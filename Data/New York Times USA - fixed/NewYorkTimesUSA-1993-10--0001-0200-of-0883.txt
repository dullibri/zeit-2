HEADLINE: Weicker Rejects Re-election Bid In Connecticut

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GREENWICH, Conn., Sept. 30

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the one-time liberal Republican who built a career out of going his own way, announced today that he would not seek re-election to a second term.
Mr. Weicker, who is 62 and has more than 15 months left in office, said he wanted more time with his family, less intrusion by the demands of campaigning, and, perhaps, a job in private industry. He avoided the word "retirement" and vowed a vigorous final year in office. 
 "If anybody looks on this individual as a lame duck on a pond," he said, "you better think twice because you're going to find something coming out of Jurassic Park at you."
 
Entering the Post-Weicker Era
 If the announcement marked a turning point for Mr. Weicker, it was no less so for Connecticut politics. For much of his 30-year career in public life, including his 18 years in the United States Senate, Mr. Weicker has been both one of Connecticut's most admired and most vilified politicians, and one of the few with any claim to a national reputation.
A bearlike man with self-confidence that borders on arrogance, he defied the odds three years ago to become the state's first third-party governor in this century.
His determination in imposing an income tax in 1991, in particular, earned him the hatred of many residents, although, like Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey, with whom he is often compared, Mr. Weicker has largely reinvented himself since then by plowing on with new initiatives, including an attempt to create regional efforts to end racial segregation in the public schools and a bid recently to attract the New England Patriots professional football team to the state. His withdrawal has also improved the fortunes of the handful of politicians who had already risen to challenge him in next year's election.
"For 30 years my neighbors -- three million plus -- have allowed me to be a part of history, and to shape history," he told a crowd of well-wishers and reporters in a speech that veered from sentimental reflection to stentorian denunciation of big-money, two-party political gridlock. "And I am still a total believer in what one man or woman can achieve when of a mind to do so."
 
He's Not Getting Any Younger
 Outweighing all of that, however, he said, was the growing realization of advancing time and age, and that his seven children -- the youngest of whom, Andrew, is 10 -- were also being forced to sacrifice for what the Governor called his own selfishness.
"We don't talk as much as we should about what went on in school, or what it is they'd like to go ahead and do, what are their dreams," he said. "The time has come to step aside and concentrate on them."
There is the question of money. Mr. Weicker, who gave up a job at a private health research foundation paying $300,000 a year to run for governor in 1990 -- a position that pays $78,000 -- used his early farewell to make an appeal for work when Hartford is behind him.
"I want the private sector to know that I'm available," he said. "I'm looking for a job. If anybody has any ideas, I'd like to hear it."
Although he comes from a family of some wealth, with ties to the Squibb pharmaceutical fortune, Mr. Weicker has said he is not wealthy.
In Hartford, Mr. Weicker's announcement shattered most expectations about next year's election. In recent months, as Mr. Weicker's popularity seemed to improve, two prominent Democrats, United States Representative Barbara B. Kennelly and Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, dropped out. Mrs. Kennelly, in particular, went out of her way to praise Mr. Weicker's achievements.
The Lieutenant Governor, Eunice S. Groark, who like Mr. Weicker quit the Republican Party to run on the Weicker ticket in 1990, said today that she was "very interested in running for governor." She said she would have a definitive statement in the next 10 days on her plans. United States Representative Nancy L. Johnson, a Republican, has also said she will announce plans soon.
One of the few people who was already in the race, State Senator John B. Larson, Democrat of East Hartford, suggested today that his strategy would be to portray himself as a bit like Mr. Weicker himself: brave enough to have jumped in even when it didn't look too safe.
"Many have waited to test the political winds," Mr. Larson said. "It was never a factor in my decision."
 
No Endorsements
 Mr. Weicker, who said he made his final decision about a week ago, declined to make any endorsements but said that in the coming campaign, he would remain true to A Connecticut Party, the party he founded, and campaign for its candidate whether that is Mrs. Groark or someone else.
One goal, he said, is to dispel the notion that politicians who aren't running again can't get anything done. He said his agenda would focus on children, specifically in protecting them from what he described as a greedy conspiracy by older generations, his own included, to milk the economic and political system and leave nothing for the future.
"Regardless if the rest of the nation wants to have their children worse off than the generation before -- and it's the first time it's ever occurred in the history of the United States -- that isn't going to happen here in our state," he said.
Louise Hull, a longtime supporter of Mr. Weicker's who drove from New Hartford in northern Litchfield County for the Governor's announcement, burst into applause at the line.
Before he entered the room, she opened her hand to show a reporter a crumpled tissue. She was fully expecting him to say he would not run, she said, and was prepared for it. "I know I'll cry," she said.
 
Praise From Politicians
 Elsewhere around the state, politicians offered only praise for a man that many had not so long ago bitterly criticized as arrogant or worse.
The State Comptroller, William E. Curry Jr., a Democrat who is considered a potential candidate for governor, conceded that he and Mr. Weicker had had their differences over the years, notably over whether the state's fiscal health was really as good as Mr. Weicker claimed after the adoption of the income tax.
"But these have been differences over management and strategy, not values," Mr. Curry said. "The Governor is a great warrior. With his departure from the arena, the rest of us will seem boring by comparison."
One long-time adviser to the Governor, Peter Gold, said he believed that even people who detested Mr. Weicker would come to dislike the quiet when the Governor went on his way.
"He was always there to inspire us, if only to anger," Mr. Gold said.

HEADLINE: G.M.'s Canada Contract Sends Shares Falling

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Shares of the General Motors Corporation slid today in heavy trading as investors reacted to news of a tentative labor contract reached Wednesday night by G.M. and the Canadian Automobile Workers.
The stock closed down $2.125 a share at $41.75. It was the most actively traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange, with 7.8 million shares changing hands. 
 Analysts said investors were not troubled by the Canadian settlement itself, but by its implications for G.M.'s negotiations here with the United Automobile Workers union.
 
 
Protests Become Harder
 The Canadian contract includes a number of provisions, including pension increases and a fund to pay laid-off workers, that are similar to those in the 1990 American agreement. G.M. hopes to moderate some of those provisions in its next American contract to cut labor costs.
But G.M.'s Canada agreement may undercut the company's credibility in protesting the pattern contract already negotiated with the Ford Motor Company and under discussion today with the Chrysler Corporation here. Wall Street reached the same conclusion.
Chrysler negotiators were still talking tonight as the strike deadline of 11:59 approached. Each side said it was close to a settlement.
Once the U.A.W. settles with Chrysler, it will move on to G.M., which is expected to put up the biggest fight because of its financial condition.
The decline in G.M.'s stock today, said Harvey Heinbach, an auto analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York, is "mostly the markets looking at the Canadian agreement and concluding from that the probability of getting significant concessions from the U.A.W. is low."
In a statement, G.M. suggested today that differences between its costs in Canada and America -- partly because Canada's national health care system lowers company health care costs there -- made the two contracts quite different.
"We have approached our negotiations in Canada and in the United States with recognition of important differences in underlying economics, as well as in the provisions of our labor agreements with the C.A.W. and the United Automobile Workers," G.M. said.
The pattern agreement written at Ford raises wages and pension benefits and increases the money set aside to pay laid-off workers. Itmaintains comprehensive health coverage fully paid by the company and it lowers wages for starting workers and lengthens the time it takes for them to reach the top of the pay scale.
 At Chrysler, the U.A.W. has been pressing for commitments to keep more parts production in-house to preserve jobs. Chrysler is the least vertically integrated of the Big Three, making about 30 percent of its parts. Chrysler was also hoping to avoid a large pension increase, because it has unfinanced pension liability estimated to exceed $2 billion.

Walkout at 5 Plants
 LAND PARK, Mich., Friday, Oct. 1 (AP) -- A deadline for a new contract between the United Automobile Workers and the Chrysler Corporation passed Thursday night with no immediate strike called, but more than 5,000 workers at five plants walked off the job early today.
Negotiators remained at the bargaining table past midnight, but there was no official announcement that the old contract for 56,000 company workers had been extended. Chrysler officials said workers at assembly plants in Detroit; Sterling Heights, Mich.; St. Louis; Belvidere, Ill., and Newark, Del., all walked off the job at midnight, a half-hour to an hour before their shifts ended.
"They told us to keep them in, but mine are gone," said Frank Massey, local U.A.W. president at the Jefferson North factory in Detroit. Other locals that were contacted said they were able to keep workers on the job.

HEADLINE: $2.5 Billion Approved for Former Soviet States

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
The Senate passed a foreign-aid bill tonight that includes $2.5 billion for Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union. The vote was 87-13. President Clinton signed the bill just hours later.
The $13 billion bill was approved by the House on Wednesday when lawmakers speeded the process to show support for President Boris N. Yeltsin in his showdown with Parliament. 
 "Recent events in Moscow highlight the urgency of helping the momentum of democratic and economic reform," the President said in a statement.
Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, chairman of the subcommittee that oversees foreign aid, said, "I hope this is seen in Russia as a very, very strong signal from the United States Congress that we are supporting moves toward democracy."
As revised by the Administration over the summer, the aid package for the former Soviet Union emphasizes efforts to develop the private sector and get United States companies involved in reshaping Russia.
The package includes $250 million in export credits for United States business ventures, $125 million for grants to help in privatization and $60 million to help transport millions of dollars' worth of privately donated food and medicine for Russia.
The bill conditions the aid to the timely withdrawal of Russian troops from Latvia and Estonia, respect for territorial integrity within the former Soviet Union and the end of Russian aid for Cuba.
The bill includes up to $300 million for Ukraine.
Total spending in the bill was $1.4 billion below the Administration's request, and down from $13.9 billion in 1993. While cutting most programs, the maintains spending of $3 billion for Israel and $2.1 billion for Egypt, the two biggest recipients since the 1979 Camp David peace agreement.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
U.S. to Defer Russian Payments
 WASHINGTON, Sept. 30 (AP) -- The United States and Russia signed a formal agreement today to defer $1.1 billion in Russian debt payments. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen hailed the action as "another element in the international effort to assist Russia."
The deferral is for America's share of $17 billion in debt payments that the United States and other Western countries agreed last April to delay.
 That total represented the largest single element of a $43 billion aid package put together for President Yeltsin by the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy.
Russia has a total estimated foreign debt of $80 billion, with $4 billion of that owed to the United States.

HEADLINE: Murdoch Gets The Post Out Despite Strike

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON

 BODY:
Three days after a strike stopped its presses, Rupert Murdoch's New York Post roared back to life last night, with a new issue of the paper on New York streets and a new victory against newspaper unions on Mr. Murdoch's resume.
With the cooperation of the leaders of The Post's production unions, whose members had spontaneously supported the striking employees of the New York Newspaper Guild on Monday, Mr. Murdoch managed to isolate the striking union and demonstrate his dominance over the others. Through the day, the production union leaders walked many of their members through the picket lines as the strikers yelled picket-line epithets like "scab" and "traitor." 
 Choosing the security of jobs with Mr. Murdoch, who cultivates a reputation for toughness with unions, in place of their brief alliance with the single striking newspaper union, some of the production workers said the realities of a shrinking industry in a weak economy left them no choice.
They could not, they said, afford to side with the striking news, advertising and circulation employees because it could cost them their jobs.
 
The Turning Point
 The strikers at times appeared stunned by what they said was a betrayal by fellow unionists. Some of the guild members seemed uncertain what course their union could take as Mr. Murdoch consolidates his hold on the paper. Late last night, after it was clear that Mr. Murdoch would be able to publish this morning's issue, the president of the guild local at The Post, Harry Leykis, was asked what the guild would do now. "We stay out here," Mr. Leykis said.
The turning point in Mr. Murdoch's effort to isolate the guild from the other unions came about three minutes before 8 P.M. Following a plan set by Mr. Murdoch's aides and the production union chiefs, about 100 newspaper truck drivers, pressmen and mailers massed on Catherine Slip, on the south side of the newspaper's headquarters building. Police officers kept the strikers around the corner, near the newspaper's main entrance on South Street, where the other workers had entered during the day. At once, three loading dock doors on Catherine Slip opened and the production workers, some cheering and whistling, slipped into the building in a boisterous group, without having to face their striking co-workers.
Barry F. Lipton, the guild's citywide president, was arrested on a charge of disorderly conduct as he and other union members pressed to get closer to the loading docks last night. He was quickly released and returned to the angry picket line, where he predicted Mr. Murdoch would have a difficult time producing the newspaper without unionized reporters and editors.
 
'A Hollow Post'
 "They're not going to be able to get out a meaningful Post," Mr. Lipton said. "It will be a hollow Post. It will say Post on the outside, but it will be empty on the inside."
With the craft union members at their places, The Post's production schedule appeared to run smoothly. The first trucks, loaded with Friday's Post, began pulling out of South Street before 10 P.M. Across the bottom of the 96-page edition, it said: "Death-defying Post is back."
"This is, we hope, the preservation of The Post," said Patrick J. Purcell, The Post's publisher.
He said nonunion writers and editors prepared this morning's paper.
Through the day, the bitterness outside the building was palpable as George McDonald, the president of the Allied Printing Trades Council, the umbrella group of newspaper production unions, led workers into the building, with other union chiefs at his shoulder.
The situation was especially bruising, some of the striking guild members said, because they could remember a time not long ago when that umbrella included the guild itself. That alliance finally broke in a different labor dispute, at a different newspaper, The Daily News, last year and now, they said, the guild's ability to survive its isolation is to be tested.
Some of the line-crossing production-union members appeared embarrassed. Some looked ashen. "We're not scabs," said Gerard Bilbao, a union superintendent of newspaper drivers. The guild, he said, had to rely on itself for defense. "Their problems are their problems. We have to look out for our families."
 
A Powerful Weapon
 In bankruptcy court yesterday morning, Mr. Murdoch's lawyers said the new cooperation of the production unions meant he was prepared to complete his purchase of the newspaper as soon as Monday. But he retained a powerful weapon for use against reluctant union workers: he retained the option to walk away from the newspaper at any time before his purchase is complete if there are any new sympathy job action.
People in and out of the newspaper industry said the latest turn in Mr. Murdoch's confrontation with New York unions was reminiscent of his fierce and successful fight with London newspaper unions in 1986, when he opened a new plant -- and stripped the unions of their power -- in the London dockyards area of Wapping.
That confrontation helped create Mr. Murdoch's worldwide reputation for toughness with unions. Yesterday, some labor experts said Mr. Murdoch's stubborn insistence on union abdication at a newspaper with only 700 employees indicated that he was playing as much to his worldwide audience as to the comparatively small group concerned about the fate of The Post or the striking Newspaper Guild.
"It is an emblematic struggle," said Daniel J. Walkowitz, a labor historian and director of the metropolitan studies program at New York University. "It is as indicative as anything of what is happening in the changing American workplace."
For the guild, its members on the picket line said yesterday, Mr. Murdoch's demand that he should be permitted what the guild members call a four-month "free-fire zone" during which he could dismiss employees with impunity -- and without severance -- was so unacceptable that there was little choice.
To Mr. Murdoch's associates, it also appeared there was no choice. Without Mr. Murdoch and his willingness to lose several million dollars a year, there would be no newspaper, they asserted. Mr. Purcell, the publisher and a longtime Murdoch executive, last night dismissed the guild's assertion that it was fighting for job security. "Their job security," he said, "is Rupert Murdoch."
For the other unions, the battle left them with impossible choices. To side with the guild, rank-and-file members and leaders said, appeared to be suicide. To side against the guild, in addition to the painful symbolism of appearing to violate trade union fundamentals, would signal Mr. Murdoch that his dominance over all of the unions was virtually complete.
 
A Halfway Stance
 What turned out to be a halfway stance, with rank and file spontaneous support for the strike on Monday, followed by the leaders' organized effort to get members back to work, indicated how difficult the dilemma was for the unionized production workers.
Mr. McDonald, the trades council president, last night reacted with fury to assertions by Mr. Lipton, the president of the New York guild, and angry strikers yesterday that he had breached basic labor rules by working to get the production workers to satisfy Mr. Murdoch's demands.
Mr. McDonald contended that the guild leaders were behaving irresponsibly and were out of touch with modern realities in the newspaper industry. "They're acting like Never, Never Land -- way back," he said in an interview. "They're not in 1993. All I can say is we're going to save the paper for the people who work there."
As the guild strike continues, its members are likely to come under far more pressure than is usual in labor confrontations, even apart from the issue of support, or the lack of it, from other unions.
Because The Post is in bankruptcy and Mr. Murdoch is a new owner of its assets, he is under no legal obligation to recognize prior guild contracts. After he completes the formal purchase of The Post, Post executives are expected to take the view that Mortimer B. Zuckerman took last winter as the new owner of The Daily News: that all current guild employees could be viewed as applicants for the jobs they formerly held.

HEADLINE: Cuban Officials Don't Foresee a Thaw With the U.S. Anytime Soon

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Despite recent agreements with Washington on immigration and narcotics matters, senior Cuban officials say they do not foresee any imminent advance in relations with the United States, which have been marked by open hostility for 34 years.
Instead, the Cuban officials say, they hope that by cooperating in areas of mutual interest, the Clinton Administration will eventually strike a more positive attitude toward Cuba as it gains a stronger political foothold for itself. 
 In an interview in New York, where he was attending the United Nations General Assembly, Cuba's new Foreign Minister, Roberto Robaina, struck a friendly but cautious tone toward Washington, taking pains, as other senior Cuban officials have recently done, to lower expectations of a breakthrough.
"After so many years of tension you don't resolve the problems from one day to the next," said Mr. Robaina, a 37-year-old who until recently headed Cuba's Communist Youth League. A dramatic change in relations, he added, "is not on the next street corner."
 
A Basis of Equality
 "But I want it to be made clear that we are not the closed-minded people that some would like to make us out to be," Mr. Robaina said. "We want to hear other opinions, but we also want our opinions to be heard. If we move forward on a basis of equality, we can arrive at almost anything."
Mr. Robaina's comments, made on Tuesday, came on the same day as an announcement of an agreement between Washington and Havana to allow the gradual repatriation of 1,500 Cuban-born prisoners who are being held in American jails for crimes committed in the United States since the Mariel boatlift that brought 125,000 Cubans to this country in 1980.
Further speculation of a thaw in relations had been aroused when the United States accepted the extradition by Cuba this month of two suspected American cocaine traffickers. The suspects had been arrested by Cuban officers in Cuban waters after a fruitless sea chase by American drug enforcement agents. Under the Bush Administration, cooperation with Cuba in narotics cases was severely limited.
Conservative Cuban-American groups and their allies in Congress have reacted with growing alarm to the two recent gestures of cooperation, the first significant collaboration between Havana and Washington since the Carter Administration.
Mr. Robaina said that as long as the Clinton Administration showed "respect for our sovereignty," the Government of President Fidel Castro would continue to work on improving limited cooperation in areas like immigration, narcotics control and telecommunications. He also said that the Cuban Government was studying ways of expanding "cultural, scientific, sports and journalistic" exchanges.
 
A Three-Pronged Strategy
 Increasing cooperation in areas like these appears to be one part of a three-pronged strategy by the Cuban Government toward achieving eventual warmer ties with the United States. The other parts are increasing visits by Cuban-Americans to the island and rapidly opening up Cuba's economy to private investment from abroad and more free enterprise at home.
By removing most restrictions on visits by Cuban-American exiles, senior Cuban officials have made no secret of their hope of winning the sympathies of parts of the exile community that are moved by nationalist sentiments or simply by the desire to help relatives back home. The emergence of more currents like this, they say, could eventually soften political opposition in the United States to a diplomatic relaxation.
"This community is Cuban," Mr. Robaina said of the Cuban-American exiles. "No one can be more interested in these people than us. What have we told ourselves as we have made contacts with many segments of this community is that even if they dislike the program which we have carried out, they stand up for many of the same things which we defend."
By opening up the Cuban economy, meanwhile, the Government feels that it is doing more than simply averting a disaster by stopping the free fall of a failed system of rigid central planning. At the same time, it hopes that the arrival of increasingly large investments from Spain, Canada, France and elsewhere will prompt American businesses to lobby for renewed access to a natural market of 11 million people that lies only 90 miles from Florida.
Cuban officials are acutely aware that however bold their attempts to privatize the economy, foreign investment will be hindered by isolation from American markets for everything from tourists to agriculture and merchandise.
 
Americans 'Penalized'
 "We are opening our economy and many companies are in, but the Americans themselves are being penalized" Ricardo Alarcon, a Communist Party Politburo member who also heads Cuba's National Assembly, said in a recent interview in Havana. "What I am sure of is that these steps and new steps yet to come will have a positive impact on Latin America and the Europeans.
"What will happen in the U.S.? We would expect it would motivate people in the business community, but we'll have to wait and see."

HEADLINE: U.S. Blockade of Workers Enrages Mexican Town

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico, Sept. 29

 BODY:
For years, as thousands of undocumented workers floated openly across the Rio Grande each day from this sprawling border metropolis to jobs in El Paso, Tex., illegal immigration became a symbol of tolerance, even brotherhood, between the two cities.
That immigration agents stopped relatively few of the nannies and gardeners and busboys was taken as a sign that Ciudad Juarez and El Paso understood each other's needs. Federal law, it seemed, was no match for the forces of economic interdependence. 
 Then, on Sept. 19, the United States Border Patrol began what it calls Operation Blockade. By deploying hundreds of agents along a 20-mile stretch of the international boundary, the Patrol has all but stopped a human traffic that it estimated at more than 10,000 people a day.
 
A Wave of Outrage
 While some impetus for the operation may have come from Washington, where the Clinton Administration has promised a tougher stand on illegal immigration, it has been received with clamorous applause in the tract homes and shopping malls that sit beneath El Paso's grey-brown hills.
"People here seem to think that all of their problems -- welfare, health care, crime, you name it -- have been solved," said Cheryl A. Howard, a sociologist at the University of Texas El Paso.
Across the border, however, the blockade and the stepped-up immigration checks that have accompanied it have brought a wave of outrage. Protesters have blocked the traffic on international bridges. Angry politicians and business executives are calling for a boycott of El Paso stores.
And in a cross-border community that is often cited as a model for the cooperation that is supposed to flower if the United States Congress approves a North American Free Trade Agreement, the conflict has shattered old assumptions about how well the two cities know each other and how well they get along.
"We were very much brothers," said Isabel Delgado, a jewelry store clerk who was born in southern Chihuahua State, raised in Ciudad Juarez and has lived in El Paso for the last 15 years. "But with this, we are going our own ways."
 
Job Losses Feared
 The border crackdown has affected two kinds of migrants. Border Patrol statistics on apprehensions suggest that it has nearly halted the flow of illegal undocumented workers who have usually waded, walked or floated on rafts across the border.
Second, there have been stricter checks to root out Mexicans who walk or drive across the international bridges here with temporary permits but who then work without permission. Many of those Mexican border residents have stayed home, some out of fear and some complaining of harassment.
On the United States side of the border, many people say approval for the blockade has underscored how the trade agreement has heightened fears of job losses even in American communities where integration with Mexico is a familiar reality.
On the Mexican side, the response may have less to do with present circumstances than with sensitivities over what has been seen as arrogant and unfair treatment from the United States in the past.
 
From Confusion to Anger
 More broadly, Mexicans say that their confusion at what they perceive as mixed American signals -- the invitation to join in a long-term economic partnership on one hand, a wave of anti-immigrant feelings on the other -- has begun turning to anger.
"Everyone recognizes that they are entirely in their rights to take measures to stop immigration," said Jose Luis Soto, a 21-year-old college student in Ciudad Juarez. "But right now? Just when we are about to get into a free-trade agreement with them? This is a humiliation."
Mexican and American officials both contend that passage of the trade agreement will ultimately help to raise wages in Mexico and reduce illegal immigration. The assertion has become central to their arguments for the pact.
At the same time, the Mexican Government has grown unusually open in its resentment at what it considers the scapegoating of hard-working Mexicans who sneak into the United States to find better lives.
Until Sept. 19, officers in the Border Patrol's El Paso sector had largely concentrated their energies on arresting undocumented immigrants after they crossed into Texas and New Mexico. On average, 800 to 1,000 were apprehended each day, but most of those who work in the kitchens and gardens and farms of the area were left alone.
 
Behind the Blockade
 In an interview, the sector's chief Patrol agent, Silvestre Reyes, gave several reasons for the blockade. After a rash of accusations of abuses against immigrants and others by El Paso agents, he said, he wanted to find a way to rebuild the Patrol's community support.
He said illegal immigrants had been responsible for crimes ranging from car thefts to transvestite prostitution, that members of a Mexican gang were "terrorizing" one South El Paso neighborhood, and that immigrant beggars and freelance window-washers had become a terrible nuisance.
Mr. Reyes, a 48-year-old native of the El Paso area whose paternal grandfather immigrated from Mexico, took up his post on July 4 after nine years in the Patrol's office in McAllen, Tex. He said he was "appalled" at what he saw.
"People seemed to think that that was all right, that that was the way it has always been, that that was the way it was always going to be, and that you had to live with it," he said. "I just don't agree with that."
 
Approved by Superior
 Beyond the local considerations, Mr. Reyes said the acting director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Border Patrol's parent agency, had authorized the operation and the $250,000 that it cost in overtime for the 400 to 450 officers involved during the first two weeks.
Mr. Reyes said he now planned to continue the operation indefinitely without a budget increase.
How widely residents of El Paso approve of the measure is not clear, but a majority of the telephone calls into the city's newspapers and television stations favor the boycott. Many of the complaints have come from people who have been unable to replace their undocumented domestic help.
In interviews, many people in El Paso complained, as many did in Mexico, that the undocumented migrants were largely honest, hard-working people coming to do low-paying jobs that American citizens did not want. More of those interviewed, however, expressed support.
"I don't want them over here," said Isabel Rodriguez, a 22-year-old woman who was selling baseball caps and "El Paso-Ciudad Juarez" T-shirts from a stand at the Cielo Vista Mall in El Paso, referring to the undocumented immigrants. "I know they're human like me, but I don't go trying to wash people's windows when they don't want me to."
In the huddles of would-be immigrants who gather now in the mornings and just stare across the Rio Grande levee, there were few printable words for the likes of Miss Rodriguez.
 
No Decline in Crime
 "The Mexicans over there are the worst," said a 45-year-old immigrant smuggler, or coyote, who is called the Cowboy. As the Cowboy turned back to his dogeared comic book (also called "The Cowboy"), Manuel Macias, 42, stepped in to defend the people he said he had been floating across the river for 15 years.
"These people aren't afraid to work," he said. "They are afraid of what they will earn here."
Despite the association made by Mr. Reyes and others between undocumented immigrants and illegal activities, statistics provided by a spokesman for the El Paso Police Department, Sgt. Bill Pfeil, showed that crime had not declined significantly since the blockade began.
Yet according to a half-dozen merchants in South El Paso, their sales fell sharply even before the Juarez Chamber of Commerce, its association of small industries and political groups, including the country's governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, began calling on Monday for a boycott.
Henry P. King, the director of a University of Texas institute that studies small business, said Mexicans were estimated to spend about 30 percent of the $6.5 billion in retail sales in El Paso each year.
 
No Takers for a Bet
 Indeed, at the weekly poker game presided over by the Mayor of Ciudad Juarez, Francisco Villareal, a table full of prominent citizens spoke of their ire at the symbolism of the blockade, of their dismay at what they saw as shallow solidarity from El Paso, of wives who insisted they not buy their car tires in Texas.
Mr. Villareal, who has criticized the blockade but worked to calm his town's fury, counted up the $161 he had lost and laid down a last, hopeful bet.
Double or nothing, he offered, that the blockade would not last a month.
There were no takers.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN;
Insurers Fear They'd Be the Big Losers in a World of Managed Health Care

SERIES: The Clinton Prescription: The Impact on Insurers -- Last of six articles

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

 BODY:
Since the President gave his health care speech last week, employees have lived with fluttery stomachs in the offices of the Bartmon Shapiro insurance agency, a thriving business high above Central Park South whose windows offer panoramic views of the park and the midtown Manhattan skyline. Under President Clinton's health care plan, the profession of health insurance agent could virtually cease to exist.
"People are very, very nervous," said Joel Shapiro, whose 17-year-old company employs 10 people. "But we are going to have to adapt. We are going to have to change." 
 Such agencies are not the only ones in the $300 billion health insurance industry that face the future with trepidation. With or without the proposed Clinton changes, hundreds of health insurers are expected to leave the business in the coming years, but the President's plan would greatly accelerate the pace.
Even the survivors, which are expected to include several of the country's largest insurers, like Prudential and Aetna, may have to fire or retrain armies of claims processors, cutting payrolls as they try to become efficient, lower-cost companies that oversee networks of doctors, nurses and hospitals.
What remains unclear is whether the survivors in the nation's health insurance industry -- an industry much distrusted by the public and often attacked in recent months by Hillary Rodham Clinton -- would eventually flourish or wither under the White House plan. It is also uncertain whether the survivors would in the end serve consumers better, as the White House insists they would.
The Administration's proposal would increase the revenue of the insurance industry by tens of billions of dollars. It would have all employers contribute and the Government subsidize the private insurance premiums of the 37 million who are now uninsured. It would also shift most poor people on Medicaid into the private insurance market. But whether those revenues would translate into profits after all the claims are paid is a matter of debate.
Under the Clinton plan, many functions of today's insurers, like setting benefit packages and negotiating with employers, would be taken over by new, state-run health alliances. The plan would force companies to compete more aggressively on the basis of price and would place limits on the premiums health insurers can charge. Those limits, insurance industry executives and a number of economists say, could squeeze profits so much that it would destroy incentives for investment and innovation.
 
Some Insurers Expected to Do Well
 "Those insurance companies that can realize real efficiencies and economies of scale may be able to do very well under the Clinton plan," said Beth Morrow, an analyst for Standard & Poor's. "But will they become more responsive to what consumers want? I don't know. What I do think is they will try to save money by squeezing health care providers to reduce costs."
The Administration says the proposed new health care system would give consumers more power in several ways.
For one, the proposed regional health alliances would serve as broker, in effect, for hundreds of thousands of consumers. Once a year, consumers would receive a menu of health plans from which to select. They would also receive a report card on each of the plans that would rate them on, among other things, consumer satisfaction and medical performance.
In addition, the Administration's proposal would permit customers more easily to compare health plans on the basis of cost. That would force insurers, health maintenance organizations and other operators of health care networks to compete for market share on the basis of both quality and price. If an insurer's services are inadequate or too expensive, the Administration says, customers once every year can vote with their feet and change plans.
In the process, the alliances would make many health insurance brokers and agents obsolete and would permit many private companies to shut down their medical benefit departments. The savings, the Administration says, would be in the billions.
Consumers would be allowed to choose traditional fee-for-service health plans, in which patients can choose their doctors and the doctors are paid for each service they provide. But financial incentives may push many consumers toward less-expensive H.M.O.'s or other types of managed care plans. Since most insurance companies today, especially the smaller ones, offer mainly fee-for-service insurance, industry analysts say most of the nation's more than 500 health insurers would be driven from the field.
The President's plan would simply be speeding up a process that is already under way: the switch of customers into H.M.O's and other forms of managed care. Last year, 41 million Americans had already enrolled in H.M.O.'s, up from 19 million in 1985. Forty-two percent of all H.M.O.'s are now owned by insurance companies or Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, while some others are run by independent companies or nonprofit organizations.
Expected to benefit most under the President's plan are those insurance companies that have already invested large sums in building up H.M.O.'s and other managed-care networks around the country. The most prominent are the Cigna Corporation, the Prudential Insurance Company of America, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, the Travelers Corporation, Aetna Life & Casualty and more than 60 Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans.
But doubters inside and outside the insurance industry say the Clinton plan, as proposed, will not necessarily result in a more efficient and consumer-friendly health insurance industry.
Dr. David U. Himmelstein, an associate professor at the Harvard Medical School and an advocate of Canadian-style government-run health care system, said he was concerned that an increasing amount of health care money would fall into the hands of an ever smaller and more powerful group of insurers.
In many regional markets, he said, a small number of large companies would dominate the market, making the entry of smaller new health groups difficult.
"What I think you would end up with is a couple of large firms controlling the health care delivered to the American people," Dr. Himmelstein said "Oligopolies don't compete in this country. They don't lower prices."
Executives of the nation's largest insurance companies as well as a number of economists dispute Dr. Himmelstein's predictions. They say the greatest danger is not that the insurers will be too powerful but that the health alliances will.
 
Local Competition Expected to Thrive
 Many insurance executives say that within each region and alliance large numbers of local H.M.O.'s and other health networks would survive as competitors. Even the largest national insurers may not have the capital or market clout to wipe out such competition.
"It will mean separate competition in many, many local markets, instead of one large market," said Paul Cooper, vice president for health care policy for Prudential. "The winners in Houston will be different from the winners in Denver. It is going to become a very decentralized industry."
But insurance companies note that the alliances, under Federal supervision, would set caps on the premiums that insurers could charge. Those caps might squeeze profits so much, industry officials assert, that it might be difficult for private insurers to raise capital to invest in new and innovative ways of delivering care. The White House expects that competition among health plans will itself hold down costs, but in case that tactic fails, it proposes limiting average premium increases to about the overall inflation rate.
"If we are going to have real reduction in medical inflation, it is going to take a lot of ingenuity and risk-taking and new ideas," said Thomas O. Pyle, chief executive of Metropolitan Life's health care operations. "Those are not going to be called forth by a cap on costs, which will make everyone very cautious and risk-averse."
Amid the theoretical debate, executives and workers in the health insurance field have begun to think in practical terms about what the Clinton plan could mean for them.
In Marietta, Ohio, a city of about 20,000 that looks across the Ohio River to West Virginia, Mark B. Schewendeman is contemplating the future of the Schwendeman Sigafoos Agency, an insurance agency his grandfather founded in 1928. His company sells health plans to small employers, mainly on behalf of regional insurers that know the small towns and farm country of rural, southeastern Ohio well.
Under the Clinton plan, his customers would buy health insurance from an alliance, and the health insurers he deals with would be likely to leave the business.
Mr. Schewendeman has been reassuring his staff of 19 that the Clinton plan is bound to be transformed by Congress. But if the final legislation leaves little room for insurance agents, he says, he would turn his company into a consulting service, offering to help individuals and companies make their way through the new health care system. If that occurs, he acknowledges, his company's revenues would probably be reduced and some of his employees would have to be laid off.
Joel Shapiro, whose insurance agents in New York bring in more than $1 million a year in revenues from health and life sales, has told his workers that his business will survive, selling life insurance and perhaps offering health-insurance consulting services. There would still be a demand, too, for private supplemental policies for elderly people on Medicare, for example.
But, Mr. Shapiro said, he believes 45 percent of his revenue would disappear, and he would have to reduce his staff by four or five.
"I really dread this," Mr. Shapiro said. "The employers we work with and my friends in the business are very upset. I feel badly for my people."
 
Profitable Niches Are Being Sought
 Insurance companies, in turn, are exploring what new niches they may occupy as Federal legislation goes into effect. Some companies that offer fee-for-service policies foresee a lasting need for them, particularly in rural areas.
But the largest companies that have invested heavily in managed care networks say they hope to move swiftly to reduce the large and costly departments that process complex claims forms. The insurers say computers will permit doctors to transmit information on patients to them directly by computer without ever touching paper.
A top executive at one of the nation's largest health insurance companies, who asked not to be identified, said his company's goal was to reduce its work force in both claims and sales by half, and to replace highly trained sales people with less expensive young college graduates.

HEADLINE: Theory vs. Practice;
Clinton's Stated Foreign Policy Turns Into More Modest 'Self-Containment'

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
The contrast between the theory and practice of the Clinton Administration's foreign policy has never been more starkly apparent than in recent days.
In a series of four speeches this month, Secretary of State Warren Christopher; the national security adviser, Anthony Lake; the delegate to the United Nations, Madeleine K. Albright, and President Clinton himself laid out their "vision" of America's post-cold-war foreign policy. At its core was the idea that the old policies of containment of Communism should be replaced by a new policy of enlargement of the family of free-market democracies. 
 But from the actual behavior of the Administration, a very different picture emerges. In reality, this Administration wants to go from a policy of "enlargement" of American intervention abroad, as existed during the cold war when almost every regional conflict attracted the United States, to a new kind of "containment," in which the United States gets involved only in crises that are containable, manageable, cheap and closed-ended, except in the case of mortal threats to American security.
The real Clinton foreign policy is self-containment.
 
'Disjunction' Is Seen
 There is "a clear disjunction" between their policy and their vision, said Robert W. Tucker, professor emeritus of American foreign policy at Johns Hopkins University. "Their vision is the vision of preceding administrations: We have a certain position of predominance and leadership in the world. No administration wants to relinquish that, and so all of them assert their intention to remain engaged in spreading democracy."
But the Clinton team's emphasis is on domestic, not foreign policy. "Their dilemma is how to maintain the traditional position of leadership, yet keep their commitments as minimal as possible to concentrate at home," Mr. Tucker said.
Indeed, that very tension was laced throughout the President's speech before the United Nations, which seemed to be addressed to two audiences at once. To the small sector of foreign policy professors and foreign dignitaries, the speech offered reassurance that America would be true to its leadership heritage. Hence Mr. Clinton's declaration: "Many people ask whether the United States plans to retreat or remain active in the world. Let me answer that question as clearly and plainly as I can. The United States plans to remain engaged and to lead."
But to the American public and Congress the speech was less about activism and more about limits on future American peacekeeping abroad. The President put it bluntly. "If the American people are to say yes to U.N. peacekeeping," he said, "the United Nations must know when to say no."
 
Ambivalence Seen
 The tension in Mr. Clinton's speech only reflected the ambivalence in the public and Congressional moods, which can be summarized as a willingness to pay only some prices, fight only some foes, and to bear only some burdens in the defense of freedom, in a time when fears of nuclear war with Moscow have receded. It took only a handful of casualties in Somalia to prompt the House and Senate to pass a nonbinding resolution calling on Mr. Clinton to seek Congressional approval by Nov. 15 for keeping American troops in Somalia.
The President's natural response in trying to manage this tension is to tell the world that the United States will continue to play its leadership role, while assuring the Congress that he will not send troops to Somalia or any to Bosnia unless a long list of conditions are met, including a clearly stated time when the policy would be reviewed and a clearly stated "right to terminate" if things go badly. The problem is that such precision and predictability in foreign policy in general and peacekeeping missions in particular are impossible.
As former Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger put it: "If you have a clear exit point in a place like Bosnia, it is like telling all the parties in advance that when our people get killed, we will leave. And that is exactly what the opponents of our presence would like. Instead of reducing the danger to our forces, it invites attack."
An exit point in Bosnia is also impossible to define, Mr. Eagleburger said, because the peacekeeping role there means separating the warring factions, and the minute the United States leaves "they will be back at each other's throats."
 
'Worst Message to World'
 If the United States does not want to go into Bosnia, then it should say so and explain it, Mr. Eagleburger said. "But we should not set up a list of unrealistic conditions based on the experience in Somalia," he added. "That is a mistake, and it will send the worst message of all to the rest of the world."
The situation in Russia today is another example where the policy of enlargement does not fit the actual choices being faced by the Administration. President Boris N. Yeltsin may be at the beginning of a long process in which he will have to use undemocratic methods to transform Russia into a free-market democracy. The real choices for American policy toward Russia, and toward many of the former Soviet republics, are not between enlargement and containment, but between turning a blind eye to some of the methods being used to make the transition to some form of democracy -- and to keep the cash aid flowing while they do -- or to back away from them when those methods get ugly.
"At some point you have to stop, take a deep breath and say that in an imperfect world among imperfect choices, which one is the least atrocious and promises some sense over time that you will be able to accomplish some of your long-term wholesome objectives," Mr. Eagleburger said. "That is the choice now with Russia."
 
Not Performing Badly
 If the Clinton foreign policy is judged not in relation to its speeches, but on the basis of what it really is -- a minimalist foreign policy in an age when the American public and President are much more concerned about health care than warheads -- it actually has not performed badly at all. Many experts argue that its case-by-case priorities have been exactly right: supporting Russian reform and standing by Mr. Yeltsin; backing the North American Free Trade Agreement; recasting trade relations with Japan, and helping Israelis and Palestinians harvest the fruits of their own breakthrough, by organizing economic assistance.
Where the Clinton team has gotten into trouble is where it has tried to play the traditional American leadership role, in places like Bosnia and Somalia, without the real will or wallet to do what would be required for success.
"There is no such thing as humanitarian intervention," said Michael Mandelbaum, international relations professor at Johns Hopkins. "You can't intervene just to relieve suffering because suffering has political causes. Our real choices in Somalia or Bosnia are to stay out and let nature take its course or stay there and try to help create some reasonable order, with all the pain and costs that might entail."
In other words, there is no minimalist foreign policy for regions which have only maximalist options.

HEADLINE: Dow Drops 11.18 Points to Close at 3,555.12

BYLINE: By JEANNE B. PINDER

 BODY:
The stock market turned in a mixed session yesterday, after suffering a little when a series of relatively good economic reports caused bonds to slide and bond-market performance affected stocks.
Technology stocks continued a retreat begun this week after a strong run-up, but beyond that there were few clear indications of what investors think about the economy or about the markets. 
 Peter J. Canelo, chief investment strategist at NatWest Securities, said "the ghouls on the bond market" were apparently not pleased about the economic news. First, he noted, the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago turned in a monthly report on economic activity that showed improvement to a point "considerably better than expected."
Then, first-time jobless claims dropped from last week, also better than many had expected and suggesting that "maybe the economy's O.K.," Mr. Canelo said.
Finally, personal income rebounded strongly in August, and personal consumption spending was also up. The bond market slid, and stocks responded with their own decline, he said, then finished mixed.
 
 
Transportation Index Falls
 The Dow Jones industrials closed at 3,555.12, off 11.18 points, while the Dow Jones transportations finished off a substantial 9.40 points at 1,628.13, still apparently suffering from Wednesday's announcement that OPEC ministers had agreed on a production ceiling at a meeting in Geneva -- news that is bad for fuel users. The Standard & Poor's 500 index closed down 1.18 points, to 458.93; volume on the Big Board was 294.4 million shares, up from 277.8 million on Wednesday.
The American Stock Exchange composite index closed up 2.74 points at 460.39 and the Nasdaq composite index was down 0.39 point to close at 762.78 on the technology slide.
Yesterday's market responses to economic news did not necessarily herald deep problems, Mr. Canelo said.
"My guess is that there's less to this day than meets the eye," he said, noting that there were few big moves outside of the technology sector. "I think we're heading toward some very positive news for the economy over the next two weeks."
 
 
Technology Stocks Lose
 Among technology stocks, the substantial losers included Intel, down 2 1/2 a share, to 70 3/4; Texas Instruments,which fell 1 1/8, to 75 1/2; Advanced Micro Devices, which slid 1 3/4, to 26 3/8, and Applied Materials, off 1 3/8, to 71 1/2. Also, Oracle Systems, lost 1 1/2 a share, to 61 3/8, and Cisco Systems, dropped 1 1/2, to 50.
Oil stocks were mixed after the OPEC announcement Wednesday caused them to skyrocket. Exxon closed yesterday at 65 1/2 a share, down 1 1/8, while Chevron was up 3/4, to 97 3/4, and Lousiana Land and Exploration jumped 1 5/8, to 44 5/8.
USAir Group said that it expected a third-quarter loss and that it planned to cut 2,500 full-time jobs. The stock closed unchanged at 12 5/8.
Stock in UAL, the parent of United Airlines, fell 3 3/4 a share, to 137 1/4, after flight attendants pulled out of a union attempt to buy the carrier.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Hard Lessons on Competitive Bids

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
If the recent scandals in the municipal market force more states and local governments to rely increasingly on competitive bidding in the sales of their tax-exempt bonds, it appears that Merrill Lynch & Company may already have an edge on its Wall Street competitors.
This advantage is evident in the rankings of underwriters for the first three quarters of the year. Merrill's lead in its competitive bidding victories was enough to beat Goldman, Sachs & Company to the top slot, although Goldman was No. 1 in negotiated bids. 
 But the fate of the $800 million California bond issue this week, in which Merrill edged out Goldman in a competitive bid, also suggests that being No. 1 has its costs.
 
Won at a Price
 The California deal, which would have put Goldman on top if it had outbid Merrill, was won at a yield that some portfolio managers said was surprisingly low. Since then, the price of the issue has dropped and the yield has jumped because prices in the Treasury market also fell. In addition, the California offering also fell because of the unexpected announcement yesterday that the state would sell another $248.9 million of bonds on Oct. 14 and, some traders said, because the original Merrill bid was too aggressive with a yield that was too low.
And as a result, Merrill was adjusting the prices down and yields up yesterday on almost $200 million of bonds that were still unsold, leaving about $185 million in the account.
Through the first three quarters of the year, Merrill had $25.795 billion in competitive and negotiated deals when credit for each issue is given to the lead or book manager, according to the Securities Data Company. Goldman's total was $24.956 billion. If Goldman had won California, it would have had $25.756 billion in deals to Merrill's $24.995 billion.
Following these two in the top five are Lehman Brothers, $16.044; CS First Boston, $15.562, and Smith Barney Shearson, $14.785.
The pressure for local governments to shift to competitive bidding, in which the underwriter with the lowest interest rate wins the issue, has been generated by revelations of possible kickbacks, fee splitting and influence peddling on big negotiated deals, in which underwriters are chosen by the local government for a specific municipal bond issue.
In New Jersey, questions about a New Jersey Turnpike bond issue lead to the resignation of a top aide to Gov. Jim Florio and an order by the governor to make state bond issues competitively bid. Merrill Lynch is being investigated for its role in the deal.
The percentage of competitive bids have averaged only 20 percent of the total in 1991, 1992 and the first three quarters of this year. And the percentage has been declining, from 23.9 percent in 1991 to 18.6 percent for the first nine months of this year. In the third quarter, the percentage of competitive bids was down to 18.3 percent.
But the costs of being first in the rankings is something Merrill might be thinking about after the California bid. While a rally in the market could turn the numbers upside down and make Merrill's original aggressive bid look good, as of yesterday it had not.
The 30-year bonds that were priced to yield 5.24 percent at the sale on Tuesday were trading at around 5.35 percent yesterday in the secondary market, according to several traders. Bonds with maturities of 16 years and less that had not yet been sold were being offered at yields 20 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, over their original yields. This means a sharp drop in prices, which move in the opposite direction.
"They came too high," said a member of the syndicate that Merrill Lynch led. In market jargon, "high" means the bid, made in interest rates, was too low.
This member of the syndicate suggested that winning has become too important for some of the big firms. "They are so intent on winning that they bid it too aggressively," he said, speaking on the condition that he not be named. "It looks like the account," he added, referring to all the firms in the syndicate, "is going to lose a lot of money unless the market turns around."
 
Treasury Market
 The Treasury market went through another volatile day of trading yesterday, as it got a dose of economic data that was a little more optimistic than some investors liked.
Since one of the foundations of the recent rally has been sluggish economic growth that can neutralize any inflation worries, signs of even a modest pickup can be disturbing when interest rates are already so low.
The price of the 30-year bond, which was down as much as 26/32 , ended in late trading at 5 P.M. down 12/32 as the yield rose to 6.02 percent, from 5.99 percent on Wednesday. Prices of Treasury notes also fell.
Among the four key pieces of economic data on the day, three were stronger than expected, while one, new-home sales, dropped a surprising 3.1 percent in August. The stronger reports included a drop in initial jobless claims last week, a rise in personal income in August and a jump in the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago index of manufacturing.

HEADLINE: Martin Marietta to Eliminate 11,000 Jobs

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
The Martin Marietta Corporation, which last year bought the General Electric Company's aerospace electronics division, said yesterday that it would close 12 production sites and eliminate 11,000 jobs nationwide this year to consolidate the two businesses.
The move, which had been expected for months, is the latest sign that the pain and layoffs of a shrinking weapons industry are far from finished. The announcement came the same day large layoffs were announced in the airline and hazardous-waste disposal industries. [Page D3.] 
 Military contractors, faced with deep cuts in the Pentagon's budget, have been selling off operations that show little promise and acquiring businesses in areas they can dominate. As a result, tens of thousands of workers have lost their jobs and dozens of plants have been shut down.
Martin Marietta, based in Bethesda, Md., said that the job cuts and plant consolidations announced yesterday would reduce its operating costs by $1.5 billion over the next five years and make the company more competitive.
Citing Federal budget cuts, the military contractor disclosed for the first time that it had already eliminated 9,000 jobs this year and that an additional 2,000 positions would be cut to consolidate operations. Martin Marietta plans to eliminate about five million square feet of excess capacity in seven states.
"These actions recognize the realities of a tough market place that demands low cost and high quality," Norman R. Augustine, Martin Marietta's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. "As but one example, as a percent of sales, our corporate overhead will be the lowest in recent history and is typical of the factors that will position us to remain a leader in the market areas in which we compete."
When Martin Marietta acquired General Electric's aerospace electronics business for $3 billion last November, it became the world's largest military electronics company with 94,000 employees, $11 billion in sales and a backlog of more than $28 billion.
Industry analysts have said that they expect dominance and synergy to come from the combined company, which has a broad customer base and a diversified product line that make it less vulnerable to pending budget cuts. Martin Marietta's main competitors are Hughes, TRW and Lockheed.
To achieve the economies of scale it wants, Martin Marietta had to eliminate duplicative administrative, production and research costs, the analysts said.
 
Army and Navy Clients
 General Electric's major customer is the Navy, while Martin Marietta is a main supplier to the Army. Martin makes space equipment and electronics, information and missile systems, including the Titan radar and military and commercial space launch vehicles and products. From G.E., Martin gained satellites and other space systems, radar and sonar systems and simulation systems.
"Massive layoffs and plant closings unfortunately have become a way of life in the defense industry as contractors reduce labor costs at a rate consistent or higher than the declines in Pentagon budget," said Jack Modzelewski, a weapons industry analyst for Paine Webber.
Weapons industry employment, since its high of 3.66 million workers in 1987, has fallen to 2.73 million workers in 1993, according to the Defense Budget Project, a Washington-based research group. Industry analysts and experts predict that Pentagon budget cuts announced by the Clinton Administration will cost the industry an additional 700,000 jobs by 1993.
Martin Marietta officials said that the job reductions and plant closings would have no impact on the company's third-quarter results because a $500 million reserve was included in the purchase of General Electric's aerospace division to cover the costs of consolidation.

HEADLINE: Whitman Says Florio Policies Led to Crime

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY J. McLARIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Christine Todd Whitman's campaign for governor took on a sharper edge today as she attacked Gov. Jim Florio for failing to stem the tide of violent crime in New Jersey.
At a news conference called to announce her own proposals for reforming New Jersey's criminal-justice system, Mrs. Whitman said that not only had Mr. Florio failed to halt violent crime, he had actually contributed to it. Trying to link crime to the issue of economic growth, Mrs. Whitman said Mr. Florio's economic policies had cost New Jersey residents thousands of jobs. The loss of jobs, she said, has, in turn, fostered the spread of crime. 
 "There is a relationship," she said. "His tax polices have helped make violent crime a growth industry in New Jersey."
Mrs. Whitman's news conference came a day after she realigned her campaign staff, removing her brother, Webster B. (Danny) Todd from his position as campaign manager and placing a Republican consultant, Ed Rollins, at the helm. Mr. Rollins, who orchestrated President Ronald Reagan's 1984 re-election campaign, is expected to steer the Whitman campaign toward a more vigorous attack on Mr. Florio's policies and political record.
 
Change Planned, She Says
 Mrs. Whitman said the change had been planned all along and was intended to allow Mr. Todd to return to the field and work with other Republicans who will campaign for Mrs. Whitman in the coming weeks.
"He never wanted a title," she said. "He took it because I asked him to. It's not a panic attack. Don't worry."
In announcing the report of a panel she appointed to study public safety, Mrs. Whitman sought to counter Governor Florio's contention that she is soft on crime.
She called for mandatory life sentences for criminals convicted of a violent crime for the third time, boot camps for nonviolent juvenile offenders and more community policing programs. She said that 17-year-old juveniles who commit homicide, carjacking, rape or armed robbery should be treated as adults, and that all violent juvenile offenders should receive at least some time in prison.
"First-time juvenile offenders cannot walk with just a slap on the wrist," she said.
 
Plan May Increase Costs
 Mrs. Whitman, who has promised to cut income taxes by eliminating more than a billion dollars in waste and mismanagement, said that some of her proposals may actually increase the state's criminal justice spending.
"That's the kind of investment we can't afford not to make," she said.
Mrs. Whitman said her proposals do not contradict her earlier opposition to mandatory sentences. Mrs. Whitman has said she opposes mandatory sentencing in general because it forces judges to act without considering the specifics of a case, leading to overcrowded prisons that force officials to release violent offenders who have not served their full time.
She sharply attacked Mr. Florio's record on several points, saying that he had failed to fulfill campaign promises to create boot camp programs for juvenile offenders and to create educational programs that would reduce crime among youths.
 
Crime Statistics Dispute
 "The impact of the policies he has supported have not done anything to make this a safer society, and in fact have exacerbated the problem," she said.
But according to the state's annual Uniform Crime Report, overall crime in New Jersey dropped 6 percent in 1992 to the lowest level since 1985 -- statistics that the Florio campaign rushed to point out.
"Mrs. Whitman has a habit of ignoring statistics if they don't fit the theme of her campaign," said Mr. Florio's chief spokesman, Jon Shure. "To blame the Governor for that is really outrageous."
Mr. Shure also criticized Mrs. Whitman for not mentioning semiautomatic weapons in her crime proposals. The state's ban on semiautomatic weapons is one of the most popular accomplishments of Mr. Florio's administration.
 
Question on Gun Stance
 Mrs. Whitman has said that she supports the state's gun ban in general. But earlier this year she told owners of a Jersey City gunshop called Gun-A-Rama that she would consider legislation to legalize certain weapons that are banned.
And in an unusual turn today, Mr. Florio selected Mrs. Whitman's principal rival in the Republican primary, Cary Edwards, as chairman of a commission to study the impact of gambling in New Jersey.
Both the Governor and Mr. Edwards, a former State Attorney General, played down any political significance to the appointment. "This has nothing to do with the election and shouldn't," Mr. Edwards said.
The appointment, nevertheless, raised an awkward political situation for Mrs. Whitman. Whether it was a calculated move by Mr. Florio or not, bringing Mr. Edwards back at this time will surely revive memories of the bitter Republican primary and the strident attacks Mr. Edwards made against Mrs. Whitman.
Mr. Edwards was Mrs. Whitman's harshest critic during the primary, calling her politically inexperienced, unqualified to be governor and unable to beat Mr. Florio. But after the June 8 primary, he stood beside her at a unity brunch and pledged to campaign for Mrs. Whitman.
Mrs. Whitman said that would still happen.
"I think you will see Cary Edwards standing right beside this campaign in the very near future," she said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar and Gold Are Higher As Russia Standoff Goes On

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar surged against all leading currencies yesterday amid nervousness over the political standoff between President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia and besieged deputies in Parliament.
Gold rose as well. Bullion for December delivery, the most active December contract on the Commodity Exchange in New York, rose $2.40 an ounce, to $357.10. The Republic National Bank posted spot gold at $355.55 an ounce, up $2.30 from Wednesday. 
 "With the possibility of anything happening in Russia, it's not too wise to short dollars," said Tom Hoge, a corporate trader for Credit Suisse. "Some people think the Parliament deadline might degenerate into civil war." On Wednesday, Mr. Yeltsin set a Monday deadline for the evacuation of Parliament.
The dollar also firmed against the yen on Japanese political jitters, amid news of a high-level Government bribery scandal.
The American currency was also bolstered by generally supportive economic data, including a rise in the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index for September and an increase in personal income for August. Dealers said a 3.1 percent drop in August home sales was mitigated by an upward revision for the July data, which showed a decline of 1.7 percent from a previous 5 percent drop. The dollar was quoted at 106.30 yen in late New York trading, up from 105.10 yen Wednesday. In Tokyo, it slipped to 105.10 yen, from 105.23 yen.
In late New York trading, the dollar climbed to 1.6330 marks, from 1.6135 marks late Wednesday. Earlier in London, the dollar closed at 1.6305 marks, up from 1.6113 Wednesday.
The British pound fell to $1.4965 in New York, from $1.5115 Wednesday, in nervous trading ahead of the Conservative Party's annual conference next week. Earlier, in London, it eased to $1.4970 from $1.5110 on Wednesday.
The Bank of Canada intervened for the second straight day and exchanged Canadian dollars for United States dollars. By late trading, the Canadian dollar was quoted at 1.3333 for each American dollar, compared with 1.3294 late Wednesday. It was the Canadian dollar's lowest level against the United States dollar in six years.
Other late dollar rates, compared with Wednesday's quotes, included: 1.4255 Swiss francs, up from 1.4125; 5.6970 French francs, up from 5.6350, and 1,590 Italian lire, up from 1,585.

HEADLINE: A New Ferry Out of L.I. May Yet Find A Developer

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., Sept. 30

 BODY:
An advisory committee of officials from New York and Connecticut has tentatively backed a developer to operate a high-speed ferry between Shoreham, L.I., and New Haven.
But some committee members and one of the principals of the company, the Long Island Sound Shuttle Limited Partnership of East Haven, are afraid that a list of requirements outlined by the committee could kill the project or lead to significant delays. 
 To gain the panel's full recommendation -- which would be presented for approval to the Governors of both states and their transportation departments -- the developer will have to demonstrate that it has complete financing for the $60 million project, and leases with the Long Island Lighting Company, owner of the Shoreham property, and with the owners of the Wyatt Oil Terminal in New Haven, the intended dock sites.
The committee decided that another potential developer, Sound Express Ferry Services of New York City, a subsidiary of the Bridgeport and Port Jefferson Steamship Company, which operates an existing ferry service, failed to meet the objectives outlined by the committee.
 
Wanted a Definitive Decision
 "I'm disappointed with the committee; I thought we should have moved ahead with a full endorsement now," said Leonard A. Liss, a member and New Haven's director of traffic and parking. "I think that some of the things being required are impossible without the committee's endorsement, especially securing private financing for the project and getting a lease with Lilco. I don't think the committee did its job."
John Acampora, an East Haven lawyer and one of three principal partners for the Long Island Sound Shuttle Limited Partnership, said he believes the partnership can meet the committee's requirements, but that it would be tougher and could delay the service, which could begin two years after all the approvals are issued.
"We haven't seen anything official yet, but it appears they have selected us with a lot of requirements we thought we already had addressed," he said. "I don't understand exactly what's going on here."
Mitchell Pally, a committee member and vice president for legislative and economic affairs of the Long Island Association, said the partnership had not yet met all the committee's requirements.
"I don't know if the provisions will or will not be possible to meet," he said, "but they are all things we believe are important. But we want to make it clear that we are very much behind the project working, because it is important to the economies of both Long Island and Connecticut."

HEADLINE: Personal Income Rises 1.3%, But New-Home Sales Falter

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Americans' personal income rose strongly in August and a measure of joblessness edged down last week, two indications that the economy, while not in great shape, is at least doing better than during the first half of the year.
However, in a jarring note among reports issued by the Government today, sales of new homes declined unexpectedly in August. 
 Incomes jumped 1.3 percent in August, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $5.43 trillion, following rare back-to-back declines during the two previous months, the Commerce Department said. It was the largest rise in four months.
Meanwhile, the Labor Department said the number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits fell by 11,000 last week, to 329,000. Analysts said that level was consistent with modest job growth.
Both reports were taken as positive signs that the economic growth rate during the second half of the year was improving from the moribund 1.4 percent annual rate during the first half.
"I think we're on the verge of a breakout from the siesta we went into in the first half," said Robert G. Dederick, an economist for the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. "The economy's got some get-up, not a lot of go, but some."
But another Commerce Department report showed a 3.1 percent drop in sales of new homes in August, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 616,000. That was the second straight fall and the fifth this year.
Analysts had expected low mortgage rates would produce a sales increase, but sales fell everywhere except the Northeast, pushing the inventory of unsold homes up to 288,000 at the end of August, the highest since October 1991.
David Seiders, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders, said the housing report was "troubling if true." But he noted that the Government frequently revisedits initial estimate of new-home sales.
The average rate of 30-year fixed-rate mortgages was close to 7 percent in August and almost a full percentage point lower than a year earlier. Rates have since slipped further.
According to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, they averaged 6.89 percent this week, close to a 25-year low and down from 6.95 percent last week.
Although home sales were worse than expected, the gain in income, and a rise in personal spending in August, were slightly stronger than anticipated by economists.
After adjustment to screen the effects of summer drought in the South and flooding in the Midwest, including crop and property damage, incomes rose six-tenths of 1 percent in August and five-tenths of 1 percent in July, the Government said.
In August, Americans' personal consumption spending rose a moderate four-tenths of 1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $4.42 trillion annual rate. That marked the fifth consecutive increase and was the same as July's.
The August combination of a big rise in income and a modest increase in consumer spending produced an advance in Americans' savings rate -- savings as a percentage of after-tax income -- to 4.1 percent, up from 3.1 percent in July.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Copper Touches 6-Year Low As Oil and Rice Make Gains

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Copper futures hit new six-year contract lows yesterday but cut their losses in heavy late trading as speculators hunted for bargains.
On other commodity markets, oil futures extended their gains on an apparent OPEC production accord; rice futures rose on purchases by Japan; grains and soybeans were mostly higher, and pork bellies rose. 
 Copper for December delivery at the Commodity Exchange in New York closed 1.25 cents a pound lower, at 74.90 cents a pound, after setting a new contract low at 74.30 cents in early trading.
"It's a continuation of all the recent selling," said George Milling-Stanley, a Lehman Brothers metals analyst. "The market is back in the harsh realities of supply and demand."
A downward spiral in prices began three weeks ago when the the London Metal Exchange imposed curbs on dealings to end what traders widely believed to be a squeeze on prices by Asian traders trying to corner the market.
The price of copper, a base metal used widely in the electrical, communications and construction industries, has dropped by 14 percent since then. The global recession and the failure of producers to cut output have increased copper supplies, analysts said.
 
Oil in Modest Gains
 Oil prices closed with modest gains as the market digested Wednesday's OPEC accord, tensions in Russia and a coming United Nations check of Iraq's weapons destruction. November crude closed up 12 cents, to $18.79 barrel.
Rice futures on Chicago's MidAmerica Commodity Exchange ralled for a second day on hopes for sales of American rice to overseas customers. Japan announced overnight that it would buy 200,000 metric tons of foreign rice immediately to shore up supply.
November delivery rough rice closed up 33 cents at $7.08 per hundred pounds. Daily limits were expanded to 45 cents from 30 cents after Wednesday's limit-up close.
"There again was talk that Japan may buy rice from us and that was the main factor here," a rice pit broker said.
Coffee futures fell for a fourth straight session as the market continued to hedge uncertainties about the success of a producer plan to retain 20 percent of output starting today. December coffee closed down 1.15 cents a pound to 74.50 cents.

California Bonds' High Yield Is 5.3%

 BODY:
A $213.2 million bond offering by California State Public Works was initially priced yesterday to yield a maximum 5.30 percent for a bond due in 2009 through underwriters led by Lehman Brothers.
The remaining serial refunding revenue bonds were priced to yield from 2.85 percent in 1994 to 4.05 percent in 1998, 4.80 percent in 2003 and 5.25 percent in 2008. 
 For investors in a 31 percent tax bracket, taxable bond equivalent yields would compute to about 4.13 percent in 1994 out to 7.68 percent for a bond due in 2009.
Proceeds from the bond sale, rated A-1 by Moody's Investors Service and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation, will be used to refund previously issued debt when interest rates were higher.

HEADLINE: 2 Parties, 1 Goal

SERIES: HEALTH CARE SECOND OPINIONS -- An occasional series

BYLINE: By David L. Boren and John C. Danforth; David L. Boren, Democrat of Oklahoma, and John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri, are members of the Senate Finance Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
With each passing year, fewer members of Congress are willing to work with their colleagues in the opposing party. Those who do are met with increasing criticism and suspicion in their own party caucuses. The culmination of this 20-year trend was passage of the budget without a single vote in Congress from the opposition party. Party and partisanship have become more important than policy and partnership.
If this pattern is allowed to continue, no one has more to lose than President Clinton. He was elected as a centrist, a "new kind of Democrat." But he cannot succeed as a centrist if the Administration continues to follow a "Democrats only" strategy. Swings to the left, necessary for votes in the House, will only shrink the President's political base and damage his credibility. 
 Health care may be Mr. Clinton's greatest opportunity for bipartisanship. There is much on which Republicans and Democrats agree. We agree that Americans deserve health care security. We agree that health costs cannot grow at three times the rate of inflation. We agree that all Americans should have insurance coverage -- including those who become ill and those who change jobs. We also agree on some of the solutions: insurance market reform, managed competition and purchasing cooperatives.
So far the Administration has made great efforts to consult with members on both sides of the aisle -- notably the First Lady's three days of testimony before committees of Congress, including our own yesterday. But bipartisanship means more than consultation in the drafting of a plan. It means compromise in the passing of a bill. It means giving up policies desperately desired by members on one side of the aisle in order to gain support for a program on the other side of the aisle.
In the end, the Administration may have to give up votes from those Democrats who favor a single-payer system or massive regulation in order to gain a solid block of Republican votes. Republicans, for their part, may have to give up the votes of those who do not want Government to be a part of the solution at all. Bipartisanship means mare than just talk; real results require real sacrifice.
 We want to help build consensus -- to initiate a process of compromise between the two parties and the various plans, a compromise that contains costs and provides universal access. In the end, if we do not pass a credible, comprehensive health care reform package, both parties will lose. The proposals are on the table; now it is time to draw together the best from each of them.

HEADLINE: Expansion of Jury Rolls Needed in New York

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Justice for Jurors" (editorial, Sept. 22) applauds efforts by Judith Kaye, New York State's Chief Judge, to increase juror access and comfort. 
 But unless jury rolls can be expanded to include those whose names appear on unemployment and welfare lists, we will rapidly find the civil trial juror an endangered species.
Legislation to do this passed both houses of the State Legislature this year. It was vetoed for technical reasons, but we believe those problems are being solved. Community and consumer groups have joined with us to see this legislation signed into law this session.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN;
Insurers Fear They'd Be the Big Losers in a World of Managed Health Care

SERIES: The Clinton Prescription: The Impact on Insurers -- Last of six articles

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

 BODY:
Since the President gave his health care speech last week, employees have lived with fluttery stomachs in the offices of the Bartmon Shapiro insurance agency, a thriving business high above Central Park South whose windows offer panoramic views of the park and the midtown Manhattan skyline. Under President Clinton's health care plan, the profession of health insurance agent could virtually cease to exist.
"People are very, very nervous," said Joel Shapiro, whose 17-year-old company employs 10 people. "But we are going to have to adapt. We are going to have to change." 
 Such agencies are not the only ones in the $300 billion health insurance industry that face the future with trepidation. With or without the proposed Clinton changes, hundreds of health insurers are expected to leave the business in the coming years, but the President's plan would greatly accelerate the pace.
Even the survivors, which are expected to include several of the country's largest insurers, like Prudential and Aetna, may have to fire or retrain armies of claims processors, cutting payrolls as they try to become efficient, lower-cost companies that oversee networks of doctors, nurses and hospitals.
What remains unclear is whether the survivors in the nation's health insurance industry -- an industry much distrusted by the public and often attacked in recent months by Hillary Rodham Clinton -- would eventually flourish or wither under the White House plan. It is also uncertain whether the survivors would in the end serve consumers better, as the White House insists they would.
The Administration's proposal would increase the revenue of the insurance industry by tens of billions of dollars. It would have all employers contribute and the Government subsidize the private insurance premiums of the 37 million who are now uninsured. It would also shift most poor people on Medicaid into the private insurance market. But whether those revenues would translate into profits after all the claims are paid is a matter of debate.
Under the Clinton plan, many functions of today's insurers, like setting benefit packages and negotiating with employers, would be taken over by new, state-run health alliances. The plan would force companies to compete more aggressively on the basis of price and would place limits on the premiums health insurers can charge. Those limits, insurance industry executives and a number of economists say, could squeeze profits so much that it would destroy incentives for investment and innovation.
 
Some Insurers Expected to Do Well
 "Those insurance companies that can realize real efficiencies and economies of scale may be able to do very well under the Clinton plan," said Beth Morrow, an analyst for Standard & Poor's. "But will they become more responsive to what consumers want? I don't know. What I do think is they will try to save money by squeezing health care providers to reduce costs."
The Administration says the proposed new health care system would give consumers more power in several ways.
For one, the proposed regional health alliances would serve as broker, in effect, for hundreds of thousands of consumers. Once a year, consumers would receive a menu of health plans from which to select. They would also receive a report card on each of the plans that would rate them on, among other things, consumer satisfaction and medical performance.
In addition, the Administration's proposal would permit customers more easily to compare health plans on the basis of cost. That would force insurers, health maintenance organizations and other operators of health care networks to compete for market share on the basis of both quality and price. If an insurer's services are inadequate or too expensive, the Administration says, customers once every year can vote with their feet and change plans.
In the process, the alliances would make many health insurance brokers and agents obsolete and would permit many private companies to shut down their medical benefit departments. The savings, the Administration says, would be in the billions.
Consumers would be allowed to choose traditional fee-for-service health plans, in which patients can choose their doctors and the doctors are paid for each service they provide. But financial incentives may push many consumers toward less-expensive H.M.O.'s or other types of managed care plans. Since most insurance companies today, especially the smaller ones, offer mainly fee-for-service insurance, industry analysts say most of the nation's more than 500 health insurers would be driven from the field.
The President's plan would simply be speeding up a process that is already under way: the switch of customers into H.M.O's and other forms of managed care. Last year, 41 million Americans had already enrolled in H.M.O.'s, up from 19 million in 1985. Forty-two percent of all H.M.O.'s are now owned by insurance companies or Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, while some others are run by independent companies or nonprofit organizations.
Expected to benefit most under the President's plan are those insurance companies that have already invested large sums in building up H.M.O.'s and other managed-care networks around the country. The most prominent are the Cigna Corporation, the Prudential Insurance Company of America, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, the Travelers Corporation, Aetna Life & Casualty and more than 60 Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans.
But doubters inside and outside the insurance industry say the Clinton plan, as proposed, will not necessarily result in a more efficient and consumer-friendly health insurance industry.
Dr. David U. Himmelstein, an associate professor at the Harvard Medical School and an advocate of Canadian-style government-run health care system, said he was concerned that an increasing amount of health care money would fall into the hands of an ever smaller and more powerful group of insurers.
In many regional markets, he said, a small number of large companies would dominate the market, making the entry of smaller new health groups difficult.
"What I think you would end up with is a couple of large firms controlling the health care delivered to the American people," Dr. Himmelstein said "Oligopolies don't compete in this country. They don't lower prices."
Executives of the nation's largest insurance companies as well as a number of economists dispute Dr. Himmelstein's predictions. They say the greatest danger is not that the insurers will be too powerful but that the health alliances will.
 
Local Competition Expected to Thrive
 Many insurance executives say that within each region and alliance large numbers of local H.M.O.'s and other health networks would survive as competitors. Even the largest national insurers may not have the capital or market clout to wipe out such competition.
"It will mean separate competition in many, many local markets, instead of one large market," said Paul Cooper, vice president for health care policy for Prudential. "The winners in Houston will be different from the winners in Denver. It is going to become a very decentralized industry."
But insurance companies note that the alliances, under Federal supervision, would set caps on the premiums that insurers could charge. Those caps might squeeze profits so much, industry officials assert, that it might be difficult for private insurers to raise capital to invest in new and innovative ways of delivering care. The White House expects that competition among health plans will itself hold down costs, but in case that tactic fails, it proposes limiting average premium increases to about the overall inflation rate.
"If we are going to have real reduction in medical inflation, it is going to take a lot of ingenuity and risk-taking and new ideas," said Thomas O. Pyle, chief executive of Metropolitan Life's health care operations. "Those are not going to be called forth by a cap on costs, which will make everyone very cautious and risk-averse."
Amid the theoretical debate, executives and workers in the health insurance field have begun to think in practical terms about what the Clinton plan could mean for them.
In Marietta, Ohio, a city of about 20,000 that looks across the Ohio River to West Virginia, Mark B. Schewendeman is contemplating the future of the Schwendeman Sigafoos Agency, an insurance agency his grandfather founded in 1928. His company sells health plans to small employers, mainly on behalf of regional insurers that know the small towns and farm country of rural, southeastern Ohio well.
Under the Clinton plan, his customers would buy health insurance from an alliance, and the health insurers he deals with would be likely to leave the business.
Mr. Schewendeman has been reassuring his staff of 19 that the Clinton plan is bound to be transformed by Congress. But if the final legislation leaves little room for insurance agents, he says, he would turn his company into a consulting service, offering to help individuals and companies make their way through the new health care system. If that occurs, he acknowledges, his company's revenues would probably be reduced and some of his employees would have to be laid off.
Joel Shapiro, whose insurance agents in New York bring in more than $1 million a year in revenues from health and life sales, has told his workers that his business will survive, selling life insurance and perhaps offering health-insurance consulting services. There would still be a demand, too, for private supplemental policies for elderly people on Medicare, for example.
But, Mr. Shapiro said, he believes 45 percent of his revenue would disappear, and he would have to reduce his staff by four or five.
"I really dread this," Mr. Shapiro said. "The employers we work with and my friends in the business are very upset. I feel badly for my people."
 
Profitable Niches Are Being Sought
 Insurance companies, in turn, are exploring what new niches they may occupy as Federal legislation goes into effect. Some companies that offer fee-for-service policies foresee a lasting need for them, particularly in rural areas.
But the largest companies that have invested heavily in managed care networks say they hope to move swiftly to reduce the large and costly departments that process complex claims forms. The insurers say computers will permit doctors to transmit information on patients to them directly by computer without ever touching paper.
A top executive at one of the nation's largest health insurance companies, who asked not to be identified, said his company's goal was to reduce its work force in both claims and sales by half, and to replace highly trained sales people with less expensive young college graduates.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN;
Hillary Clinton Raises Tough Question of Life, Death and Medicine

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton said today that she hoped the nation would engage in a serious discussion about what is appropriate medical care in cases where very expensive treatments do nothing for the patient's quality of life.
 The First Lady, completing her testimony before the Senate Finance Committee -- her fifth Congressional hearing in three days on the President's health care proposals -- was prodded by Senator John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri. He asked her whether the system would have "somebody at some level in a position to say no." 
Senator Danforth cited a baby who was kept alive for 11 months without a brain; a separation of Siamese twins of whom one was certain to die and the other had only a 1 percent chance of living; babies with low birth weights of whom only 15 percent will be functional, and expensive efforts to prolong life for three or six months at very high cost.
 Mrs. Clinton neither responded directly to the examples nor promised anything administratively in the health plan. But she predicted that there would be a more promising climate for serious discussions about such issues. If the plan creates "the kind of health security we are talking about," she said, "then people will know they are not being denied treatment for any reason other than it is not appropriate -- will not enhance or save the quality of life."
 
Makes Politicians Nervous
 The issue frightens most politicians, who fear that they will be seen as enemies of the elderly, who vote in high proportions. Gov. Richard D. Lamm of Colorado drew widespread antagonism when he said in 1984 that the elderly, if ill, "have got a duty to die and get out of the way."
 Mr. Danforth has raised this issue from time to time since 1987. He has never addressed it as emphatically as Mr. Lamm, but he was re-elected after raising it. He has said he will not seek re-election next year.
 Mrs. Clinton has argued that the budgetary constraints the Administration plan will put on insurance companies and hospitals may reduce unnecessarily costly treatment. She has repeatedly cited the example of a 92-year-old man given a quadruple heart bypass because the surgeon had depended on a cardiologist who had referred that patient to him, and she suggests that if the system is changed such surgery will not be performed.
 She told that same story and offered the same hope today. Reflecting on her own days waiting at the hospital as her father was dying last spring, she said: "I would agree that for both moral and ethical reasons as well as economic ones, there has to be the kind of very difficult conversation that you are suggesting." Personal Reflections
 She said she had had a lot of time to think about the issue "on a personal level when I was in the hospital with my father and spending literally all day every day talking to doctors and nurses about the very kinds of cases that you are outlining."
 There were other tough questions for Mrs. Clinton today, more than she had before the earlier committees. The senators usually focused directly on financing and bore in with considerable detail. She frequently promised to consider Senatorial arguments for changes and delays.
 Senator John Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, contended that imposing limits on insurance premiums after just two years would not give competition a chance to start. She told him, "Whether we can get to where we need in two years or over a longer period of time, we are very open to talking with you about that."
 Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat who heads the committee, asked how she expected to hold health costs to the rate of inflation when such costs had grown more than twice that fast between 1960 and 1992. Goal of Zero Growth
 She replied, "We should be thinking zero growth as a budget target that this country should be moving toward." She insisted that vast savings could be made, citing the economies that some cities, states and health care systems had managed in recent years. And she referred to Mr. Moynihan's own writings on the "cost disease" to argue that health care has been made less productive because the payment system rewarded waste and inefficiency.
 When Senator Bill Bradley, Democrat of New Jersey, asked whether some of the financing for health care could not come from steep taxes on guns and gun dealers, she answered that she liked the idea and that she agreed that shootings were a serious factor in health costs.
 Mr. Bradley replied, "Well, let me say that there is no more important personal endorsement in the country today, and I thank you very much."
 When the hearing ended, the senators applauded the witness.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 1, 1993, Friday

 CORRECTION:
 An article on Oct. 1, reporting on Senate testimony by Hillary Rodham Clinton about health care, included a passage about former Gov. Richard D. Lamm of Colorado. It said Mr. Lamm "drew widespread antagonism when he said in 1984 that the elderly, if ill, 'have got a duty to die and get out of the way.' "
Similar characterizations of Mr. Lamm's speech of March 27, 1984, were published soon after it was given, and have appeared periodically. But that version of Mr. Lamm's remarks is a distortion, as Governor Lamm complained in 1984. He said then that insufficient attention to detail by the news media had led to a misinterpretation.
 An editorial in The Times on March 31, 1984, and articles on April 1, April 4, June 30 and Sept. 5 of that year reported on criticism generated by his speech or included accounts of his statements, but noted that his remarks had been misconstrued. Nevertheless incorrect accounts appeared in The Times on March 29, 1984; April 1, 1984; April 18, 1984; May 11, 1984; Jan. 5, 1985; Jan. 18, 1985; Aug. 18, 1985, and Aug. 20, 1985.
In a letter dated Oct. 8, 1993, Mr. Lamm provided excerpts from the 1984 speech, in which he spoke philosophically about the terminally ill of any age, about the extraordinary costs of high-technology medicine and about the ability of medical science to stave off death far beyond considerations of quality of life. After saying that society should be talking about the ethical implications, Mr. Lamm said, according to the excerpts:
"We've got a duty to die and get out of the way with all of our machines and artificial hearts and everything else like that and let the other society, our kids, build a reasonable life."
In his letter last month, Mr. Lamm wrote that he never said "the elderly or the terminally ill have a duty to die," and he added, "I was essentially raising a general statement about the human condition, not beating up on the elderly."

HEADLINE: New York Rivals Differ Strikingly On Dealing With City's Poorest

SERIES: Mayoral Agenda
A periodic report on major issues
facing the election winner.

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
In the four years since they last ran for mayor, David N. Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani have refined their positions on what should be done for the city's impoverished multitudes and now present voters with distinctly different approaches to homelessness and welfare reform.
But even as they have become more sophisticated about the issues, the already staggering scale of the city's social ills has worsened, fueled by a deep, prolonged recession, rising numbers of people with AIDS, a virulent drug crisis, a persistent low-income housing shortage and the spread of tuberculosis. 
 The number of people on welfare has risen to almost 1.1 million, its highest level since the Depression. There are 273,000 more New Yorkers on welfare now than when Mr. Dinkins took office, a figure that equals the total population of Newark. The number of families in the city's shelter system has risen 54 percent, to 5,700, and dozens of families sleep each night on floors, chairs and tables in city offices.
 
Choices Affecting Life
 So as New York City moves into an era of deepening fiscal constraints, the mayor in 1994 will have to make hard choices that will affect the texture of life for those people, as well as for taxpayers who foot the bills and walk streets jostling with beggars, paupers and hustlers.
Both Mayor Dinkins and his challenger, Mr. Giuliani, say the city should encourage the jobless to work and take the homeless in from the streets. But the candidates' views about how to reach those goals differ in crucial respects. At bottom, their debate is an age-old one about how society should balance its duty to the poor with their responsibility to help themselves.
Mr. Dinkins, a liberal Democrat and the son of a maid and a barber, says he believes the poor will help themselves if given the chance. The city, he says, should rely primarily on incentives -- the promise of a subsidized apartment or higher income -- to give them a reason to seek education, training, drug treatment or a job itself.
Mr. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal candidate and a former prosecutor, argues that the poor need more of a push to get back on their feet. He would combine the carrots Mr. Dinkins uses with a few new sticks.
Managing the city's enormous welfare system involves excruciatingly difficult choices on how best to move single mothers from dependence on government into the work force.
During Mr. Dinkins's term, Barbara J. Sabol, who heads the city's Human Resources Administration, has emphasized giving welfare recipients choices. When they are called in to take part in the city's welfare-to-work program, they can either look for work immediately or choose education or training.
Under the Federal Family Support Act, adopted in 1988, an increasing part of the city's welfare caseload is required to participate in such programs. But while the percentage of eligible city recipients who are looking for work or pursuing education and training has doubled since 1989, to 12 percent, the number of job placements has increased only 13 percent, to 16,551 last year.
Under Mrs. Sabol, the city has also reduced the number of single parents whose welfare benefits are cut, or "sanctioned," for failing to participate in the welfare-to-work program. That figure has fallen almost three-quarters since 1989 to 8,542 last year.
"Clearly, her direction was to work hard to reduce sanctions because of the hardship on very poor people, and we try to be responsive to that," said Catherine Zall, the deputy commissioner in charge of the welfare-to-work program. "But she's not unresponsive to rigorous enforcement of the program. She wants to see people active, participating, going to work."
 
Current Emphasis Is on Education
 Mrs. Sabol, who rarely gives interviews, declined to discuss the administration's differences with Mr. Giuliani for this article. But in the past she has said that virtually every woman on welfare she has ever spoken with desperately wants to go to work. She has said that the city's current heavy investment in education and training will eventually pay off by enabling welfare recipients to get decent-paying jobs, rather than dead-end jobs.
Deputy Mayor Cesar A. Perales says the administration is also about to start a major welfare experiment in Brooklyn. It would let recipients of court-ordered child support keep more of their welfare benefits when they go to work than they would under traditional programs. The current system discourages work by docking welfare recipients' benefits almost dollar-for-dollar against their wages.
Mr. Giuliani has not issued a position paper or given a major speech on welfare policy, but his advisers suggested some of the ways his policies would differ from Mr. Dinkins's.
For instance, his principal social policy adviser is William J. Grinker, a Democrat who headed the city's Human Resources Administration under Mayor Edward I. Koch. Mr. Grinker helped found the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation, which made its reputation researching welfare-to-work programs.
When Mr. Grinker headed the H.R.A., that agency began requiring welfare recipients to look for a job immediately or lose part of their welfare benefits.
Mr. Grinker criticized the Dinkins administration for letting people choose education and training over an immediate job search. "You end up with a lot of people going from training program to training program and never have any results," he said. He described Mrs. Sabol's message to welfare recipients as, "We're not going to really push you."
 
Sharp Differences On 'Right' to Shelter
 The mayoral candidates' contrasting approaches come into clearest focus on the issue of homelessness. Mr. Dinkins still fervently argues that the city owes the homeless shelter, though he has tightened access to the bulging shelter system with new eligibility rules.
But Mr. Giuliani contends the city should undo the right to shelter that is the foundation of its policy on homelessness -- a right that he says no other city guarantees.
He wants the city to challenge the consent decree the city signed in 1981, promising to shelter all homeless men. But he would also have to persuade the courts to modify a 1986 preliminary injunction requiring the city to shelter families. The courts have never ruled on whether the right to shelter is rooted in the State Constitution, but the state's Appellate Division has said it probably is -- hardly an encouraging harbinger for Mr. Giuliani's approach.
If his administration did succeed in the courts, Mr. Giuliani would fundamentally alter the shelter system, limiting many shelter stays to 90 days and requiring shelter residents to join programs.
Mr. Dinkins has attacked Mr. Giuliani for "suggesting we should turn pregnant women and peaceful children out on to our streets." But Mr. Giuliani insists: "We need people to help themselves, to reform their own behavior."
Both men's views have evolved in recent years. Mr. Dinkins has got some difficult on-the-job training. He tried to house shelter residents quickly in permanent subsidized apartments, assuming that that would empty the shelters. Instead, he now says, the policy boomeranged and attracted more families who were looking for a short cut to an apartment. He hopes the eligibility rules will screen out such families.
The candidates' views have converged on some issues, largely because both have been strongly influenced by Andrew M. Cuomo, the Governor's son, who headed Mayor Dinkins's Commission on the Homeless.
Like Mr. Cuomo, now a Federal housing official, both candidates say the city should stop running shelters and hire nonprofit groups to do the job. Both agree that many of the homeless have chronic problems like drug addiction and mental illness and need intensive social services.
And both candidates realize that homelessness has become an emotional issue for voters dispirited by the city's inability to end the presence of a raggedy, sometimes threatening army of street people, despite more than a decade of effort and almost $5 billion spent on the problem.
Mr. Giuliani has explicitly linked the presence of aggressive or demented homeless people on the streets to what he calls the degradation of the quality of life. "New Yorkers no longer want to look the other way when passing a needy homeless person on the street," he said in a position paper. "Nor are they required to be assaulted by menacing individuals."
Those statements leave unresolved whether either candidate has an approach that will actually reduce the number of people living on the streets and help the homeless attain self-suffiency, goals that can sometimes be contradictory.
 
Limiting Shelter To the Neediest
 For example, Mr. Giuliani's carrot-and-stick approach would require drug addicts to seek treatment as a condition of being sheltered, and would use workers to coax people off the streets. But failure rates for drug treatment are high, and some addicts simply refuse help. If Mr. Giuliani's policy is followed to its logical conclusion, the most hard-core addicts would be kicked out of shelter -- right back onto the streets.
In the late 1980's, Philadelphia imposed strict new rules requiring that shelter residents stay off illegal drugs and submit to random urine testing. The new policies helped push some people to get their lives back in order, but experts and advocates say they have also put more people on the city's streets.
The candidates' positions also raise questions about whose policies would be most successful in limiting shelter to the neediest. Both men say they believe that some families have entered city shelters so they can jump to the front of a years-long waiting list for subsidized housing, contributing to a near doubling of the costs of sheltering families to $292 million a year since Mr. Dinkins took office.
Mr. Dinkins has developed eligibility rules, scheduled to go into effect next month, that are supposed to exclude people who can still live with friends or relatives. But his administration has hedged when asked how it will enforce the new rules. Inevitably, the city will find it hard to turn away desperate families.
Mr. Giuliani goes much further, and some social policy experts credit him with opening up the debate about a subject that has been virtually taboo.
But Mr. Giuliani's proposed 90-day limit on many shelter stays could prove as difficult to enforce as Mr. Dinkins's eligibility standards. In the days after his plan was released, Mr. Giuliani said that if an individual still had no place to go after 90 days, "of course it can be extended, and it should be extended."
An even more striking proposal received less attention. Mr. Giuliani says the city should stop giving the homeless priority for permanent housing. This is a step he could probably take without the courts' approval.
In 1989, Massachusetts eliminated the housing preference for shelter residents. The number of families seeking shelter there has dropped from 5,700 in 1989 to less than 2,500 in each of the last three years.
 
The Series So Far
 The first article of the series, which appeared on Monday, discussed the city's approaching deficits and reported that whoever wins the mayoral election Nov. 2 will immediately face a major budget crisis. Fiscal experts say the city must find a strategy to guarantee long-term budget stability.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "ON THE ISSUES: The Candidates' Plans for the Poor"
 
 These are the mayoral contenders' major actions and positions on the issues of homelessness and welfare.
 
 Mayor David N. Dinkins
 
 * Created new Department for Homeless Services to contract with nonprofit groups to develop and run specialized shelters and service programs.
* Established eligibility rules to deny shelter to families who can continue living with friends and family.
* Began welfare-to-work program that gives welfare recipients choice between job search and education or training.
* Starting experimental program that would allow some welfare recipients to keep more of their benefits if they go back to work.
 
 Rudolph W. Giuliani
 
 * Proposes challenging the legal right to shelter for the homeless. Wants a 90-day limit on many stays.
* Proposes that city provide mentally ill and addicted homeless people with more treatment services, while also requiring that the homeless accept such help in exchange for shelter.
* Favors eliminating the housing preference given to homeless families living in city shelters.
* Would probably change welfare program to require recipients to look for a job before being sent for more education and training. (pg. 28)

HEADLINE: Number of Cuban Refugees Called Highest Since Boatlift

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico, Oct. 1

 BODY:
The United States Coast Guard has intercepted more Cubans escaping their homeland by sea in September than in any month since the Mariel boatlift of 1980, a Coast Guard spokesman said today.
The total of 522 refugees does not include Cubans who overstayed American tourist visas, illegally entered the United States or fled to neighboring islands or to Mexico, Chief Petty Officer Joe Dye said in a telephone interview from Miami. 
 Coast Guard cutters have intercepted 2,260 Cubans so far this year, Mr. Dye said. He said he expected the final figure for 1993 to surpass the total of 2,557 refugees in 1992.
The departures come amid worsening economic conditions in Cuba.
The Coast Guard total for September was the highest monthly figure since the Mariel exodus, in which 125,000 Cubans left on thousands of boats from April to June 1980.

HEADLINE: Clinton and China's President Will Meet to Discuss Disputes

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 1

 BODY:
As part of a strategy to improve the increasingly troubled relationship between Washington and Beijing, the Clinton Administration has scheduled a number of high-level meetings with Chinese officials.
President Clinton will meet with President Jiang Zemin of China for the first time at a meeting of heads of member states of the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation Organization, a forum devoted to economic cooperation, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said in New York on Thursday. The meeting is planned for November in Seattle. 
 A senior Administration official said that the two Presidents would take advantage of the fact that they would both be attending the conference to meet, but that the meeting would not be a "summit." The fact that a meeting is scheduled, however, indicates the importance that both countries place on establishing a high-level dialogue.
 
Timed for Meeting
 "I don't want to minimize the importance of the two Presidents having a chance to see each other," the official said in a briefing with reporters Thursday evening. "I want to emphasize again to you that this was as a result of the APEC leaders meeting."
The Administration is also prepared to send Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen to Beijing to revive a bilateral Joint Economic Commission with China that was suspended after the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989, a senior Administration official said today. Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy is also likely to make a trip to Beijing, the official added.
Mr. Christopher announced on Thursday that China agreed to allow John Shattuck, the Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, to visit China next month -- the first such visit in a year -- to discuss China's poor human rights record and its continued use of prison labor.
But senior Administration officials stressed that they have no illusions that the visits will make an appreciable difference in China's behavior. In a meeting in the White House on Sept. 25, National Security Adviser Anthony Lake and Winston Lord, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs, bluntly described the Administration's areas of concern to Li Daoyu, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, in anticipation of Thursday's meeting between Mr. Christopher and Qian Qichen, the Chinese Foreign Minister.
 
Trade Status Issue
 The Administration is eager to reverse the downward trend in relations that will make it difficult for Mr. Clinton to renew most-favored-nation trade benefits for China in June unless the Chinese make substantive progress on human rights and weapons nonproliferation issues.
Another American official said that Mr. Lake told Mr. Li that the Administration would like to find a way to waive economic sanctions imposed on Beijing in August after China transferred M-11 missile technology to Pakistan. The official added that such a move would require a new commitment from China to adhere to the principles of the Missile Technology Control Regime, a 1987 international agreement restricting the export of missiles and missile technology.
"We made clear we were willing to negotiate a waiver of the sanctions, that given the evidence against China, we had no choice under the law except to impose them," the official said. He added that the Chinese would have to make a more formal commitment than the one that Mr. Qian gave to James A. Baker 3d, who was then the Secretary of State, in November 1992.
At that time, Mr. Qian wrote a letter agreeing to abide by the guidelines of the missile control agreement, but China has never signed the accord and China and the United States have never fully agreed on what constitutes a violation of the accord.
The United States is eager to improve relations with China, particularly to preserve and improve the trade relationship. In addition, the United States needs China's continued cooperation to oppose North Korea's nuclear weapons program and to bring stability to Cambodia.

HEADLINE: As Mormon Church Grows, So Does Dissent From Feminists and Scholars

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY

 BODY:
The Mormon Church, whose early leaders feared the wrath of outsiders, has lately viewed its gravest threat as coming from within: intellectuals and feminists in the temples.
In what dissidents have described as a purge, church leaders took severe disciplinary action in September against six Mormon scholars and feminists. The transgressions fit into two categories: academic research that raises questions about official church history, and the call for opening the priesthood to women, which is granted to males over the age of 12. 
 "With the tremendous growth of the church, we have seen an emerging intellectual pluralism in Mormonism," said Elbert Peck, the publisher of Sunstone, an independent Mormon magazine. "And the church feels it must confront them."
The Church of Jesus Christ Latter-Day Saints, as the Mormon Church is known, is one of the fastest-growing in the world and now counts 8.5 million members in more than 120 countries. In 1950, when there were one million Mormons, nearly half of them lived in Utah; today, not even one in six live here. And growing numbers of women in the church, like those in other religions with male-only clergies, are chafing at what they regard as sex discrimination.
 
Independent Mormon Voices
 In the last decade or so, a flurry of independent Mormon publications and groups have emerged in Salt Lake City, including the Mormon Women's Forum, a feminist group that says it has about 2,000 members.
Its president, Lynn Kanavel Whitesides, was one of the six disciplined by the church authorities. She was "disfellowshipped," which means the loss of certain privileges like receiving sacraments. The other five were excommunicated, a more severe penalty, and their names were removed from church rolls.
Don LeFever, a spokesman for the Mormons, said that the church never discussed its actions but that anything that caused harm to Mormonism would be grounds for discipline.
While women sometimes deliver sermons and lead prayers, they are not allowed to baptize, bless or distribute the sacraments, or lead congregations.
It galls some Mormons that boys as young as 12 can become deacons, an office within the priesthood, and distribute the sacraments. At 16, boys can baptize. In their early 20's, men typically become bishops, the equivalent of priests or ministers in other Christian denominations, an office that is closed to women, as are other positions of authority within the church.
 
Motives Are Discussed
 "We are not trying to tear the church down," said Ms. Whitesides, who has called for leadership roles to be opened to women. "Instead, we are trying to give Mormon women a reason to stay in the church."
She said she believed that she had angered the Mormon hierarchy by organizing a protest when two liberal professors at Brigham Young University were denied tenure. The university is owned by the church.
She later appeared on a Salt Lake City television program and warned church leaders that they would be unable to quell the rising tide of feminism in the Mormon ranks.
"If you excommunicate one of us, there will be 10 more to step up and take her place," she said. "Excommunicate those 10 and there will be 100 to take their places."
A long-established doctrine of Mormonism, not widely known outside the church, gives the debate a tantalizing twist: the belief in a female as well as a male deity as the spiritual parents of humankind.
In recent years, Mormon feminists have pointed to a female diety as logical grounds for opening leadership to women. Indeed, some women have begun praying to "our Mother in heaven" as well as "our Father."
 
Leadership Point of View
 A church leader, Gordon Hinckley, delivered a speech in 1991 that forbade prayer to a mother in heaven but did not challenge the concept of a female diety. Citing the Sermon on the Mount by Jesus, he said prayers should be offered to "our Father." Another church leader, Boyd Packer, told a Mormon conference in May that feminists posed a serious threat to the faith, along with homosexuals and "so-called intellectuals and scholars."
"Our local leaders," Mr. Packer said, "must deal with all three of them with ever-increasing frequency."
The existence of a female God is underlined in a popular church hymn, written in 1843 by Eliza Snow, an important church figure who called for equal rights for women. The hymn, "Oh, My Father," is still sung in Mormon meeting houses on Sundays. It includes these verses:
In the Heavens are parents single?
No. The thought makes reason stare.
Truth is reason.
Truth eternal
Tells me I've a Mother there.
Throughout the 20th century, leaders of the Mormon Church have sought to move the faith toward the mainstream of Christianity, and at the same time to preserve the distinctiveness of its religious culture. Mormons are expected to tithe, or donate 10 percent of their income to the church, abstain from coffee, tea, tobacco and alcohol, and adhere to conservative family values.
But the profile of church members has been changing: statistics on family size, working women and divorce rates show that Mormons are looking more like the rest of America.
Through the 1970's, the size of a typical Mormon family was about 50 percent larger than the national average, said Tim Heaton, a sociologist at Brigham Young University, but that gap has been shrinking in recent years.
The typical married couple in Utah today has 2.5 children, compared with the national average of 1.9.
 
Same Economics for All
 "Mormons respond to the same kinds of social and economic conditions that others do," he said. "And the fact is, it's gotten to be very expensive to have a big family."
He said that the percentage of Mormon women who hold paying jobs virtually mirrored the national average and that the divorce rate in Utah was only slightly lower than elsewhere. The Mormon Church encourages women to stay home with children, rather than work. "But that is an ideal," said Mr. LeFever, "and the church understands it's just not economically possible for many families to do so."
Along with the Mormon Tabernacle and the other majestic church buildings, the city has its share of avant-garde places, like Club DV8 and bands with names like Nudeswirl and Maggots Head.
Professor Heaton said, "Salt Lake does not look appreciably different than any other big city in America except, of course, that it's almost all white."
 
Speaking Out for Women
 One of the women who was excommunicated, Maxine Hanks, said, "Feminism is embedded in our Mormon history, our culture."
Ms. Hanks, who edited the book "Women and Authority: Re-emerging Mormon Feminism" (Signature Books, 1992), added, "Mormon theology is potentially very empowering for women. But the police and the practice of the institutional church has been very damaging and confining to women."
Michael Quinn, a Yale-educated scholar who formerly taught at Brigham Young, believes that he was expelled from the church for his research. In 1985, Mr. Quinn unearthed evidence that Mormon leaders continued to practice polygamy for 14 years after the church officially ended the practice in 1890, known as the Great Accommodation, to win statehood, which came six years later.
He also wrote an essay for Ms. Hanks's book, "Women Have Had the Priesthood since 1843." It explored the notion that women were spiritually invested with the priesthood by Joseph Smith in a ceremony the church calls "Endowment in the Temple."
The others who were disciplined were Avrhami Gileadi, a conservative Biblical scholar; Paul Toscano, an author and lecturer, and Lavina Fielding Anderson, a writer and scholar.
 
'Incompatible Categories'
 "I am an orthodox, believing Mormon and a feminist," said Ms. Anderson, who was deeply shaken by her excommunication, "and my church has informed me that those are incompatible categories." She said she had been excommunicated for writing critically of certain Mormon bishops and for speaking out about the church's treatment of scholars.
"This is the worst thing that has ever happened to me," Ms. Anderson said. "My people have been Mormons for six generations."
The debate over feminism in the Mormon Church comes at a time of growing research by scholars exploring the roles of women in ancient Christian and Jewish culture.
Jan Shipps, a religious scholar and author of "Mormonism: The Story of a New Religious Tradition" (University of Illinois Press, 1985), said the idea of a Mormon feminist has long been regarded as an oxymoron.
"But in fact, their history gives them more resources, more inspiration, to draw upon, for feminism," she said.
The Mormon notion of "a Mother in heaven," she said, as it becomes more broadly discussed in American feminist circles, "will be exciting to those who are trying to figure out where they belong in the scheme of Christianity."

HEADLINE: Inquiry on Commerce Secretary Finds Vietnam Bank Account Plan

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Federal investigators examining a Vietnamese businessman's assertion that Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown sought $700,000 to help end a trade embargo against Vietnam have uncovered evidence that the Vietnamese were preparing to establish a special bank account in Singapore, Administration officials said today.
The evidence, in the form of transfers of an undisclosed sum of money in East Asian banks, appears to corroborate portions of the account of Ly Thanh Binh, the businessman who told the Federal authorities that a former associate approached Mr. Brown last fall to enlist his help to improve trade relations between the United States and Vietnam. 
 Mr. Binh has said the Vietnamese Government was trying to use the Indosuez Bank in Singapore as a conduit to pay Mr. Brown. But it is not clear whether the transfer of funds being scrutinized by the Federal authorities involved Indosuez or, indeed, whether the financial records drew any connection between the funds and Mr. Brown.
Mr. Brown has denied any wrongdoing, but he acknowledged through his lawyer that he had met three times with Mr. Binh's former associate, Nguyen Van Hao, a former Vietnamese official. Mr. Brown's lawyer, Reid H. Weingarten, has denied that the Commerce Secretary ever discussed accepting money from the Vietnamese. The lawyer said that two of the meetings occurred before Mr. Brown was appointed Commerce Secretary and the third took place in February, after his confirmation.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation is trying to learn whether Mr. Brown took money as a public official in return for favors.
 
Authorities Hear of Plans
 Mr. Binh has said that Mr. Brown was to receive $700,000, plus a percentage of new business he generated for Vietnam, in addition to concessions from oil and gas reserves opened as a result of ending the embargo.
Mr. Binh said the money was to be funneled from Vietnam through a Hong Kong bank to a Singapore bank. In Singapore, he said, it was to be deposited in an account in the name of Mr. Hao or Marc Ashton, a Haitian friend of Mr. Brown's who first introduced Mr. Hao to the Commerce Secretary, or Lillian Madsen, Mr. Ashton's sister-in-law and a friend of Mr. Brown's.
Mr. Binh said a total of $1 million was to be deposited in the account, $700,000 for Mr. Brown and $300,000 for the Vietnam Development Corporation, the entity that Mr. Hao intended to establish to funnel American investment to Vietnam.
U.S. News & World Report said tonight in a news release describing an account in next week's issue that the F.B.I. was looking at NVH Associates, a company that Mr. Hao incorporated in Hong Kong and the United States. The magazine said Federal agents were seeking to determine whether the company might have been involved in directing any payments to Mr. Brown.
Thus far, no evidence has emerged to indicate that Mr. Brown received any money from the account, nor is there any evidence that he engaged in any unlawful act, the Administration officials said. A telephone call to Mr. Brown's lawyer today was not returned.
This evening, ABC News reported that Mr. Hao had sent at least two faxes from his house in Florida to the chief of staff for Vietnam's Prime Minister, Vo Van Kiet. The communications summarized Mr. Hao's meetings with Mr. Brown and described the meetings as positive and indicated that Mr. Brown had agreed to work with the Vietnamese representatives.
Today, the head of a Vietnam veterans' group that opposes normalization of relations with Hanoi pending a full accounting of all missing Americans said that Mr. Brown should resign because of the accusations swirling around him.
Mr. Brown's supporters have said that opponents of improved ties with Vietnam have quietly helped spread Mr. Binh's accusations in order to maintain the trade embargo.

HEADLINE: Gas Tax Hits, and Drivers Aren't Happy

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 1

 BODY:
With resignation and skepticism, the public began making its first contributions to reducing the Federal budget deficit today when around the country motorists woke up to President Clinton's new gasoline tax and slightly higher prices at the pump.
There was chaos at some service stations Thursday night before the 4.3-cents-a-gallon increase went into effect, with some people idling in lines to save a dime or two. There were reports of truck drivers protesting the tax and disrupting traffic by driving the speed limit in tandem on highways in the Midwest. 
 And today, business was anemic at many stations as motorists, accustomed to below-average prices, balked at the increase and others bought the minimum in vain hope that this would all go away.
"I'm mad, I'm mad, I'm mad," said Lula Curtis, a Philadelphia motorist as she paid for gasoline at a downtown Amoco station. "I didn't profit when all these people made these bad debts. The business people who made money off the deficit should pay. Let Ross Perot pay."
 
Protest by Truckers
 It was not enough to make drivers sell their cars or Democrats leave the party. But it was one more burden to people still waiting for the economic recovery and an irritant to people who had no choice but to pay.
In addition, today was the start of the the Federal oxygenated fuel program, increasing the price of gas a few more cents per gallon in about 40 metropolitan areas, including the New York City region. Oxygenated gas, a cleaner burning fuel, is used to help reduce carbon monoxide levels.
"It's horrible," said Meggos Tesfamarian, an Oakland cab driver filling up at a downtown British Petroleum station, where prices rose five cents to $1.22 today. "We'll have to see how we'll survive. It's kind of a weird time now. Everything is going up. People don't have jobs, don't use taxis."
The biggest protests so far have come from truck drivers, whose industry stands to lose $1.5 billion a year because of the tax, according to the American Trucking Association, an industry trade group.
Some truck drivers have taken out their frustration on the highways. There have been spontaneous slowdowns on the Ohio Turnpike since Tuesday, when a convoy of 18-wheelers slowed to 40 miles an hour on the highway just west of Youngstown.
 
Grumbling at the Pump
 On Thursday night, before the tax took effect, 250 semi-tractor trailers heading west clotted traffic near Toledo, when they drove single file in the righthand lane at 55 m.p.h.
The trucks that highway patrol officers could stop were given citations for impeding traffic. And sometimes when a truck was pulled over other truck drivers would stop, too, to give the trooper a piece of their mind, said Rosemary Hoelscher, radio dispatcher on the Ohio Turnpike.
"We don't condone those actions," said John Collins, senior vice president of government affairs at the American Trucking Association. "But we can understand them."
He said the tax was "really a rifle-shot tax at transportation users, and we think it falls unfairly on the trucking industry."
Ordinary motorists were on their own, left to grumble to cashiers and gas attendants. Some stations had posted signs in their windows for weeks warning motorists of the new tax, but it apparently did little good today.
"We have a lot of screaming customers out there," said Sina Ierome, manager of an Amoco station on Chicago's northwest side, where prices went up a penny a gallon. "One customer said: 'This is ridiculous. Pretty soon I will have to take the bus.' We are telling them, it's the President not us."
To make up the 4.3 cents, most stations added five cents to the price of regular and mid-grade gas and three cents to the price of premium. Some stations facing stiff competition decided to absorb the tax for now, according the Service Station Dealers of America, a trade association and advocacy group. The American Automobile Association said some stations might phase in the tax or wait for the competition to raise pump prices first.
 
Some Pay Willingly
 Many motorists said they could handle the tax, welcome it even, if they could be assured it would go to reduce the deficit. "But we really don't know where the money is going to go, do we?" said Merrill Ringold, a Seattle social worker, as he pumped unleaded gas into his Mercury Grand Marquis.
Some fully accepted the idea and were ready to take their castor oil. "I drive, and I'm a smoker," said Joseph Lombardi, driving his Honda Accord around Boston. "It's a sin tax, and I'm a sinner. I'm sorry they didn't put a tax on alcohol, too."
The American Automobile Association said the tax could be a blow to the travel industry, already struggling after the recession.
But with peak automobile travel over since Labor Day, and retail gasoline prices down by about 10 cents from a year ago to an average of $1.06 a gallon for self-serve regular unleaded last week, this was perhaps the least painful time to impose a gasoline tax, some industry officials said.
Today, there was customer resistance in part because motorists have grown used to lower gasoline prices in recent years. Because of an oversupply and lower demand during the recession, the price of crude oil has been stable or declining in recent months, and this year pump prices have been lower than they were a decade ago, even as taxes have risen.
In 1982, the average gallon of gas cost $1.28, of which 24 cents went to taxes. In 1992, without accounting for inflation, that same gallon of gas cost $1.19 with 35 cents going to taxes, according to the American Petroleum Institute, an advocacy group.
To many motorists, though, all that matters is how much they have to pay. And today they had to pay more. "Some people launched into a tirade," said Bob Randall, who runs a station in Denver. "They just see it as another way for Government to get into their pockets. And they don't think it's going to go for deficit reduction."
At the Gastown Service Station in Garfield Heights, Ohio, motorists loaded up on gasoline until the minute the station closed late Thursday to put off paying the tax. Some waited through exhaust fumes to save eight cents.
"People were getting $2 or $3 of gas even if they were already practically full," said Lynn Sibly, the station manager. "They went into a panic mode. It was a zoo."
 
Remembering the 70's
 But some motorists remembered the fear and gas lines in the 1970's and kept the numbers in perspective. "Four cents is nothing," said Wiston Arguello, a cab driver who was filling up at a service station in Manhattan. "I use premium, and I'm not going to change."
With all the talk of the President's health care plan and the fight over the Federal budget seeming like a bad dream, the gasoline tax sneaked up on some motorists. "I didn't know that it was going up," said Ken Nordine, a 73-year-old Chicagoan at a gas pump. "They don't tell the people anything."
To be sure, the Clinton Administration is probably betting that necessity will be the savior of the new gasoline tax. It has already figured into the calculus people like Betty William of Oakland, who was too busy this morning to care what price she paid.
"All I know is that I have to get to work, and I need the gas," she said.

HEADLINE: Oils Lead Stocks Rally, With Dow Rising 25.99

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Following a weak performance in its previous session, the stock market bounced back yesterday, rallying ahead of a firm bond market that was reacting to a batch of economic reports that confirmed the economy was still on a slow-growth path.
The smaller-than-expected September rise in the index of the National Association of Purchasing Managers, helped lift bond prices, which generally rally on weak economic reports that, traders think, may influence the Fed to keep interest rates low. 
 Robert C. Walberg, equity analyst with MMS International, a Wall Street economic analysis and research firm, said he attributed yesterday's blue-chip performance to cyclicals, which reversed their recent trend of trailing the market.
"Oil stocks paced the advance, spurred by recent increases in oil prices and an announcement by the White House offering energy incentives that will include tax breaks to bolster the natural gas and domestic oil industry in development and exploration," he said.
 
Cyclicals Making Gains
 Among the big cyclicals making gains were Alcoa, Caterpillar, Goodyear and paper stocks, while Intel moved up again on positive comments by Merrill Lynch.
A sharp drop in several health care issues kept the market's most recent leadership, the Nasdaq composite, in check. Shares of health maintainence organizations, or H.M.O.'s, dropped sharply after the New York State Insurance Department's decision to decrease U.S. Healthcare's New York H.M.O. premium rates by an average of 3.9 percent. The company, whose stock fell 4, to 46 3/4, plans to file an action seeking to annul the decision.
Also under pressure were Oxford Health, another publicly traded New York H.M.O., down 3, to 78 3/4; Healthsource, down 2 3/4, to 46 1/4; United Healthcare, down 2 3/4, to 65 7/8, and Coventry down 1 1/4, to 36.
The Dow Jones industrial average surged 25.99 points on the day to 3,581.11, while gaining 38 points for the week. Volume on the Big Board was heavy at 260.4 million shares traded, as gainers outnumbered decliners by 1,102 to 886.
With the onset of a new month and new quarter, money managers seem eager to put cash to work after kicking out at the end of the last quarter, and that also provided the support in the market yesterday.
Autos gained as the result of the agreement between Chrysler and the United Automobile Workers union. Chrysler rose 1, to 49; General Motors, was up 3/4, 42 1/2, and Ford Motor gained 1 1/4, to 56 1/2.
Elsewhere in the market, C. J. Lawrence initiated coverage of wine maker Robert Mondavi with a buy recommendation, as the stock closed up 3/8, to 9 7/8.
Gtech Holdings gained 1, to close at 37. The company says it is part of a consortium formed to bid for operation of a national lottery in Britain.
Hechinger Company, a home-improvement retailer, had its Prudential Securities rating cut to hold from buy, as the stock dropped 2 1/8, to 9.
Stocks affected by lower earnings estimates included Xyplex Inc., which dropped 10, to close at 18 3/4. The data communications equipment maker said it sees earnings per share at 30 cents to 32 cents for the third quarter, below the 41 cents a share consensus.
 
Applied Magnetic Down
 Applied Magnetic fell 2 1/4, to 6 7/8, when it announced expectations of a fourth-quarter operating loss, citing continuing turmoil in disk drive industry.
Shares of Sonat Inc. rose 1 3/8, to 36 3/8, as Mobil Gulf Properties sold an interest in 13 gas producing properties and three associated pipelines in the western Gulf of Mexico to Sonat Exploration for $133.6 million.
In Tokyo yesterday, stocks moved higher on buying spurred by the start of the new fiscal half-year. The Nikkei index of 225 issues gained 177.42 points, or 0.88 percent, to 20,283.13.

NEW YORK CITY
 
TWO APPROACHES TO HOMELESSNESS
 In the four years since they last campaigned to be mayor, David N. Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani have refined their positions on what should be done for the city's impoverished multitudes and now present voters with distinctly different approaches to homelessness and welfare reform. Page 1. 

CRITICS DISMISS STADIUM PLAN
 Opposition to a proposal to build a new stadium for the Yankees on the West Side of Manhattan sprouted yesterday like mushrooms on Miracle-Gro, with community advocates predicting almost endless lawsuits that would delay the project for years, perhaps decades. Page 26.

 SCHOOL CONDITIONS PROTESTED
 Parents of public-school children recounted dismal accounts of dilapidated school buildings at a City Hall rally, one of several recent outpourings of anger by parents who have begun to express broader concerns over the crumbling state of the city's school buildings. Page 26.
 
 POLICE WATCHDOG UNIT CRITICIZED
 As hearings into corruption in the New York City Police Department resumed, two former narcotics officers described the department's watchdog agency as disorganized, incompetent and so ineffectual that honest officers feared reporting their crooked colleagues. Page 27.
 
 GIULIANI CALLS COMMENT A SLUR
 Rudolph W. Giuliani asserted that a prominent black minister's charge that Mr. Giuliani is supported by "fascist elements" seemed intended as an anti-Italian slur and that it may have been part of a coordinated effort by the Dinkins campaign to use supporters to inject race into the campaign. Page 28.
 
 POPULAR DINKINS PROGRAM ATTACKED
 By saying he would eliminate New York City's affirmative-action program for minority contractors, Rudolph W. Giuliani has waged his most direct assault on Mayor Dinkins's economic development policies and targeted a program that has won wide support among black, female and Hispanic voters. Page 28.
 
REGION
 
MORE QUESTIONS IN STRANGLING
 For a second day in Superior Court in Paterson, James P. Wanger was bombarded with tough questions about inconsistencies and gaps in his accounts of where he was and what he did on the day that Robert A. Solimine Jr. was strangled. Mr. Wanger is charged in the slaying of Mr. Solimine. Page 29.
 
 BIAS CHARGES IN TEANECK INCIDENT
 Bias charges have been filed against the man suspected of hiring someone in a gorilla suit who disrupted a Teaneck, N.J., Township Council meeting by presenting the only black member with bananas and a toy monkey. Page 29.
 
 PARKING TICKET VICTORY AND DEFEAT
 Ira J. Raab won't have to pay the $15 parking ticket he received last March when he pulled into a crowded lot and parked in a spot reserved for the police, a judge has ruled. But the decision was a defeat for Mr. Raab, who thought he had found a way to challenge the validity of every parking ticket Nassau County has issued for years. Page 29.

HEADLINE: Hotel Business Is Waking Up

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
After 11 consecutive years of losses totaling more than $33 billion, the United States hotel industry is heading for its first profit since 1981. Occupancy rates are rising almost everywhere, with many hotel chains reporting their best year for a long time.
"Our forecasts indicate that the lodging industry will show a profit of a half-million to $1 billion this year," said Bjorn Hanson, the industry analyst for the accounting firm of Coopers & Lybrand. 
 The 240-hotel Hilton chain, for example, received a record one million calls last month and also booked the most reservations in its history.
 
Optimism for Decade
 Industrywide, the latest available figures show that room occupancy rose to 74.4 percent in July, almost 4 percent above July 1992 and the highest in the seven years that the American Hotel and Motel Association has tracked such figures. Room sales in that period were more than $12 million a day higher than in the similar 1990 period, when the industry lost a record $5.2 billion.
"I think the whole decade is going to be profitable, because as the U.S. economy evolves from manufacturing to service, those types of jobs tend to involve a lot more traveling," said Mark Lomanno, research manager at Smith Travel Research in Gallatin, Tenn., which compiles the occupancy figures for the hotel association.
Atlanta, for example, has experienced a surge in business travel, bringing its hotel use up 9.4 percent this year. Nationwide, Hilton says its business travel increase is 23 percent this year over last.
 
 
Gains in Leisure Travel
 But in some areas, like Phoenix, the industry's resurgence is being led by increased leisure travel. And the Richfield Hotel Management Company, which manages 170 hotels under 23 names in 38 states, finds business travel still in the doldrums but a big surge in leisure travel.
Phoenix occupancy rates are up almost 7 percent this year over last, Denver is up 8.6 percent, Detroit 7.5 and Washington 5.7. New York is up only 2.8 percent, in part, analysts say, because of its 21.25 percent room tax -- the highest in the nation.
Average occupancy levels are expected to hit 64 percent this year, a figure that Mr. Hanson described as the break-even point necessary for hotels to cover fixed costs, and occupancy should rise to 68 percent in 1995, he said. In 1990 it was only 61 percent, and it was 62 percent last year, despite record air travel last summer because of the half-price fares.
The hotel industry's improving fortunes may be a mixed blessing for consumers, who for several years have been waiting until the last minute to make travel plans. Higher occupancy rates are likely to mean no room at the inn for those who neglect to reserve in advance.
Yet the good news for consumers, if not hoteliers, is that room rates are expected to lag behind inflation for at least the next year, meaning bargains should still be readily available. But by 1995, room rates are expected to exceed the rate of inflation.
Many analysts have predicted that the lodging industry will finally turn a slender profit in 1994, or perhaps 1995, as the economy picked up and demand increased, at the same time the supply of excess hotel rooms dwindled. Thousands of the nation's 3.1 million hotel rooms have been taken off the market each year. Mr. Hanson said only about 23,000 new rooms are being added this year, compared with 111,000 in 1988. In addition, 100,000 rooms are changing affiliations, he said, suggesting that they are changing to lower-end brands, which require fewer employees and have lower overhead.
Much overbuilding occurred in the days when many hotels were built as tax shelters, rather than in response to market demand. But the Tax Reform Act of 1986 eliminated most real estate tax shelters, and hotels have since lost a third of their value.
 
 
'Tough Couple of Years'
 "It's been a tough couple of years, but the industry has benefited from the restructuring," said Mack Koonce, senior vice president of sales and marketing for the 50 Wyndham Hotels in the United States, Caribbean and Bermuda. "It has made it leaner and a more profitable business."
Paul Sistare, executive vice president of operations for Richfield, the hotel management company, also said that hard times had made the survivors more competitive than ever. "Hotels have finally recognized that being a hotel means being in business," he said. "In the past, the industry was often driven by ego and operated as a tax break."
The restructuring and the trend since 1988 toward opening limited-service hotels, which now make up 65 percent of the total, are reflected in these statistics cited by Mr. Hanson: The number of employees for each 100 hotel rooms has dropped to 50.5 today from 54 in 1988. That drop, he said, has enabled the break-even occupancy rate to fall to 64 percent from 65.8 percent in 1990.
Nevertheless, while occupancy levels are inseparable from industry health, the biggest spur to profitability has been a series of belt-tightening decisions -- most notably, the restructuring of an estimated $2 billion worth of annual interest payments in the last four years.
In addition, as hotel values have plunged, some 40 percent of hotels have appealed their property taxes. About 80 percent of the appeals were successful, Mr. Hanson said, resulting in reductions of 15 to 20 percent.
Hotels have saved an estimated $500 million a year in management fees, which are down to 5 to 8 percent of total revenues today from a high of 10 to 12 percent a few years ago, though often with incentive clauses tied to cash flow available for debt service. Many occupancy rates have climbed because of new vigor in group meetings and conventions.
"They're helping Atlanta have a great year," said Mark Woodworth, director of the Hospitality Consulting Services Group in Atlanta. "Close to 70 percent of all the upscale hotels here are enjoying the benefits of the return of the group meetings and convention segment. But most Atlanta hotels have shown improvement." Occupancy in Atlanta is up 9.4 this year.
The expansion of the Moscone Center in San Francisco, a convention center, has been a boon to that city's hotel industry. The July occupancy rate was 81 percent. "By year's end, occupancies will wind up flat," said Susan Ernst of Horwath Hospitality, "but that's good news out here, because the trends have been so sour for so long."
San Francisco is the lone bright spot on the West Coast, according to Mr. Lomanno of Smith Travel Research. Los Angeles occupancy is off 1.5 percent; San Diego, 4.5 percent, and Honolulu, 7.7 percent, largely because of weak economies in California and Japan, from which Hawaii draws most of its visitors.
What has especially hurt West Coast hotels, analysts say, is the drop in Japanese and European visitors because of recession, and residual fear from the Los Angeles riots of spring 1992.
 
Improvement in Miami
 But elsewhere, the hotel industry is booming.
Even in Miami, occupancy rates rose 7.6 percent through July, and while the recent rash of tourist murders is likely to deter vacationers, analysts say the city will continue to do well because of the construction workers, insurance adjusters and others who descended on the area in the wake of Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and are still there.
Room rates have lagged behind for several years, bedeviling the industry, and this year rates have increased only 2.3 percent, to $61.29 from $59.91. "But any increase in demand will help push hotels over their break-even number," Ms. Ernst said, "so whether the increase is from higher room rates or more heads in the beds, they all add to profitability if the operators can contain expenses."
Analysts say that assuming there is a gradual economic recovery, rather than the brisk recovery many analysts had thought likely several years ago, the industry will continue to strengthen, at least for several years -- by which time money for hotels should again flow freely, and new hotels and motels will be under construction.

HEADLINE: 43 Nations Promise Palestinians $2 Billion in Aid

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Delegates from 43 nations today promised about $2 billion in aid over the next five years for the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as Saudi Arabia put aside its anger at the Palestinians for supporting Iraq in the Persian Gulf war and pitched in $100 million.
Recognizing that peace is firmer when buttressed by prosperity, the nations promised $600 million in aid for this year alone, and American officials said they were confident that the contributions would ultimately far exceed their $2 billion goal. 
 The delegates, often from countries that have been bitter adversaries for decades, agreed that the economies of the occupied territories were in deplorable shape and needed a quick burst of aid to minimize tensions after the peace accord between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization.
At a conference held at the State Department, Secretary of State Warren Christopher, said: "We must help them demonstrate the tangible benefits of peace, and we must do so quickly if the advocates of peace are to be strengthened and the enemies of peace are to be isolated and discredited."
 
U.S. Pledges $500 Million
 The United States pledged $500 million over five years, three-quarters in grants and one-quarter in loans and loan guarantees from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. Israel pledged a grant of $25 million and a loan of $50 million.
"This is really an important moment because it continues the momentum of peace that was created in this signing ceremony at the White House on the 13th of September," said Nabil Shaath, chief political adviser to the P.L.O.'s chairman, Yasir Arafat. "It's a commitment from the international community to support that peace process and to turn it from a starting point into a full, just, lasting and comprehensive peace."
[Mr. Arafat, speaking from Tunis, told Britain's Independent Television News: "At least, we are in need of five billion dollars," Reuters reported.]
But Arab delegates rebuffed an American plea to abandon their boycott of Israel, which Vice President Al Gore said had "no place in a world seeking peace."
Yasir Abed Rabbo, a member of the P.L.O.'s executive committee, said the boycott should remain until Arab nations recognize Israel and numerous disputes are settled, including the competing claims of Israel and the Palestinians over East Jerusalem.
Before today's five-hour conference, Saudi Arabia had left the Palestinians -- and the United States and Russia, which sponsored the conference -- guessing as to whether it would bury its anger at the P.L.O. and enlist in the international aid effort. Several officials at the meeting said Saudi Arabia promised $100 million over the first year and indicated similar amounts could be expected in subsequent years.
The European Community pledged $600 million over five years, and Japan $200 million over two years, and the Nordic countries $150 million over an unspecified period. "This is an incredible response that you've seen in such a short period of time," said Treasury Secretary Lloyd M. Bentsen. "I'm confident that we will exceed the $2.4 billion that the World Bank estimates to be the needs over five years."
The World Bank estimates that the Palestinians need $400 million this year and $475 million in each of the subsequent four years. According to the bank, these sums are needed to finance a civil administration, pay back salaries for teachers, pay police salaries, and finance investments in basic services like schools, hospitals and sewers.
Officials at the conference are eager for the aid to make a quick, visible difference, partly to defuse radicals who are seeking to undermine the P.L.O. and derail the peace agreement.
Lewis T. Preston, the World Bank's president, painted a dismal picture of the Palestinian economy today. "Incomes have stagnated for a decade, and living conditions are appalling, especially in Gaza," he said. "Unemployment is high -- and increasing."
Mr. Gore gave the opening address to the conference, where Israeli officials sat alongside delegates from Arab nations that refuse to recognize Israel. Like many officials at the session, he said the Palestinians ultimately had to rely on private investment, not foreign aid, to achieve long-term prosperity.

HEADLINE: Beliefs

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels

 BODY:
When Laurence O'Connnell was told one day last February that the White House was calling, he thought it was a practical joke.
If Dr. O'Connell had been a medical economist, he might not have been surprised. But instead he is a medical ethicist, president of the Park Ridge Center, a Chicago institute that studies the intersection of health care and religious beliefs. And the call, he says now, "came out of the blue." 
 That was also the case for most of the 30 other people working in the field of medical ethics who were invited to join the 500 or so experts that President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, put to work this year forging a plan to overhaul the nation's health care system.
Highlighting ethical issues and submitting them to careful moral analysis are activities that mix uncomfortably with the rhetoric and roughhouse of politics. Medical ethicists drawn into the world of lawmakers often complain that their work becomes fodder or window dressing for political agendas.
Now, as health care finally takes center stage in American politics, a lot of the ethicists who tore up their normal lives and moved or commuted to Washington for two months of mind-wearying discussions are asking what they accomplished.
Conversations with about a third of them draw out stories of deplorable working conditions, heated debates, intellectual frustration and even financial loss (they covered their own travel and living expenses). But almost all say they would do it again.
As one of the last working groups to be appointed, the ethicists found themselves without a permanent meeting room of their own, and their sessions became a kind of floating crap game in the Old Executive Office Building.
"There was a particularly lovely stairwell we found very comfortable," said Nancy Neveloff Dubler, a lawyer and professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx who directs the division of bioethics at Montefiore Medical Center. She was not exaggerating.
The group was assigned neither telephones nor computers. "She who had a laptop got to write the draft or make the revisions," said Carol Levine, only a bit whimsically. Ms. Levine heads the Orphan Project at the Fund for the City of New York, a research project on the effects of AIDS on surviving children.
The working group's only explicit mandate was to write a preamble for eventual legislation that would spell out the values motivating the proposed changes in the health care system, linking them to the nation's moral and religious traditions.
The ethicists were divided about the wisdom of the mandate, and eventually about its execution. As director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University of Minnesota, Arthur Caplan drew a lesson from that state's success in passing a significant health care measure, as well as from the experience of Britain and Canada.
The lesson was that only a strong, clear consensus on guiding principles, like universality of coverage, would keep the effort on track. "First, argue values, then debate the mechanics," Dr. Caplan said.
The President took this approach in his Sept. 22 speech before Congress, and some members of the ethics working group saw their efforts reflected in his language.
The ethicists put tremendous energy into writing the preamble. There were sharp disagreements, too, not so much about its substance as about whether it should be an easily accessible, inspiring statement or a carefully argued set of principles.
"Some wanted it to sing opera, and some wanted atonal music," said Ronald Bayer, who teaches public health at Columbia University. He was among those who doubted whether preamble-writing was the best use of the ethicists' skills. "I can't believe they needed us to write the speeches," he said.
A preamble, or "values framework," Dr. O'Connell said in response, would become the standard by which any new system could be evaluated and held accountable.
The ethicists soon took up other tasks as well, often at the request of other working groups. Some analyzed privacy problems linked to the proposed issuing of a national health security card. Some worked on ethical issues related to malpractice claims or to organ transplants. The group produced more than two dozen position papers on such topics.
Most frustrating was the Administration's clear signal that it did not want the ethicists discussing guidelines for medical rationing. Most of them doubt the Administration's conviction that removing inefficiencies will make limits on services unnecessary. They want the grounds for those limits openly examined.
None of the ethicists sound totally confident about their impact in Washington. Professor Bayer calls it "very modest." Yet most of them describe the experience, for all its travails, as one of the most intense and exciting of their professional lives.
Many also express admiration for the moral passion and ethical sensitivity that they encountered throughout the Administration's choice of health care experts.
Paradoxically, that fact could support the argument that medical ethics made its real contribution to health care changes not by joining the Clinton effort in 1993, but by more than a decade of drawing attention to the inequities and irrationalities in the health care system.

HEADLINE: Giuliani's Affirmative-Action Plan Steps Up Policy Fight

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
By saying he would eliminate New York City's affirmative action program for minority contractors, Rudolph W. Giuliani has waged his most direct assault on Mayor David N. Dinkins's economic development policies and targeted a program that has won wide support among black, female and Hispanic voters.
Mr. Giuliani, who is campaigning on a platform of cutting city spending and taxes, has also underscored a personal philosophy that precludes the use of economic incentives to promote social advancement at the expense of government efficiency and free-market competition. 
 "What this program says to minority contractors is that they don't have to be efficient, and City Hall will absorb the extra cost," said Stephen Kagan, the chief economic adviser to Mr. Giuliani, who has proposed the creation of more community development banks in the poorest sections of the city as an alternative means of aiding minorities.
Few economic incentives have been advocated more vigorously by the Dinkins administration than the affirmative-action contracting program. Started a year ago, it directs city agencies to award 20 percent of the city's $3 billion in contracts for goods and services to companies with Asian, black, female or Hispanic owners, even when their bids are as much as 10 percent higher than those of other companies.
 
A Supreme Court Ruling
 The program was established after the United States Supreme Court ruled in 1989 that cities and states -- many of which already had affirmative-action contracting programs -- could not retain them unless they showed that there had been discrimination against minorities and women.
To protect itself from legal challenges, the city commissioned a study in 1990, which found that 25 percent of the companies bidding for contracts in 1989 had been owned by women or minorities, but only 8 percent of the public money went to those firms.
"This is going to be a big negative for the Giuliani campaign," said Mariel Serafin, president of the New York National Bank, a minority-owned commercial bank in the South Bronx that serves a largely black and Hispanic clientele. He added that Mr. Giuliani's comments might hurt his campaign the most among Hispanic voters, whom he has courted.
"Mr. Giuliani has put his foot in it," said Diane Welsh, president of the New York City chapter of the National Organization for Women. "This program is about pulling the city together, and I am dismayed that he would dismantle it."
Mayor Dinkins remains firmly committed to the program, which he first advocated in his 1989 campaign.
"We are not only surprised but offended" by Mr. Giuliani's criticism of the program, said Wallace L. Ford 2d, the Commissioner of the city's Department of Business Services, which determines what firms qualify. Other officials said the number of firms that have been awarded the affirmative action contracts, and the amount of money the contracts are worth, has not been tabulated.
Mr. Giuliani said he would support, as an alternative, an investment from the city's pension funds in what he said might be a growing number of the small community development banks in poor neighborhoods.
Such banks, sometimes organized as credit unions, have been advocated by President Clinton as a way to provide small-business loans and mortgage lending in depressed areas.
Under Mr. Giuliani's plan, city pension fund money would be made available even if Congress fails to provide Federal money, said Richard Bryer, a Giuliani spokesman.
Response to the proposal was mixed, even among some of the staunchest supporters of the community-development lending banks.
Clifford N. Rosenthal, executive director of the National Federation of Community Development Credit Unions, based in Manhattan, said his group, which assists community development lenders in several cities, would welcome pension fund investments. But he added that there are "technical problems to overcome."

HEADLINE: Indicators Post Broad Gain of 1%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
In another sign of a possible quickening of the economic recovery, the Government said today that its main forecasting index posted a broad 1 percent advance in August, its biggest rise of the year.
The manufacturing sector appears less robust, however, with two other reports showing relatively little improvement. 
 Despite the unevenness, various analysts said that when combined with other figures over the week, today's results seemed to point to some strengthening in what has been subpar expansion. Housing starts, incomes, help-wanted advertising and even consumer confidence have moved up lately while first-time claims for unemployment insurance have eased.
 
Toward 'Better Growth'
 "It's all pointing in the direction of better growth," said Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist at the Midland Bank in New York.
The jump in the index of leading indicators, which is assembled by the Commerce Department and is meant to forecast the direction of the economy, was not only the biggest since a 1.7 percent surge in December, but it was also the broadest advance in six and a half years.
And since what had initially been reported as a one-tenth of 1 percent decline for July was revised today into a one-tenth of 1 percent increase, there have now been three straight advances. The index also rose one-tenth of a percent in June. Previously there had been seven straight months in which the index had reversed direction from the preceding month.
Ten of the 11 components of the index contributed to the August rise, while only the money supply, which many economists think has become irrelevant as an economic indicator, declined.
Today's second report, from the National Association of Purchasing Management, showed its chief index edged up to 49.7 percent in September from 49.3 percent in August, a bit less than expected.
This was the fourth straight month the index has been below 50 percent, the point that divides an expanding factory sector from a contracting one. Yet as long as the purchasing managers index remains above 44.5 percent -- and it has averaged 51.7 percent during the first three quarters of 1993 -- this indicates an expansion of the economy at large.
 
Factory Orders Climb
 Anticipated growth in new orders failed to appear in September, resulting in a working off of backlogs, said Robert J. Bretz, head of the trade group's survey committee. "However, there was some sign of life in employment and encouragement that prices were decreasing," he added.
In still another report, the Commerce Department found that new orders for factory goods climbed nine-tenths of 1 percent, or $2.2 billion, in August. This was the second increase in the last three months but was not enough to offset July's sharp, 1.9 percent decline.
"We believe the economy is growing, but slowly or moderately," said Edward Guay of the Cigna Corporation, predicting continued drag from higher taxes and uncertainty over health care.
Unfilled orders for factory goods slipped six-tenths of 1 percent in August, the 21st decline in 24 months. The level of unfilled orders is now at the lowest point since July 1988 and the orders-to-shipments ratio is at the lowest level in 15 years.
Shipments, meanwhile, rose 1.5 percent, partly offsetting a 2.6 percent July skid.
The three biggest contributors to the rise in the leading index were higher building permits, lower claims for jobless benefits and higher contracts and orders for new plant and equipment. Lesser factors were a rise in companies reporting slower deliveries from suppliers, higher stock prices, a longer workweek, rising backlogs of orders for durable factory goods, greater consumer optimism, new orders for consumer goods and higher prices for materials particularly sensitive to the business cycle.
 
Lagging Indicators Rise
 A companion index that usually moves at the same time as the economy rose seven-tenths of 1 percent in August while the department's index of lagging indicators moved up two-tenths of 1 percent, the report also showed.
Safian Investment Research, a White Plains firm, reported that its composite index of the real, or nonfinancial, economy gained eight-tenths of 1 percent in August after two flat readings. "It seems we're ready for another step up," said Kenneth Safian of the economy's prospects.
Another private forecasting gauge, one created by David B. Bostian Jr. of Herzog Heine Geduld in New York, rose only to 199 in August from 197. Mr. Bostian said growth would continue "subnormal" as tax increases more than offset the benefit of low interest rates.

Lufthansa And United Deal Is Set

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
Culminating a lengthy courtship, United Airlines and Lufthansa will announce on Monday that they are joining forces as marketing partners.
The latest in a long line of airlines to pair off, the two carriers will end months of guessing about which of America's two largest carriers -- United or American Airlines -- Lufthansa would pick. 
 Although the terms of their deal could change before Monday, the plan is for passengers of either carrier to share in the other's frequent-flier program and use either's airport lounges, according to people familiar with the accord's details.

 More important, however, the two airlines will also "code share," a term to describe how United would use Lufthansa for the German leg of a trans-Atlantic trip, while Lufthansa would use United for the American leg. By coordinating flights, passengers would receive one flight number for the entire trip, easing travel. Code sharing also gives carriers a competitive advantage on reservation systems, because their flights are the first choice listed on trips that previously required connections with one or more flight numbers.
A decision by Lufthansa was expected, particularly after negotiators for the United States and German Governments settled their disputes last week over an aviation policy that dictated the frequency of flights between the two countries.
That bilateral agreement created provisions for code sharing, rising from 140 flights a week in the first year to 350 a week in the third year.
The United-Lufthansa accord, which is subject to Government approval, adds to the long roster of alliances between United States and foreign airlines seeking to guarantee themselves a percentage of passengers on established routes closed to them by law or on routes that they can enter only at enormous expense. Other partnerships, but with large investments by foreign carriers into United States airlines, include British Airways and USAir, and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Northwest Airlines.
United's stock rose $2.625 a share, to $139.875, yesterday. But industry analysts said that with the sluggish economy in Germany and Europe, the partnership would probably not yield a noteworthy increase in business for the two carriers until late next year. Because the two carriers are not investing money in each other beyond the costs of establishing the partnership, the risk appears minimal. Continental Airlines and Air France have a marketing agreement but no investment or code sharing.
 
 
'Not Much Left'
 Analysts also said the pending announcement left American Airlines with few candidates with which to form a similar alliance. "American is kind of looking for a bouquet, but there's not much left out there that would benefit them," John Stodden, an airline analyst at Duff & Phelps, said.
United and Lufthansa expect to begin code sharing on Jan. 10. Their partnership will present a new competitive threat to Delta Air Lines, which has a large but unprofitable hub in Frankfurt.
United is also expected to announce shortly that NBC News and NBC-TV will begin producing customized news, sports and entertainment programming to be shown on United flights.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Down in Busy Day; Gold Closes Mixed in U.S.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell in active trading yesterday with the selling propelled by concerns about the political standoff in Russia and weakness in the domestic manufacturing businesses.
Gold prices closed narrowly mixed in New York trading after falling in Europe. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery closed at $355.00 a troy ounce, down 10 cents from Thursday's closing quote of $355.10. 
 Traders said a closely watched report on national business activity contributed to the dollar's demise. The National Association of Purchasing Management said its September index of economic activity was 49.7 percent, which is up slightly from August but still below 50 percent, a sign that the manufacturing sector is declining.
"A lot of people were focused on the U.S. data," said Curtis Perkins, currency trader for the Chemical Banking Corporation.
Mr. Perkins said many traders sold dollars to readjust their trading positions ahead of the weekend. Conclusion of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings in Washington and signs that President Boris N. Yeltsin may be diffusing a political crisis with the Russian Parliament reduced demand for the dollar, he said.
The dollar has gained as investors sought a safe haven for their investments during the tense 11-day standoff in Russia.
Also hurting the dollar were signs that Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, may not cut interest rates for at least another month, said Earl Johnson, vice president at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank.
In New York, the dollar closed at 1.6315 German marks, down from 1.6329. In Europe, the dollar fell to 1.6308 German marks, from 1.6350 late Thursday.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 106.38 yen, up 1.28 yen from Thursday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted lower at 106.05 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 105.90 yen, down from 106.30 yen late Thursday.
In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.5050, up from $1.4955 late Thursday. In New York, the pound closed at $1.5050, more expensive than $1.4968 late Thursday.
Other dollar rates at 4 P.M., compared with late Thursday, were: 1.4240 Swiss francs, down from 1.4251; 5.6930 French francs, down from 5.6943; 1,593.00 Italian lire, down from 1,592.00, and 1.3379 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3338.

HEADLINE: Chrysler Settles on a Tentative Labor Pact

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 1

 BODY:
The United Automobile Workers union and the Chrysler Corporation reached a tentative agreement on a three-year labor contract shortly before dawn today.
The pact, which mimics an agreement reached by the Ford Motor Company last week, sets up the union's final round of bargaining, scheduled with the General Motors Corporation next week. 
 Thomas Gallagher, Chrysler's vice president of employee relations, said that with the agreement the auto maker had achieved "a basis for producing world-class vehicles and a basis for discussion of ongoing issues."
Spokesmen from the union, who declined to speak for attribution, acknowledged that the contract approximated terms reached last week with Ford. In that agreement, workers won higher wages and pension benefits, maintained health coverage fully paid by the company and had more company money set aside to pay laid-off workers. But Ford won lower wages for starting workers and longer periods before those workers reach the top of the pay scale.
The Chrysler agreement was reached after the expiration of a strike deadline of 11:59 P.M. Thursday. Last-minute wrangling over the union's insistence on timely notification by Chrysler of any plan to buy parts from nonunion subcontractors caused a short walkout by 6,000 hourly workers at seven Chrysler factories across the nation.
Karen Stewart, a Chrysler spokeswoman, said the walkout cost the company lost production of about 500 vehicles. Work at the affected plants resumed this morning, she said.
Given the average wholesale price of a vehicle, the walkout could mean $5 million to $10 million in lost revenue. But the auto maker said it would try to make up the lost production.
The union is seeking as much notice as possible about plans to buy outside parts. The U.A.W. believes that if it given enough notice it can come up with ways to make outside production unnecessary, like adjusting work rules. Chrysler, seeking lower costs, wants the flexibility to hire new suppliers without having to consult the union. Chrysler makes only 30 percent of its parts, the least of the Big Three. It was not immediately clear whether Chrysler conceded the point or a compromise was reached.
Chrysler union locals must now vote on the contract, probably by early next week. Afterward, negotiations will begin at G.M., the largest auto maker and perhaps the most needful of cost savings among the Big Three.
G.M., which has thousands of workers on long-term layoff, has said it cannot afford extensive job security benefits, which cost it $3.5 billion to $4 billion in the last three years.
Ford and Chrysler have apparently agreed to job security benefits, though it is not clear whether these would apply to G.M. in the same way they did in the last three years.
The opinion that G.M. may have no choice but to accept the union's terms -- reinforced by its tentative settlement with Canadian workers on Wednesday -- was cited as a possible reason for a 10 percent slide in the value of G.M. shares on Wednesday and Thursday.
Gerald Knechtel, G.M.'s chief negotiator, warned of "important differences in underlying economics" between the two G.M. work forces.
The stock recovered some of its value today, however, gaining 75 cents, to $42.50; Chrysler gained $1, to $49, and Ford gained $1.25, to $56.50.

HEADLINE: New Issues Were at Record Pace in Third Quarter

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Corporations issued new stocks and bonds at a record pace in the third quarter, producing more than $2.2 billion in fees for securities firms that are in the midst of their third consecutive year of record profits.
After three years of rising stock prices and falling interest rates, the financial markets are as hospitable as many corporate treasurers have ever seen. Increasingly, American investors' strong demand is attracting foreign borrowers. Italy, for example, sold about 30 percent of its $5.5 billion global bond offering to Americans earlier this month, and YPF Sociedad, the Argentine oil company, had a $3 billion stock offering in late July that was bought largely by investors in America and Europe. 
 "The usual seasonal slowdown in late July and August was not much of an issue this year," Samuel Liss, a brokerage industry analyst at Salomon Brothers, said. The heavy financing volume and increased trading indicated that third-quarter profits for securities dealers would be well above last year's, and probably slightly better than the records set in the second quarter of this year, Mr. Liss said.
 
 
Same Firms
 The new business has largely been handled by the same firms that have long dominated Wall Street. Merrill Lynch; Goldman, Sachs, and Lehman Brothers ranked first, second and third, respectively, in corporate stocks and bonds -- the same as a year earlier. Kidder, Peabody remained the leader by a wide margin in handling new issues of mortgage-backed securities, while Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette was the leading underwriter of junk bonds by a narrow margin, up from an eighth-place ranking a year earlier.
In the stock market, according to Securities Data Company, new corporate share offerings continued at a near record pace, although the third- quarter total of $20.6 billion was down slightly from $21.3 billion in the second quarter. Through the first nine months of the year, share offerings, including new issues of closed-end mutual funds, totaled $59.2 billion, up 29 percent from a year earlier, while the number of stock offerings rose to 931 from 760.
Among 171 companies making their debut in the public stock market last quarter, new issues totaled $9.4 billion, down from $10.9 billion in the second quarter, when 153 companies came to market. Through the first nine months of this year, however, initial public offerings totaled $27.6 billion, up 43 percent from the 1992 period.
In the bond market, issuance of all kinds of securities was at or near record levels, with $252.9 billion of securities sold in the quarter, up 19 percent from a year earlier.
 Although new corporate bond issues totaled a record $346.1 billion in the first nine months, investment bankers noted that many companies have still not taken full advantage of bond interest rates, which are the lowest in more than 20 years. Many strong potential issuers are on the sidelines, happily borrowing in the commercial paper market or from banks at less than 3.5 percent, rather than selling new bonds at rates of 5.25 percent to 7.25 percent, depending on maturity and the company's rating.
With many economists predicting continued low inflation and low interest rates, "a lot of people are very comfortable and think they can delay their bond financings with impunity," the head of bond underwriting for a big Wall Street firm said.
Investment bankers noted that some industrial companies were not refinancing their old bonds because the terms of the old, high-interest issues would require a company to incur a one-time charge against its earnings. That is less of a problem for electric and gas utilities, whose regulators allow them to include that cost as part of the new issue.
There is a strong herd instinct in the corporate bond market, where one financing pattern will quickly be imitated by many companies. Securities dealers are now waiting to see if more companies will follow the GTE Corporation, which recently announced plans to refinance $2.1 billion of existing bonds even though it means a $90 million charge for the third quarter. The company expects eventually to save $250 million by selling bonds with lower interest rates.
 
 
Yankee Bonds
 While some some American companies are waiting, more foreign borrowers are coming to the American market. Yankee bonds -- those offered in the American market by foreign governments or companies -- totaled $48.2 billion in the first nine months, up 52 percent from a year earlier. Stock offerings by foreign companies also increased, with a record $3.1 billion sold in the third quarter. The total for the first nine months was $6.9 billion, 47 percent greater than the 1992 period.
Bradley Jack, head of bond underwriting at Lehman Brothers, said foreign issuers are finding "that in the American market their securities get placed with real institutional investors, as opposed to the Eurobond market, which is more retail."
Jessica A. Palmer, a managing director at Salomon Brothers, said that many foreign companies were attracted to the American market because American investors' experience with junk bonds had made them more accustomed to evaluating risk, and American investors were not so enamored of well-known corporate names as investors in foreign markets.

HEADLINE: Japanese Starting to Link Pay To Performance, Not Tenure

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 1

 BODY:
In Japanese festivals, dozens of people together hoist a heavy portable shrine, known as a mikoshi, and chant as they carry it through the streets. Since it is impossible to tell who is actually doing the lifting, it is only natural that some shrine carriers shirk off, shifting more weight onto others.
Japanese companies, too, have what is called "mikoshi management." People work as a group and the achievers often carry the laggards along. Salary depends much more on how long one has worked for the company than on how much one contributes to it. 
 Now, however, Japanese companies are departing from the seniority-based pay system and introducing merit pay, in which those who perform better are paid more and promoted faster. The idea is both to save on labor costs and to promote individual accountability.
 
 
Setting Specific Goals
 It is a drastic change for corporate Japan, where job responsibilities are usually defined vaguely and management is by consensus. Now managers at companies like Honda, Fujitsu and Fujisawa Pharmaceutical are having to write specific goals for the coming year and are being held accountable for how well they meet them.
At Honda, merit pay now affects 4,500 managers, about 10 percent of its Japanese work force. Starting last December, bonuses, which can account for 40 percent of annual salary, were linked to performance, with the difference between the best and the worst performers being about 1 million yen, or $10,000.
"Japanese employees have never been faced with their own performance in such a direct way," said Shigeru Tanaka, general manager for Japan of Hay Management Consultants, a Washington-based consulting firm that develops corporate compensation plans.
Merit pay is only one of the changes sweeping Japan as a result of a severe economic slump. While Japanese companies are known for factory-floor efficiency, they are realizing that their white-collar work forces are too big and inefficient.
The annual raise, also something of a tradition, is under attack as well. Some executives are saying that unions should accept a wage reduction when contracts are negotiated next spring.
And Japan's most famous labor institution, lifetime employment, is also fraying. Companies are finding it hard to continue to keep "window-sitters," people who are given no useful work to do but collect a salary anyway. More people are being asked to retire early, and some analysts expect that if the current slump continues large companies will announce sweeping layoffs, as in the United States.
"These unique Japanese systems were a plus during the era of high economic growth," said Toru Katsurada, a director and head of personnel for Fujitsu Ltd., Japan's largest computer company. "But now we are going into an era where we can't expect growth anymore."
If merit pay catches on, some executives say, it could allow companies to better use their high achievers, who now have to wait in line for promotions and raises behind older but less capable people. At some companies, inefficient workers actually take home more pay than efficient ones because they have to put in more overtime to finish their tasks.
 
 
Concern About Cohesion
 But others warn that merit pay could ruin group harmony. And it could lead to more short-term thinking -- something Japanese executives have long criticized American companies for -- as managers shift their attention from long-term planning to meeting next year's targets.
In Japanese companies, new recruits enter directly out of high school or college. Each member of the class tends to start at roughly the same salary, now about $33,000 a year, including bonuses, for male college graduates, and advance up the scale together. By age 55, their salaries are roughly three times what they started with. Salary is so closely tied to seniority that securities analysts can get a good idea of a company's labor costs just by looking at the average age of its employees.
Promotions are also geared to seniority, although there is some latitude for high achievers to rise faster. At Fujitsu, for instance, there are cases in which younger people are in charge of older people. But the older subordinates still get paid more than their younger boss, in line with the seniority system.
The seniority system works best in the system of lifetime employment. Young workers tend to receive lower salaries than their abilities would dictate. But they make it up later in their careers, when salaries rise to help them cope with family expenses, even if they are no longer working at their peak.
Now, with fewer young people entering the work force because of Japan's low birth rate, companies are finding their overall work forces are aging.
"If we keep the seniority system, the weight of wages in our cost will become larger and larger," said Koichi Sejima, director of human resources development for the Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Company.
Still, traditions in Japan die hard and the movement toward merit pay is gradual. A survey of 500 companies by the Japan Federation of Employers' Associations found that 14.6 percent of such companies had merit pay systems in 1992, up from 10.4 percent a year earlier. Most companies that are trying the system are limiting it, for now at least, to top managers.
One of Japan's largest manufacturers this year started a merit pay system for workers at the general manager's level and above, one official at the company said. Next year's pay for these managers will be 80 to 120 percent of this year's, depending on performance. But the company is keeping it a secret because it does not want to alarm younger workers.
There has also been some resistance from older workers, who say they put up with lower salaries when they were young and expect their payoff now. Unions have also expressed concern about the fairness of the evaluations.
"We think salaries have to be at a level to support one's family, which cannot vary drastically among individuals," said Hideaki Narikawa, deputy head of the labor policy bureau of the Japanese Trade Union Confederation. He also said unions were concerned that salary reductions under a merit-pay system would be used to harass employees, forcing them to quit.
So far, however, it has been difficult for companies to actually cut salaries, since this would be a crushing blow to an employee. The result has been that for companies introducing merit pay, labor costs actually go up, not down, because they pay more to good performers without penalizing bad ones.
"It is a Japanese characteristic that people do not tell others that they have low ability," Mr. Katsurada of Fujitsu said. "The tendency is that everyone should be at the center of the scale. There would be some A's, but mostly B's and C's, and very rarely a D or E. Japanese people cannot take a D or an E."
He said Fujitsu viewed its new merit pay system not as a way to reduce labor costs, but as a means of improving productivity.
Even between the A's and the D's there is not a great salary difference. Japanese companies are still far from the situation that might be found, say, on Wall Street, where a 30-year-old might make millions of dollars after developing a sophisticated computerized trading program for his company.
Fujisawa Pharmaceutical started its system in 1990 and applies it only to its 130 department heads. Salary is based on three evaluations: rank; expectation, a somewhat vague concept having to do with responsibilities, and achievement.
For two managers of the same rank and expectation, the one who gets a top grade in achievement (S, for "super") will earn about $20,000 more than one who gets the lowest grade, a C.
 
 
Rating the Boss
 To try to preserve group harmony, one criterion for evaluation is often how well a person works with others. NOF, a chemical company, seeks the opinions of a manager's subordinates as well as those of his boss. Five underlings of each department head are asked to rate their boss anonymously on questions like whether he keeps his temper and whether he scolds subordinates when necessary.
Merit pay could unleash a bigger change in the Japanese work force -- encouraging workers to move from one company to another.
The seniority system rewards people for staying with one company and limits a company's ability to offer special incentives to snatch an employee from another company. The exception has been foreign companies, which often offer higher pay and greater rank or responsibilities to recruit employees of Japanese companies who are frustrated with their low pay and slow advancement under the seniority system.
But merit pay in a sense begins to put a market value on mid-career employees. If a worker bargains with his own company, why not with others?

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REVIEW: TAXES;
Watch for Distributions As Year Winds Down

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
NOVICE mutual fund investors can slide into tax traps, particularly in the fourth quarter. But with a modicum of knowledge about how funds work, they can play the tax laws to their own advantage.
Funds distribute three kinds of income to shareholders: capital gains the fund has received selling securities in its portfolio, dividends paid by securities it holds and interest earned on bonds or similar holdings. An investor who sells fund shares at a profit also earns capital gains directly. 
 Conversely, an investor who sells fund shares at a loss will have a capital loss. But if the fund itself incurs a capital loss in selling securities, it cannot by law distribute that loss to shareholders. It must carry the loss forward to offset future capital gains.
Once a mutual fund distributes capital gains and dividends -- most funds do so late in the year -- its net asset value, which is the price at which it trades, drops by the amount distributed.
This simple fact is at the heart of tax planning for fund investors. Say a stock fund's net asset value is $20 a share. It distributes capital gains of $1.50 a share and dividends of 50 cents a share, both of which are taxable, and its net asset value immediately drops to $18 a share.
"Someone who buys into a fund just before a distribution can get hit with a big tax bite without any economic benefit," said Joel S. Isaacson, president of his own financial and tax management firm, Joel Isaacson & Company, New York. Consequently, he advises calling a fund and checking on the distribution date before buying shares.
Mr. Isaacson also recommends that shareholders check with theirfunds in October or November to find out what the outlook is for capital gains distributions. If a distribution is coming, they may want to take an offsetting loss before the end of the year on any stocks or fund shares that are lagging, he said.
"A lot of funds sold growth stocks this year -- Philip Morris, Wal-Mart, drug companies -- in which they had a very low basis, so there will be significant capital gains," Mr. Isaacson said. "A lot of novice investors have gone into funds this year," he added, and they may be surprised to get a Form 1099 in January reporting a significant capital gains distribution even though their fund's net asset value has changed little. The distribution is taxable, of course, even if it is automatically reinvested in fund shares, unless an investor has offsetting losses.
Tax-free bond funds may also have taxable capital gains distributions if they have traded bonds profitably. Only the interest on the municipal bonds they hold is tax-free.
Steven E. Norwitz, vice president of T. Rowe Price, the Baltimore-based fund manager, said his firm, like several other large fund managers, now provides shareholders with an October advisory on the outlook for capital gains distributions. It also provides taxpayers with calculations on their average cost for use at tax time, a real time-saver for people who have failed to keep records.
Taxpayers are allowed to report share sales using several methods, including average cost; first in, first out, and specific shares. For the third method investors need careful records of each fund purchase, including shares bought through reinvested dividends and capital gains. Vincent D. Vaccaro, the partner in charge of personal financial planning for the New York office of Coopers & Lybrand, said that "specific identification gives you the best ability to pick and choose a gain or loss." He also observed that funds' annual distributions offered upper-income taxpayers "a technique of converting ordinary income into capital gains."
Buy right after the dividend distribution date, he said, "and ride up, then sell right before." "Of course, there is market risk, but it is attractive for an upper-income taxpayer," he added, because the top rate on ordinary income is 39.6 percent, while that on capital gains is 28 percent. A no-load growth or aggressive growth fund would be appropriate.
Sam Freedman, chairman of Oppenheimer Shareholder Services, said that because of the higher tax rates, upper-income investors were moving into growth stock funds to get as much income as possible from capital gains, and in the bond area were turning to municipal bond funds. But Social Security recipients need to be careful, he said, because even tax-exempt income is included in determining whether Social Security is taxable.

HEADLINE: The Real Costs of Mideast Peace

 BODY:
After a rousing sermon, the astute preacher passes the plate. So, after the historic Rabin-Arafat handshake, the Clinton Administration yesterday raised more than $2 billion in pledges of international aid for Palestinians, including an unexpected $100 million offer from Saudi Arabia.
That's a splendid start. But open borders and freer trade are what will truly make the West Bank bloom. On that score, Israel's Arab neighbors still seem unwilling to take the smallest risk for peace. 
 In talks at the United Nations, Secretary of State Christopher was rebuffed when he urged Arab states to end their 45-year economic boycott of Israel. All Arab states are supposed to boycott any company doing business with Israel, though the stricture is often circumvented. Even so, Israel loses around $1 billion a year.
Israel long ago learned to work around the boycott; it has nurtured a high-tech economy with a vibrant growth rate. Fortified by Russian immigrants, the Israeli work force has an excess of doctors and engineers in a region where such skills are sorely needed.
So whom does the boycott most punish? The moderate Arab states that persist in maintaining it deny their own people jobs and trade, and deepen the despair that breeds pro-Iranian zealots.
The West Bank urgently needs schools, roads, hospitals. Nearly a million people are crammed into the impoverished Gaza Strip, where only the population seems to grow. The World Bank estimates that annual aid of $400 to $500 million is essential to show quick benefits from peace.
On paper at least, yesterday's pledging party has reached that target. In addition to Saudi Arabia's generous offer, the European Community promises $600 million over five years, Japan pledges $200 million over two years, and the Nordic countries have earmarked $150 million in several years.
The U.S. pledge of $500 million in five years was achieved by juggling grants and loans, shuffling programs and assuming that Congress will concur. Yet close legislative scrutiny is needed. Americans have already provided a disproportionate share of the aid flowing to Israel and Egypt after the Camp David accord; this mustn't become a habit. And Congress must make sure the aid reaches West Bank Palestinians, not the P.L.O.'s bureaucrats.
In a glowing moment, an elected Government of Israel has offered a $75 million down payment to help a Palestinian people whose very existence was once denied by Israeli leaders. When will other Persian Gulf states follow the Saudi lead in offering aid? And when will all Arab states end a pointless and self-punishing boycott?

HEADLINE: A Legislative Infant, Needing Care

 BODY:
Two years ago Congress established a modest but imaginative program to underwrite the overseas study of critical non-Western languages like Arabic, Chinese and Japanese. It would plug a huge hole in America's education system.
Some Congressmen voted for the bill in the belief that America's intelligence failures over the years had been caused partly by the shortage of people qualified in non-traditional languages and area studies. Others, looking to the future, hoped the program would sharpen America's skills in a competitive global economy. 
 The bill, the National Security Education Act, authorized a $150 million trust fund from which $24 million would be drawn the first year and distributed in three parts: as scholarships to undergraduates; as fellowships to graduate students, repayable with a year of teaching or government service, and as grants to universities and other institutions for foreign language and area studies.
The legislation was conceived and shepherded through Congress by Senator David Boren, Democrat of Oklahoma; indeed, the scholarships will bear Mr. Boren's name if they are ever fully funded. Right now, that's a very big if. The Senate has approved the program, but the House Intelligence Committee, in a fit of pique in June, voted to scrap it. Many of the negative votes were aimed not at the program but at Senator Boren, who had made enemies among fellow Democrats for his opposition to President Clinton's economic program.
Mr. Boren was fair game for criticism, but America's students hardly deserved the committee's chosen retribution. The program addresses an obvious shortcoming. If administered with care and exacting standards, its monies will fall like rain on a desert. Senate and House conferees are scheduled to meet early next week. The hope here is that the House conferees will accede to the Senate, thereby allowing an exceptionally sound idea to go forward.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REVIEW;
A Sizzling Third-Quarter Performance, at Home and Abroad

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
Investors may be living dangerously, but what a living. As skepticism mounted in the third quarter about whether the rallies in the stock and bond markets could continue, mutual funds posted especially strong returns.
They were aided by a surge in stocks of small companies and continuing declines in interest rates, both domestically and abroad.
Funds that invest in stocks of American companies turned in their best performance of the year. The average domestic stock fund had a total return of 5 percent in the latest quarter, more than twice the return in the second quarter. Foreign stock funds did even better, returning 8.8 percent. 
 Taxable bond funds returned 2.1 percent in the third quarter, the same as the previous quarter. And municipal bond funds returned 3 percent, down from 3.3 percent.
The total return figures, which are calculated by Morningstar Inc., a research company in Chicago, combine the gain or loss on the mutual funds' shares with the dividends or interest the funds paid in the quarter. The returns omit sales charges.
The stock funds again did better than the Standard & Poor's 500 index, a broad gauge of large company stocks, which returned 2.9 percent in the quarter. While most mutual funds underperformed this index during the 1980's, they have beaten it more recently by investing in smaller companies, the most active segment of the market. In fact, the Wilshire Small Capitalization Index, representing stocks of 250 smaller companies, had a total quarterly return of 7.1 percent.
It's no surprise then that among domestic general stock funds, those that invest in small companies posted the best performance in the quarter, with a total return of 8.6 percent. Aggressive growth funds, which also largely invest in smaller companies, were a close second. Growth funds, which can invest in any stocks, returned 5.1 percent, up sharply from 1.1 percent in the second quarter.
Among specialty stock funds, the winners were financial services funds, which rose 9.9 percent. Precious metals funds were the big losers, falling 10.4 percent. The two groups effectively reversed positions from the second quarter, when metal funds shot up 31.4 percent on a gold bubble and financial services funds fell by 1.8 percent because of a temporary correction in bank stocks.
Technology stock funds did well in both quarters and racked up the best one-year return figure.
The fall in European interest rates after the summer currency turmoil helped funds that invest in European stocks post an 8.7 percent return in the third quarter, nearly as high as the 9.6 percent return for Pacific stock funds. In the second quarter, European funds lagged far behind Pacific funds.
Among individual stock funds, the top performer was Smith Barney Shearson Special Equities, which invests in small rapidly growing companies. Its major holdings include Calloway Golf, a club maker, and Electronic Arts, a video game company. Although the fund is up 72.2 percent in the last 12 months, George Novello, the fund's manager, says he expects the trend to continue. "We try to buy companies that transcend the market and won't be sensitive to the current economic malaise or potentially higher interest rates," he said. Moreover, Mr. Novello, a former food analyst for E.F. Hutton, said he expected the bull market in small company stocks to continue for several years.
Many of the top-rated funds have what is called a momentum strategy that searches out rapidly rising stocks, often looking for earnings that have exceeded expectations. The fourth-rated Twentieth Century Giftrust, which is meant for long-term gifts to minors or charities, uses such a technique.
The Invesco Strategic Leisure fund, ranked No. 2 for the quarter, invests in a wide range of companies related to leisure time, including the fast-growing cable television and cellular phone industries. Fidelity Select Home Finance, No. 3, has ridden the revival in fortunes in savings and loans and banks. GAM International, ranked fifth, focuses on blue-chip foreign stocks, mostly in Europe.
Before rushing out to buy one of the top-rated funds, investors should consider the fate of Lexington Strategic Investments, the No. 1 fund last quarter, when it returned 82.5 percent. A gold fund, Lexington lost 12.8 percent in the third quarter, finishing fourth from last. Despite that loss, it remains the top-performing fund for the last 12 months.
Investors interested in a purely contrarian play might consider the Yacktman Fund, the worst-performing fund over the last year, with a negative total return of 9.7 percent. Founded a little over a year ago, it is managed by Donald Yacktman, who had run the highly successful Selected American Shares fund. Mr. Yacktman likes pharmaceutical, food and tobacco companies, the sort of blue- chip stocks that are out of favor now.
Among bond funds, the best performance continued to be by funds with the longest maturities, because these investments gained the most as interest rates fell. Treasury funds, which generally invest in long-term bonds, led the domestic category.
The Benham Target Maturity 2020 fund, which buys only long-term zero-coupon Treasury bonds, gained 17.5 percent in the quarter. Zero-coupon bonds are the most sensitive to interest rate movements because they pay no current interest, and they are sold at deep discounts to their face value.
International bond funds performed even better because of falling interest rates.
 The article also misstated the third-quarter performance of Lexington Strategic Investments, a gold fund. Lexington Strategic lost 10.87 percent in the quarter, not 12.8 percent, finishing 10th from last in mutual fund performance in the period, not fourth from last.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REVIEW;
A Pioneer of Mutual Funds Takes a Look at Today

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VALLEY FORGE, Pa.

 BODY:
Walter L. Morgan, a young Philadelphia accountant, had just founded one of the first American mutual funds when stocks rose to dizzying heights in the summer of 1929. His portfolio was heavily invested in common stocks, including such speculative favorites as Curtis Publishing at about $125 a share and U.S. Steel at more than $250.
Applying the then-novel idea that adding bonds to stocks for "balance" would create a fund that could better withstand bear markets, he and his fledgling Wellington Fund survived the ensuing stock crash and Depression. 
 "We had chosen the worst time in the financial history of the United States to launch a new investment vehicle," Mr. Morgan observed many years later. "Yet in another way what good fortune we had to launch a conservative fund just a few brief months before the merits of conservative investing were to be so amply demonstrated."
The founder not only of the first balanced mutual fund but also of the Vanguard empire, whose 76 funds now have $120 billion in assets, Mr. Morgan has been a keen observer of market gyrations. Though he retired from active management in 1970 and his pace has slowed, the 95-year-old mutual fund pioneer still spends two mornings a week at the Vanguard Group's new building here.
 He boasts of no particular skill in predicting market turns nor does he believe that anybody can do it consistently. But he talks -- and to some extent, acts -- like a bear nowadays.
 The Wellington Fund, a $7.4 billion giant, is riding the crest of decade-long bull markets in both stocks and bonds after an era of high-flying stocks and rising interest rates in which its performance was lackluster and its image stodgy.
Yet Mr. Morgan, like many others, is feeling a bit queasy from the securities markets' lofty heights. The events of recent days remind him a bit of the summer of 1929, when he watched stocks become "hysterically" overpriced and then decided to sell heavily at prices that many issues have not seen since.
The proceeds from those sales were put into bonds. Fixed-income securities accounted for about 40 percent of the fund's assets when the Dow Jones industrial average plummeted in October 1929.
Not even bonds, his one-time savior, can be counted on for stability now, he said in a recent interview.
 "I'm scared to death of bonds, as a matter of fact, with the low yield they have now," said Mr. Morgan, a salty, eighth-generation descendant of an early Welsh colonist with family ties to David Rittenhouse and other prominent regional families. "Anybody going into 30-year bonds, they may lose their shirt."
An occasional confidant of Warren E. Buffett, the fabulously successful Omaha investor, Mr. Morgan also frets about the money pouring into "speculative" stock mutual funds at price-earnings multiples that remind him of the 1920's.
"The main difference, I would say, is everything was leveraged then," he said. "They not only bought stocks at 60 times earnings," Mr. Morgan observed, but setbacks were magnified by margin calls that generated fresh waves of selling.
Since a far smaller proportion of stock is bought with borrowed money these days, a self-reinforcing crash is less likely. Unless, of course, panic sets in among the millions of investors who, shunning minuscule yields on certificates of deposit and money market funds, have been lured into stock market purchases for the first time.
Mr. Morgan's own fortune, which he conservatively puts at "several million" dollars, remains mainly in the Derwell Company, a personal holding company whose investment portfolio reflects Mr. Morgan's advanced age and tax bracket as much as his view of the various securities markets.
His personal assets are about 80 percent in "seniors," mostly tax-exempt notes and bond issues, and 15 to 20 percent in equities, Mr. Morgan said.
"That doesn't mean I think the market is going to hell," he said, only that a man in his mid-90's who was at Princeton with F. Scott Fitzgerald tends to put a premium on liquidity. Indeed, Mr. Morgan says continued corporate restructuring in America may result in profits "better than people think."
Mr. Morgan obviously has made his share of stock coups over the years. Derwell shares, worth slightly more than $200 each by recent calculations, carry a cost basis of a mere 10 cents, he said. That performance, in a percentage increase, appears to put him in the same league as the acclaimed Mr. Buffett.
Among the stocks that have treated him well over the years, he said, are the insurance companies Geico and Safeco as well as the oil giants Royal Dutch/Shell and Texaco and various bank companies.
His adroit handling of the 1987 crash didn't hurt either. Repeating his successful pre-Depression strategy, he reduced Derwell's equity exposure just before stocks dove in October that year.
Although Mr. Morgan, who has endured what he describes as 11 "major" operations and nine eye operations, has had to give up hunting and fishing as well as driving, he keeps well versed on the political and financial issues of the day.
Earlier this year, when Congress was considering a measure it eventually passed to exempt gifts of appreciated stock from the alternative minimum tax, Mr. Morgan wrote to Hillary Rodham Clinton, then drafting the Administration's health care plan, to point out that this proposal would benefit health-oriented charities. He has also spoken against taxing capital gains at death.
Asked to give some market advice, Mr. Morgan demurred. When pressed, however, he said that as a general principle, younger investors "might want to have 50 percent in stocks."

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REVIEW;
Latin America. Eastern Europe. Smaller Investors Expand Reach

BYLINE: By KATHRYN JONES

 BODY:
Americans' hot romance with foreign stock funds shows no sign of cooling off.
"The American investor has always had an interest in foreign funds, but it's been heightened," said John R. Horseman, investment manager of Global Asset Management's International Fund, in a telephone interview from his London office. "As we go into 1994, increasingly, that investor is looking around and putting bigger shares of money outside" the United States. 
 Witness the popularity of foreign and global stock funds this year. Funds that invest only abroad have taken in $12.3 billion through August, versus $4.1 billion in the comparable period last year, the Investment Company Institute, a trade group, said this week. The funds held $44.2 billion at the end of August, double their level a year earlier.
For global funds -- which invest in the United States as well as abroad -- the cash inflow more than quadrupled during the first eight months to $5.6 billion from $1.2 billion in the period a year earlier. The global funds' assets rose to $32.2 billion from $18.3 billion during the 12 months ended in August.
"Foreign funds have gotten the eye of the small investor," said John Collins, a spokesman for the Investment Company Institute in Washington, the mutual fund trade group.
Several factors make foreign funds attractive. As more countries switch from socialist to free-market economies, stock markets all over the globe are springing to life. Government-run utilities, oil companies and banks are going private, carrying with them all the possibilities and pitfalls of capitalism. Developing countries are also harnessing inflation and showing glimmers of economic growth.
During the third quarter, funds invested in Latin America and developing countries generally surged, as did funds with diverse international holdings, according to a list of top foreign funds compiled by Morningstar, the mutual fund rating company in Chicago.
 The sizzle in emerging markets, which are defined by the World Bank, came from stocks in Brazil and in the Pacific Rim. Emerging markets funds remain heavily weighted to the Pacific Rim and, to a lesser extent, Latin America.
"A lot of them are nibbling at Eastern Europe," said Eileen Sanders, who follows the category for Morningstar. A few are even looking to Africa.
Over all, developing countries are expected to post average economic growth of 5.2 percent this decade, compared with 3.1 percent for developed countries. Those higher growth rates are expected to translate into higher corporate profits and thus stronger stock market performance.
The emerging markets funds surged last year because of economic growth in the Pacific Rim, Ms. Sanders said. The Fidelity Emerging Markets fund, for example, had $213.5 million in assets at the end of August, up from from just $6.8 million at the end of 1991.
Because many of these funds are new, it's difficult to draw any conclusions about their long-term performance. "They can be risky, but total returns can be quite attractive," Ms. Sanders said. "One of these funds has a place in an investment portfolio, but only a small portion."
In the developed world, the loosening of Europe's currency controls in July led to select stock and bond market rallies in the third quarter. Fund managers expect investor interest in Europe to continue as more countries cut interest rates, spurring economic recoveries and making stocks and bonds more attractive.
Mr. Horseman of Global Asset Management said his International Fund was focusing on the German housing industry, expecting it to benefit from falling interest and inflation rates and construction in the former East Germany. In the last quarter, the fund benefited from investments in water utilities in Britain.
Among the top-performing foreign funds, the International Fund is one of the most heavily weighted in Europe. About three-quarters of its assets are in Europe, with the remainder in Asia.
Latin American stock funds are having a strong year, driven by the privatization of industries and the easing of trade restrictions. Scudder, Stevens & Clark Inc.'s Latin America fund has zoomed to the top five among foreign funds since its debut in December.
William F. Truscott, a Scudder vice president and co-manager of its Argentina fund, attributed the new fund's performance mostly to heavy investments in Brazil at the beginning of the year. "The market is probably up 100 percent," he said. "What also helped us in August was an increasing weighting in Argentina, which is doing well, and in Mexico."
The next markets of interest in Latin America will be Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Chile, Mr. Truscott said.
Although the North American Free Trade Agreement remains controversial in the United States and far from a sure thing in Congress, fund managers play down its importance.
J. Mark Mobius, director of Templeton Funds' Far East division and manager of its emerging markets portfolio, said, "The integration of the United States and Mexico economies is taking place already and will continue regardless of what Congress says."
Mr. Truscott referred to Mexico as a great long-term investment. "Quite frankly, in the long run, Nafta is meaningless," he said. He conceded, however, that "if Congress is not enlightened enough to pass it, it may create some volatility in the Mexican market."
While interest grows in foreign funds, investment managers emphasize that their funds are for investors with a long-term horizon, and equities in Latin America and emerging markets have a history of volatility. In addition, returns depend in part on exchange rates between the dollar and local currencies.
"Potential investment in Latin America has to be thinking in terms of five to seven years," Mr. Truscott said. "We think this is going to be the beginning of a very strong story, but there could be some bumps along the road."

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS QUARTERLY REVIEW;
Stalking New Markets Where Many Fear to Tread

BYLINE: By KATHRYN JONES

 BODY:
While some managers of international funds hang on the German central bank's every move and on the latest trade figures from Japan, J. Mark Mobius tracks a Turkish steelmaker, the telephone company that serves Rio de Janeiro and the Nigerian stock exchange.
Emerging markets are his game. And he's one of the hottest portfolio managers in an area where growth potential is enormous, yet economic and political turmoil is commonplace. 
 With an office in Hong Kong and a frenetic travel schedule, Mr. Mobius directs the Far East division for Templeton Funds and manages emerging markets portfolios, overseeing more than $2 billion.
His Templeton Developing Markets Fund, begun in late 1991, ranks among the top performers this year. In the third quarter, it returned a healthy 12.7 percent. A less-expensive offshoot of the older Templeton Emerging Markets Fund, it has grown from $22.3 million in assets at the end of 1991 to $480.3 million at the end of August.
"American investors are discovering equities," Mr. Mobius said in a recent telephone interview. "We're seeing the flow of money from bank deposits to mutual funds and equity funds, and then people think globally as they want to diversify. A small percentage of that money is going to emerging markets. But that small percentage amounts to a heck of a lot."
Although his investments span the globe, Asian markets are his specialty. Mr. Mobius, who was born in New York City, has an undergraduate degree from Boston University and a Ph.D. in economics and political science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He has lived the last 20 years in Asia. Now 57, he joined Templeton in 1987 as managing director of the Far East division.
In addition to the Developing Markets and Emerging Markets funds, he is managing the China World Fund, a closed-end fund begun in September. A closed-end fund issues a fixed number of shares that are traded on a securities market, as opposed to an open-end fund, which continuously sells and redeems shares.
Aiming to capitalize on China's economic reforms and the planned integration of Hong Kong with mainland China in 1997, the fund will invest at least 65 percent of its assets in the stocks of companies doing business in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
But the open-end developing markets fund garners the most attention. John Templeton, who founded the Templeton group, now a subsidiary of Franklin Resources Inc., has said he plans to put into the developing markets fund the millions of dollars he recently made selling his holdings in the closed-end emerging markets fund, whose portfolio is virtually the same. The closed-end fund is more expensive because it trades at about 30 percent more than its per-share value. The developing markets fund has a sales charge, which is 5.75 percent for the smallest investors.
Eileen Sanders, an analyst who follows emerging markets funds for Morningstar Inc. in Chicago, praises Mr. Mobius's performance and says, "He's done an excellent job with the closed-end fund."
So where does the expert place his bets? The developing markets fund is invested in about 22 countries, with its largest holdings in Brazil, Turkey, the Philippines, Greece, Hong Kong and Portugal.
Some analysts expressed surprise initially about the purchases in Turkey, but the move has paid off with strong economic gains there this year. Referring to Turkey as underrated, Mr. Mobius says the country is industrialized and diverse with a rising standard of living and a strategic position near key waterways and some of the new republics of the old Soviet Union.
The fund does not invest more than 20 percent of its assets in one country, however. Mr. Mobius cited investments in fast-growing Brazil as another key reason for his strong showing this year.
"Our portfolio has become very diverse, so we have more protection against big problems in any one country," he said. "You must diversify -- otherwise, you'd get badly burned."
He continues to see value in Mexico, with or without a formal trade agreement with the United States and Canada, and in South America, as countries embrace free-market economies and continue privatizing businesses once run by the governments. He's also interested in the small but still volatile developing markets in Eastern Europe, especially in some countries like Latvia.
Breaking away from the pack does not faze him. Although few fund managers are investing in Africa, Mr. Mobius said he was looking at Zimbabwe and Nigeria precisely because international investors have not yet discovered the equity markets there.
Prices are still low, and the economies have long-term growth potential, Mr. Mobius said. "Nigeria is really the gem of Africa," he said.
Although emerging markets funds are sizzling right now, he recommends them only for investors who have already had some exposure to global markets, who want potentially higher returns along with higher risk and who take a long-term view.
Emerging markets have higher average economic growth rates than those of industrialized countries, but it can take years or even decades for those markets to develop, he said. To wit: Templeton was investing in an developing market in the 1960's that is now a world economic powerhouse -- Japan.
Before joining Templeton, Mr. Mobius worked in Asia in international finance, as a consultant and as a research scientist. Still a zealous researcher, he spends most of his time on the road, studying companies and stock markets and trying to understand the countries where he invests.
His October itinerary includes trips to Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore and Taiwan. "It's the only way to invest competently," he said.
Ms. Sanders of Morningstar concurs. "I'm very distrustful of managers of foreign funds who are always in their New York offices," she said.

Could the Sun Ever Set On the BBC?

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
DENNIS POTTER, THE WRITER of some of the British Broadcasting Corporation's most critically acclaimed programs, is an acerbic sort. But reminiscing recently about growing up with the BBC, the 58-year-old Mr. Potter seemed at times positively misty-eyed.
"I'll admit that I'm quite ready to be a churl in sharpened hobnails," Mr. Potter, the writer of "Pennies From Heaven" and "The Singing Detective," told an audience at a television industry conference. "But it would be graceless of me not to acknowledge with an open heart the significant part the BBC played in my life and the lives of the people I came from. Millions of our fellow citizens feel the same way, for there have been all too few British institutions of any size of which one could say with hand on heart that they truly work, that they are the best that is." 
 In the same speech, however, Mr. Potter asked, as growing numbers of those citizens have in recent months, a remarkable question: whether the BBC as currently constituted and managed has a claim to long-term survival. "I fear the time is near when we must save not the BBC from itself but public service broadcasting from the BBC," Mr. Potter said.
The BBC is in no immediate danger of being killed off or being forced to adopt any of the more radical suggestions for its future, like accepting advertising. But, beset by dissension from within and responding uncertainly to the rapid changes in the television industry, it is struggling to hold on to the roles that have made it so influential: embodiment of British culture; standard-setter in programming quality and innovation, and keeper of the ideal that a publicly financed broadcaster can entertain and inform a mass audience while accommodating highbrow fare that cannot thrive on commercial networks.
The BBC's predicament offers scant hope of solution. Where once its domination of broadcasting in Britain was complete, it now finds itself one of a growing number of alternatives in an intensely competitive industry. The erosion in its ratings is inevitable. In this way, its problems are comparable to those of the Public Broadcasting System in the United States, whose member stations had a clear mandate when they went on the air decades ago but must now compete against an array of specialized cable networks like Arts & Entertainment and the Discovery Channel.
Moreover, where commercial networks have clear goals and philosophies -- seeking the biggest audiences and maximizing advertising revenues -- the BBC is tugged in many directions by constituencies with different views of its mission. Writers like Mr. Potter may pine for a culture in which creativity, not finances or ratings, reigned supreme. Mass audiences want funnier sitcoms. And the Government wants closer attention to how the BBC spends its money.
"I believe the BBC should survive and will survive," said Lord Grade, who as Lew Grade was one of the pioneers of commercial broadcasting in Britain. "But they have a job ahead of them."
No longer can the corporation count on unquestioned political support. That kind of backing fell victim in the 1980's to Margaret Thatcher's disdain for the BBC as a symbol of a hostile, entrenched establishment. And with Britain only slowly coming out of its worst recession since the 1930's, it can no longer assume that the public -- which finances the corporation through a "license fee," a tax that for households with color televisions now runs $125 a year -- will want to pick up the tab.
In an early test, the Government will decide next month whether to grant the BBC's request for small but steady increases in the license fee or to cut the levy. Then, in 1996, Parliament will consider a grander question: whether to renew the corporation's charter, the document governing its operation and setting out its reason for being. The pressure is on, and the BBC, under a new director-general, John Birt, has undertaken a sweeping program to cut costs and improve programming quality.
"If the BBC had not made and does not continue to make changes, the future of the license fee in the short term, and of the BBC itself in the longer term, might need to be considered from a very different perspective," Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary in Prime Minister John Major's Government, said in a speech to a television-industry group in September. "We might now or in the future find ourselves contemplating, rather sadly, the demise of a dinosaur."
In programming, the BBC has always been called on to provide popular entertainment, serious drama and a voice of authority in times of crisis. Now it must continue to offer those things without merely duplicating what appears on its commercial rivals: two national broadcast networks, ITV and Channel 4, and a growing number of cable and satellite channels.
The commercial networks, for their part, have increasingly been able to attract the kinds of writing, directing and acting talent that once seemed the province of the BBC. ("Prime Suspect 2," the British-made mini-series that recently won an American Emmy, was produced by Granada Television, in association with WGBH in Boston, for ITV.)
UNLIKE NETWORKS IN THE United States, the BBC produces most of its own programs in-house. It still makes plenty of the ambitious dramas that are the backbone of its reputation in the United States, where BBC programming remains a staple on PBS. With the BBC now doubly eager to generate income by selling its programming abroad, it is, if anything, more committed to its prestigious dramas.
This season the BBC will air plays and limited-run serials including Bob Hoskins in "The Changeling" and a new production of "Hedda Gabler," starring Fiona Shaw and Stephen Rea. "A Foreign Field," a comedy-drama starring Alec Guinness and Lauren Bacall about D-Day veterans returning to France, won rave reviews when it was broadcast in September. But the overall BBC programming lineup, always a mixed bag, has had particular trouble with programs designed for a wide audience.
The ratings have held up reasonably well in sitcoms. However, many of its series, including ambitious productions like an adaptation of "A Year in Provence," based on Peter Mayle's best-seller, have failed to draw viewers. The record has been even worse in more mainstream fare; this year, a soap opera called "Eldorado" became something of a national joke before being canceled.
The audience share of its two national television networks, BBC-1 and BBC-2, has fallen to about 43 percent over the last year, from 51 percent in 1981. (BBC-1 is the more mainstream of the two channels; its shows are intended for a mass audience. BBC-2 has historically broadcast more documentaries, educational programs and highbrow drama.)
Reinforcing a long-held impression among many viewers that the BBC is elitist in its programming, a recent study by the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising, a trade group, found that among manual laborers and their families, only one program shown on the BBC -- a weekly soccer match -- ranked in the top 20 in the ratings. Among professional and managerial workers and their families, 7 BBC programs were in the top 20.
Attempts to shore up programming weaknesses have been undertaken against a background of internal turmoil. The staff at the huge Television Center complex in west London has been riven by the strategy adopted by a management team under Mr. Birt, who became director-general in January. Mr. Birt has set the BBC on what amounts to an efficiency drive.
The goal, he says, is to reassure viewers and the Government that the annual budget of $2.1 billion is being well spent, and to head off attempt to reduce or eliminate the license fee. Much of the money saved in the efficiency drive -- roughly $100 million this year -- has been put back into programming, Mr. Birt said. "We have been an overlarge, wasteful, inefficient institution," he said at the television conference, adding: "We're marching on. We're firing on all cylinders, and where we aren't, we're identifying what we need to do."
But the cost has been high to the BBC staff, about 4,000 of whom have lost their jobs in recent years as the corporation has reduced employment to 23,000. And it has led to a near-mutiny by some employees, who view the Birt team as a phalanx of gray-suited accountants willing to sacrifice the BBC's heritage to a hostile Government and willing to bury creativity under a mountain of paperwork.
"John Birt's style of management has been described as Stalinist and pseudo-Leninist," Mark Tully, a veteran foreign correspondent for BBC News, said in a speech over the summer, criticizing the director-general as having created a climate of fear. "I would not go that far, but so many managers parrot his name that many of the staff feel there is some sort of Big Brother watching them."
To many associated with the BBC, Mr. Birt's management is a logical extension of a Thatcherite legacy of free-market dogma: that the institution must justify itself not on the basis of what it does for British cultural life but on a purely bottom-line basis, like commercial broadcasters.
Given the different directions in which the BBC is being pulled, it is not surprising that its culture is somewhat schizophrenic. It is a culture that seems to force itself to be comfortable with "This Is Your Life" (a show recently purchased by BBC-1) but is most proud of productions like "Black Daisies," a drama about a woman with Alzheimer's disease that won critical praise last year but a tiny audience.
"It's the ability to commission those pieces, knowing they will attract a specialized audience but a highly enthusiastic one, that is one of the reasons I pay my license fee and one of the reasons 20 million people pay theirs," said Charles Denton, the BBC's new head of dramatic programming. "Thank God the BBC is still sufficiently well funded to be able to play both of those games -- commercial competition when necessary, and also very much playing to specialized audiences."

Users Outmuscle Investors for Foreclosed Co-ops

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
IN a matter-of-fact voice, with no sign of regret, Jonathan Barrett described an apartment catch that slipped off his bidding hook at an auction last June.
"The building was in Bayside," he said. "It was 60 percent sold. The monthly maintenance was reasonable. A nice apartment. We thought it had a resale value of $45,000. We bid $22,500. 
 "We didn't get it but the lady living next door did. She was going to use it. Investors in this game are not going to be able to compete with someone who's going to use it."
Mr. Barrett is a partner with his brother, Anthony, in a two-year-old investment company called Ossa Properties Inc., based in Kew Gardens Hills, Queens. It owns 550 renter-occupied apartments in four co-op projects in the city, and it competes with investors of various stripes for apartments that are offered in bulk or individually, through negotiated sales or at auction, vacant or occupied. Often the sellers are third parties representing institutions that are lightening their real-estate portfolios.
As the June sale showed, buyer-users are sometimes slipping into the act when co-op apartments are on the block. A newspaper advertisement of the sale June 6 listed the buildings involved but not the apartment numbers, and invited bids, with further information available from the marketing agent, Douglas Elliman-Gibbons & Ives. Fifty-three apartments were offered. A bank had foreclosed on loans to their occupants, some of whom had not yet departed.
It turned out that there were almost 300 bidders. Bids were accepted for 50 of the 53 apartments, but only 7 were buyer-users. They typically had backgrounds in real estate, finance or accounting.
"You've got to do your homework," said Raul Melo, an operatic tenor whose $93,000 bid on a second-floor, two-bedroom, two-bath apartment at 200 East 90th Street, on Third Avenue, was a winner. He and his wife, Cynthia Tillotson-Melo, who works in corporate relations and is getting a master's degree in business administration, plan to move there from the Park Slope section of Brooklyn. They bought a co-op there seven years ago.
The June auction also called attention to the uses of auctions as a way to dispose of residential property. Two years ago builders and sponsors were using "outcry" auctions to rid themselves of remaining newly built units after a long sales process. But it is not the method of choice for a vacancy.
"What happens if it doesn't sell?" said Andrew Gerringer, vice president of Douglas Elliman. "They say there's no life after a failed outcry auction." Douglas Elliman acted as marketing agent for J.E. Robert Company of New England, of Milford, Conn., in the June sale. J.E. Robert is a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation asset manager.
Asset dispositions are not necessarily accomplished by auction. Most sales occur through brokers, or through banks handling their sales directly.
Last March a New York City firm, Greenthal/Harlan Realty Services Company, held a successful outcry auction of 450 "nonperforming end loans" on apartments in New York and surrounding communities. The total book value was $30 million. The loans were sold in 14 pools.
"We are not using the sealed-bid format to sell individual units," said Lance West, president of the company's executive committee, though many of the apartments may later be resold to users by investor-buyers.
THERE are no estimates of the total number of co-ops and condominiums that may be sold individually or in bulk by or for lenders. But recent figures show that New York City has a large inventory of renter-occupied co-ops, fertile investor territory. As long as financing remains tough to get for this inventory, prices will remain depressed. The recent strengthening of the rental market, however, suggests that a firmer sales market is coming.
At the June sale the bidders were furnished with an information kit and allowed to inspect documentation at Douglas Elliman's office. After that they were on their own to find out what they could.
The bids came in in late June. After considering them, J.E. Robert requested second and "final" bids from all; that raised offerings about 10 percent, Mr. Gerringer said. Winners were chosen in August. Closings are scheduled for this month ) and next.
"Some people were still living in the apartments when the bids were made, and some were still in litigation," said Mr. Gerringer of Douglas Elliman. That situation is among the risks bidders must consider. Another is the possibility of difficulty finding mortgage financing. The buyer might have to be prepared to pay all cash.
Jamie Burba, an accountant working for a title company in Westchester, is in contract to buy a one-bedroom co-op at 20 Secor Place in Yonkers after her bid of $23,000 was accepted. The former owner, angry at the bank that foreclosed on him, damaged fixtures in the apartment. She will have to replace them.
She looks on the purchase as an investment that she will either rent out or resell, but temporarily she expects to move in. "You have to move in to get a mortgage," she said, "and even then it may be difficult."
But even without a mortgage she thinks she got a good buy at $23,000. "I know I can get $750 in rent," she said, "so that after five years, after taxes, I would be getting all my money back."
The economic calculations depend on many imponderables, which is why professionals urge caution upon buyers. They have to work on their own to uncover the economics of the building, its future repair and maintenance requirements, the financial state of a sponsor who may own apartments in the building and much more.
"It's caveat emptor," said Mickey Cohen, who under the name Micon Industries of New York, in Manhattan, is in the business of buying vacancies at discounts from vacancy value and flipping sales contracts to users before the closing. "You're on your own."
That didn't frighten the Melos. Their successful bid at 200 East 90th Street followed two unsuccessful bids for other apartments elsewhere at earlier auctions. They could not get inside the unit before they contracted to buy it. But they decided that its $725 a month maintenance was low for a doorman building. They think their unit's vacancy value is about $240,000.
BUT the building doesn't yet have 60 percent of its apartments sold to users, Mr. Melo said. "We're having a devil of a time finding financing," he said. "We need 35 percent down, a huge amount for us. But we'll do it somehow because it's too good a deal to pass up." The Melos finally got into the apartment two weeks ago, after it had finanlly been vacated. "Its conditions was better than I feared, but not as good as I had hoped," Mr. Melo said.
Figures from the 1991 Housing and Vacancy Survey done by the Census Bureau for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development show that the total number of co-op and condominium units rose 25 percent in New York from 1987 to 1991, to a total of more than 400,000.
But the proportion of renters occupying those apartments also rose, a reflection of diminished selling in the late 80's. The percentage of renter-occupancy reached 155,760, up almost 40 percent from 1987. Owner-occupancy rose 10 percent, to 219,413 units.
The housing survey also revealed a sharp gap between the rents regulated tenants pay in co-op and condominium buildings and the true rental value of their apartments, a gap that hurts city tax revenue and damages the fiscal strength of co-op housing.
In Manhattan, the median regulated rent was $668 in 38,200 apartments; the median nonregulated rent -- usually when vacancies are rented out by sponsors -- was $1,100. The figures for Queens were $480 in the regulated sector and $700 in the nonregulated sector.

HEADLINE: YOUR HOME;
Detailing The New Tax Law

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
AS the dust settles on the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, signed into law in August, the ramifications for homeowners are becoming clear. Some changes will affect the elderly. There are also important considerations for anyone in a high-income bracket and for people who own rental property. And there are equally meaningful implications for shareholders in some New York City co-ops.
"Though the homeowner was not specifically addressed," said Julian Block, a tax lawyer in Larchmont, N.Y., and author of "Julian Block's Year-Round Tax Strategies," 1994 Edition (Prima Publishing, $14.95, available this month), "the changes will have meaning for quite a lot of people." 
 Accountants and financial planners begin by noting that the rise in the top tax bracket from 31 percent to 39.6 percent makes owning a home increasingly important as a tax-saving strategy -- the way it used to be before the Tax Reform Act of 1986. This is because both the mortgage interest costs and the real estate taxes remain deductible. And as tax rates rise these deductions grow proportionately more valuable.
By the same token it becomes more beneficial from a tax standpoint to own a vacation home, said Mr. Block. A vacation home carries almost identical tax benefits and can thus double those benefits. "It really is a good time to buy," he said.
In addition, added Mr. Block, there were no changes in the capital-gains tax rate. It remains at 28 percent. As a result it makes any profit from the sale of investment property more meaningful. "The spread between the capital-gains rate and the rate on ordinary income is growing," he said.
Some couples who earn more than $150,000 a year may also benefit from a relaxation of the passive-loss rules. In recent years taxpayers with incomes above that threshold could not use any shortfall ("negative cash flow") from a rental property to offset earned income. But starting in 1994 -- and assuming, among other requirements, that one spouse is professionally involved in real estate for at least 15 hours a week -- these deductions will be allowable.
"This is a tremendous opportunity for the kind of couple where the husband is a highly paid professional and the wife is a real estate broker," said Martin A. Goldberg, a tax and estate lawyer in Avon, Conn. He commented upon such benefits in a recent issue of Medical Economics, a bi-weekly trade publication.
Such benefits should be allowed, he said, whether the property is jointly owned or is solely in the name of the spouse involved in real estate. But it remains unclear, he added, whether the opportunity will apply if the property is solely in the name of the spouse who is in another profession. "We'll have to wait for the regulations," he said.
Taxpayers earning under $100,000 a year will be glad to know they have retained their right to offset any losses from rental property against ordinary income (with some minor adjustments up to $150,000).
Another effect of the liberalization of the passive-loss rules may be an improvement in the market for occupied units in New York co-ops. These are units occupied by statutory tenants who frequently pay regulated rents that fall below the unit's maintenance costs.
Richard Montanye, a partner with Marin & Montanye of Port Washington, L.I., accountants who specialize in co-ops, is among those who predict that these units should now be easier to sell. The reason is that real estate professionals, many of whom bought the units by the cartload in the 80's, will again be able to use the negative cash flow to offset income from more profitable ventures, a benefit taken away from them by the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The change may also ease some of the financial stress of conversion sponsors.
BUT other repercussions are not so good for co-ops. Many financially troubled co-ops were expecting the new law to provide them with an automatic income-tax exemption if the lender holding the building's underlying mortgage "forgave" a portion of the loan (for example, by writing off $500,000 from a $2 million loan balance), said Mr. Montanye. But this did not happen.
Instead, the law created fresh criteria that must be met before the co-op can qualify for the exemption. One is "insolvency." If the co-op can show, for example, that its mortgage debt, plus other liabilities, exceed the fair market value of its assets, it should be O.K. "And at today's prices this shouldn't be too hard to do," said Mr. Montanye.
The new law was also expected to make co-ops less vulnerable to the so-called "277 rule" -- paying taxes on revenues derived from sources other than maintenance charges, such as the proceeds of a laundry room. It did not, said Mr. Montanye. So 277 remains a threat, although alternative legislation is still being sought.
Finally, the implications for the elderly. It has become commonplace in recent years for the elderly to place their homes in what is known as a "Medicaid trust" to avoid exposing the equity to nursing-home debts. If the change-over to a trust was made at least 30 months before admission it usually worked. Even if the changeover was completed only a few months ahead of time there was still a limit on how much the state could take.
No longer. The new law cuts back hard, warned Lawrence Davidow, co-chairman of the Suffolk County Bar Association's Elder Law Committee. For instance, if the elderly person has retained lifetime occupancy rights to the home -- which is common -- the trust may now be declared invalid for Medicaid purposes, he said.
However, Mr. Davidow maintains that this part of the new law is so ambiguous that he is advising his clients to sit tight "until we see exactly what the regulations say." Anyone only now intending to set up such a trust should similarly wait until more definite regulations are available, he said. But they should also be aware, he said, that the change-over must now be made 36 months (rather than 30 months) before a nursing home admission.
So if a nursing home stay is anticipated soon, Mr. Davidow still believes certain trusts may be worth establishing. But to safeguard validity, he said, the elderly person should refrain from retaining the usual legal right to lifetime occupancy.
Does this mean the elderly person will have to leave once the transfer of title occurs? Probably not, said Mr. Davidow. The difference, he said, is that it will be the heirs or the trustee who have control over that decision, as with any other type of outright transfer.

HEADLINE: A Shift in Rules Guiding Growth Along the Water

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
WATERFRONT zoning is about to reach New York City's waterfront. After decades in which shoreline development was guided by the same rules that cover the densest urban neighborhoods, the City Planning Commission has crafted zoning measures that are meant to open the land's edge.
Public space, including shoreline walkways with landscaped borders, would be required in certain large projects. Building heights and widths would be limited, as would floor sizes. Development rights could no longer be transferred upland from underwater property. And suburban-style "big box" discount stores would be prohibited on piers.
"This is an unprecedented zoning text amendment that will, for the first time, put the waterfront into the Zoning Resolution," declared Richard L. Schaffer, the commission chairman, just before his colleagues voted in August to amend the resolution with 200 pages of new text.
What kind of precedent does the amendment offer? Real estate interests maintain that the zoning would thoroughly dampen development by imposing too many extra costs on private builders. Meanwhile, neighborhood leaders and environmental advocates say the zoning does not go far enough to preserve openness.
But the true test will not come until it is known exactly where along the 578-mile waterfront these new rules are to be applied -- and, of course, until the real-estate market recovers.
"The issue is, as we begin to come back in this town economically, does this inhibit the development of new sites on the waterfront?" asked Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey, Democrat of Queens, who heads the Council's zoning and franchises subcommittee.
Tomorrow, the subcommittee is to hold its second hearing on the subject. The zoning amendment would be considered next by the Land Use Committee and then, later this month, by the full Council.
Legal challenges are almost sure to follow. Questions have already been raised about the constitutionality of the public access and underwater zoning rules, as they might be construed as an unlawful taking of property.
Critics have also faulted the overall process, saying that the effects of the zoning measures cannot be adequately evaluated before planners pinpoint the sites.
"WE'RE horrified that no environmental impact statement was deemed necessary and believe it may be actionable," said William P. Bowser of the West Village Committee, speaking to the zoning subcommittee. Several community boards have also called for a full environmental assessment.
However, the counsel to the City Planning Department, William Valletta, told the subcommittee that the new zoning tools "have not landed anywhere" yet.
"To say 'these are the places and these are the impacts' is just not possible," he said.
In the Comprehensive Waterfront Plan of 1992, city planners generally identified some 20 areas, now zoned for manufacturing, where they believe residential redevelopment would be appropriate. These include large parcels in Flushing and Long Island City, Queens, and the Red Hook and Mill Basin sections of Brooklyn.
About 5 percent of the manufacturing districts on the waterfront might be rezoned residentially, said Marilyn Mammano, the director of zoning and urban design for the City Planning Department. Other new rules -- those governing piers and platforms, for example -- would be in force citywide.
Under the new zoning, builders of large projects in medium- to high-density residential and commercial districts would have to set aside 15 to 20 percent of their property for the public, including shoreline esplanades 20 to 25 feet wide, with landscaped "buffer" areas between the public and private space.
Currently, there is no such requirement, although negotiations with developers of
waterfront projects like Brighton by the Sea in Brooklyn have yielded even greater amounts of land set aside for the public.
To get people out to the esplanades through private property, connections would have to be run between the shoreline and public streets or parks at intervals no greater than 600 feet. These walkways would be 12 to 30 feet wide and would be counted toward the overall public space requirement.
A former counsel to the City Planning Department, Norman Marcus, has criticized this approach, in his role as chairman of the New York County Lawyers' Association urban development and land use committee.
"There is a kind of dominant reliance on privately owned property as the vehicle for providing public access," he said. "After 30 years of conflict and quarreling over plazas and the rights of owners versus the rights of the public, it seemed silly to be expanding this difficulty to such an important goal as public access to the waterfront."
Instead, the lawyers' group proposed that open space and connections be provided through public streets and public parks that were officially mapped as such and, therefore, were the city's responsibility.
Mr. McCaffrey also noted "a legal issue in terms of takings." The Fifth Amendment prohibits taking private property for public use without just compensation.
But Mr. Valletta cited the common-law doctrine that lands between high and low tides -- known as "wet sand" -- were held by the state in trust for the public's use for fishing and navigation. That trust was not extinguished by private ownership, he said.
"Since the public trust is still there," he said, "can we say that the equivalent of the public's historic right to go down to 'wet sand' is, in modern terms, the requirement for public access along a walkway? Our zoning is built on the idea that that's an acceptable and appropriate modern substitute."
On land, building sizes would be regulated several ways by the new zoning. In medium- to high-density residential districts, there would be height limits ranging from 150 to 390 feet (roughly 15 to 40 stories). The upper floors could not be wider than 100 feet parallel to the shoreline and floor sizes would have a limit of 7,000 to 8,100 square feet.
The result would be smaller towers and more of them on the site. The Real Estate Board of New York complained that more towers mean more elevator cores, elevators, fire stairs and building entrances. That means higher construction costs, less floor space for apartments and more security problems.
THERE would also be fewer apartments with water views, which command premiums up to 20 percent in rental buildings and up to 50 percent in co-ops or condominiums, the Real Estate Board said.
"Manhattan market values may make up for the inherent economic penalties," the board said. "However, rezoned industrial areas in Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island are not likely to command rents to offset these costs."
Mr. Schaffer said, "We believe these are buildable buildings with a substantial amount of flexibility." Planners point to the broad, wall-like expanse of Shore Towers in Astoria, Queens, as an example of what they do not want to happen again.
Something else they do not want to see again is a proposal like Trump City on the Hudson River, which would have used development rights from under water to generate up to 4.5 million square feet of floor space, for a total of 15.33 million square feet. (The project was later scaled down to 8.3 million square feet and renamed Riverside South.)
Trump City would have taken advantage of the fact that property between the bulkhead and pierhead lines has been recognized as part of the zoning lot. Development rights from that property -- obviously unusable under water -- can be transferred to sites on land or piers, yielding much more building bulk than would ordinarily be permitted.
The new zoning would end the use of underwater property, beyond the bulkhead line, in the calculation of allowable density.
This, too, might be challenged as a taking. The Real Estate Board has said the new rule "raises serious constitutional issues."
Mr. Valletta, however, said the granting of development rights from underwater property was not a matter of law but rather an interpretation of the Zoning Resolution by the Buildings Department -- "a kind of bonus."
"We gave a little extra and we can clearly take it away," he said, "because the constitution protects property rights and this is not a property right."
On existing piers, building sizes would be strictly limited, unless a developer received a special permit. As a matter of right, structures less than 200 feet long could rise only 40 feet. Longer, shed-like buildings could rise only 30 feet. And public space would be required all along the pier.
Developers could seek a special permit to build much larger buildings on piers. "But given that the as-of-right standard has been significantly reduced," Ms. Mammano said, "you have something to measure it against." It would seem unlikely, for instance, that planners would approve a structure 10 times higher than the stated limit.
Also on piers, planners have imposed a limit of 20,000 square feet on certain kinds of stores, including "warehouses that provide accessory retail sales areas."
"YOU couldn't have a 100,000- or 200,000-square-foot Rickel's," Ms. Mammano told the subcommittee at its first hearing. "Going to a Home Depot and loading up on two-by-four's is not a waterfront experience."
Mr. McCaffrey asked, "How is that different from going to the South Street Seaport and shopping at Banana Republic?"
"There are no windows, there is no life on the street," Ms. Mammano replied. "At the South Street Seaport, when you go to Banana Republic, you don't just shop there. You have a drink. You sit down. You meander."
New piers and platforms are limited to parks, playgrounds or what planners call "water-dependent" uses, including docks, boatels, boat yards, launches, heliports, seaplane bases, sewage-disposal plants and marine-transfer stations for garbage.
By special permit, new piers can be converted to "waterfront-enhancing" uses like hotels, motels, restaurants, theaters, arenas, boat showrooms, skating rinks, tennis courts and golf courses -- provided that the original use had ended at least two years earlier.
While critics suspect that this is a loophole through which commercial development can be slipped on to new piers, Ms. Mammano said: "Who is going to go out and get a Corps of Engineers permit, financing for a water-dependent use, open it, close it for two years, then come in for a special permit? And all you can get is a waterfront-enhancing use, which does not include residential or offices. We thought the downside risk was minimal."
However, Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan told the subcommittee, through an aide, that she opposed any rules that would "give city sanction to as-of-right development of new piers or platforms" or "offer a special permit for converting these uses to other more questionable uses."
The vice president of the New York City Audubon Society, Leslie T. Sharpe, urged the city to allow new piers only where there was no practicable alternative. "Activities that are 'enhanced' by a water-based location, such as an ice-skating rink and a golf driving range are not a proper use of the waterfront," she told the subcommittee.

HEADLINE: Streetscapes/Window Awnings;
A Small Revival for a Long-Vanished Adornment

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

 BODY:
THE hot weather is over and the apartment houses should start taking down their canvas window awnings -- except that they stopped putting them up half a century ago.
But over the last decade one building, 180 Riverside Drive at 90th Street, has staged a micro-revival of the floppy striped-canvas artifacts whose disappearance is still hard to explain. 
 Canvas awnings began to supplant wooden shutters in the mid-19th century, and by 1900 summer awnings were nearly universal. Some early designs were elaborate, like those of the Ardelle, at 527 Riverside Drive, which had a large "A" in a circle of laurel and ornate borders.
But the typical awning was a simple striped affair, although reserved solids had a vogue in the late 20's on real luxury buildings. There are photographs of buildings with awnings in every window, but others show that some tenants -- perhaps 10 to 25 percent -- apparently declined them.
J. Mitchell Jablons grew up at 898 West End Avenue in the 30's and remembers that his family's awnings "killed any wind that might come along" and thus were raised at night.
Where possible, it was customary to draw the awning flush against the window frame when the tenants were away for the summer; a building with all the awnings drawn in this way was obviously upper-class.
But for everyone in the city awnings were fixtures of the seasons, an urban counterpart to the hum of cicadas on a summer night. Robert Bien, an architect and partner in the Eggers Group, grew up at 175 Riverside Drive and recalls the respective signs of winter and summer as "the rattle of coal down sidewalk holes, and the man coming in to put the awnings up."
Julio Lo Iacono, retired president of the Acme Awning Company, recalls the industry in the 40's and says that awnings were usually stored on the premises of buildings in the winter. They lasted for six or seven years, and the charge was $2 or $3 a window. But somehow, after World War II, they vanished.
"The last ones were up on Morningside Drive around 115th Street" Mr. Lo Iacono said. Few apartments at this time had air-conditioning, and it is hard to explain the disappearance.
PERHAPS it was a discretionary item in a housing economy with dwindling room for extras, but perhaps, too, awnings seemed irretrievably stuffy and Victorian.
In recent years, some hotels have installed awnings as year-round advertising. Summertime awnings still remain in relatively frequent use on penthouses, but they generally appear only on principal building facades as odd exceptions, often for studio apartments with direct sun.
Until 1980, 180 Riverside Drive was like almost every other building on the West Side, no different in summer or winter. But then Nora Schwartz, a shareholder, went out to dinner. "I was at a restaurant near Lincoln Center," she said, "and I thought, 'the light in here is really beautiful.' They had awnings."
She and her husband, Gabriel, had no air-conditioners in their windows facing the river. "I didn't want the view blocked by those big boxes," she said
They installed awnings on the living room windows facing Riverside Drive and became devotees. Three other tenants have since installed them, including William Meyers, who is an eloquent apologist for awnings.
"IT'S not that I am against the machine," he said. "It's that the awning is so much more pleasurable, like sitting under a shade tree on a hot day. It's a real example of low-tech being effective," although no one pretends that awnings cool like air-conditioners.
Mr. and Mrs. Schwartz designed their awning with stripes of white and terra cotta, roughly matching the limestone and brick of the building. The board required that future awnings follow their plan.
The building is in a historic district designated in 1989, and this summer, when some awnings needed replacement, the board got the approval of the Landmarks Preservation Commission. "They thought it was the best thing since sliced bread" said Dennis Mack, the current board president.
Awnings now run $400 to $600 a window. The tenants at 180 Riverside Drive leave them out in the winter, although they furl them.
But any revival will probably continue to be on a small scale. No other tenants have followed the lead offered by the Schwartzes and their neighbors. "I'm so surprised that they don't think about them," Mrs. Schwartz said. "The light is so soft and beautiful."

HEADLINE: Q and A

 BODY:

Finding Furnished Rentals in Israel
 
Q. We are interested in renting a furnished one-bedroom apartment in Israel for one or two months. Tel Aviv would be our first choice and Jerusalem our second choice. We would like to rent from the owner. Any suggestions? . . . Lilian Fields, Nyack, N.Y. 

A. Call Hometours International in Manhattan at 689-0851 or 800 367-4668. It handles apartments, bed-and-breakfasts and other types of lodging and rentals in Israel.
 
Rent Control And Increases
 
Q. Who determines the M.B.R. (or maximum base rent) increases for rent-controlled tenants?
And why have the rent increases been so high in what has been, at least for the last few years, a period of relatively low inflation? Isn't there supposed to be some sort of connection? . . . Nina Swidler, Manhattan
 
A. The maximum base rent increases for rent-controlled apartments -- in New York City only -- are determined by the state Department of Housing and Community Renewal in Albany, which oversees the rent-regulation system, according to a spokesman for the department, Lou Ganim.
He said that the increases seemed high to tenants because they were determined not by the overall inflation rate but rather by a complex formula created by New York City in the 60's. The formula includes, among other things, maintenance costs, taxes, water and sewer costs.
The owner, Mr. Ganim said, is also allowed to have an 8.5 percent return on capital. By forumla the maximum base rent increases in the city would have been 10.8 percent in 1992, 8 percent in 1990 and 16.4 percent in 1988, he said. By law, though, rent in a rent-controlled apartment can increase by no more than 7.5 percent a year.
 
Applying Homes To an R.E.I.T. Fund
 
Q. How would one apply a small rental property portfolio (four homes) to an existing real estate investment (R.E.I.T) fund? And what are the minimum requirements necessary for establishing such a fund? . . . David A. Schwartz, Manhattan
 
A. According to Barry Vinocur, editor of Realty Stock Review in Shrewsbury, N.J., a four-home portfolio is much too small to establish a real estate investment trust, which is basically a fund that allows individuals to invest in large-scale commercial and residential real estate projects.
"Generally, the threshold is $150 million in assets," he said, noting that some smaller regional trusts may have $30 million to $50 million in assets and, occasionally, may even have assets as small as $10 million.
David L. Brandon, general counsel for the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts in Washington, also said that the small size of your portfolio would make it extremely unlikely that an existing R.E.I.T would want to acquire your properties.

HEADLINE: Teachers Go to Class to Learn Economics

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON

DATELINE: PURCHASE

 BODY:
AS she has for the last seven years, Ellen Purcigliotti took a course in economics this summer. Economics was not something the Lakeland High School social studies teacher knew much about, she said, before the state decided, in 1986, to require high school seniors to study the subject for one semester. About 20 states have a state mandate to teach economics.
Like many other social studies teachers, Ms. Purcigliotti herself had taken only one college course in economics 25 years before. "It was a rude awakening," she said of her efforts to master some basic principles before trying to teach them. "It was scary." 
 She found herself that first summer in Dr. Peter F. Bell's economics classroom at the State University of New York here, where the other students were also high school teachers struggling to construct demand and supply curves and analyze circular-flow diagrams.
 
'Stranger in a Strange Land'
 To the conscientious Ms. Purcigliotti, her ignorance came as a blow. "I couldn't believe they were speaking English," she said of those first days in class. "I was a stranger in a strange land."
Ms. Purcigliotti, who said she now "can pick up the business section of the newspaper and know what I'm reading," eventually became comfortable describing micro- and macro-economics to 12th graders. Dr. Bell's course each summer, and an evening undergraduate course in economics at Mercy College, she said, restored her self-esteem as a teacher.
James Fitzpatrick, her colleague in the social studies department at Lakeland High School, said he has been teaching topics like scarcity and supply and demand since the school year began, but that it was hard to get students excited about economics. "When you are 17 or 18, how interest rates affect you seems so remote," he said. "Even discussions about issues like unemployment and the underclass don't seem to interest them."
Dr. Bell, who heads the New York State Council on Economic Education from his SUNY Purchase office, is determined to stir up young people's curiosity about economic issues, whether the subject is a third-grader's allowance or the intricacies of the North America Free Trade Agreement.
 
Youngest Children Included
 "People know a lot about the American Constitution," said Dr. Bell, a British-born associate professor who has taught at SUNY Purchase for 21 years. "But they know nothing about the economy, which is just as basic to their understanding of their place in the world."
The New York State Council, which is part of the National Council on Economic Education, has set out to incorporate economics courses into every level of the school curriculum, bringing the subject in a simple way even to the youngest children. The national council, a nonprofit partnership of leaders from the worlds of education, business and labor, have created a set of programs called Economics America, which Dr. Bell and social studies coordinators in local school districts are working to establish in the county's schools. S. Stowell Symes, director of school services for the council, said the programs were intended to give millions of students "the tools to be competent decision makers throughout their lives."
"We believe we can teach people not what to think but how to think about economic issues," he said.
Forty-seven state councils, including the New York State Council on Economic Education, which Dr. Bell directs from his SUNY Purchase office, hold teacher workshops and distribute published materials to member schools. Twenty-five schools in Westchester County participate in the programs.
Dr. Bell, who is also an internationally recognized expert on Thailand and a specialist on the economies of developing nations, coordinates the workshops and teaches in some of them.
 
Cookie Consumers
 This summer, he taught a course in global economics here for county high school teachers and directed a teacher workshop in Choices and Changes, an Economics America program for elementary- and middle-school students.
Choices and Changes, which has been adopted by schools in New Rochelle and Mount Vernon, focuses on the everyday decisions made by youngsters as both students and consumers. During one workshop activity, teachers like Deborah DeFrancesco, a sixth-grade language arts and social studies teacher at the Crittendon Middle School in Armonk, prepared to lead their own students in a consumer exercise by evaluating different brands of chocolate-chip cookies. Jeffrey Engel, a New Rochelle sixth-grade teacher who regularly leads the workshops, also discussed ways to show children that they are part of the economy.
The State Council initially received money from Albany to help prepare high school teachers for the required half semester of economics, but the organization, with 15 statewide centers, is now financed by corporate grants and other contributions. In explaining why the state discontinued its aid to the council, George M. Gregory, supervisor of educational programs for the State Education Department, said it was assumed that teachers certified in social studies were already knowledgeable about economics.
But Mr. Fitzpatrick, another social studies teacher at Lakeland High School who studied with Dr. Bell this summer, said that assumption was wrong. "I found it curious that the state would think one summer of economics would prepare anyone to teach the course," he said, referring to the early workshops co-sponsored by the state and the council. "Most teachers had only one economics course 25 or 30 years ago. We needed a set of mathematical and analytical skills that most of us didn't have."
 
A Focus on Broader Human Issues
 He and Ms. Purcigliotti said they had been reassured by Dr. Bell's easygoing approach to the subject and stimulated by his nontraditional views. He told them not to worry about graphs and charts and concentrate on the choices that would affect students' lives.
The professor, who came to the United States as a graduate student, said he was troubled by economists who measure development with "tunnel vision," focusing on "figures, data and gross national product" instead of broader human issues.
His view of Thailand, where he spent more than three years doing research, he said, is that "maldevel-opment and exploitation" have brought success to some at the expense of many, especially women. Dr. Bell, a frequent world traveler who speaks five languages, including Thai, is working to incorporate race and sexual politics into a standard economics curriculum, which he says wrongly inhibits both.
Dr. Bell, who has won both the SUNY Chancellor's Award for excellence in teaching and the Outstanding Service Award of the Westchester Council for the Social Studies, calls himself a political economist, which he defines as one who "looks at the economy as part of a larger set of social institutions that involve questions of power and class," in the tradition of economists like Adam Smith and John Kenneth Galbraith.
"I see the world in a very holistic way," Dr. Bell said. "Everything radiates out from economics, but not everything is explicable in terms of economics."

HEADLINE: 'Good' Jobs in Hard Times

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
ALMOST unnoticed, discount retailers like Wal-Mart, Kmart, Target, Venture and Home Depot are becoming a huge source of new employment in America. The jobs they offer, mostly at $5 to $9 an hour, would have been unappealing in another era. But in these hard times, the low hourly pay -- sweetened with health insurance and profit sharing -- is turning out to be one of the best deals that corporate America is offering to the mass of Americans looking for "good" jobs.
Leading this process is Wal-Mart, the nation's second-biggest private employer, after General Motors. In the 30 months since the recession ended, no other company has added so many jobs to the national work force as has Wal-Mart: 153,000 of them, a significant contribution to the net increase of 1.9 million jobs created in the United States during the recovery. The other 165 or so discount retail chains together accounted for an additional 186,000 jobs, according to Chain Store Guide, a trade publication, which gathers such data. The Labor Department does not track employment at discount stores. 
 As the discounters expand, opening hundreds of barn-like stores to meet the demand for low-priced merchandise from Americans pinched by stagnant incomes, many other industries shrink and lay off workers -- including traditional higher-priced retailers hurt in the competition with Wal-Mart and the others. That gives the discounters a huge pool of idle people from which to choose. The stores report that 5 to 10 people, many of them experienced and skilled, compete for each job. Home Depot, for example, hires carpenters, plumbers and electricians as sales people for its home improvement centers.
The proliferation of discount store employees is a far cry from the Clinton Administration's vision of highly paid technicians proliferating in high-tech industries. But Robert Hall, a Stanford University economist, hails the expansion of the discounters as "a tremendously important development because it is providing jobs to the high-school educated who in the past worked in factories and trades."
 
On the Retail Floor
 Visits to various Wal-Mart stores turned up workers who fit Professor Hall's description, and then some. There is Richard Moyer, who once studied architecture and now manages the gardening department at a Wal-Mart in Fayetteville, Ark. There is Mary Meyers, who lost her job as an I.B.M. technician and now sells accessories and lingerie at Wal-Mart's month-old outlet in Fishkill, N.Y. And there is Carolyn Dagit, who once ran a convenience store and is now a customer service manager at the store in Bentonville, Ark., where Wal-Mart has its headquarters. She switched for Wal-Mart's better benefits package. All earn less than $8 an hour.
While Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich is the Administration's point man in the campaign for more high-tech, high-wage industries, he nevertheless blesses the discount store employment trend. "The best retail sales jobs are not like the old sales jobs at all," he said, "and we should not be prejudiced against retail jobs because of old pictures in our heads of workers doing drone work. The proper distinction is not between manufacturing and retail, but between jobs that demand skills and expertise and those that don't."
The discounters are not the only vigorous job creators. Some other industries, among them restaurants, health care and temporary employment, have generated even more jobs than the discounters. These jobs also are low paying, but most lack the standard benefits package that has emerged among the discounters.
The discounters, in effect, are becoming the "factories" of the 90's, from an employment viewpoint. They are providing a new version of the full-time jobs with benefits that millions of blue-collar Americans found in manufacturing in former decades -- although this emerging "safe harbor" offers just a shadow of the wages, benefits and security that were commonplace in manufacturing.
Full-time in discount retailing means 28 to 30 hours a week, not the minimum of 35 to 40 hours that is still standard in manufacturing. The shorter week is used, in part, to give flexibility to raise a worker's hours in busy periods without paying overtime rates, which kick in at 40 hours.
While manufacturers, prodded by unions, pay all or most of the premiums for company-sponsored health insurance, workers at discount retailers, where unions are rare, pay a bigger share, typically 30 percent. That can be $80 a month for a family policy, a considerable sum for a person earning $6 or $7 an hour. Some don't take the insurance. At Wal-Mart, where 335,000 of the company's 490,000 employees are full-timers and thus eligible for health insurance, just 250,000 take it.
In moving toward higher employment levels, the discounters are adopting labor practices that run counter to trends elsewhere in corporate America. While many companies have hired more part-timers, discounters have concluded that sales clerks and cashiers are more enthusiastic about customers if they are full-timers. So full-time employment, as the discounters define it, has risen to between 60 percent and 70 percent of all employees at companies like Wal-Mart, Kmart and Target, from 50 percent five years ago. But should sales weaken, hours can be adjusted downward so an employee could become a part time, losing health insurance and pay. (Wal-Mart acknowledged that this can happen, but a spokeswoman said the company responds to sales downturns by cutting part-timers' hours, not full-timers'.)
 
Adding People
 The discounters are also running counter to corporate America in layoffs. Instead of getting more sales from fewer workers -- the norm in manufacturing -- sales and employment rise in tandem at many discounters, on the theory that one requires the other. In the discount store culture there must be enough sales people, for example, to be within call of a customer needing help.
Neat shelves also boost sales, Wal-Mart contends. That means enough sales clerks to constantly straighten merchandise in stores that cover 90,000 square feet or more and display 50,000 different items.
Late one recent afternoon, Michael Campbell, manager of Wal-Mart's Bentonville store, took a visitor through the food produce department, where after a day of shopping shiny apples were still arranged in unbroken pyramids, and watermelons, sliced open, were displayed in geometric patterns on tilted beds of ice, their juicy red innards drawing customers. "We have five people in produce through most of the day to make it look as if the store just opened," Mr. Campbell said.
And if more than three people are lined up at checkout counters, another line must be opened to reduce the waiting time, or sales will drop, Wal-Mart executives say.
The Wal-Mart store in the Regency Shopping Center near St. Louis shows the results of these strategies. The staff has grown to 225 from 180 two years ago, with no increase in floor space.
But if the discounters are engaged in rapid hiring, they certainly are not engaged in raising wage levels. The very success of discount retailing in an era of straitened circumstances depends on translating some profits into lower prices rather than higher wages -- a process Professor Hall describes as "raising the real incomes of Americans by delivering goods to them at lower prices."
Raises for workers come, instead, through profit sharing. Full-timers are eligible, as are part-timers, at most discounters if they work at least 20 hours a week. Typically, the profit sharing is an annual award of company stock equal to 6 percent of a worker's pay. But between job turnover and low pay, just 7,018 of Wal-Mart's employees have accumulated $50,000 or more worth of stock.
"That is not a lot of employees," said Charles Rateliff, vice president of benefits. "One reason is that when people accumulate enough stock they often leave and use the money to start a business."
The workers -- more than a dozen were interviewed in visits to Wal-Mart stores -- express resignation at their circumstances. They also express hope that Wal-Mart's expansion will bring them promotions, more money, and gratitude for the Wal-Mart culture of customer service. Since the latter requires worker initiative, Wal-Mart pays attention to employee morale, trying to squeeze smiles and loyalty from workers whose incomes have deteriorated.
"A lot of our people came to us from jobs that paid more; that is true," said Donald G. Soderquist, Wal-Mart's vice chairman. "But we say to a department head, for example, 'You are running a store within a store.' That is important and it makes people feel better."
 
Big Cut in Pay
 Certainly, customer service is a lot easier to generate at Wal-Mart's Fiesta Plaza store in Fayetteville, with people like Mr. Moyer, 53, the garden department manager. Most of his career had been spent at a trucking company, where he calculated complicated cargo rates. But the company went bankrupt in 1987, and with three children still in school, Mr. Moyer joined Wal-Mart, first as a freight handler, at less than half his old pay of $12 an hour. In time, he moved up to gardening manager, earning today $7 to $8 an hour (he won't be more specific).
"I can do a lot of purchasing on my own, as long as I can sell what I buy," Mr. Moyer said, noting with pride that over the last month he has purchased 1,200 chrysanthemum plants, quickly reselling all of them. But while he speaks well of Wal-Mart, Mr. Moyer, who dropped out of college after two years, stops short of saying he is happy with his lot.
"Sometimes there are no jobs, and then when the opportunity comes to be with a solid company, you better take it," he said.
Ms. Meyers, the former I.B.M. employee who joined Wal-Mart in Fishkill in July, takes a more ambitious tack. She says she is determined to rise in the company, even if that means relocating to one of the newly opened Wal-Mart stores. Having slowly worked her way up at I.B.M. during 21 years there, she found herself forced out. So Ms. Meyers, who is in her early 40's, joined Wal-Mart's store in Fishkill, 50 miles north of Manhattan and the first in the New York area. There she earns $7 to $8 an hour. She, too, resists being more specific about her pay, but acknowledges that it is less than half her I.B.M. wage.
From being a technician at I.B.M. learning to be a computer programmer, she took a buyout ("It was only a matter of time before the job disappeared," she said) and went to Wal-Mart as manager of accessories and lingerie -- joining 30 other former I.B.M. employees who now help to staff the Fishkill store.
"I believe you have to crawl before you walk, and I don't mind if I have to go down a little and then work my way up again," Ms. Meyers said. "I saw that I could do that at I.B.M., and now I want to do it here."
But what if Wal-Mart, like I.B.M., pushes her out before she gets to the next steps up, which are assistant store manager, at $23,000 to $25,000 a year, and store manager, at up to $60,000 a year in base salary.
"I never, never thought that I.B.M. would lay me off, and it took 21 years for that to happen," Ms. Meyers said. "Now I want to work somewhere for at least a good five years, and I think that is possible at Wal-Mart."
 
Looking for Benefits
 The big draw for Ms. Dagit, who became an employee 18 months ago, was Wal-Mart's benefits, which are similar to those at other discount retailers. She is now a customer service manager in the Bentonville store. Ms. Dagit, who is 33, had managed an E-Z Mart convenience store, earning $5.60 an hour plus health insurance, but none of the other benefits that Wal-Mart offers, among them profit sharing, dental care up to $1,000 a year, life insurance and paid vacations (a week after one year, two weeks after two years, three weeks after seven years).
With these benefits as a lure -- and the prospect of more weekends off -- Ms. Dagit took a cut in pay and joined Wal-Mart as a cashier at $4.50 an hour. Now she is up to $5.25, and is hoping to rise to $6 as a supervisor of customer service managers.
But very few hourly workers get beyond $7 an hour in Arkansas and other rural areas, or beyond $9 an hour in metropolitan areas. Robert Schleicher, manager of the Fishkill store, says he has only one employee beyond that range, a woman hired away from another discounter to run the ladies' wear operation, at $10.25 an hour. And Mr. Campbell, the Bentonville store manager, mentions pharmacists and skilled butchers as people who can get even $15 an hour.
Karen Singer, 44, a sales clerk in the fabrics department at the Wal-Mart store at the Regency Shopping Center near St. Louis, is not near that level of pay, despite her skills as a lace-maker. Having worked very little while she raised two sons, she joined Wal-Mart in July, at $5 an hour, out of concern that her husband might lose his $16-an-hour factory job at McDonnell Douglas.
"A lot of my husband's friends have been laid off and they tell him there is nothing out there, no jobs," Ms. Singer said. "But the company now says that they won't close his factory, so I am buying a car with my salary rather than put it in savings."
 
The Going Rate
 That salary will go to $5.60 an hour soon, mainly because the company has decided that $5 is not enough to hold new employees like Ms. Singer at a store that is just a few miles from downtown St. Louis. The minimum starting pay at Fishkill is $6 an hour, under the Wal-Mart policy of paying just above the going rate in any market for competent people.
"We hire no one at the minimum wage; we base our pay on the marketplace," said Mr. Soderquist, the vice chairman. "If Kmart is paying $5 an hour, we'll play $5.25 or $5.50; and if the competitors are paying $4.50, we'll pay $5." The minimum wage is $4.25.
Similarly, Kmart and other discounters claim to be paying above Wal-Mart. But only Home Depot's pay scale is significantly higher, with wages of $10 an hour or more to attract carpenters and plumbers -- an outlay that is offset by offering slightly less in benefits.
"People doing the same sort of work in France, Belgium or Germany get much higher wages than Americans," said Richard Freeman, a Harvard labor economist. "In France, no one earns less than 60 percent of the average manufacturing wage, but here it is 40 percent."
For Mr. Freeman, the lack of union representation helps to explain the disparity. But American union leaders say discount retailers like Wal-Mart, with nearly 2,000 stores, are hard to organize store by store. In fact, the discounters have hurt the unions, having forced out of business some higher-priced retailers with union workers.
So the unions take an indirect approach, trying to stir public opinion against the discounters by accusing them of such things as buying too much merchandise abroad.
As for organizing workers, "we think it is better to wait until the climate is right and the workers come to us," said Charles Mercer, an executive of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. The right time will come, he said, when the discounters' rapid growth slows, workers find their hours cut back and profit sharing is hurt by falling stock prices, which happened to Wal-Mart's stock this year.
"One reason the workers have not come to us is the profit-sharing," Mr. Mercer said. "It has worked; you cannot deny that."
 
 
 
DO CHAINS COST JOBS?
 THE discount retailers are expanding by hundreds of stores a year. That is a fact.
But Americans have not spent more in recent years to purchase all the merchandise that the nation's retailers -- discounters and traditional stores alike -- offer. That is also a fact.
So, if the discounters are adding huge quantities to the national pile of merchandise, and selling it, then the traditional merchandisers must be losing sales, and even going out of business -- particularly stores on downtown squares in hundreds of rural towns.
That conclusion may be logical, but it does not get by as uncontested fact. "If someone wants to compete against us on Crest toothpaste, we'll win," said Don Soderquist, Wal-Mart's vice chairman, "but if they offer a better quality of fabric than we do, or name-brand clothing that we don't have, then they can merchandise around us, and they do."
Many local retailers disagree. They argue that no matter how clever they are, they cannot compete against the discounters' efficient, low-priced operations, or their huge selection of goods.
Kenneth Stone, an Iowa State University economist who has studied the Wal-Mart phenomenon, supports this contention.
"The damage is done three or four years down the road," he said. "Wal-Mart increased the jobs initially in Iowa, but out of 43 Wal-Marts in the state, one-fourth of the towns near them now have smaller commercial areas.
"What happens is that Wal-Mart has a saturation strategy," he added. "They come in with stores 60 miles apart and then they are 10 to 12 miles apart. About three years after a Wal-Mart opens, stores near it begin to close."

HEADLINE: World Markets;
A New Coffee Cartel Tries Its Hand

BYLINE: By James Brooke

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO

 BODY:
WORLD coffee producers could well have cheered last week: "King Coffee is dead -- long live King Coffee."
On Monday, the United States pulled out of the International Coffee Organization, driving a coffin nail into the 30-year-old consumer and producer forum. 
 Rising two weeks ago to take the place of that forum, the Association of Coffee Producing Countries started Friday to shore up prices by holding back 20 percent of its planned exports. Formed in Brasilia, the group of 28 coffee-growing nations produces 85 percent of the world crop.
But will a coffee cartel bring stability and stronger prices to a volatile market?
After the last International Coffee Agreement expired in July 1989, prices plunged, hitting a historic low of 48 cents a pound in August 1992. Prices rallied to 84 cents last December, then fell to 52 cents in April.
After the Association of Coffee Producing Countries started to take shape three months ago, prices increased by about 40 percent. Last week, prices declined 9.4 percent, with coffee for December delivery closing on Friday at 73.50 cents a pound, compared with 81.10 cents a pound a week earlier.
"It's been a case of buy on rumor, sell on fact," said Lawrence Eagles, a coffee analyst for GNI Ltd., a London futures broker. "Now the market is looking at the negative side, saying stocks are high. We don't know if this retention scheme will hold."
Mr. Eagles predicted that coffee prices would hover around 70 cents a pound during the next few weeks.
From New York, Sandra Kaul, an industry analyst at Smith, Barney Shearson, predicted that coffee would rise to the 90-cent level in November and December, peak demand months in the Northern Hemisphere.
"Last year, there was a low crop," Ms. Kaul said. "This year, production did not rebound as expected."
Indeed, more powerful than a retention plan run largely on the honor system, international coffee supply is drifting down to meet demand. In Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer and a nation in which 10 million people work in the coffee industry, low prices have had catastrophic effects. Since prices started to tumble four years ago, an estimated 2 million coffee workers have lost their jobs and about 20 percent of the nation's coffee bushes have been uprooted. Economists here say Brazil has lost $2.5 billion because of low prices.
Protesting worldwide producer losses of an estimated $10 billion since 1989, demonstrators last week marched outside the London headquarters of the International Coffee Organization. The protesters carried an enormous, empty coffee cup.
Brazil has seen its production drop by about 23 percent in four years, from 31 million sacks to an estimated 24 million sacks in the crop year that officially ended on Thursday. Each sack weighs 132 pounds.
Colombia, the world's second-largest producer, has registered a drop of about 19 percent. From a record crop of 18 million bags three years ago, Colombia's crop this year was 14.6 million bags, the country's National Federation of Coffee Growers said on Friday.
In Africa, the world's second-largest coffee producing area, production has fallen by about 17 percent over the last six years. Production in Asia and Central America has remained relatively stable over recent years.
"World coffee production is now inferior to world consumption," said Manoel Vicente Bertone, president of Brazil's National Coffee Council, a producers' group.
Mr. Bertone said he was not fazed by the high level of coffee stocks in consumer nations. These stocks are currently about 19 million bags, virtually double normal levels.
"This excess is concentrated in the United States," he said in reference to stocks that are considered adequate to supply American coffee drinkers for a six-month period. "But the Europeans and the Japanese will have to buy. World coffee prices will easily rise to 90 cents."
At that level, coffee producers will not have to worry about the enforceability of their retention plan.
Under the plan, which was adopted on Sept. 24, member countries are expected to retain 20 percent of what they exported between last Friday and Oct. 28. After that, the plan will be regulated by a 20-day average of coffee prices.
If the average price falls below 75 cents a pound, countries plan to continue to hold back 20 percent of their anticipated exports. If prices are between 75 cents and 80 cents a pound, they plan to hold back 10 percent. Above 80 cents, they plan no retention.
"We want stability and prices above 80 cents -- below 80 cents, we lose money," said Salim Janna, North American representative of Colombia's coffee growers' federation. About 10 percent of Colombia's 33 million people depend on coffee for their livelihood.
To put teeth into the plan, the Association of Coffee Producing Countries plans to select an auditing company in October to monitor whether each member country is complying. Under a punishment system, a producing country that violates the agreement would have to retain twice as much coffee during the next quarter.
"The market wants to see how solid the retention scheme really is," said Mr. Eagles, who noted that the International Coffee Organization used to involve consumer countries in policing producers' export quotas. "Without consumer involvement, this is an honesty plan."

 BODY:

THE ECONOMY
 
Can Anything Resist Hillary Clinton? Time Will Tell
 
An irresistible force met an immovable body last week; at press time, the world had not ended. First, one very powerful force, Hillary Rodham Clinton by name, stormed Capitol Hill in search of support for "health security," and even the crustiest of pols were moved to applaud her. But a day later the health plan hit a wall called the American Medical Association. After working quietly to shape the plan, the A.M.A. suddenly went public with a long list of gripes, complaining, for example, that "physicians will be given financial incentives to provide less care." Lawmakers no doubt heard this loud and clear, for doctors are big political contributors. Well, no one said it would be easy. 

The Open Road Inc.
 
This doesn't make sense. Our Government tells us that a private health care system has failed and that Washington can do it better. But in the next breath the Government -- in the person of Rodney Slater, its top highway official -- proposed last week that private businesses run parts of the Interstate System, using tolls to pay for repairs. In other words, bureaucracy-laden Uncle Sam cannot possibly do it as efficiently as the private sector can. So, does the Government know how to do things or not? Maybe this is the answer: All involved say privatizing the highways -- which has the backing of Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena -- would mean higher tolls. So when drivers start yelling, Washington -- which gets yelled at for everything else -- would be able to smile innocently and point the finger at Acme Tunnels and Tolls Inc.
 
Mending the U.S. Pension Net
 
First, health security; now the Administration wants citizens to have pension security, too. They certainly don't have it now. Pension underfunding -- the gap between pension promises and pension cash -- stands at about $45 billion, mainly in industries like steel and autos. And if the burden falls on the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, that badly drained Federal agency could be ripe for a bailout. Last week Labor Secretary Robert Reich proposed legislation to strengthen pension insurance by raising premiums for the weakest plans. But the delicate problem is that companies with the weakest plans can least afford a premium increase.
 
Efficient Cars: The U.S. Signs On
 
As you pay your income taxes, do you ever think wistfully of those billions that vanished into "Star Wars" or other ultrafancy cold-war weapons? The Government wants to do a bit of recycling. Last week the White House and the Big Three auto makers put their wrenches together and said that if Washington gave Detroit that weapons technology and other help, Detroit would try, within a decade, to build cars with triple the current fuel mileage. That's quite a vision. After all, fuel economy hasn't really budged in eight years. But that just shows the old ways don't work. This is different, said Al Gore. "It's an act of patriotism but also an act of good business sense." But will Washington ways work on an assembly line? And with gas fairly cheap, is there any clamor for a fuel-efficient car?
 
. . . and Bass Created Biosphere
 
What can you buy with billions in oil money? Almost anything you want, which Edward Bass proved by financing Biosphere 2, a bizarre sealed-off world in the Arizona desert. Last week eight people emerged from that world, a lot thinner, after two years. What did Mr. Bass's $150 million investment prove? That this pocket planet needed no outside air (except for 600,000 cubic feet pumped in). That biospherians needed no outside food (except for some they'd tucked away) and were self-sufficient (except for emergency supplies). If this "laboratory for the study of ecology" proved one thing, it was that cockroaches, which did just fine, are better equipped to inherit the earth. But we knew that.
 
Economy May Be Set to Budge
 
The economy has been neither fish nor fowl lately -- recovering, yes, but with the gains often invisible to the naked eye. It could get a bit better. The Government's index of leading indicators -- designed to show where we're heading in six months or so -- posted a strong 1 percent rise in August, the broadest rise in six and a half years. But not all numbers were so good. A purchasing managers' index rose less than expected, while factory-goods orders recovered only modestly. What it adds up to is that "the economy's expanding, but not at a rate that will make us feel good," as one economist put it. The stock market felt a bit better, though, as the leading indicators helped the Dow to a 25-point rise on Friday.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Mint Juleps for Mercedes
 
Mercedes-Benz. Tuscaloosa, Ala. They just don't sound right together. The glamour, the coldly efficient German engineering, just don't seem to fit at the down-home heart of the American South. But look at it this way: Cheap land, skilled workers, a beehive of auto-parts makers nearby, the huge American market all around. That's the way Mercedes looked at it, announcing last week that it would build its first American automobile assembly plant near Tuscaloosa. Its labor costs will be much lower than in Germany, and since it will build sport-utility vehicles at the plant, it will avoid 25 percent tariffs. And it was a prize for Alabama, which won out over many other states. The plant will employ 1,500, plus create thousands of other jobs.
 
Rice to Newcastle
 
The symbolism must have been painful. As if its economy didn't have enough troubles, Japan said last week that its rice crop had let it down. Japan has always protected its politically powerful rice growers, whose farms are so small and inefficient, and whose prices so high, that they would never withstand true competition. But poor weather hurt the crop, and Japan said it would have to import a million tons of rice in the next year. It's a risky precedent, because America would love to get its fork in this particular door. But that's not what Japan has in mind. "This is absolutely, positively an emergency measure," said Agriculture Minister Eijiro Hata.
 
COMPANIES
 
New York Post (the Mini-Series)
 
There's a new suspense show on prime time, "Will The New York Post Survive?" Each week, after six minutes of sex and car chases, a crisis erupts -- the latest owner is bankrupt, a union goes on strike, you name it. A familiar montage: Presses shudder to a stop, editors clean out desks. Drum roll, with cellos. Is it over? First, this commercial. At the last minute, a deal is reached, the presses roll. In last week's episode, the Newspaper Guild, balking at a contract that would leave members open to dismissal without severance pay, went on strike, other unions refused to cross picket lines, and Rupert Murdoch said it was all over. Presses stopped. Commercial. Then Mr. Murdoch got other unions to cross guild picket lines, and The Post came out again. Next: "Revenge of the Guild"?
 
Everyone, it seems, is angling to be a guest star on this show. (Various local comedians have done cameos as prospective owners.) After Gabe Doppelt resigned last week as editor of Mademoiselle, she was asked of her plans and replied, "Oh, a hostile bid for Paramount. Maybe buy The New York Post."
 
A Law Firm Pays Its S.& L. Dues
 
Ever since the savings and loan mess unfolded, the Government has been trying to recoup a few cents on each of the billions of lost dollars. It has turned over stone after stone, suing savings officials with sticky fingers, going after accountants whose magnifying glasses were smudged. It has pursued lawyers, too, and last week Resolution Trust reached one of its largest settlements with a law firm, as Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison agreed to put $45 million into the kitty. The deal involved the firm's role in junk-bond investing by Centrust of Miami, which went down in $1.5 billion of flames.
 
Opening South Africa's Floodgates
 
American companies can't stand the thought of passing up a sizable foreign market, so many did not wait for an official invitation to go back to South Africa as apartheid started crumbling. But the official invitation just came, when Nelson Mandela formally called for the end of trade sanctions, and now American investment could turn into a flood. Last week came the first drop in that flood, as Pillsbury said it would create a joint venture with Foodcorp, a leading South African food company, to make and market Pillsbury products. The deal had been negotiated in recent months, but Pillsbury held back on making it final until Mr. Mandela spoke.
 
The Battle for Paramount
 
So where do things stand on the big-bucks race to buy Paramount? Let's see. Paramount still wants to merge with Viacom, but Viacom needs to do better than $7.6 billion. It did get Blockbuster Entertainment to chip in $600 million, but that still leaves it short of QVC's $9.8 billion rival bid. Paramount, perhaps stalling, told QVC to prove it can pay, and QVC may be about to do so. Stay tuned.
 
Little Airline, Big Lessons
 
Here's one tail that just keeps wagging the dog. Every discussion of the airline industry, it seems, comes down to Southwest Airlines: We have to learn from Southwest. We have to find a way to compete with Southwest. Here it goes again. Last week United's flight attendants, criticizing the carrier for opening a base for flight attendants in Taiwan, pulled out of a union coalition formed to gain control of the carrier. Though the pilots and machinists could go ahead on their own, the move deals a heavy blow to that effort, one that would lead to quick, badly needed savings in labor costs. Why is that so vital just now? Because, yes, United has to compete with expanding low-cost carriers -- like Southwest.

HEADLINE: In a Bid for Casinos, Chicago Comes Up With Snake-Eyes

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
THE tune is familiar, but instead of the lyric "Chicago, Chicago, that toddlin' town . . . ," the advertisement radio listeners throughout the upper Midwest are hearing says, "Aurora, Aurora, that Hollywood town. . . ."
The advertisement aims to lure gamblers to the Hollywood Casino's two new river boats based in a middle-class suburb about an hour's drive west of here on the Fox River. But the casino's snatching of Chicago's semi-official theme song is a grating reminder that the city's political and business leaders have thus far been powerless to win Chicago a piece of the action as casino gambling spreads throughout the Midwest. 
 Not that Chicago hasn't tried mightily to put itself at the center of the gambling map. The city's effort has been led for the last two years by some of the most powerful gambling and hotel companies in the nation, and Mayor Richard M. Daley, who once opposed downtown casinos, is backing it. Their initial plan, introduced nearly a year and a half ago, was for a $2 billion gambling and family entertainment complex to be built by Caesars World, Circus Circus Enterprises, Hilton Hotels and other private investors. Lately, there have been more modest proposals too, like putting casinos on local river boats.
But the plans have disappeared into the political swampland of Springfield, the state capital, where Gov. Jim Edgar has firmly opposed lifting a ban on casinos on land and, at best, has shown lukewarm support for their floating cousins.
Chicago will try again when the state legislature reconvenes late this month or early in November following a special session; the legislature is currently wrestling with a financing gap that threatens to close Chicago's schools. The city will be pushing for permission to license up to five river boats.
In the long run, industry analysts figure that Chicago is bound to secure at least river boat gambling. With about 8 million residents in its metropolitan area, its status as one of the nation's top destinations for tourist and business travelers, and its location about halfway between Atlantic City and Las Vegas, Chicago has jackpot potential for the $10 billion casino gambling industry.
"People realized that New Orleans would open up next after Atlantic City because of political support, but there is no comparison with Chicago," said J. Terrence Lanni, president of Caesars World. Mr. Lanni said Chicago's pluses also include the renown of its sports franchises.
Wall Street analysts made preliminary estimates that the $2 billion complex proposed last year -- if it had been quickly approved -- could have added 10 percent to Hilton's earnings per share by 1995, in part because of cross-marketing with the three major hotels here. Some saw the potential for a 20 percent increase in earnings per share last year for Circus Circus, a smaller company that now owns and operates casinos in Las Vegas, Reno and Laughlin, Nev.
The spillover from such profits would be thousands of new jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars annually in tax revenues. That promise has become steadily more tantalizing for Mayor Daley and other civic leaders as other development schemes, such as a proposed airport at the southeast edge of the city, have encountered roadblocks.
"It's not a question of if Chicago emerges as the third major center -- it's just a matter of when," said Marvin Roffman, a Philadelphia-based investment adviser who has followed the gambling industry for 15 years. He said the city will lose out on becoming such a center if some scandal, perhaps involving organized crime, restores the political clout of those morally opposed to gambling.
But timing may make all the difference in the extent of downtown development. Indiana recently approved licensing of 11 river boats, including 5 that will serve the Chicago region by sailing on Lake Michigan from cities in the northwest corner of the state. Other projects are also nibbling at the fringes of the market the gambling industry sees Chicago serving. There are plans to develop a land-based casino in Windsor, Ontario, just across the Detroit River from Detroit; Missouri's decision last spring to legalize river boat gambling at several sites, including St. Louis; the rapid growth of casinos on Indian reservations in Minnesota and Wisconsin, and New Orleans' entry into gambling.
"If you have 20 regional places, the one grand one may never get built," said Michael Sloan, the general counsel at Circus Circus and a key negotiator for the plan presented to Chicago last year.
Ceasars, Circus Circus and Hilton originally proposed developing more than 100 acres in an unspecified area near the heart of the city. Each partner planned to build a major casino and counted on a fourth casino being built by local investors or another big gambling company. About 80 percent of the site was to be set aside for parks, restaurants and sporting facilities, such as ice rinks and miniature-golf courses, and for such family entertainment as the "Back to the Future" ride at the Universal Studios park in Orlando, Fla.
The earliest versions of the plan also envisioned new hotels. That element was scaled back to win the support of Chicago's current hotel owners, many of whom are suffering from occupancy rates below 65 percent.
A series of conceptual designs was created by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the Chicago architectural firm famous for such skyscrapers as the John Hancock Building and the Sears Tower. Skidmore said it drew inspiration from Copenhagen's Tivoli Gardens, Les Halles market in Paris, the Galleria shopping district of Milan and Midway Gardens, the entertainment complex that became one of the city's major attractions shortly after World War I and that was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.
"This was going to be an international tourist attraction as opposed to just another amenity, which is what you have with the river boats going in at St. Louis now," said Mark Grossman, a spokesman for Hilton.
The three gambling companies also emphasized that International Entertainment Center, as they called the plan, could be financed entirely by private investment. They released a study by Arthur Andersen asserting that the project would bring 10.2 million new visitors to the city annually, encourage the nearly 12.5 million tourists who already visit (and who stay longer than those visiting on business), lift state and local tax revenues by $625 million and create 66,000 jobs. An additional 37,500 workers would be employed in construction.
Such figures won over Mayor Daley and impressed many local business executives.
"It wasn't a full-court press, but it was a pretty serious effort," said Jerry Pearlman, chairman and chief executive of the Zenith Electronics Corporation, recalling the business community's lobbying for the plan.
It was not serious enough to shake Governor Edgar's firm stand against repealing Illinois' ban on land-based casinos. He and other opponents quickly responded with surveys of their own suggesting that the benefits to Chicago would be largely offset by losses to the already licensed river boat operations, the state lottery, and restaurants and other businesses that would face new competition.
"When you looked at it on a statewide basis, there was good reason to be suspicious," said John Rau, an economic development adviser to Governor Edgar who recently became dean of the Indiana University School of Business. "The support was broad because the Mayor had cast it as a vital issue, and a lot of people have to live with him -- but it wasn't deep. There was more income transfer than wealth creation."
The drive to lift the ban died in November without reaching a vote in the legislature after Democrats realized they would not be able to override Governor Edgar's threatened veto. Attention then focused on the Governor's hints that he might be receptive to a river boat proposal.
Mayor Daley responded derisively, questioning the difference between land-based casinos and gambling on boats that are essentially immobile. This year, though, as Chicago's schools face a widening budget gap, the Mayor endorsed the plan for up to five casino boats that is about to go before the legislature.
The Mayor's $800 million plan for an as yet undetermined Chicago River site envisions building some of the same types of entertainment facilities sketched out in the Skidmore drawings, then docking the gambling boats next to them. Others simply argue that Chicago should get one or more river boats into the water, and worry about related development later.
Thus far, the prospects that any plan will emerge from the Byzantine wheeling and dealing this fall in Springfield look dicey. Suburban and downstate legislators in districts with river boats want more time for those operations to build a regular clientele before Chicago is allowed to compete. Chicago's lobbyists also must contend with the determination of other legislators to load any bill authorizing river boats for the city with projects for their districts. That could create such a pork-laden bill that Governor Edgar, a Republican who is expected to seek re-election next year, could veto it without appearing to be unconcerned about the economic plight of heavily Democratic Chicago.
"All you can say about Chicago is we gave it a good shot," Mr. Lanni of Caesars World said, "and we'll be back."
 
 
 
PLAYING THE RIVERS OF CASH
THE more than 20 river boats already plying the Mississippi and other rivers in the Midwest are expected to generate more than $1 billion in revenues this year -- 40 percent more than is generated in Atlantic City.
The first successful river boat in the Chicago region was the Empress, which cruises the muddy Des Plaines River in rundown Joliet, less than an hour's drive southwest of Chicago's Loop.
The Empress has been taking in more than $15 million a month.
The Promus Corporation, which is based in Memphis and owns two other river boats based in Joliet -- the Northern Star and Southern Star -- expressed mixed feelings about Chicago's drive to get in on the action.
"When you think about how big the Chicago market is, the demand is nowhere near being satisfied," said Ralph Berry, a spokesman for Promus.
"Opening up downtown Chicago would accelerate the splintering, but it would be a different product from Joliet," Mr. Berry added. "We hope it would be open for competitive bidding because we would want to participate."
Mr. Berry noted that one reason for the state to go slowly in Chicago was that the other river boats have not been open long enough to fulfill Illinois' goal of "building up rural tourism."
The Joliet boat owners' perspectives are no doubt influenced by their plans for river boat gambling in Indiana.
Promus is bidding for a license in Indiana, and the investor group that owns the Empress hopes to grab another chunk of the Chicago market with a $100 million river-boat and shore-based casino and entertainment project, scheduled to go before the voters in Hammond, which is just east of Joliet, in November.

Health Care: Loser With a Future?

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
SO far this year, the only losing group among domestic stock funds has been the health-and-biotechnology category.
All the other 15 stock fund categories tracked by Morningstar Inc., a research company in Chicago, have produced positive returns since January. In the latest three months, the average domestic stock fund rose 5.3 percent, yielding a gain of 10.5 percent from January through September. 
 Gold funds were the biggest winners over the nine months, up 45.3 percent, although gold began losing ground in the third quarter. Following them were the Pacific stock funds (up 36.8 percent since January), foreign stock funds (up 25.7 percent) and natural resource funds (up 23.1 percent).
But health-and-biotechnology funds fell 5.3 percent in the last nine months. Since July, the health-and-biotechnology group rose only 2.6 percent, as investors waited out the uncertainty of the Clinton health care plan.
Health care stocks have been laggards since January 1992, after a stunning run that yielded average returns for health care funds of nearly 45 percent a year from 1989 through 1991.
Now the managers say the bad news may be over. "There's a good chance that underperformance has run its course -- the economy is not strong and health care is resistant to the economic cycle," said Edward P. Owens, who runs the $540 million Vanguard Specialized Portfolio: Health Care.
Moreover, the Clinton plan "was the event that Wall Street was waiting for," said Joanne Soja, who took over the $765 million Putnam Health Sciences Trust in August. "Now that we know what the worst case is, we can start looking at stocks again."
The plan probably will not have an immediate impact, the managers say, because it takes a broad approach and "the devil is in the details," Mr. Owens said. Also, it's likely that the plan will take the same tortured route through Congress as the Federal budget, yielding to compromises along the way.
Here is what the fund managers have to say about turning their group around:
Given that many large-capitalization health care stocks are near record lows, "I'm relatively sanguine," Mr. Owens said. Still, he finds foreign companies most attractive now. He noted that international stocks have underperformed for the last three years, so their valuations are better. A favorite: Zeneca, a British drug company created when Imperial Chemical Industries split into separate drug and chemical companies in June.
Jordan Schreiber, who manages the $120 million Merrill Lynch Healthcare Fund, has also been moving outside the United States. About 41 percent of the fund is invested overseas; its biggest holding is Roche Holding, the Swiss drug company. In the United States, he said, "large-capitalization drug companies have already been hit, probably more by market forces than the Administration's plan," and the damage is "ongoing and permanent." Some that he feels might survive an industry restructuring are Warner-Lambert, Merck and Carter-Wallace.
Mike Yellen, co-manager of the $4 million Franklin Global Health Care Fund, said he has avoided large-capitalization consumer drug companies because "their pricing flexibility is gone forever." Instead, he buys health maintenance organizations and generic drug companies to benefit from cost-containment trends. He likes Healthsource, a Concord, N.H.-based H.M.O.
Charles A. Mangum, manager of the $550 million Fidelity Select Health Care fund, compares the health care industry today to "the oil industry of the 1980's, one time perceived as strong growth companies." About half the fund is invested in drug companies; the three largest holdings are Schering-Plough, Warner-Lambert and Imcera. Lately, Mr. Mangum said he has been buying biotech stocks -- "which I've avoided for quite some time" -- bringing that sector up to 10 percent of the fund. He said he liked Chiron, which is preparing to market a treatment for multiple sclerosis, and Genentech, which has a cystic fibrosis drug up for approval by the Food and Drug Administration.
Ms. Soja, of Putnam, is focusing on companies that have a track record of dealing successfully with intense Government intervention. One favorite is Vivra, a dialysis company that has managed despite declining Government reimbursements. She has increased the fund's H.M.O. position and likes companies that will benefit from the trend to managed care. One favorite: Value Health, a specialty managed care company that helps corporations reduce the drug and mental health portions of their insurance costs.
Louis E. Salemy, who runs the $90 million Fidelity Select Medical Delivery fund, says H.M.O.'s and health insurers are likely to feel the most immediate impact from the Administration's plan. As a result, he is buying shares in companies that dominate local markets "because you have to control the market to maintain pricing power," he said. Hospital companies account for 30 percent of the fund. The biggest are the Hospital Corporation of America, Health Management Associates and Columbia Health Care.
The worst performer in the health-and-biotechnology category, the $529 million Invesco Strategic Health Sciences (down 15.9 percent since the beginning of the year), was hurt this year by a big position in Synergen. Still, fund co-manager John Kaweske is moving slowly back into biotech again, with a position in Creative Bio-Molecules.

HEADLINE: The Executive Computer;
From the Practical to the Fantastic, Books for the Beleaguered

BYLINE: By Peter H. Lewis

 BODY:
THERE is no reason, as millions of Americans head back to the classroom, that executives should not be hitting the books as well. Here are suggestions for what to do on long flights when the laptop battery, as usual, fails to fulfill its promised life.
"No Excuses Management: Proven Systems for Starting Fast, Growing Quickly and Surviving Hard Times," T. J. Rodgers, William Taylor and Rick Foreman ($35, Currency/Doubleday). 
 "A computer chip is the result of literally a thousand interdisciplinary tasks," the authors of this business boot camp manual assert. "Doing 999 of them right guarantees failure, not success."
There is nothing warm and fuzzy about the management philosophy of Mr. Rodgers, the founder of Cypress Semiconductor, and his co-authors. In Mr. Rodgers's neighborhood, the computer chip industry, the phrase "we're tough" was literally part of his company's original credo.
"No Excuses Management" is a fascinating look behind the scenes at a semiconductor company at a time when semiconductors are the strongest segment of the domestic economy. It is also intended to be a blueprint for other companies that want to be lean and mean.
Simply put, the management principles enumerated here are based on no, rather than yes: no secrets, no surprises, no politics, no distractions, no confusion, no waste, no illusions. And above all, no excuses. This philosophy loves winners and hates whiners.
A few years ago, when many people were wringing their hands about the suspected threat to America's high-technology industry posed by Japan, Mr. Rodgers was fixing bayonets and developing management systems that took no prisoners, even among his own staff. These systems have been encoded into computer programs that streamline the management process of setting goals and tracking progress.
A diskette containing demonstrations of two No Excuses Management programs is included with the book.
"Things That Make Us Smart: Defending Human Attributes in the Age of the Machine," Donald A. Norman ($22.95, Addison-Wesley).
The computer-driven, no-excuses management style espoused by Mr. Rodgers and his colleagues might strike some observers as cold and mechanical, which is exactly how some people view the information technologies that are entering the office and home.
Mr. Norman, one of the senior researchers at Apple Computer Inc. and the author of "The Design of Everyday Things," argues that we too often design systems around technology rather than around human qualities that are less precise and less repetitive than those of computers.
While Mr. Rodgers portrays executive decision-making as a logical process, Mr. Norman says it is often illogical, drawing on personal experience, analogies and serendipity. Automating the decision-making process in a company hinders the informal channels of communication that are, he contends, just as valid as purely logical systems, if not more so.
Unlike some thinkers, Mr. Norman does not advocate reducing the role of information technologies in the office. Rather, he suggests, these technologies must be redesigned to put humans, rather than computers, at the center.
"The Electronic Invasion: A Survival Guide for the Brave New World of Business Communications," Cheryl Currid ($26.95, Brady Books).
Many books advise technically savvy executives how to scale down their corporate computing to client-server networks, or similarly eyeball-glazing topics. Other books are aimed at "dummies," or novice PC users. Here is a book for executive dummies.
Some people may find it hard to believe that there are still some executives who have managed to remain untouched by local area networks, electronic mail, facsimile machines, voice mail, video teleconferencing and other electronic office tools.
Yet that is the audience Ms. Currid addresses in this friendly guidebook, which finds the neutral ground between the seemingly opposing philosophies of Mr. Rodgers and Mr. Norman.
Ms. Currid, a former director of applied information technology at Coca-Cola Foods, has written for the technologically timid. The book has all the warmth and fuzziness lacking in Mr. Rodgers's spartan tome, and the practical advice missing in "Things That Make Us Smart."
In other words, this is not a book for executives who write their own Lotus 1-2-3 macros or who travel with a bandoleer belt slung with EO Personal Communicators, cellular phones and digital beepers.
Instead, "The Electronic Invasion" addresses the things that make us feel dumb. There are basic explanations of how local area networks work, how to send effective electronic mail ("Don't send it when you are angry"), step-by-step plans to master the fax machine, and how to record a meaningful voice-mail message ("Write out your phone mail message before recording it").
Some advice will surely amuse or annoy seasoned computer users. But it will provide comfort to those executives who have been waiting for something like "Everything You Wanted to Know About Office Electronics but Were Afraid to Ask."
"The Joy of Cybersex: An Underground Guide to Electronic Erotica," by Phillip Robinson and Nancy Tamosaitis ($24.95, Brady Books).
It was inevitable that personal computers would become a medium for sexually explicit material, just as print, film and video technologies did before them. Computers add an extra dimension of interactivity, however, and have become hosts for a surprising variety of so-called adult services.
About the best things that can be said about this book are that it illuminates what has for years been a shadowy area of the personal computer culture and that it shows how computer erotica appears to provide many people with a "safe" alternative to real, personal relationships in a world where H.I.V. is deadlier than computer viruses.
The book comes with a diskette (DOS) that contains the "PG" versions of two games common on underground networks.
"Virtual Light," by William Gibson ($21.95, Bantam Books), and "A Philosophical Investigation," by Philip Kerr ($20, Farrar, Straus & Giroux).
These are ripping yarns for executives who have a fondness for computers, science fiction and mystery (and who have a stomach for crude language and human bodies in various stages of disassembly).
The chilling visions of corporate information systems in a virtual realm called cyberspace were first put forth by Mr. Gibson nearly a decade ago in his science fiction classic "Neuromancer." After that first novel, Mr. Gibson became something of a cult figure because so many of the supposedly fantastical technologies in the book were plausible.
It was even more amazing when Mr. Gibson revealed that he was not particularly computer literate. His vivid descriptions of the dimension called cyberspace, to which one gained access through "the Net," were simply extrapolated from his observations about the information systems of today. The future was darker, raunchier and more sinister than we might imagine, but it was also disturbingly believable from a technological perpective.
In Mr. Gibson's new novel, "Virtual Light," executives looking for more guidance and insight into the dazzling but dark future of information systems will find, instead, a more mundane world, a decaying San Francisco of 15 years hence. This is a good detective story; again, a piece of technology (the "virtual light" of the title) plays a key role. But this time the technological vision is not the main attraction.
Mr. Kerr's "A Philosophical Investigation" is another example of fiction with a plausible technological undercurrent. It is also something of a departure into science fiction by one of Britain's best young mystery writers. The caper takes place in London about 25 years from now, and involves an intuitive homicide detective, a subverted biogenetics experiment, a computer system gone awry, a madman who thinks he is the reincarnation of the philosopher Wittgenstein, and a team of serial killers.

HEADLINE: Neighborhood Report: Highbridge;
A Bittersweet Season

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
The growing doubts about the Yankees' future in the Bronx have been especially painful for the small merchants in the shadow of Yankee Stadium. That's because the new talk comes after a year in which the Yankees played well for a change and helped drum up business for their neighbors along the way.
Indeed, the team's unexpected run for first place, down to the very last days of the season, kept fans and revelers flooding into the economically struggling neighborhood in greater numbers, and for far longer, than in less-competitive years. 
 "When the Yankees win like this, we're busy," said Louie Diamontis, the manager of Ball Park Lanes, a bowling alley at 810 River Avenue where the bar and restaurant served roughly 100 more people on game days this year than last. "This year, it seemed like a longer season because they were in the running."
On Thursday, though, New York State officials added new fuel to the uncertainty about the team's future in the Bronx, unveiling their bid to keep the Yankees from moving to New Jersey: a 50,000-seat stadium on Manhattan's West Side.
George M. Steinbrenner, the team's principal owner, has persistently complained that fans have shunned the stadium because of problems with parking, traffic, sanitation and security -- a complaint that seems cruelly ironic to the merchants around the stadium, given that game attendance increased by more than half a million fans this year.
"This season's been bittersweet," Mr. Diamontis said. "While the Yankees are doing great, people are saying they're going to leave. I don't understand."
Steve Manesis, manager of the Unity Coffee Shop at 58 East 161st Street, is equally puzzled. As far as he is concerned, the team's old inability to draw fans had far less to do with the Bronx than with the team itself..
"This year, they won and people came," Mr. Manesis said. "But when they lose, people stop coming."
Joseph Bastone, owner of the Yankee Tavern at Gerard Avenue and 161st Street, says business has more than doubled of late. "This year," he said, "has been just like the old days." R.H.

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
Honda Rolls Out Its New Accord

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
IT was noon and traffic was oozing on New York's 42d Street. I was pointed west, momentarily moribund in front of Grand Central Terminal when an eastbound 5.0-liter Mustang crept alongside.
"Hey," the driver said, "is that thing smaller than it used to be? It looks smaller." 
 New Yorkers don't usually talk to each other, at least not in civil tones, so I was surprised. But I was surprised, too, at the perception that the car -- the new '94 Honda Accord -- had shrunk.
Because, in truth, the wedge-shaped fifth generation of Honda's amazingly popular and important sedan is taller, wider and heavier than its predecessor. It is also rounder, stiffer and higher in the rump than the car that was America's leading seller for three years running.
But what I said to the guy in the gray Mustang was: "Uh, no. Don't think so."
You really don't want to get into specs when you're trying to push undented through the midday madness.
In fact, the new Accord sedan is 1.2 inches shorter than the '93 model, but that is not something you can spot. The big thing that skews perception and makes the car look shorter is its width, which has been increased a full three inches. That allows an inch more shoulder room and helps encompass the new side-impact protection, which now meets the Federal safety edict that will take effect in 1997.
Along with its new design, the midsize Accord has also been reengineered, with more power and a refined suspension, and the company plans a strong effort to regain the No. 1 spot that it held in 1989, '90 and '91.
Ford's Taurus put an end to that dominance with its '92 cars through aggressive marketing and through fleet sales, but it should be said, too, that Honda has felt the need to update the Accord and to broaden its appeal. The old car's market consisted primarily of people between the ages of 35 and 45, and a company spokesman said the new design is aimed at buyers from 30 to 45.
In addition, Honda is trying to put a more American stamp on its cars. It announced last week that, as of next April, all Civic four-doors for North America will be built at the company's plant in East Liberty, Ohio. And by April 1996, all Accord four-doors for the American market will be produced in Marysville, Ohio, which currently turns out more than three-quarters of the 400,000 sedans sold here each year.
Right now, the four-door is the only Accord in the showrooms, but the sportier coupe will make its debut in November, and a good-looking four-door wagon will come along next February.
Like Honda's other new models, all Accords are equipped with standard dual air bags. Antilock brakes, standard or optional, are also available, depending on the model. The sedan and coupe come in three flavors, the base DX, the LX and the top-of-the-line EX. The wagon will be available in LX and EX trim.
All Accords also have 2.2-liter aluminum fours under the hood, mounted sideways and driving the front wheels. DX and LX models deliver 130 horsepower, but the EX has a new version of Honda's VTEC engine (VTEC being an obscure acronym that stands for variable valve timing) which puts out 145 horses.
The white test car was, predictably, a well-equipped EX with an automatic transmission and leather upholstery whose odd purple-tan color I couldn't quite figure out.
With leather and the automatic, it was the most expensive of the new Accords, carrying a sticker that said $21,550. Honda has, however, kept prices pretty much at 1993 levels, and that means you can still buy a base DX for $14,330, while the LX starts at $17,230.
The EX rides on 15-inch alloy wheels, an inch bigger than those on the cheaper cars, and the tires are Michelins, newly designed to provide low rolling resistance and thus greater fuel economy, which ranges from 23 miles per gallon, city, to 31, highway.
Trim on the tester was of the blackout variety, set off around the side windows by a narrow band of chrome. A black air dam has also been added under the steeply sloping nose. The halogen headlights are narrow and slightly smaller than on the previous model, but they are superior to earlier headlamps, using multiple reflectors to turn the darkest night into a splash of sunlight.
At the other end of the car, the fairly deep trunk has a liftover at bumper height, and its lid rises on gas struts to an angle of more than 90 degrees, getting it out of the way so you have easy access to the 13 cubic feet of cargo space. The locking rear seatback is split 60-40 to allow stowage of long objects.
Glass is nearly flush, and seams between panels have been narrowed to enhance appearance and aerodynamics. In addition, the corpulent new body is more rigid, with stiffness increased by 25 percent. But the extra girth and the girdling against side impacts add only about 50 pounds to the sedan's weight, which varies from 2,800 to 3,075 pounds, depending on trim and transmission.
A five-speed manual is standard on all Accords, but a refined version of Honda's four-speed automatic is available. For '94, the transmission employs what the company calls "Grade Logic" control, which senses driving conditions. On upgrades, the system reduces the hunting between gears that is common to automatics. Downhill, the transmission stays in a lower gear to take advantage of engine braking.
As for the brakes themselves, four-wheel disks and an antilock system are standard on the EX and are available on the lesser cars. Without the ABS option, the DX and LX models are equipped with power front disks and drums at the rear.
Inside, the new car offers Honda's usual neat arrangement, although everything has been redone for '94. The EX sports full power equipment, including a flip-or-slide sunroof, and there are dual cupholders and a bin for toll change.
Incidentally, the color of that leather interior bothered me, so I asked Honda. It turns out to be two-tone taupe. Try to say that three times fast.
 
 
 
AND NOW, IN-DASH DIALING
FORD likes to say that it has a better idea. But its archrival, Honda, has now come up with a better idea of its own.
And what a good idea it is.
For 1994, all Honda Accords and Preludes -- as well as Acura Integras -- offer the first hands-free, in-dash cellular telephone, located right above the radio for convenience, easy dialing and a measure of disguise against theft.
The in-dash phone kit, installed by dealers and costing $500 to $600, has three components, a small antenna in the upper right corner of the windshield, a small talk-and-listen handset that resides in the console between the front seats and a transceiver with a large keypad mounted in the middle of the dash.
The phone has a large vacuum-fluorescent display that is bright enough to be read in direct sunlight. A built-in microphone offers speaker-phone performance, allowing the driver to keep both hands on the wheel.
When a call is received, the phone mutes the sound system, and the telephone can be set to answer automatically. The caller's voice is heard through the stereo system.
The keypad is illuminated and offers seven function keys as well as "on," "in use," "no service" and "roam" indicators. In addition, the phone has one-touch dialing that allows the driver to call the nine most frequently used numbers at the push of a button.
Twenty-one more numbers can be stored and recalled with a few keystrokes. Other features include last-number recall, scratchpad dialing, automatic redial and call timing.
As an added fillip, the phone can be set to detect a thief. If the car is started by someone who doesn't know the proper code, the phone automatically dials its owner and emits a tone that can be thought of as an electronic cry for help.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Supply-Side Economics Play New Jersey

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
IF she is elected Governor of New Jersey, Christine Todd Whitman says, she will join in the latest revival of supply-side economics, the theory preached by President Ronald Reagan and now proselytized by a small band of G.O.P. Governors.
But first she must beat Gov. Jim Florio on Nov. 2, and so she has taken a gamble that few in recent political history have dared. 
 Nearly two weeks ago, she put before voters a plan, albeit short on specifics, to cut their taxes by about $1.5 billion. It would, over three years, reduce state income taxes 30 percent on everyone with taxable income under $80,000. The rich would get smaller breaks. She also promised to eliminate the state telephone sales tax, which raised $312 million last year, the fuel tax on heavy trucks, which raised $9 million, and the corporate tax surcharge, which raised $40 million.
Not since the glory days of Mr. Reagan's first campaign has a candidate placed so much stock in supply-side economics -- the belief that lowering tax rates allows the economy to improve, meaning that workers and companies earn more, so have more income to tax (at the lower rates), so government takes in the same revenue and therefore does not have to cut services.
There's a good reason, political experts say, that no one else is campaigning on a supply-side platform.
"People just aren't willing to buy tax cuts anymore as a panacea," said Howard J. Gold, who teaches government at Smith College. "The public has grown increasingly skeptical of election year tax-cut promises."
Mrs. Whitman has said she is simply following the lead of other Republican Governors: William F. Weld of Massachusetts, Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, John Engler of Michigan and Fife Symington of Arizona. But none of those incumbents pushed the envelope as far as Mrs. Whitman has.
By the end of the Reagan Presidency, supply-side theory had been widely discredited. Even some authors of the Reagan plan, including the former budget director David A. Stockman, had disavowed it. But that did not end the debate, nor efforts like those of Governor Weld of Massachusetts to try the idea. He has reduced income and capital gains taxes by about $200 million a year.
"Since the Reagan era, voters look at anyone who is claiming to be offering a tax cut very carefully and they look at the plan with a jaundiced eye," said Michael P. Ettlinger, tax policy director for the Washington-based Citizens for Tax Justice. "The problem that an anti-tax candidate faces after Reagan is that they are called upon to deliver specifics on what they are going to cut to pay for tax cuts. Mrs. Whitman has decided to brave that world."
But she need not heed that warning from a Washingtonian. There are others closer to home. A New York Times/WCBS-TV News poll released a week after she announced her plan showed that only 10 percent of the voters believed that their taxes would go down if she were elected. Thirty-six percent said their taxes would go up; 38 percent felt they would stay about the same.
And there is precedent to watch out for too. Raymond H. Bateman ran in 1977 for the office Mrs. Whitman wants. One newspaper account called him the Republican Party's "bright young man, its heir apparent, its best bet to someday capture the governorship."
His Democratic opponent was Gov. Brendan T. Byrne, who had earned the public's wrath and the nickname "One-Term Byrne" by introducing the state's first income tax.
Mr. Bateman said he had a plan to roll it back. His co-author was former United States Treasury Secretary William Simon, and it was called the "Bateman-Simon plan."
On the stump, Mr. Byrne took to referring to it only by their initials.
 
Inglorious Defeat
 That, and hard questioning about how the state would make up the money led to an inglorious defeat. Mr. Bateman went into the last six weeks of the campaign leading by 14 percentage points; he ended up losing by 300,000 votes.
Sixteen years later, Mrs. Whitman finds herself in a fascinatingly similar situation -- but without the poll numbers. In Jim Florio, she has an opponent who until recently was highly unpopular. He was thought to have killed any chance of re-election back in 1990, when virtually his first act as Governor was to push through a record $2.8 billion tax increase.
Then on Sept. 21 -- two days short of the 16th anniversary of Mr. Bateman's announcement -- she announced her tax-cut plan. Her co-authors are Malcolm S. Forbes Jr., editor-in-chief of Forbes magazine, and Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist for Bear Stearns & Co. in New York. As deputy budget director during Mr. Reagan's first term, Mr. Kudlow was a chief proponent of supply-side economics. He has brought that passion to this campaign.
"My prescription was a big-think, big-bang solution," he said of the Whitman plan. "This was not going to be tinkering around the edges. I've always been interested in the last couple of years to see if the Republicans can sell this message successfully."
But the plan that was intended to lead the offensive instead backfired. Most of the newspaper editorials that followed its release sneered with the same cynicism that voters seem to be expressing.
And Mr. Florio worked hard to undermine Mrs. Whitman's credibility. He brought Mr. Byrne out of retirement to proclaim the plan "B.S. II." And he himself, taking a rhetorical cue from George Bush's early campaign against Mr. Reagan, called it "voodoo redo."
Selling the plan may be the least of her problems. The latest Times/WCBS-TV poll had her trailing Mr. Florio by 50 to 31 points. Last week, she demoted her brother, who had managed her campaign, and laid plans for "going negative" about Mr. Florio, a style of campaigning that friends say she has never liked.

HEADLINE: Conversations/Charles W. Adams;
The Rise and Fall of Civilization According to Tax Collection

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
THE Constitution and the ballot may protect Americans against overreaching tax collectors, but some of the ancients enjoyed even better security.
An extortions court created by the Romans enabled Cicero and others to prosecute overzealous tax men. The code of laws (313 A.D.) under Constantine provided civil remedies for judges derelict in defending taxpayers against abuses. The penalty: 30 pounds of gold assessed against the judge and payable to the taxpayer. 
 Those are but a few of the facts that Charles W. Adams, a former California lawyer who is a research historian at the University of Toronto, has culled on the influence of taxes on history.
He concludes that perhaps in no other era were taxpayers as blessed as in the Middle Ages, when God was on their side. The medieval system was divine supply-side economics, he says, based on the belief that a king who taxed excessively incurred sin punishable by God, whereas a king who taxed justly would find gold in his treasury.
"Isn't this what supply-siders are telling us the laws of economics will do?" asks Mr. Adams, eyes twinkling, lips slightly arced in professorial omniscience.
Mr. Adams, a lean, graying man of 63 who earned his doctor of law degree from the University of California at Los Angeles and taught history at the International College of the Cayman Islands before migrating to Canada, believes much of history is defined by efforts in various civilizations to curb tax collectors. His views often seem to reflect a political conservative's natural crankiness about having the Government's hand in his pocket. But he does quote former Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes about the necessity of taxes, and likens the tax gatherer to a bureaucratic Robin Hood taking wealth where he can and often doing much good with the loot.
But Robin Hood is less Mr. Adams's hero than is St. Thomas Aquinas, the 13th-century theologian and philosopher, who defined the tax limits of the medieval state. According to Aquinas, rulers were entitled to tax their subjects for only what was necessary to safeguard the common good. Anything in excess was the equivalent of robbery. "Wherefore they are bound to restitution just as robbers are," Aquinas wrote in his "Summa Theologica."
 
Potentially Destructive
 Montesquieu, another hero, who influenced the framers of the United States Constitution, echoes Aquinas. "The real wants of the people," wrote the eminence of the Enlightenment, "ought never to give way to the imaginary wants of the state."
The history of taxes has been Mr. Adams's passion since 1968 when as a jack-of-all-trades lawyer in Hollywood, he scoured the card catalogue at the U.C.L.A. library for works on the historical role of taxes. He couldn't find a single listing.
Mr. Adams abandoned what became mainly a tax law practice to teach and write. His works on the subject include his own recently published summa theologica, 20 years in the making -- "For Good and Evil: The Impact of Taxes on the Course of Civilization" (Madison Books, 1993).
If taxation sustains civilized society, it also represents a potential danger to civilization, Mr. Adams believes. "When we tax," Mr. Adams says, "we are dealing with fire, and without proper controls and care, we can easily burn down everything we have built."
Income creates jobs, he argues. When the state takes away income from an enterprising man or woman, it takes away his or her capacity to generate employment and wealth for society.
The lessons he derives from history are more than economic. The ancient Greeks, who developed the concept of liberty, discovered that excessive taxation bred despots.
Unfortunately, Mr. Adams says, when the need for revenues collides with ideals of freedom, ideals give way. During the reigns of certain pharaohs and late Roman emperors, tax collectors became virtual slave masters. He's worried the situation may recur in the United States today.
"I believe we've lost something when we tolerate the degree of public intrusion that we do," he says. "Our tax system is now a spy system." The problem, he argues, is that American taxes have lost their sense of fairness. "When you feel the system is a rip-off on you and a loophole for somebody else, then it loses its moral persuasion, and the Government has to fall back on heavy criminal penalties."
No revolution was more deeply rooted in taxation than the revolt of the 13 Colonies. The rallying cry, taxation without consent, was expressed in the Declaration of Independence.
Over two centuries, Mr. Adams says, this country has replaced colonial tax oppression with a home-grown version few understand, let alone consent to, which falls hundreds of billions of dollars short of paying the bills.
Mr. Adams says the Internal Revenue Service takes a leaf from the scribes of the pharaohs, who taxed almost everything. Sales, slaves, foreigners, imports, exports and business were all fair game. Snooping reached the point where scribes regularly inspected kitchens to make sure women were not using free drippings instead of the taxable oil they were required to use.
 
Like Ice Melting
 Yet 3,000 years of Egyptian history are filled with moments of humane tax administration, including remitting taxes during hard times.
Mr. Adams, pointing out the classic gaps in the system, recounts how Frederick the Great, the 18th-century ruler of Prussia, asked his finance minister during a cabinet meeting why the treasury was so low when his subjects were paying such high taxes. The minister requested a piece of ice, handed it to the minister farthest from the king and told him to pass it on to the next person, on up to the king. All Frederick received was a wet hand. He promptly instituted greater frugality in his Government.
The Greeks developed a progressive revenue system wherein richer citizens paid the larger share of Government costs. Their voluntary approach, known as the liturgy or public service to the gods, involved a sense of responsibility to the community, something that Mr. Adams feels is lacking in the United States.
When public improvements were needed, leading Athenians competed to finance them. Those with wealth "held it in a kind of voluntary trust for the city," he said.
The Islamic tax policy is one reason for Islam's spread, he says. Vanquished peoples were given three choices: convert and pay no tax; keep your own religion and pay a head tax, or be put to death.
A shortage of revenue developed, Mr. Adams notes wryly, because of a shortage of infidels. Islam's head tax antedated our own sin taxes, which President Clinton proposes to raise on cigarettes to pay for health care.
The dawn of tax history is recorded on clay tablets excavated at Lagash, a city state 6,000 years ago in what is now Iraq. Little is known about Lagash, except that it instituted heavy taxes to fight a war. That war ended, but the tax burden did not lighten.
On a tablet, an anonymous citizen had scratched a complaint: "You can have a Lord, you can have a King, but the man to fear is the tax collector."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Looking to Courts for Catharsis

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
THE land of the endless summer seems to have become the home of the endless Rodney King trial as one legal proceeding unfolds from another like waves rising in the surf. Beating begets trial begets acquittal begets riot begets trial. Suit spawns countersuit. Victim becomes plaintiff, plaintiff becomes defendant. Appeal counters appeal.
All flow from an 81-second videotaped beating of a black motorist by white police officers more than two years ago. And yet there is no closure, only periodic strokes of theater that inflame a city that continues to seek, and fails to find, a catharsis in the legal system. In the absence of successful social programs or economic renewal or inspired political leadership, the city has sought to come to terms with its ailments through courtroom drama. 
 The attempt is futile, said Peter Arenella, a law professor at the University of California at Los Angeles. "We have come to look at our criminal justice system as more than a mechanism to decide guilt or innocence but also as a mechanism to somehow resolve fundamental rifts in the community," Mr. Arenella said. "People naively expect that a trial can somehow give them justice, but that is literally impossible because people in the community have different substantive expectations of what justice demands."
After many months of trials, retrials and appeals, there is a possibility this week that some partial resolution may be at hand. Tomorrow a jury is to resume deliberations in the case of two black men charged with attempted murder in the vicious beating of a white truck driver during the riotingthatfollowed the April 29, 1992, acquittals of four white police officers accused in state court in the beating of Rodney King.
Also this week the United States Supreme Court may determine whether two of the officers, who were convicted of violating Mr. King's civil rights in a second, Federal trial this April, must soon begin serving their two-and-a-half-year prison terms. The judge who sentenced them, John G. Davies of Federal District Court, last week gave them two extra weeks to take their request for bail to the high court, extending until at least Oct. 12 the date on which they must report to prison. The judge's extension, on marginal grounds that surprised most legal observers, was merely the latest jolt.
As the legal cases unfold, they generate more tension and more anger. They also generate big money and visions of bigger awards. Legions of lawyers are now involved, and almost everybody, it seems, is suing somebody. Justice and race are the vocabulary; the currency is in the millions.
 
Raining Lawsuits

 
 On top of the previous trials, with their controversies and their now-routine riot preparations, a third Rodney King trial is scheduled as Mr. King seeks $9.5 million from the city in a civil suit. That case, which is scheduled to be heard next March, singles out as targets the former Mayor Tom Bradley, the former police chief Daryl F. Gates and a score of officers who were at the scene of the beating -- which includes a police helicopter pilot -- as well as the four officers who have already stood trial twice.
City officials say that Mr. King's case has been weakened by his own conduct. He has been arrested four times since the beating, once when surprised in his automobile with a transvestite prostitute, once on a complaint of domestic violence and twice for drunken driving.
"We could have endless trials," said Mr. Arenella, "and it still wouldn't change the tragic place we're in." The problems of Los Angeles cannot be solved by anything as simple as a verdict.
And the realities of the courtroom, as the Rodney King beating trials sometimes surrealistically illustrated, can have little connection to the realities of the outside world. Few participants in the beating can have any very clear memory of that night after countless viewings of the videotape and seemingly limitless self-interested courtroom interpretations of the events it shows. Almost every one of the more than 51 baton blows has been subjected to contrasting explication.
And the re-showings and re-interpretations continue. The two men who were riding with Mr. King on the night of the beating have also sued for redress, though they were not beaten, kicked or stunned with Tazers as he was.
Reginald O. Denny, the white truck driver who found himself in an intersection that became the epicenter of the disturbances, has sued the police, asking $40 million for their failure to protect him during the riot. Thousands of other riot victims have brought lawsuits against the city.
As the legal repercussions continue, the two convicted officers, Sgt. Stacey C. Koon and Officer Laurence M. Powell, are appealing their conviction. The Justice Department is appealing back again, claiming that the sentence imposed by Judge Davies was too short. At the same time, Los Angeles Police Department administrative hearings are under way to dismiss formally three of the officers (the fourth, a rookie at the time of the beating, was fired outright).
 
Blame Away

 
 In this arena, it is Officer Theodore J. Briseno, who seemed the most passive on the videotape of the beating, who has suddenly become the most aggressive in wielding the legal system. The only one of the four officers who has an actual possibility of regaining his job, he is pointing fingers at everybody. In an administrative hearing that began briefly in August and will resume in December, he is blaming the department for the incident and the department in turn is blaming him.
The officer with the most imaginative defense during the trials (he said he was actually trying to protect Mr. King, not hurt him), Officer Briseno has found unexpected grounds for a counter-suit against Mr. King. The officer is accusing him of assault for his struggles during the beating.
For good measure, he is also suing his convicted colleague, Sergeant Koon, saying the sergeant should have stopped the beating and thereby saved him, and the entire city, from this endless legal roundelay.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
The Hopeful Future That Never Arrives

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
OVER the last several months, economic forecasters have arrived en masse at a somber conclusion: the American economy, with its daily reminders of hard times, won't show a noticeable improvement until next summer, at the very earliest, and perhaps much later.
Only last January, the economy seemed to be shaking off its funk. "It seemed to many of us to have a nice rosy glow of health about it," said Lyle Gramley, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association. "And all of a sudden that nice rosy glow was gone, and I don't know why."
But as the forecasters are scaling back their optimism, they leave two issues unsettled. 
 One is this: Is it so bad for the economy to grow slowly? After all, slow growth avoids inflation. And even slow growth can gradually create jobs. Eventually, enough jobs might appear to make Americans feel comfortable again. But not before 1995 or 1996.
Marvin Kosters, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, states the second issue. "The real question," he says, "is not whether the present situation is good or bad; the real question is, if we are unhappy with our situation, what price are we willing to pay to make it better?"
More to the point, if Americans don't like the current economic growth rate, which is less than 3 percent a year, what can they do about it? Apparently very little. One solution would be to pour money into Government spending, mainly for public works and other tangible items that require hiring a lot of workers. But the Clinton budget for the fiscal year that just began, with its emphasis on deficit reduction, forecloses that avenue.
With Government sidelined, consumers could strengthen the economy by borrowing and spending vigorously. But with raises and job security hard to come by, millions of Americans decline to take this road, although consumer spending has risen somewhat recently.
Another avenue for stronger economic growth is selling to foreigners. Rising exports, in fact, were billed last winter as the tactic that would lift the economy. But the Japanese and the Western Europeans, big buyers of American merchandise, have been having their own hard times -- and because of this, American exports have fallen, not risen.
Low interest rates -- the lowest in years -- have encouraged people to buy cars and appliances on credit and to build or buy homes. But as Mr. Gramley notes, the rise in home construction, of key importance for economic growth, has not been enough. "If you had asked last winter what would happen if rates dropped as much as they have, I would have predicted a boom in housing; that has not happened," Mr. Gramley said. "The only explanation that I can give you is that people are very worried about the future."
Just one of the nation's economic pillars, business spending for machinery and equipment, particularly computers, has been strong. But much of this spending results in automation that eliminates jobs.
The forecasters, in sum, see no wind on the horizon that will blow away the hard times. Or, as Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, puts it, with exasperation: "We live in this world in which the current quarter never seems to pan out as well as people thought it would, and then they say the upturn will be in the next quarter. And it is like waiting for Godot."
That is evident in the forecasts. The Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a monthly newsletter that polls 51 forecasters for each issue, shows them scaling back their forecasts a little each month since April. Then they said the gross domestic product would grow this year at an annual rate of 3.3 percent and next year at 3.1 percent. That means that the value of all the new goods and services produced in a particular year would rise by these percentages.
 
Private Pessimism

 
 Now the Blue Chip forecasters have reduced their estimates to 2.6 percent this year and 2.7 percent next year. Mr. Reischauer's office has taken a similar action, and so has President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. Neither, however, is quite as pessimistic as the private forecasters, although everyone seems to agree that the economy is somewhat stronger than it was in the dismal first half of the year.
Still, only Mr. Clinton's economists expect the economy to manage a 3 percent growth rate in 1994. More than the others, the Administration is counting on the low interest rates to get people borrowing and spending, although Alan Blinder, a member of the Clinton Council, acknowledges that nervous Americans are not responding to low rates as they have in the past.
"It is one thing to say that the unemployment rate is only 6.7 percent and another to say how many Americans are suffering from job insecurity," Mr. Blinder said. "We have no measure of that."
A 3 percent annual growth rate is a sound barrier of sorts, most economists agree. The thinking goes this way. The economy has to grow at least by enough to create jobs for the people entering the work force, most of them young. Then additional growth is needed to create jobs and even new industries for all the people who are laid off at companies that manage to become just as productive with, say, 5 employees instead of 10.
The minimum annual growth in the G.D.P. to accommodate these two groups is thought to be 2.2 percent, roughly the 1992 growth rate. But no one really knows. If there are too many layoffs, the economy might have to grow by 2.5 percent to create enough jobs for everyone who wants one. Whatever the exact number, the gray area between 2.5 percent and 3 percent, the new range for the scaled back forecasts, is considered just enough to create jobs slowly, too slowly for most Americans to notice.
Only when the economy is growing at 3 percent or more for at least a year, an achievement last experienced in 1988, do labor shortages begin to develop, prompting employers to hold onto their workers, which improves their mood. "Until we get over 3 percent," said Peter L. Bernstein, an economic consultant, "there will be very little dent in the unemployment rate."

HEADLINE: Israel's Right Wing in the Wilderness

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN

DATELINE: TEL AVIV

 BODY:
FROM his spare seventh-floor office here, Ariel Sharon can see a thin gray line in the distance that is the Mediterranean. "The way things are going," the old general and Likud Party elder said, grimly joking, "I'm afraid that's where the Jews of Israel will be pushed."
Actually, if any back is to the sea, it is that of Israel's right wing, dominated by Likud and its young American-style leader, Benjamin Netanyahu. The right is convinced that Israel has put itself in mortal peril by accepting the legitimacy of the Palestine Liberation Organization and agreeing to Palestinian self-rule in the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank. But it has yet to figure out how to respond effectively to this dramatic new situation, which caught it unawares and underlined how out of touch it is despite having run the Government for 15 years, until displaced last year by the Labor Party and its leader, Yitzhak Rabin. 
 In Israel, the words "right" and "left" have almost nothing to do with economic or social policies. Here, the core issue is whether territories captured in the 1967 war can be given up in the name of peace with the Arabs. And while definitions are imprecise, Israeli leftists generally favor concessions and rightists say no, whether out of security concerns or religious convictions that God promised those lands to the Jewish people. The more rightward one moves -- from Likud to small but important parties like Tsomet, the National Religious Party and Moledet -- the more hawkish views tend to be.
Since the deal with the P.L.O. first became known five weeks ago, rightists have marched against it, calling Mr. Rabin a traitor and a liar. Some of them have evoked the Holocaust and warned that a comparable disaster awaits Jews again. They have damned the Government as illegitimate. Citing Mr. Rabin's reliance on Israeli Arab parties to win parliamentary approval of the agreement 10 days ago, they have accused him of lacking "a Jewish majority," a catch phrase that strikes moderate Likudniks as morally racist and politically dumb. But what the right has conspicuously failed to do is provide a plausible alternative for the majority of Israelis who are exhausted by conflict and are ready to give this plan a chance, no matter how many doubts they may have.
"There is an intellectual vacuum," said Yossi Olmert, a spokesman for the last Likud Government. "People expect a new agenda from Likud, and all they're getting is the same old ideological slogans."
And for all the slogans, the accord has prompted a flurry of progress toward peace. On Friday in Washington, Israel's Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres, and Crown Prince Hassan of Jordan shook hands at the White House to confirm that they are normalizing relations. Blocks away, a 43-nation conference pledged $2 billion to the occupied territories to insure the accord's success.
Perhaps no one has been more undercut by recent events than Mr. Netanyahu, who has come across as Dr. No, focusing on what he is against, not using his ample verbal skills to articulate what he is for. He bills himself as a pragmatist. Yet he strikes even some in his own camp as having been taken hostage by extremists and messianics, by doctrinaire small-party figures.
In recent days, Mr. Netanyahu seems to have heeded the complaints of internal critics like Mr. Sharon, who say Likud should stop flailing its arms at a done deal and focus its fire on specific perceived dangers in the accord. It must appeal more to the broad center where most Israelis reside, they say, and the Likud leader agrees, promising proposals soon to safeguard Israel's "military and demographic security" when the territories' final status is negotiated. One possible idea is to carve up the territories to protect certain Jewish settlements and keep the Israeli Army perched on strategic high ground.
 
Fervor and CashExtremists Only
 The right's difficulties were apparent at recent anti-Government rallies. Tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets of Jerusalem in the largest demonstrations in years. But they were top-heavy with young yeshiva students, settlers from the territories and black-hatted adherents of the Lubavitcher Hasidic sect, who have given this campaign the fervor and cash once devoted to proclaiming their spiritual guide as the Messiah.
It is significant who was not out there en masse: secular Israelis who form the backbone of Likud support, working-class people, business owners, yuppies. They are as tired as anyone else of dangerous army reserve duty in Gaza. Surveys suggest that fully a third of Likud voters endorse the agreement. When the plan went before Parliament, 3 of Likud's 32 members broke ranks with Mr. Netanyahu, abstaining rather than voting no, and several other colleagues were with them in spirit.
Not that these Likudniks have full faith in Mr. Rabin. But they cannot accept that this former army chief, who captured the territories in 1967, is guilty of treason. And they want nothing to do with the handful of fire-breathing visionaries threatening to gun down the first soldier who tries to evict them from their West Bank enclaves.
"When you put yourself in the same square with some of these people, you're saying that you're against peace, and nobody's going to vote you back into power," warned Meir Sheetrit, one of the Likud abstainers.
Even the protesters seem wary about going overboard at this point. Threatened acts of wide civil disobedience have failed to materialize.
It is still early, though, in the battle for Israeli hearts and minds. The latest polls show that while there continues to be majority support for the agreement, it is thinner than a few weeks ago. Mr. Netanyahu says this heartens him. But it is also worth noting that Israelis generally take their Government at its word on national security. Imagine, for example, hard-nosed Israelis agreeing not to retaliate against a sworn enemy who, unprovoked, fires nuclear-capable missiles at them. Yet that is precisely what they did during the Persian Gulf war. Polls showed overwhelming public support then for the Likud Government's decision to absorb Iraqi Scuds and, at Washington's behest, do nothing about it.
"People basically go with the flow," said Gadi Wolfsfeld, a political science professor at Hebrew University. "And if it looks good and the Government says it's all right, they say, Amen."

HEADLINE: Planners Say That Early Retirees Might Add Billions in Health Costs

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
Clinton Administration health planners have begun to acknowledge that a politically important part of their plan could cost billions of dollars a year more than they anticipated.
The proposal would have the Government pay for most of the health insurance for early retirees, or those who retire before the age of 65, at which point they become eligible for Medicare. The plan is intended to win support from large manufacturers saddled with skyrocketing health insurance bills. 
 The Government would assume most of the health costs not only of these early retirees from big industry but also of any longtime worker who decided to retire early. And many would be expected to under the new health entitlement program.
 
Cost Estimate of $6 Billion
 Hillary Rodham Clinton said in Congressional testimony on Thursday that the proposal would cost about $4.5 billion a year, but Ira C. Magaziner, the President's top health adviser, said in an interview this week that the Administration planned to raise its official cost estimate to $6 billion.
Several other Government officials said that some internal Administration estimates suggest that the cost of assuming early retirement health care could reach $10 billion a year, a big difference for a plan with financing that has already been criticized as shaky.
The proposal could ultimately cost considerably more than even the upper-range estimates if far more people take advantage of it than now anticipated.
Some officials say the proposal, when effective, would lead 150,000 more Americans to retire before the age of 65; others put the number at 600,000. The more early retirees the provision produced, the more it would cost.
As with dozens of aspects of the Clinton health proposal, the estimates on early retirements are educated guesses about how Americans will change their behavior in response to it. Any time the Government sets out to restructure one-seventh of the economy, there are bound to be consequences that are unintended or fiendishly hard to predict or measure, economists say.
To help the big manufacturers with their health costs, the President proposed that companies pay 20 percent of health insurance for early retirees who now receive health coverage from their former employers. The Government would pay the rest. Many companies now pay 100 percent.
Mr. Magaziner's $6 billion-a-year estimate remains considerably lower than the General Accounting Office's calculation that American companies now pay $8.6 billion a year to provide health insurance for 2.5 million early retirees. The accounting office assumed that early retirees, on average, pay 20 percent of their health coverage themselves. The G.A.O. estimate does not include the surge in early retirements that is expected to result from the provision.
 
Some Retirees Would Pay
 For an early retiree whose former employer does not provide continued health coverage, the Government would pay 80 percent of the average cost of the insurance premium in the retiree's region and the retiree would pay the rest.
By guaranteeing health coverage for all Americans, the proposal would encourage workers to retire early because many who are at least 55 years old are believed to be working mainly because they need health insurance for themselves or their families. The proposal is also expected to give companies an incentive to push some older workers into retirement.
Under the proposal, a company that pays 80 percent of the health insurance for its employees might conclude that it could achieve significant savings by pushing some workers into early retirement, since the company would then have to pay only 20 percent of an early retiree's health insurance. The company might make such a move to reduce its work force or to replace the employee with a younger worker, perhaps at a lower salary.
Mr. Magaziner argued that the cost of the proposal could be held to $6 billion by the Administration's plan to reduce annual inflation in health care costs and by not discriminating by age in health insurance premiums. Administration officials said, for example, that the annual premium for a retired worker who is 60 years old and single would fall to $1,800 a year, down from perhaps $5,000 paid by his former employer under current premiums based on age.
"We've discussed this thoroughly, and I don't think there is disagreement now on what the numbers should be," Mr. Magaziner said.
In many ways, this proposal is a response to complaints from Ford, Chrysler and other large manufacturers -- and from the auto workers' and steelworkers' unions -- that their competitiveness was endangered by the huge burden of providing health insurance for their large number of early retirees.
Mrs. Clinton told the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday, "Those companies that are continuing to provide retiree benefits are doing so at an extraordinary cost that we think should be more broadly shared by the general public because their commitment to retiree health care is taking out of investment, wages, wage increases, profits -- money that should rightly go there instead of taking care of the work force that is no longer working."
One White House official said the proposal was so generous to these companies because they had got the President's ear early, when his health care proposals were being formed. Administration officials also noted that in most other industrial countries the governments, and not companies, pick up the health insurance costs for early retirees.
"There is a competitiveness issue here," Mr. Magaziner said. "You could argue that the thousands of manufacturing companies for which this is an issue got themselves into this problem by agreeing 15 years ago to support early retirees. But you could also say they had no idea that health care costs would skyrocket."
 
'A Big, Wet Kiss'
 While there is general agreement within the Administration about the importance of making American manufacturers more competitive, there is considerable debate about just how generous the Government should be with taxpayer dollars in pursuing this goal.
"This proposal is a big, wet kiss for large manufacturers," one Administration official said.
To reduce any windfall effect that manufacturers would enjoy, Mr. Magaziner said, the Administration is considering changes in its health proposal so that companies would have to pay 30 percent of the cost of the health insurance for early retirees rather than 20 percent.
In light of the hundreds of thousands of early retirees the plan would produce, the Administration is worried that by drawing from the Social Security trust fund rather than contributing to it, these retirees could endanger the fund.

HEADLINE: In Hanoi, U.S. Goods Sold but Not by U.S.

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HANOI, Vietnam, Oct. 2

 BODY:
Wandering the narrow streets of what was the enemy capital in the Vietnam War, American visitors to Hanoi can find themselves wondering, what American trade embargo?
Vietnam Airlines flies many of them here on its shiny new Boeing jets. The city's electronics stores carry I.B.M. and Apple computers, and even the computers that bear Taiwanese or Korean brand names are powered by a computer chip manufactured by the Intel Corporation. Those familiar yellow boxes of Kodak film are on sale in plenty of photo shops and for Hanoi teen-agers, Coca-Cola is the soft drink of choice. 
 Not far from Ho Chi Minh's hulking gray marble mausoleum, video shops are promising the first pirated copies of "Jurassic Park" some time this fall.
 
Foreign Middlemen Profit
 To a degree that the United States Government seems unwilling to admit, the 18-year-old American trade embargo on Vietnam is crumbling.
After generations of Communist central planning, the Hanoi Government is opening its economy to the world. And the technology that Washington had fought for so long to keep out of Vietnamese hands is getting here, usually through third-country middlemen who are delighted to profit from the sale of technology that Americans pioneered but cannot sell in Vietnam themselves.
American business executives eager to profit from one of the developing world's most promising markets insist that they -- not the Vietnamese -- are now the chief victims of the embargo.
 
'Losing a Market'
 Many Vietnamese agree. After years of accusing Washington of using the embargo to force this nation into submission, Vietnamese officials acknowledge that they are now getting most of the technology and foreign investment money that they can use, at least for today.
"Americans are losing a market of 72 million people that we don't need to lose," said James Rockwell, an American business consultant based in Hanoi whose clients include the Chrysler Corporation.
"Vietnam is not waiting for us anymore," he said, the American flag flapping in the humid breeze outside the window of his company's offices here. "Capitalism has run amok here, and the Vietnamese have decided to put together an economy with or without us."
Mr. Rockwell is helping Chrysler prepare to open car manufacturing plants in Vietnam when the embargo is lifted. But there is no guarantee that President Clinton will lift the embargo any time soon.
 
Japanese Open Factories
 And as Mr. Rockwell and Chrysler wait anxiously, Japanese car makers, unencumbered by the embargo and eager for a new beachhead in southeast Asia, are opening their first Vietnamese factories.
The complaints of American businesses ring hollow to the families of some of the more than 2,000 Americans still listed as missing in action from the Vietnam War.
Their fate is the issue that continues to divide Washington and Hanoi, and organizations representing some of the families say the Vietnamese Government is still giving only grudging cooperation to American military investigators.
Larry W. Rivers, a Vietnam veteran who is the executive director of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said in a telephone interview from Washington that "our only concern is whether Vietnam is giving us a full accounting on the missing -- whether the embargo helps or hinders the American business community is not our focus."
 
Call for Brown to Quit
 On Thursday, an umbrella organization of 75 groups that represent Vietnam veterans or the families of missing Americans called for the resignation of the United States Commerce Secretary, Ron Brown, because of accusations that he accepted $700,000 from a Vietnamese businessman to lobby for an end to the trade embargo.
While Mr. Brown has denied the accusations, the controversy could further delay the lifting of the embargo. A group of Republican members of Congress has asked President Clinton to hold off on any move to improve relations with the Vietnamese Government until an investigation of Mr. Brown by a Federal grand jury in Miami is completed.
The American embargo was imposed when the Communist forces of North Vietnam overran the South in 1975. For more than a decade, the sanctions were undeniably effective in punishing Vietnam. Its economy stagnated, both because of the embargo and because of inept Government policies, and Vietnam remains one of the world's poorest nations.
But that is changing rapidly. Vietnam's fortunes began to improve in the late 1980's, when the nation's leaders abandoned Marxist economic theory and accepted free markets under a policy known as doi moi, or renovation.
At the same time, Vietnam moved to placate Washington. It released most of its political prisoners, pulled its troops out of Cambodia and, most important of all, expanded its cooperation in trying to determine the fate of Americans missing from the war.
 
Embargo Gradually Eased
 Washington has gradually eased the embargo. Shortly before he left office, President Bush allowed American firms to open representative offices in Vietnam.
In July, President Clinton decided to lift the American veto that had blocked billions of dollars in loans to Vietnam by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other international organizations. Those loans are expected to permit the Vietnamese to begin to rebuild their road network and power plants, and to create a modern telecommunications system.
When the embargo came up for renewal in September, President Clinton decided to allow American businesses to bid on projects financed by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
But he kept in place what for most American businesses is the heart of the embargo. With few exceptions, American companies cannot manufacture or sell their goods here, even as their foreign competitors, mostly from Japan and elsewhere in Asia, move quickly to sew up the Vietnamese market before the Americans arrive.
 
Fear of Antagonizing Veterans
 More than 500 international investment projects, worth more than $5 billion, have already been approved by the Vietnamese Government. Only about $55 million of that directly involves American companies.
While eager to move into Vietnam -- with its well-educated, low-wage workers and great natural resources, including oil -- many large American corporations do not take a formal position on the question of whether the United States should lift the embargo.
Their reluctance to fight for an end to the sanctions reflects in part a fear of antagonizing veterans groups or the families of missing Americans. So far only three large American corporations have sent representatives to live in Vietnam -- International Business Machines, General Electric and Price Waterhouse.
I.B.M. is among the companies that take no formal position on the embargo. Still, the company's Hanoi representative, William Howell, who has lived in a hotel room here for the last five months, cannot hide his frustration at having to turn down so many inquiries from customers who are eager to buy his computers.
 
Frustration Over Lost Sales
 "It's very frustrating to look at a big market that we can't sell to," said Mr. Howell, who figures that I.B.M. could reap $50 million in annual sales in Vietnam by the end of the decade if the embargo is lifted.
That is not to say that the company's computers are not for sale in Vietnam. I.B.M. personal computers -- as well as computers made by big American competitors, including Apple and Compac -- are sold openly in both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, the southern Vietnamese city once known as Saigon, and can be found in use in Government ministries.
"It's easy to buy an I.B.M. in Vietnam, but we're not the ones selling it," grumbled Mr. Howell. American computers are imported by Asian middlemen who rake off much of the profit the manufacturers would otherwise make if they were allowed to sell and service their own computers here.
Among those who cannot buy I.B.M. computers in Vietnam are the large non-American foreign corporations -- banks, airlines, construction companies and the like -- that have set up offices in Hanoi. Many of them are loyal I.B.M. customers elsewhere in the world. But in Vietnam, they are usually forced to buy I.B.M. clones made outside the United States, often in Taiwan or Korea.
Boeing has a similar problem. Under the embargo, it cannot sell its jets to Vietnam Airlines, so the American company's planes must instead be leased to Vietnam by a non-American company that takes much of the profit that would otherwise go to Boeing.
 
Embargo Hurts Oil Companies
 Foreign middlemen bring to Vietnam a vast range of American brand consumer goods, from Eveready batteries to Kleenex tissue, by transshiping them through other Asian countries. Because the embargo has prevented the Hollywood studios from policing the video market here, the latest films are widely available on black market cassettes, smuggled across the border from Cambodia and translated into Vietnamese.
Almost certainly the biggest corporate losers as a result of the embargo are American oil companies, which have been barred in Vietnam from bidding on rich offshore tracts in the South China Sea.
For several years, Vietnamese officials had hinted that they were willing to set aside some of the most promising tracts for the American oil giants. But soon, all of the best oil-drilling zones will be committed to non-American companies.
"The opportunities for American companies are getting very narrow now," said Do Duc Dinh, an economist with Hanoi's Institute of World Economies. "We want to do business with the Americans. But Vietnam cannot wait forever."

HEADLINE: Canada's U.S. Trade Experience Fuels Opposition to the New Pact

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRANTFORD, Ontario

 BODY:
Debbie Annis came to the door of her gray two-story, vinyl-sided house on Ninth Avenue, in the shadow of the industrial skeletons on Mohawk Street that used to make tractors, electric blankets and woolens in Canada's manufacturing heartland.
Michael Smith, candidate on the political left for Brantford's parliamentary seat in the federal elections on Oct. 25, told her that his New Democratic Party, which has held the seat for 22 years, would jettison both the North American Free Trade Agreement and free trade with the United States. 
 Ms. Annis, 41, who used to be a real estate agent, said that would suit her just fine. "Free trade is killing Canada," she lamented. "Brantford is turning into a ghost town."
 
Effect on Property Values
 A house across the street, she noted, was put on the market two years ago for $95,000, and is now being offered at $76,000. "You can't buy a house here because you don't know whether you'll have a job tomorrow," she said.
A few doors down, Dennis Garvey, 37, has been unemployed since the Massey-Ferguson farm equipment plant closed in 1986, except for three years he spent as a bartender.
"All the jobs have gone to Mexico," he said. A year after the closing of the Massey plant, he was divorced. "My ex-wife is now out of work, too," he told Mr. Smith. He supplements his welfare check by working as a handyman. He blames free trade as well.
 
Opposition to Free Trade
 The comments of Ms. Annis and Mr. Garvey, two of Brantford's 82,000 citizens, go far to show why free trade, which dominated the last federal elections in 1988, after Canada and the United States worked out free trade between themselves, is unpopular with many, if not most, Canadians.
Once one of the brightest names in Canada's industrial firmament, Massey ended all farm equipment manufacturing in the late 1980's, cut its staff by tens of thousands, diversified into auto parts and moved its headquarters to Buffalo.
It is just one of scores of heavy-duty manufacturing enterprises around the western end of Lake Ontario and southwestern Ontario that have either closed or shrunk in Canada's prolonged recession.
Because this retrenchment has come as Canada has been adjusting to lower trade barriers with the United States, Mr. Smith, with the bouncy step of the Fuller Brush man and a bundle of fliers, has found that many on Ninth Avenue share the views of Ms. Annis and Mr. Garvey, and his own, and are ready to scrap free trade.
Now with Nafta geared to opening both countries' dealings with Mexico and intensifying the breakdown of trade walls between Canada and the United States, anxiety about job losses from increased trade competition has increased in Ontario, which accounts for nearly half of Canada's population and economic output.
The disquiet is shared in most other provinces. Some 55 to 60 percent of Canadians continue to tell poll takers they do not like free trade.
Some of the western beef and grain-growing regions, dependent on export markets, are less hostile. In Quebec, which often takes a contrarian view on much in Canadian life, sentiment in favor of free trade is also stronger -- linked, political analysts say, to separatist feelings. An independent Quebec would count on hardy trading relationships to the south.
With national elections scheduled for Oct. 25, Canadians -- whose unemployment rate of 11.3 percent is half again as high as that of the United States -- are fretting more about employment than any other issue. They worry about jobs lost not only to Monterrey and Mexico City, but also to Buffalo, Spokane or Nashville.
 
Factors in Jobless Rate
 Although the Canadian jobless rate was only 7.5 percent on Jan. 1, 1989, when free trade with the United States went into effect, economists caution against attributing all of the rise to the trade agreement. Canada has also suffered in the period from one of its most severe postwar recessions. The Canadian economy is more heavily resource-based than that of the United States, and thus has been hurt more by declines in prices in recent years for such raw materials as lead, zinc, copper, nickel, timber and petroleum.
Canada's economic size, measured by gross domestic product, is about a tenth that of the United States. And its dependence on the United States for 80 percent of its trade made the bilateral free trade pact far more sensitive here than in the United States.
Also weighing heavily was the perception that free trade further erases Canada's distinctness and more deeply reinforces the power and influence of American multinational companies and American culture.
Organized labor led the fight against free trade in 1988 and, like labor in the United States, is vehemently resisting the North American Free Trade Agreement today. The farm community is divided. The favorable stand of the big wheat and beef growers is countered by the opposition of small farmers who fear increased competition and erosion of their subsidies. Farmers, though representing only about 3.5 percent of the population, are a potent political force, as in the United States.
 
Five Years of Building Support
 But circumstances are different from what they were five years ago, when the two main political parties, Conservatives and Liberals, were at each other's throats over trade. Despite free trade's unpopularity, it is deeply enough entrenched now to build support groups.
Old manufacturing industries have been clobbered, but new high-technolgy export industries like precision instruments, telecommunications, computer parts and specialized machinery are starting to flourish.
"If you look at the last two and one-half years," said John Kirton, a specialist in international economic policy at the University of Toronto, "you'll see that virtually 100 percent of our growth has come from exports. Given the deficit, the debt load and the decline in income tax revenues, where would the Canadian economy be today if we hadn't had that growth?"
In Brantford, Mayor Bob Taylor put it this way: "We have a shadow that sits over the city, yes, but people are also seeing that companies can come in and prosper." Those companies include Gates Canada Inc., with 600 people making automotive belts and hoses, Eagle Precision Technologies Inc., with 200 workers producing machines that make auto mufflers, or Western Foundry Company Ltd., a manufacturer of exhaust manifolds with a work force of 100.
A study by the C.D. Howe Institute, a policy research group, found that free trade has so far cost Canada more jobs than it gained, but the study concludes that the tide will soon turn and that the new jobs already created are better paying.
 
Losers Are Labor-Intensive
 The losers -- old-line businesses like food processing and makers of furniture, appliances and clothing -- tended to be labor-intensive. The winners are high-technology companies that pay more because of higher skills that add greater value to the end product. On average, the study found pay to be 20 percent higher in the expanding industries.
"In the first couple of years the employment impact was very negative," said Daniel Schwanen, a Howe policy analyst. "Now we're close to seeing a turnaround because of exports. In terms of dollars and cents, we're already getting positive results."
The political configurations have changed as well. In fighting free trade five years ago, Liberals gave the Tories a second term. Today the official Liberal stand supports free trade, but the party leader, Jean Chretien, wants the North American trade pact "improved," specifically to define trade subsidies and set rules more precisely for retaliatory action when trade laws are infringed.
The Clinton Administration, struggling for Congressional approval of the existing accord, voices little sympathy, even though Mr. Chretien is only emulating President Clinton, who insisted on the recently negotiated side deals related to labor and the environment when he took office.
Asked if the United States would go along with a request for negotiations by a new Canadian Government, the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, said: "No, we're interested in putting this into effect. It's in the best interest of all three countries."
 
Awaiting the Elections
 The pact has already been approved by the lower house of Parliament. Former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, free trade's champion, made sure of that before leaving office in June. One tiny step remains before full Canadian ratification -- the formal promulgation of a final order by Governor General Ramon J. Hnatyshyn, which now awaits the outcome of the elections.
Should Mr. Chretien become Prime Minister, and the United States Congress pass the deal, analysts predict some face-saving approach for Canada that would probably not involve full-scale negotiations or a resubmission to Congress.
The popularity of two other parties contesting the elections -- the populist Reform Party with its base in the mid-continent, and the Bloc Quebecois, which wants to prepare the nation for Quebec's separation, raises the strong possibility of a minority government.
Without an absolute majority, Mr. Chretien, 59, who is now favored in public-opinion surveys, could be dependent on the New Democrats. But their leader, Audrey McLaughlin, has said her price for support is renunciation of Nafta and the existing pact with the United States. So the outlook is for much political uncertainty.
Kim Campbell, 46, the former Vancouver lawyer who replaced Mr. Mulroney as Prime Minister and leader of the Conservatives, strongly defends Nafta and the agreement with the United States.
 
Too Many Promises
 Many, including Ms. Campbell, believe that free trade would have had an easier ride here had its advocates promised less. "Some areas of Canada's manufacturing industry were perhaps too optimistic about their ability to be competitive in the short term," Ms. Campbell said recently in a campaign swing through southern Ontario.
Another factor was the rejection by the Government of programs of trade adjustment assistance, which have been enacted in the United States, giving workers special help if imports wipe out their jobs.
Interviews in Brantford found general agreement even among supporters that the process came about too abruptly and for many did not leave an adequate cushion.
Christine Monks, 36, a school bus driver, who was eating at the Sub Tub luncheonette, across the street from the carcass of an old textile plant not far from Ninth Avenue, said, "Free trade is bound to happen globally, but for us there was too fast a transition."
Diane Russell, 47, who works in the reconditioning department of the Johnson's Wax company, which employs 220 people, added: "I think free trade did a lot to devastate this country. But we can't go back. We've paid our dues."

HEADLINE: 2 Largest Hospital Chains in U.S. Merge

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
In the latest consolidation reflecting powerful pressures for change in health care, the nation's largest hospital chains, Columbia Healthcare Inc. and HCA-Hospital Corporation of America, said yesterday that they had agreed to merge. The new company, which would operate 190 hospitals, would be the largest investor-owned hospital chain in the world.
Richard L. Scott, the chairman and chief executive of Columbia, who will be the president and chief executive of the new company, said the value of the deal was $10.25 billion, making it the seventh-largest merger in any industry since 1981. He said it would be accomplished in a tax-free exchange of shares. No cash will be involved. 
 The merger is the largest in a wave of health care industry consolidations across the country in anticipation of President Clinton's health care proposals and growing pressure to slow increases in health costs.
Only last month, the Columbia Hospital Corporation, as it was known then, completed a merger with the Galen Health Care Inc. hospital chain, which had been owned Humana Inc., a large health maintenance company. Columbia changed its name after the merger.
 
Approval Needed
 And Merck & Company, the world's largest pharmaceutical company, is awaiting regulatory approval of a merger valued at $6 billion with Medco Containment Services, a mail-order and discount drug distributor.
Subject to approval by shareholders and Federal antitrust regulators, the new company formed by Columbia and HCA, which will have 125,000 employees in 26 states, will be called Columbia/HCA Hospital Corporation. The executive offices will be in Louisville, Ky., and Nashville.
"The Government ought to love this one," said Dr. Thomas A. Frist Jr., the chairman of HCA, who will be the chairman of the new company's board. "This is exactly what the Clinton Administration is seeking."
Dr. Frist, a physician, was the highest paid executive in the country last year as the head of HCA. He received $127 million in compensation, mainly through options to buy and sell stock at steep profits.
Dr. Frist, 55, whose family still owns HCA shares worth $409 million, said he would be "in no way retiring."
 
A Surprise to Analysts
 The merger, coming so soon after the Columbia-Galen merger, surprised Wall Street securities analysts. "It is very unusual," said Kenneth S. Abramowitz, a health care analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. "After companies make a major acquisition, they usually digest it for one or two years before moving on."
But John F. Hindelong, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said "the time is right" for hospital mergers. "The Clinton Administration is encouraging consolidation, networking and cost reduction -- all of which will result in the Columbia-HCA merger," he said.
Mr. Scott said in a telephone interview yesterday that the new company would be in a stronger position to compete for national business and to offer lower prices at a time when both the Government and private purchasers were insisting on economies.
"Nobody is succeeding unless they are reducing costs," he said. "We will save at least $138 million a year," by eliminating duplication in hospital administration and other costs that do not affect patient care, he said.
 
Good Relations with Doctors
 He added that both companies have reputations for good relations with physicians. Columbia, which was started in Fort Worth, has a policy of offering local doctors a chance to buy minority ownership in hospitals where they work.
In a joint statement, Mr. Scott and Dr. Frist said "health care delivery in the future will focus on quality results and cost efficient operations." They said the merger would strengthen their efforts toward this goal.
Although the new company would have revenues this year exceeding $10 billion, that would be only 3 percent of the widely scattered $325 billion hospital industry, Mr. Hindelong said.
Columbia operates 94 general and specialty hospitals with 21,627 beds. HCA-Hospital Corporation operates 96 general and specialty hospitals with 20,485 beds, including 20 psychiatric hospitals. Both companies also operate diagnostic, outpatient and other treatment centers.
Columbia will dominate the board of directors of the new company with 11 members including Carl F. Pollard, a former Humana and Galen hospital executive, who will be the chairman of the new executive committee. HCA will have four board members.

HEADLINE: For 3 Tabloid Papers, Some More Tightrope

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
With the successful completion of Rupert Murdoch's long struggle to buy back The New York Post, newspaper analysts and executives say New York City's three money-losing tabloid newspapers appear to be poised on the brink of a strange new era of resilient nonprosperity.
It is shaping up, these experts say, as an extended period of unaccustomed stability for The Post, The Daily News and New York Newsday, based on the deep pockets of their owners -- a period of labor peace and financial security that seemed highly unlikely even a few months ago. 
 But while The Post and The News have survived bankruptcies, labor strife and repeated brushes with death, they and the more even-keeled New York Newsday, the analysts say, face continuing losses or at best marginal profitability for years to come in an anemic advertising market battered by prolonged recession and dominated by The New York Times.
And the new era promises to be one of fierce competition among the feisty tabloid papers, with intense battles for limited numbers of readers and retail advertising dollars -- a fight that experts say is still likely to end, sooner or later, in the long-predicted death of one or more of the newspapers.
 
'Not All Three'
 "There is simply not going to be room for three tabloids, along with The New York Times, in New York City," Gerald D. Reilly, a consultant on newspaper investments, said in an interview. "I think the city can support one and a half tabloids, or maybe two can get by. But not all three."
Each newspaper faces a different set of problems. But the problem for all, say Mr. Reilly and other analysts, is that many big retail stores have gone out of business, limiting a prime source of advertising revenue, which is the lifeblood of newspapers. Moreover, the combined circulation of the three papers, just under 1.5 million, is unlikely to grow much, if at all.
The Post, which has been losing $14 million to $18 million a year recently and has been battered by bankruptcy, staff rebellions, repeated shutdowns and a succession of wound-be owners, emerged from the graveyard on Friday when Mr. Murdoch, who owned the paper from 1976 to 1988, reacquired it in a $25 million deal to pay creditors, back taxes, pension claims and administrative costs.
There is no question that Mr. Murdoch, whose holdings under the News Corporation had a profit of $605 million in the year ended June 30, has the money to keep The Post going indefinitely. And industry analysts say that while he usually discards money-losing properties, he may be willing to run The Post at a slight deficit because of the prestige and fun of being a New York publisher.
Mr. Murdoch, industry analysts say, is a shrewd businessman with the muscle to handle unions and the streetwise tactics to run newspapers. In a showdown last week, he virtually destroyed the Newspaper Guild unit representing The Post's news and advertising personnel, who will have to apply for their own jobs this week. And having signed nine craft unions to contracts cutting The Post's deficit by millions, Mr. Murdoch now plans a fight for readers and advertisers.
 
Formidable Challenges
 He faces formidable challenges, analysts say. The Post has no Sunday paper, limiting its circulation and advertising potential. Even the daily Post has become all but irrelevant to major advertisers; two-thirds of its readers take another paper, so advertisers can reach them without The Post. And the paper must confront a huge loss of readers, down to about 440,000 from a million a decade ago.
Patrick Purcell, The Post's publisher, declined in an interview to discuss what is expected to be a sharp paring of the staff of 700, but he said The Post planned to "go upmarket and be very issue oriented" in its quest for readers and advertisers.
The survival of The Post, fiscal analysts say, may have the most impact on The Daily News, which itself seemed doomed in recent years by strikes, bankruptcy and other troubles, including the loss of $100 million over the last decade and drastic declines in circulation.
Once the nation's largest daily, with 2.4 million readers in 1947, The News epitomized tabloid journalism with its news coverage and snappy pictures, headlines and writing. But many of its readers were lost to television and the suburbs; by 1990 its daily circulation had dropped to 1.2 million, and today it is about 770,000. The Sunday News circulates about 977,000 copies.
Sold in 1991 by the Tribune Company of Chicago to Robert Maxwell, the British publisher whose death at sea and postmortem bankruptcy left it in turmoil, The News was bought for $37.3 million last January by Mortimer B. Zuckerman, the multimillionaire real-estate developer and owner of U.S. News & World Report and The Atlantic magazine.
Mr. Zuckerman's promise to revitalize The News by practicing street-smart journalism for ordinary New Yorkers has met with some success. The News's circulation has rebounded from drastic losses during a five-month strike two years ago, and advertisers have been attracted by a new television-listings magazine in the Sunday paper and other supplements and features.
Beginning his tenure by dismissing 170 news and advertising employees, Mr. Zuckerman vowed to cut losses estimated to be about $7 million a year. Some analysts say he may yet succeed in his goal of breaking even the first year.
 
Major Hurdles
 But he faces major long-term hurdles, including the huge expense of buying or building a new printing plant with color presses, newspaper executives said. Moreover, Mr. Zuckerman, who had every reason to believe that The Post, his main competitor, would vanish in 1993, now faces a long competition with Mr. Murdoch.
New York Newsday is now in its eighth year as a stepchild of Newsday, the highly successful Long Island paper. It is owned by the Times Mirror Company of Los Angeles, one of the nation's most prosperous newspaper companies, which has made a long-term commitment despite New York Newsday's annual losses ranging from $8 million to $14 million.
Robert M. Johnson, the publisher of Newsday, recently told the staff of New York Newsday that he was personally committed to cutting those losses to $5 million a year in the next few years and to breaking even by 1998. At the same time, however, he said that the company did not expect circulation to rise as much.
New York Newsday's circulation in the five boroughs is about 275,000 daily and 269,000 on Sundays, according to a spokeswoman, Chiara Coletti. She said circulation increases of 30,000 or 40,000 a year were common in the paper's start-up years, but that growth in the next few years was expected to be 5,000 to 6,000 a year.
The prosperity of the Times Mirror Company and Long Island Newsday seems to guarantee New York Newsday's future. But while Mr. Johnson and other executives insist that the commitment to New York Newsday is open-ended, some analysts believe Newsday and its parent may eventually become frustrated if the New York circulation does not grow much beyond 300,000 and cumulative losses -- now said to be about $100 million -- are unchecked.
New York Newsday has acquired large segments of The Daily News's circulation in Brooklyn and Queens, and it has aimed at the more educated and affluent readers of The Times for much of its continued growth.
But some analysts say New York Newsday has always had an identity problem: whether to be a street-smart city tabloid or a more respectable, well-written suburban paper, with a balance of city, national and foreign affairs that is more typical of The Times and other broadsheets.
The Times has a daily circulation of more than 1.2 million and 1.8 million on Sundays, much of it outside New York City. It views itself as competing for news, readers and advertising in many markets, including the city, where it has worked lately to expand local and regional coverage and to reach a younger audience.
Financial analysts say The Times is more concerned about competition from New York Newsday than from The Daily News, but still has a majority of the local advertising market, with the rest split among the other newspapers.
Moreover, The Times, with its heavy emphasis on international, national and economic news, reaches an older, more established and more affluent readership, while New York Newsday has focused on the middle class, particularly younger, well-educated readers.

HEADLINE: California Questioning Clinton's Promise of Aid

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Oct. 2

 BODY:
When President Clinton arrives in California on Sunday evening for his second visit in a month, he will find growing impatience and political rancor over his Administration's response to the battered local economy.
Increasingly, even strong backers of the President among business and political leaders here are saying he must act quickly to reverse California's deepening slide into recession or risk losing the most populous state's 54 electoral votes in 1996. 
 The White House has responded by assigning several staff members to work on a California plan to supplement the efforts of Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, assigned last May by Mr. Clinton to oversee recovery efforts here. A number of leaders here have complained to the White House that Mr. Brown, while saying the right things, has produced little.
While the Administration has taken steps to bolster the state's economy, the effort has taken on new urgency as California's recession deepens and as complaints from Clinton backers in the state rise.
 
Call for 'Real Initiatives'
 "It's hard for me to understand the delay," Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat who faces re-election next year, said in a telephone interview from Washington. "We need some real initiatives to put a focus on California."
Senator Feinstein has been urging the Administration to use Federal money to aid military conversion in California and to build a high-speed rail corridor down the middle of the state.
And last Tuesday about 15 top Southern California corporate executives met privately with David Wilhelm, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, in Los Angeles. According to a person present, the executives were blunt in describing the consequences of failing to act soon.
Their comments echoed those of Bill Press, chairman of the California Democratic Party, who said: "I've been saying to them California is Iowa without the floods -- it's that critical. The only way to turn it around is focused attention from the top."
 
Huge Layoffs
 While the Administration has made no explicit commitments to aid California, it is taken as a given by the White House that there can be no full national recovery without California and possibly no re-election in 1996 without a major reversal of fortunes in this state, where the end of the cold war has brought huge layoffs at bases and in military industries, contributing to unemployment on a scale not known since the Depression.
The main purpose of the President's three-day visit is to promote his health plan. But while he is in San Francisco to address the national A.F.L.-C.I.O. convention on Monday, Mr. Clinton is expected to take the opportunity to announce concrete action on the California economy.
A broader strategy of aid has been under discussion at the National Economic Council in Washington, White House officials say. But there is debate over whether to begin implementing them gradually or to have the President make a full-blown announcement that might raise undue expectations about what the strapped Federal Government can do to cure problems caused by global economic changes.
 
'Unrealistic Expectations'
 The political risks have not escaped the White House. Mr. Clinton won California last year with 44 percent of the vote in the three-way Presidential vote in which President George Bush's perceived insensitivity to California's declining fortunes was a major issue.
"People are impatient, but there are unrealistic expectations of what one person can accomplish," said Tom Epstein, who as a special assistant to the President for political affairs is in charge of dealing with the California issue at the White House.
"We know the economy won this campaign," Mr. Epstein said. "The President is deeply committed to getting the California economy back on track. But California was in a tailspin when he was elected. Nothing this Administration can do will turn it around quickly. It will take several years."
On a hopeful note, he added, "People will see some immediate benefits before the end of the year."
 
Loss of Jobs, and People
 Since Mr. Clinton's election, the California unemployment rate has hovered near 10 percent, two or three percentage points above the national average. More than 22,000 jobs have been lost in the last month alone, and 1.4 million people are unemployed. Nearly 300,000 jobs have disappeared because of Federal cuts in military spending. In the computer industry there has been a net loss of 50,000 high-tech jobs and a halving of new business formations over the last five years.
Military base closings have hit Northern California hard, but the part of the state that has been hit hardest is Southern California, long a center of aircraft, weapons and missile production. After decades of torrid growth, the population of Los Angeles is now declining.
 
Winning Applause
 The President's options are limited, given the tight budget. He won applause here on Wednesday when he eased cold-war-era export controls on computers and other high-tech products, a measure expected to help the computer industry. But California is clamoring for policies specifically tailored to its problems.
The Administration says it has already taken substantial steps to help the economy here. Mr. Epstein said the President had directed about a quarter of Defense Department money for conversion of military industries to California and acted to speed up transfer of closed bases to the local authorities.
Both Mr. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have made numerous visits to California. Mr. Gore has been particularly interested in efforts to tie the thousands of high-tech companies in Silicon Valley, south of San Francisco, into a new fiber-optics communication system.
 
'California Project'
 And Mr. Brown, the Commerce Secretary, has created a "California Project" in his department, with offices in Washington, Los Angeles and San Francisco.
Melinda C. Yee, a special assistant to Mr. Brown who heads the San Francisco office, said the project had drawn officials from several Federal agencies to make recommendations on issues like speeding the transfer of unneeded military bases to local governments for conversion to other uses.
She said her office had also been working on helping cut red tape to speed Federal aid to dredging San Francisco Bay, considered essential to keep the port of Oakland competitive. And the Commerce Department has 10 people helping the Silicon Valley Global Trading Center, an office sponsored by the computer industry to help small companies market their products abroad.
 
'A Lot of Photo Ops'
 While welcome, such gestures are widely viewed as inadequate. "There are a lot of photo ops, but we have not yet seen a Federal response," said Tom Hayes, chairman of Joint Venture: Silicon Valley, an organization of companies and local governments formed to stimulate the local economy.
Jack A. Kyser, chief economist at the Economic Development Corporation of Los Angeles County, a private business group trying to help retool the area's battered economy, said it appeared to him that the Administration "doesn't know quite what to do."
Mr. Kyser, who described himself as a Clinton Republican, added: "Last year I said the Bush people did not seem to know what was going on. But now the bloom is off the rose for Clinton. Clinton Republicans are asking who the Republicans will run in 1996. Bill Clinton will have a tough time to carry California again."

HEADLINE: Led by Private Sector, Free Trade Unites Colombia and Venezuela

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Oct. 2

 BODY:
Colombia's ties with Venezuela have been hailed as one of the most successful examples of economic integration between two developing countries.
While most free-trade pacts have been made possible through government initiative, Colombian and Venezuelan integration has been preempted by the private sector. 
 "We reversed the order," said the Colombian Foreign Minister, Juan Manuel Santos. "We lowered tariffs and let things happen. The private sector showed us how."
Integration between Colombia and Venezuela is formally derived from the Andean Pact, an agreement that also includes Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru. Early last year, the pact's five members vowed to liberalize trade and create joint external tariffs.
The fact that Colombia and Venezuela followed a continentwide tendency toward open-market economies has eased free trade. "If we had not gone this far, both countries would have felt the brunt of the worldwide recession," Mr. Santos said.
But economic troubles in Peru, elections in Ecuador and stalling in Bolivia prevented decisive action. So Colombia and Venezuela forged ahead, eliminating trade barriers, harmonizing customs laws and setting common external tariffs of 5 to 20 percent.
Venezuelan investors were focusing their attention on the Colombian financial sector, which had recently been deregulated. Banco Mercantil, one of Venezuela's largest financial corporations, bought a Colombian bank two years ago and opened a branch office here. Banco Latino, which has become Venezuela's largest financial group, is now in business in Colombia. Venezuelan investors own over 20 percent of Colombian Banco Ganadero, a recently privatized conglomerate.
Oswaldo Cisneros, a Venezuelan businessman who controls a large part of cellular phone communications in Venezuela, recently signed up with a group of Colombian investors to make his debut in communications here. And the Colombian Petrochemical Group obtained a stake in one of Venezuela's biggest industries when it bought two plants in Venezuela.
Governments are rapidly following suit. Beginning this year, Venezuela issued $150 million worth of government debt bonds in Colombian money markets. Venezuela is taking steps to deregulate its financial sector. Once this is done, Colombian investment in this area is expected to rise sharply.
Trade between the two countries has increased from about $340 million in 1987 to over $1 billion in 1992. They now represent each other's second largest markets after the United States.
Where there is a potential for competition, agreements in the private and public sectors have established quotas to insure a fair share in the market for each side. Overlapping exports in the metal industry led business leaders in both nations to sign a one-year pact establishing export quotas. Similarly, both agricultural ministries agreed on quotas for competing rice and potato production.
Venezuela and Colombia account for about 70 percent of the trade within the Andean Pact. Negotiations are under way to set common external tariffs with Ecuador, a move that will involve slight changes in the numbers already bargained on by Colombia and Venezuela.
"It's a difficult process," a Colombian diplomat said. "The more countries, the more difficult integration will become."

HEADLINE: Rebuilt Pittsburgh Economy Braces for New Blow Under a U.S. Health Plan

BYLINE: By MICHAEL DeCOURCY HINDS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH

 BODY:
This city may always be known as Steel Town, but Medicine City would more accurately describe its economy today.
Health care became the dominant industry here after global competition wiped out most of the area's steel mills in the early 1980's. The health industry's steady growth, adding about 4,000 jobs a year in the last decade, helped revive the economy. The local hospitals have a worldwide reputation for transplant surgery and high-technology medicine. 
 Now, the prospect of a new national health care system is seen as a threat to the economic foundation of a region that has nearly as many magnetic resonance imaging X-ray devices as all of Canada. The new system will challenge an industry that economists say has too many hospitals, too many administrators and too many staff members.
The health care industry buoys the local economy by providing nearly 1 of every 8 jobs and by generating $3.8 billion a year, or about 9 percent of the region's total spending.
 
11.8% in Health Care Force
 Though Pittsburgh's economy is far from alone in its dependence on the medical industry, it is vulnerable because the region has 108,000 health workers, or 11.8 percent of its total work force in July, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. No other metropolitan area has such a high proportion of health workers.
If the Clinton health plan is approved and if it works as advertised, Pittsburgh's growth will stall, economists say, as its health industry becomes more efficient. The question is what will happen over the long term.
"It's clear that the health care sector here will not be a major source of growth in the future, if the Clinton plan goes as it is," said Judith R. Lave, a professor of health economics at the University of Pittsburgh. "It will be hard for Pittsburgh to adjust, but I don't think it's all gloom and doom."
As hospitals shed beds, thousands of jobs go with them. But some health economists expect that the loss of hospital jobs will be largely offset by increasing employment in the growing health sectors like home care, nursing homes and suburban clinics.
Nearly 15 percent of the region's 2.1 million residents lack health insurance. As these people obtain coverage, they will increase demand for primary and preventive services, said Margaret A. Potter, associate director of the Health Policy Institute at the University of Pittsburgh.
 
5-Year Stall Predicted
 And because the Pittsburgh region has the nation's second-oldest population of any in the country, after Miami, economists predict that the elderly's need for health care here will continue to rise slowly through the year 2030, even as Pittsburgh's population declines.
"My gut feeling is that health care will stop adding jobs for a five-year transition period, when some job shrinkage will occur, and then jobs would start to grow again," said Paul R. Flora, regional economist for the PNC Bank Corporation here.
Many health care workers already face a revolving job market. Last December, for example, Denise Kovach lost her job as a registered nurse at Forbes Metropolitan Hospital in Pittsburgh. "You can't take a job and think it's going to last forever anymore," said Ms. Kovach, 43.
The hospital, concerned about its future in a crowded market, converted from a 175-bed general hospital to a 121-bed institution serving only convalescing patients, said Dawn M. Gideon, a senior vice president with the Forbes Health System, which runs the hospital. She said the hospital laid off 292 of its 668 employees, but in March rehired 60 of them, including Ms. Kovach, as well as 40 new employees, when the transition was completed.
 
Support for Clinton Plan
 Hospital officials here said in interviews that they generally supported the Clinton plan, despite the spending reductions it promises. Many said the plan would accelerate some industry trends already under way.
"We believe that the plan has been pretty much anticipated, and our overall view of it is quite positive," said Jack C. Robinette, president of the Hospital Council of Western Pennsylvania.
Hospitals here are converting wards to outpatient services from inpatient ones, opening up suburban clinics that provide primary and preventive care, and canceling purchases of experimental medical equipment.
The change, Ms. Gideon of the Forbes Health System said, reduced her hospital's operating costs to an estimated $33 million this year from $46 million last year.
 
Tougher Times Ahead
 As the pace of change quickens, however, some economists say that more workers may be out of jobs, and for longer periods. Some may have to take lower paying jobs and others may need to move out of the region to find work. The jobless rate was 6.9 percent in July, the same as the national rate. And almost none of the hospitals are unionized, so workers have few contractual protections to ease the transition.
The biggest shake-up in Pittsburgh's health industry will occur if hospitals start dealing aggressively with the oversupply of beds. Pittsburgh has more than three times as many beds per capita as the nation, on average. On any one night in the metropolitan area nearly 30 percent of the 10,600 beds are vacant.
Such high hospital vacancy rates are a national problem, and pressure to eliminate the oversupply of beds would increase under a system that emphasized preventive treatment and steered more people to outpatient care.
A half-dozen hospitals have closed or merged in the last three years and, this year, hospitals have laid off 1,000 workers, from administrators to housekeepers.
 
A $60,000 Job, Lost
 Gloria Blint moved here with her husband and two small children from Erie, Pa., last summer to take a $60,000-a-year job as director of communications at a local hospital. In April the hospital eliminated many administrative jobs, including Ms. Blint's.
"I've been out of college 13 years and I've never lost a job," she said. "This was a shock."
Ms. Blint has not been able to find a comparable job in the region and does not want to uproot her family by moving again. She is considering starting her own advertising agency. "I'm going to stay the heck out of health care," she said.
Since losing his job as a personnel director at an area hospital in February, Jim Anderson, 57, said he has sent out 900 resumes and had 17 interviews for jobs as far away as Wisconsin. "A lot of human resource people are out of work," he said. He finally got a job, starting this month, at a hospital in Rome, N.Y.
Even the region's prestigious academic medical center, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, is laying off workers and shifting them in large numbers. The center, a pioneer in transplant surgery and cancer research, is the region's largest private employer, with a staff of 12,000.
In June, the center laid off 250 workers and eliminated another 250 empty positions, mostly in administrative areas. The center is also shifting about 400 employees from its hospitals to new suburban clinics that will provide primary care, said Jeffrey A. Romoff, the center's president.
The center, which has a $1.3 billion annual operating budget, and the region could be hurt financially if an overhaul of health care limits peoples' choice of hospitals, Mr. Romoff said. Three-quarters of the center's patients come from outside Pittsburgh. "The Clinton plan recognizes this problem, but how it will work out is uncertain," he said.
 
Cutback on Technology
 The prospect of change in health care is also putting a damper on purchases of new medical technology. Mercy Hospital, for example, has decided against spending $3.1 million on an experimental scanning device used for studying the brain and other organs.
"We are reviewing all new requests for technology, to make sure we can manage them within our cost structure and remain competitive," said Michele Rone Cooper, a vice president of Mercy Health System, which operates the nonprofit teaching hospital.
Such caution is hurting Pittsburgh's nascent medical technology industry, which includes about 75 companies and 5,000 employees.
"Quite frankly, I don't see any new medical device companies starting up, and there is going to be a tremendous struggle for the others, without mergers or something like that," said Irene R. Skolnick, president of Dymax Corporation, a manufacturer of medical probes and scanning devices. She said declining sales had forced her to lay off three of the company's 25 employees, put two others on part-time schedules and reduce health benefits and salaries for everyone else.
But Ms. Skolnick is optimistic about her company's prospects under a changed health system. "In the long run," she said, "it will play into our hands because we're improving the effectiveness of medicine and reducing its cost."

HEADLINE: Washington Memo;
Policy on Jobs Holds Trade Pact's Fate

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
Every year for at least the rest of the decade, more than two million Americans, most of them solidly middle class, are likely to lose their jobs because of fundamental changes in the world economy.
It is one of the most vexing social and political problems facing President Clinton, and its immediate symbol has become the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
 Unless Mr. Clinton can persuade lawmakers this fall that he is coming to grips with the question of lost jobs, Congress will reject Nafta, as the accord is known. From the President's perspective, the trade measure will be the most crucial issue Congress will vote on this year.
"Many Democrats are waiting to see what the Administration does on jobs," said Representative Robert T. Matsui of California, who is coordinating the campaign in the House on behalf of the trade agreement. "It will have a big impact on how members vote on Nafta."
 
Support Is Slender
 So far, only about one-quarter of the Democrats in the House have promised to vote for the trade measure, far too few for it to pass.
Administration officials insist that the agreement will actually lead to a net increase in employment in the United States and cause relatively few jobs to be lost. But they concede that as a political matter, the trade accord and the President's response to the jobs problem are inextricable. Right or wrong, many workers fear that free trade would result in the moving of their plants and jobs to Mexico, where wages are lower.
In the minds of many Americans and the politicians who represent them, the agreement, which would gradually lift trade barriers between the United States, Mexico and Canada, has come to represent the economic transformation that makes the future seem bleak to many middle-class factory workers.
Politicians cannot vote against competition from Europe and Japan, against American plants moving overseas in search of cheaper labor, against companies at home cutting their work force or against the lower military budgets that are costing so many industrial jobs. But they can vote against Nafta.
The President's effort on the jobs issue is important for other political reasons as well. His election last year resulted to a large extent from his winning the votes of blue-collar workers who had voted Republican in the 1980's, and he cannot afford to lose them. And he will be hard pressed to win re-election if he cannot carry swing states like California, Michigan and Pennsylvania, where the problem of dwindling factory jobs is most severe.
 
Failure of Retraining
 The jobs situation is especially daunting because the solutions tend to be very expensive and because the Government's efforts over the years to find unemployed workers jobs in fields different from the ones they left have rarely succeeded.
"The problem you run into," said Calvin Johnson, a lobbyist for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., "is what to do with a 40-year-old auto worker who's used to making $45,000 or $50,000 a year. No one has ever figured out how do we retrain the middle class."
Anthony P. Carnivale, the chief economist of the American Society for Training and Development, said studies over the years had showed that roughly 60 percent of workers who are laid off find new jobs within a year. Generally, he said, their wages are lower at first -- by 10 percent on average for service workers, 20 percent for manufacturing workers and 30 percent for automobile and steel workers. But within five years, these workers are usually earning what they were in their old jobs.
On the other hand, Mr. Carnivale said, perhaps 35 percent of the workers who lose their jobs never again make the same wages.
Louis Jacobson, an economist at Westat, a consulting company in Rockville, Md., took a different cut at the figures. Based on the records of thousands of people who were laid off in Pennsylvania in the 1980's, he and his colleagues calculated that the average cost of a job loss for a worker with at least six years on the job was $80,000 over the rest of the worker's life.
Few people know these statistics better than Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich and his Assistant Secretary for Employment and Training, Douglas Ross. Mr. Reich, who taught at Harvard University, spent his academic career writing about economic changes and their effects on workers. Mr. Ross was director of the Department of Commerce in Michigan for five years in the 1980's when that state's economy was on the ropes.
In the Clinton Administration, employment policy has been almost completely delegated to the Labor Department, unlike other big domestic initiatives like health care, welfare and education, in which officials in the White House have taken charge. Gene Sperling, a top economic adviser to the President, said the jobs policy was being handled differently because of Mr. Clinton's high regard for Mr. Reich, who has been a friend for more than 25 years.
In separate interviews, Mr. Reich and Mr. Ross said that Government programs now on the books had been intended to correct for short-term unemployment resulting from a general economic downturn and that times were different now.
Three of four workers who lost their jobs last year did not go back to the same type of job, the highest proportion since the statistic was first recorded in 1967, Mr. Ross said. And he noted that people today were unemployed longer. In the 1970's, 11 percent of those laid off were still unemployed after six months. In the 1980's, that figure had risen to 15 percent, and last year, it was up to 21 percent.
What the Administration plans, he said, is an ambitious program that would identify permanently displaced workers early, give them counseling, help match them with available jobs and, in some cases, place them in community colleges or other forms of long-term education and training.
Studies have shown that job training for a few weeks or months generally does no lasting good, while programs for 18 months or longer often lead to new credentials, skills and solid jobs.
The most innovative element of the proposal, scheduled to be announced late this month, involves stipends to workers to cover living expenses while they attend school or undertake training.
These programs would be available to all workers regardless of why they lost their jobs and would take years before they were fully in effect. Mr. Reich argued that it would be a mistake to have a special program to help workers who lost their jobs because of the trade agreement. He said time and money would be wasted while a bureaucratic determination was made about why particular jobs had been lost, and he said it would be unfair to offer different programs to people who worked at the same company but made slightly different products.
Still, Mr. Reich said he recognized that a special jobs program related to the trade pact might be a political necessity, and he said the Administration was considering such a program "as a bridge to" a comprehensive jobs retraining program.
 
'Trying to Find Money'
 The comprehensive program would eventually cost $3 billion a year, Mr. Ross said -- $2 billion for job services and training and $1 billion for the stipends -- and the Administration has not determined how to finance it.
Mr. Reich said, "I am scurrying around trying to find money."
Critics say the Administration's proposals, even at a cost of $3 billion a year, would not come close to fulfilling those aims. Mr. Jacobson, the economist at Westat, said that reasonable compensation to workers who lose jobs because of Government policies could cost as much as $20 billion a year.
Another official engaged in preparing the Administration's jobs proposal said that no Government program could realistically protect factory workers from the economic changes sweeping the world.
Somehow, he said, the Government needed to persuade workers to take their future into their own hands and begin preparing for economic change long before it occurred.
He compared workers who lose assembly line jobs because their plants close to those who for years disregard warnings about smoking and cholesterol and eventually have heart attacks. "You can't wait till you have an economic coronary," he said.
That is not the kind of message politicians like to give their constituents.

HEADLINE: COMMERCE LEADER FACES MAJOR TEST

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
Ronald H. Brown, who easily weathered questions about ties to wealthy and powerful interests when he was confirmed as Commerce Secretary, is facing the most withering scrutiny of his career.
Mr. Brown is confronting accusations by a Vietnamese businessman that he sought $700,000 in return for his help lifting the trade embargo against Vietnam, at a time when he was moving from his quasi-official role as a political party official to the Government. 
 For years Mr. Brown has been a powerful lobbyist in Washington, and his connections have at times led to accusations that he skirted the edges of propriety. In January, as he awaited confirmation to the Cabinet, he was forced to cancel an inauguration tribute in his honor financed by large corporations, including some companies that could have been affected by his actions as Commerce Secretary.
Nevertheless, Mr. Brown glided easily through his confirmation hearings, becoming the country's first black Commerce Secretary. He had come from Harlem, where his parents managed the Hotel Theresa, and worked his way into a lucrative legal practice, several successful business ventures, the top position in the Democratic Party and finally, the highest echelons of power in the Clinton Cabinet.
 
Meetings With Businessman
 Two months after his confirmation, the questions arose about Mr. Brown's involvement in the Vietnam deal. His aides suggested that Mr. Brown did not know the principal figures involved. But this week, Reid H. Weingarten, the Secretary's lawyer, acknowledged that Mr. Brown met three times with Nguyen Van Hao, a former Vietnamese Government official who wanted to hire Mr. Brown to help ease the trading restrictions against Vietnam.
The first meeting was in November 1992 in Florida at a time when Mr. Brown was widely speculated to be under consideration for a Cabinet post, but had not yet been nominated. The second meeting was held in Washington at the townhouse of Lillian Madsen, a friend of Mr. Brown and the sister-in-law of Marc Ashton, another friend who introduced Mr. Hao to Mr. Brown.
The third meeting occurred in February after Mr. Brown's confirmation, when he gave Mr. Hao a brief tour of the Commerce Department. Mr. Weingarten said that Mr. Hao sounded out Mr. Brown about a proposal to set up a company that would provide advice to American concerns hoping to operate in Vietnam, but never discussed any payment to Mr. Brown in return for services.
Mr. Brown has said that he never participated in the Clinton Administration's deliberations over easing trade restrictions against Vietnam. The Administration has taken steps toward improving trade ties, dropping longstanding opposition to lending from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund and allowing American companies to bid on projects in Vietnam financed by the international lending institutions.
 
Evidence Uncovered
 By the end of last week, Federal investigators had uncovered evidence supporting the assertions of Mr. Brown's principal accuser, Ly Thanh Binh, who said Mr. Hao told him that he was preparing to funnel money from Vietnam to Singapore to open an account to pay Mr. Brown. But there was no indication that Mr. Brown had received money from any overseas bank account.
A Government official familiar with Vietnam, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that Mr. Hao was the only top official of the South Vietnamese Government who was allowed to stay on after the country fell to the Communists in 1975.
Mr. Hao was appointed South Vietnam's deputy premier for economic development in November 1974, but held only lesser posts under the Communist government, the official said. The official said Mr. Hao entered the United States in 1982 after leaving Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon, aboard an Air France Flight to Paris.
As a Federal grand jury in Florida investigates Mr. Binh's accusations, anxiety at the White House seems to be rising rapidly, with President Clinton forced into a protective mode, publicly defending his Commerce Secretary. Attorney General Janet Reno chose not to appoint an independent prosecutor, giving her own prosecutors 60 days to complete their inquiry, Administration officials said.
 
Successful Career
 As chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 1989 to 1992, Mr. Brown was considered highly successful, a conciliatory and energetic figure who helped revive the Democrats after the defeat of Michael S. Dukakis in 1988. He never flinched from his role as a critic of the Bush Administration, even when George Bush looked unstoppable.
But although he was party chairman, he never gave up his partnership in Patton, Boggs & Blow, one of Washington's largest lobbying firms known for its Democratic clientele. Mr. Brown insisted that he spent all his time on Democratic Party matters.
Over the years, Mr. Brown's talents had brought in clients like the Haitian Government, American Express and Japanese electronics companies. Gradually he was compared to lawyer-lobbyists like Robert Strauss of Texas, who headed the Democratic Party when Jimmy Carter won the Presidency. Mr. Brown resigned his partnership when he joined the Cabinet.

HEADLINE: Proposing a Manhattan Stadium Is a Risky Play for Cuomo and His Team

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 2

 BODY:
In their single-minded crusade to keep the Yankees from moving to New Jersey, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and his aides may have undercut their primary goal: persuading George Steinbrenner 3d not to abandon his team's home and history in the Bronx.
But if they overplayed their hand by publicly discussing plans for a new stadium in mid-Manhattan, it was because they believed the risk was too great to do otherwise. 
 Mr. Cuomo and his economic development czar, Vincent Tese, the director of the Urban Development Corporation, have no way of knowing whether Mr. Steinbrenner is bluffing about moving his team out of Yankee Stadium to a more inviting site, possibly the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, N.J. But they clearly have calculated that he is capable of doing so, and that the damage caused to New York City and State by the team's departure to a neighboring state would far exceed the damage to the Bronx by the team's departure to a neighboring borough.
 
The Re-election Factor
 Some city politicians and Yankees fans do not necessarily agree. But Mr. Cuomo may be viewing the situation through the unique prism of reelection politics. If he runs for a fourth four-year term next year, few events could be more devastating than a Steinbrenner news conference announcing the team's departure for New Jersey. The Yankees, for so long the ultimate symbol of New York's pride, would become just as powerful as a metaphor for its decline.
"Who lost the Yankees will be equivalent to who lost China," said Mitchell L. Moss, the director of New York University's Urban Research Center.
Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Tese contest that point, arguing that the departure for New Jersey of the New York Giants in 1976 and of the New York Jets in 1984 bore little political cost for elected officials like former Mayor Edward I. Koch. But Mr. Cuomo would be running as a relatively unpopular incumbent whose poll ratings had been battered by the impact of 12 years in office and four dismal years of economic hardship.
"If they do leave, it's just one more business and thousands more employees that have abandoned the state of Mario Cuomo," said the state Republican chairman, William D. Powers, perhaps envisioning an advertising campaign featuring a boarded-up ballpark.
Said Lieut. Gov. Stan Lundine: "If you lose, you want people to know you did everything that could have been done. And then, I suppose, you beat up on Steinbrenner."
Whenever discussing the future of the Yankees, Mr. Cuomo has been careful to say that his preference is to keep the team in Yankee Stadium, where the former minor league player witnessed his first professional baseball game, with Joe DiMaggio in center field.
But intentionally or not, the state's recent actions created a different perception. Mr. Cuomo began talking publicly in June about the possibility of building a stadium on a concrete platform above the Long Island Rail Road storage yards in Manhattan. Then this week, spurred by an article in The Village Voice about New Jersey's efforts to lure the team, Mr. Tese hastily disclosed details about a $319 million, 50,000-seat stadium, with an optional $50 million retractable dome, and a $211 million, 7,000-space parking garage. The stadium would be built on a 13.2-acre site bounded by 11th and 12th Avenues and 30th and 33d Streets.
 
'You Have to Act Now'
 "What Vincent's saying is you've got to act as though Steinbrenner's leaving, and that makes sense," Mr. Cuomo said in an interview on Friday. "You have to act now. You probably won't hear about a deal with New Jersey until it's made. You have to let this guy know there are other possibilities."
But what confounds officials in City Hall and the Bronx is that the state has not seemed to dedicate similar effort to keeping the team in Yankee Stadium after its lease expires in 2002. Mr. Steinbrenner has complained that attendance remains below its potential because of fan concerns about traffic, parking and safety. No plans or scale models have been unveiled to illustrate a package of proposed inducements for staying in the Bronx -- which have been discussed for five years -- like more parking, a Metro-North Commuter Railroad train station near the ballpark, and luxury boxes inside the stadium.
To the Bronx loyalists in city government, Mr. Cuomo seemed to be offering a concession before it was needed. And they suggested that it was unseemly for the Governor to appear to grovel before Mr. Steinbrenner, who was described by Mr. Lundine on Friday as "more disliked in New York City than Larry Hogue."
The net impact, some said, would be to undermine efforts to keep the team in the Bronx by letting Mr. Steinbrenner know that New York was prepared to take Herculean steps to keep him in the state.
City officials also were peeved that the state had acted unilaterally, after little consultation with the city. "If anyone asked my opinion," said Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President, "I wouldn't be playing into Steinbrenner's hands to participate in a bidding war because that means the taxpayers lose. But nobody asked me."
After listening to a few days of such criticism, Mr. Tese issued a statement late Friday to make clear that "any offers to the Yankees are the sole decision of New York City" and that "the West Side idea is just that, an idea."
Some city officials said that Mr. Cuomo seemed to be grasping at straws because, like Westway, any plan to build a stadium on the West Side could almost certainly be strangled in court by residents opposed to its impact on traffic and pollution.
"I just don't see how we do it," said Betsy Gotbaum, the city's Parks Commissioner, who is leading the effort to improve the Yankee Stadium area.
The Daily News, in an article on Friday, christened the West Side stadium "The House That Mario Built." But Mr. Cuomo, whose infrastructural tastes have run to repaved highways, shored-up bridges and upstate prisons, said he is not motivated by a newly emergent edifice complex.
What drives him, Mr. Cuomo said, is less the preservation of jobs than the preservation of tradition. "It is more than the Giants in New York or the Jets in New York or even the Brooklyn Dodgers in Ebbets Field. 'New York Yankees' is really one word."

HEADLINE: Whitman and Florio Issue Pair of Hard-Edged Ads

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST WINDSOR, N.J., Oct. 2

 BODY:
With a month of campaigning to go in the race for governor, Jim Florio and his Republican challenger, Christine Todd Whitman, have begun pounding away at each other with new ads.
The hard-edged advertisements are a familiar strategy for Mr. Florio and his campaign. But they are new ground for Mrs. Whitman, who had avoided so-called negative advertisements until recent polls showed her losing ground to Mr. Florio in what had been a dead heat as late as three weeks ago. 
 The ads are the start of what is likely to be a furious and nasty month of campaigning, and even the release of the commercials turned into a race today. Mrs. Whitman's campaign scheduled a midafternoon news conference at a hotel here, near Princeton, to announce her ad.
 
Tape Handout Near the Lobby
 But as reporters arrived, Mr. Florio's chief strategist, James Carville, was waiting off the lobby to distribute videotapes of Mr. Florio's new ad.
It opens with the taunt, "Where is Christie Whitman?" and attacks her budget plan as a fraud, citing a newspaper editorial; accuses her of being indecisive on the state's ban on semiautomatic weapons, while showing her firing a rifle at a range, and contends that she is against welfare reforms.
Mrs. Whitman's ad criticizes Mr. Florio for the $2.8 billion tax increase that he pushed through the Legislature after his election in 1990. The ad accuses Mr. Florio of lying to the public and contends that the increased taxes drove 8,000 businesses into failure and cost 280,000 jobs.
 
Big Lead in Polls
 "Now Florio refuses to rule out raising taxes again," an announcer says. "Jim Florio, he may be the worst governor New Jersey's ever had."
After a summer of promoting their views to a sometimes uninterested public, Mr. Florio and Mrs. Whitman now rest their hopes on four weeks crammed with nonstop broadcast advertisements, whistle-stop tours and three televised debates.
In the last week the complexion of the race changed because of public-opinion polls showing Mr. Florio in the lead, including The New York Times/WCBS-TV News poll released on Tuesday that showed Mr. Florio with a 21 percentage-point lead.
At midweek Mrs. Whitman demoted her manager, her brother Webster B. Todd, and placed the day-to-day operation of her campaign in the hands of Ed Rollins, her chief political strategist and a former political adviser to President Ronald Reagan.
Mr. Rollins has set about to change the focus of Mrs. Whitman's campaign from her widely criticized tax-cutting economic plan that she has promoted for two weeks to sharper and more personal criticisms of Mr. Florio. Broadcast ads released this weekend reflect that change.
 
Warm-Up for the Debates
 Up to now, Mr. Florio's campaign has been the clear aggressor, pounding Mrs. Whitman almost daily on some point and making personal attacks on her over her wealth.
"I expect us to be even more aggressive here in October," Mr. Carville said. "We are going to continue to draw distinctions between us and Mrs. Whitman. It's going to be a lot of talk about guns and the National Rifle Association, about welfare, about drunken driving and a lot of talk about her pie-in-the-sky promises."
The rancor is most likely a warm-up for the debates, the first of which will be here at 8 P.M. on Thursday and broadcast over WABC-TV in New York and WPVI-TV in Philadelphia. The other debates, also to be televised, are on Oct. 19 and 24.
 
Challenge to Become Known
 Despite Mr. Florio's standings in the polls, there is ample evidence of the volatility of voters in gubernatorial elections. Over half those polled, 54 percent, in The Times/WCBS-TV poll, said they were undecided or might change their minds before Nov. 2.
Mrs. Whitman shows some clear strengths like the issue of trust, but she also faces huge tasks, the most pressing of which is to make herself much better known to the electorate.
"The Whitman campaign has failed in the primary responsibility of letting people know who she is," Neil Upmeyer, president of the Center for the Analysis of Public Issues in Princeton, said. "She has been telling voters all along that the issues are jobs and the economy. If she suddenly now says the issue is Jim Florio and his ethics, then that is going to raise even more confusion about her."
 
Sheltering of Candidate
 But at this late date Mrs. Whitman's campaign aides apparently feel they have little choice, and she has steered her effort in a different direction. The campaign has also become more open to reporters, inviting reporters to preview television and radio ads and scheduling a news conference for Monday at the State House in Trenton.
Under Mr. Todd's direction the strategy had been to shelter Mrs. Whitman from reporters as much as possible. In the summer she held few news conferences, and her schedule was filled with friendly venues.
That allowed Mr. Florio, through a daily barrage of news releases from his staff and manipulation of the power of incumbency, to command headlines as he tried to paint Mrs. Whitman as out of touch with the common voter because of her wealth, soft on crime and an ally of the National Rifle Association and its effort to overturn the state ban on semiautomatic weapons.
The Times/WCBS-TV poll showed that much of the plan has worked. Thirty percent of the registered voters who were surveyed said Mrs. Whitman understood their needs and problems; 45 percent said she did not. For Mr. Florio, 59 percent said he was more in tune with them.
The sampling error is 4 percentage points.
Nearly one-third, 32 percent, said Mrs. Whitman was "too close to the N.R.A." an idea driven home in Mr. Florio's speeches and ads.

HEADLINE: Bosnia's Desperate Gamble: Winter in Time of War

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Oct. 2

 BODY:
When the Muslim-led Parliament of Bosnia walked away from a peace plan this week, some members said they had given up their last chance of salvaging a territory of their own from the wreckage of their country.
As the Parliament dispersed, one legislator after another spoke of the agonies of conscience involved in rejecting a chance for peace. Several said that the Parliament's decision could mean life or death for tens of thousands of people, mainly Muslims. 
 Lord Owen of Britain, one of the mediators who has spent months negotiating with the Serbian leaders, was among those who feared that there could be more than bluster in Serbian warnings that rejecting the peace plan would lead to the "flattening" of Sarajevo and the extinction of Muslims as a political force.
 
No Illusions Left
 Radovan Karadzic, the Serbian nationalist leader in Bosnia, has said for weeks that if Muslims reject a state of their own on the 30 percent of Bosnia offered to them in the peace plan, they will end up with no state at all.
Until recently, in virtually every move it made, the Bosnian Government was motivated by the hope of Western military intervention. But by the time the Parliament met there were no illusions left.
President Alija Izetbegovic, who met President Clinton in Washington last month, told the legislators that Mr. Clinton had closed the door on military intervention, telling him that the Bosnian Government should make the best deal it could in the Geneva talks.
"Have no doubt about this," Mr. Izetbegovic said. "There will be no American intervention. We are on our own."
Mr. Izetbegovic has often been accused of engaging in public agonizing over Bosnia's fate instead of offering decisive leadership, and his performance in Parliament did little to assuage his critics.
 
'A Personal Tragedy'
 Calling the choice before the Parliament "a personal tragedy for all of us," he said he was unable to recommend acceptance or rejection of the peace plan. Instead, he offered arguments -- nine for the plan, five against -- and urged the legislators to make their own choice.
In opting for a middle course -- accepting the principle of Bosnia's dismemberment into three ethnic states, for Croats, Muslims and Serbs, but demanding a share of the territory closer to the Muslim proportion in the population, 43.7 percent -- the legislators appeared to have been swayed by several considerations.
The most powerful of these may have been one that Mr. Izetbegovic did not mention, but that many legislators spoke of off the debating floor: the unwillingness to be associated in history with an agreement that would bring an end to Bosnia's existence, after 1,000 years, as a territory where people of different faiths and cultures have mixed freely.
"These people feel like people who have been asked to sign their own death sentence," a Bosnian Government minister said. "Their attitude is, 'If they're going to hang us, at least don't ask us to give our assent.' "
Along with this, there were many in Parliament who said that they were deeply skeptical of the willingness of the Serbian leaders to carry out the pact, which would require the Serbian forces to withdraw from territories amounting to 25 percent of Bosnia. The history of the war has been one of broken agreements, and the legislators said the peace accord was so loosely worded ed and so lacking in enforcement mechanisms that it seemed to invite defiance.
 
Doubts in the U.S.
 In this, they shared similar concerns with members of Congress who have cast doubt on President Clinton's pledge to commit 25,000 troops to a 50,000-member NATO peacekeeping force if the peace pact is concluded. Like the American politicians who question committing troops to a situation where they could be trapped by renewed fighting, many legislators said they feared the peace agreement could be as elusive as the pledges Serbian leaders signed in London a year ago, promising to end "ethnic cleansing," to halt the use of heavy artillery against civilians, and to allow free passage of relief convoys.
Just as many Muslims at an earlier stage of the war pinned their hopes on United States military intervention, there are many now who see the prospect of having American troops here to enforce the peace pact as the saving grace of an accord that is widely regarded among Muslims as an appeasement of Serbian and Croatian territorial aggression.
Amid the general gloom that pervaded the debate, some legislators said that by accepting the peace pact now, Muslims might be dooming Bosnia as a country just at the moment when the tide in the war was beginning to shift.
Recent successes scored by Bosnian forces against Croatian nationalist troops in central Bosnia, where a string of towns have fallen to Muslim units, has boosted morale. Although Serbian forces remain dominant wherever they meet the outgunned Bosnian troops, many in the Parliament said that they saw signs that backing for the Serbian nationalist cause in Serbia was beginning to crumble under the pressure of international economic sanctions.
 
An Enormous Gamble
 But when the vote was taken, the sense among those who rejected the peace pact was that they had taken an enormous gamble. Apart from the risk of renewed Serbian offensives, thoughts of the approaching winter weighed on many minds.
United Nations relief officials have warned of a disaster for the 2.7 million Bosnians dependent on United Nations food supplies if the war continues into the winter, when snow-clogged mountain passes will cause new delays to aid convoys and many families will have to survive without fuel for heating.
"Winter will be tough enough" for Serbian and Croatian troops in the field, Mr. Izetbegovic told the legislators. "For us, it will be unbearable."

HEADLINE: Mandela Looking for Free-Market Investors

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
Having been viewed as a liberator and a martyr, Nelson Mandela has now cast himself in a new, seemingly unfamiliar role: salesman for his country.
But Mr. Mandela, the head of the African National Congress, has found himself somewhat frustrated by the hesitancy of some members of the anti-apartheid movement in the United States to back fully the lifting of sanctions on South Africa. 
 In the week since Mr. Mandela called for the end of economic and trade sanctions, he has journeyed back and forth between Washington and New York, meeting with business executives, portfolio managers, pension fund trustees, stock brokers and officials of the International Monetary Fund, all in an effort to attract investment in South Africa.
Seeking to reassure potential investors, he has shed the Marxist language that used to characterize African National Congress pronouncements on the economy and is now sounding the theme of free-market capitalism.
"We are aware that we live in a world in which there is intense competition for scarce capital," Mr. Mandela said Friday in a speech to portfolio managers, venture capitalists, stock brokers, pension fund trustees and others who have money to invest. "We are therefore determined to insure that our own country becomes an attractive destination for the enormous capital resources held by the institutions you represent."
In their addresses and in interviews with journalists, Mr. Mandela and others in the South African delegation have stressed such things as competitive tax policies, the continued independence of the central bank, a constitution that will guard against arbitrary seizure of property and the need to control the spiraling violence that has wracked several parts of the country, most notably Natal and the Transvaal.
Mr. Mandela acknowledged that violence in his country is a major impediment to investment, and vowed to bring it under control. He stressed the need for foreign investment so economic development could forestall future political extremism.
"It would be reasonable for investors to be extremely cautious in investing in our country because of political instability and a lack of predictability, and, secondly, because of the alarmingly high level of the violence that is ravaging the country," Mr. Mandela said. "Conditions which can attract investment do not fully exist in our country."
But he insisted that much of the violence was politically motivated and fomented by right-wing elements opposed to the rule of the country's black majority. Mr. Mandela said that once the Transitional Executive Council, which will oversee government activity until the election on April 27, and a new peacekeeping force begin functioning, the level of violence will decrease.
While Mr. Mandela, who emerged from 27 years in prison in 1990 and will probably be his country's next leader, may feel the necessity to turn salesman for South Africa, he is clearly uncomfortable doing it. Reflecting his unfamiliarity with economics as opposed to politics, his speeches on the need for economic development are read in a wooden manner, with little flourish and few ad libs. When he concludes his sales pitch, he immediately turns the podium over to his economic advisers to handle questions.
In contrast, at a dinner at the British Embassy in Washington on Thursday night, Mr. Mandela extemporized with gusto on the need to build political bridges to all of South Africa's political parties and described how that was causing him to lose support among his hard-core backers in the African National Congress.
Yet even while much of the talk was about future tax structures, possible trends in domestic spending and export controls, hanging over all Mr. Mandela's appearances were questions over the continued high levels of violence. Frederick Thorne, a director at Harbor Capital Management, a Boston investment concern, said that was the question most asked by his clients.
"They are concerned about the tremendous amount of civil strife," Mr. Thorne said. "It's terribly disruptive to a country that is trying to straighten itself out economically."

HEADLINE: Yale Inaugurates Dean and Economist as Its 22d President

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN, Oct. 2

 BODY:
Richard C. Levin was inaugurated today as the 22d president of Yale University in a traditional bell-ringing ceremony. He capped the installation with a lyrical effort to heal the wounds from the faculty revolt last year that led to the resignation of his predecessor.
The new president, who is 46 and the former dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, specializes in technological change, and he sought to reassure those engaged in university-based research that he is their champion. 
 Some critics, most of them outside the universities, have contended that the major educational institutions have promoted research, much of it inconsequential, at the expense of teaching.
"Today," Mr. Levin said, "the scientific capability of American universities is the envy of the world. We neglect its support at our peril."
After reciting lines from Sophocles's "Antigone," Mr. Levin said in his inaugural address that the purity of spirit of the Greek heroine, who chose self-sacrifice over yielding on principle, should be a model for "the social order we create within the university."
 
List of Prominent Alumni
 Then, like an old-time preacher whipping up enthusiasm by calling the roll of saints, Mr. Levin, who remains the Frederick William Beinecke Professor of Economics, recited a list of notable Yale alumni. The list included 14 members of the Continental Congress, 4 signers of the Declaration of Independence, 3 of the last 5 Presidents of the United States, 10 of the 100 Senators in office and, for good measure, Eli Whitney, Samuel F. B. Morse, Walter Camp and Cole Porter.
Despite a colorful procession, heraldic banners snapping in the wind, blue academic gowns and other trappings that date from the Middle Ages, Mr. Levin broke with one tradition. He dispensed with the formal dinner and held a reception for the entire community.
"That's more in the spirit of my administration than a black-tie dinner," he said.
Although his speech concentrated on uplift and unity, Mr. Levin spoke frankly on sensitive issues in an interview on Friday night.
Trouble developed last year when the president, Benno C. Schmidt Jr., whose dealings with some faculty members had created enemies, announced a plan to close a huge budget gap by eliminating nearly 11 percent of the faculty of arts and sciences and by cutting programs and departments.
The faculty and students rebelled, voicing their anger at meetings and at one point sending an anti-Schmidt pamphlet to many alumni. In short order two of Mr. Schmidt's highest appointees resigned, followed by Mr. Schmidt himself. He left in June 1992 to head the Edison Project, a venture to create a national private-school system.
A history professor, Howard R. Lamar, was interim president until Mr. Levin took office on July 1.
In his interview Mr. Levin said he did not expect to be forced to make the deep cuts in the faculty and academic programs that Mr. Schmidt and his aides had proposed.
"Large savings have already been made by cuts in administrative and support services," he said.
"For example, for the fiscal year that ended in July, we cut the deficit, from a projected $22 million to $14.5 million. "That may sound like a lot. But that $14.5 million is less than the interest we pay on the loans taken out for renovation of the physical plant. Meanwhile our endowment has grown, from $2.8 billion to $3.2 billion, an increase of $400 million. So I don't anticipate having to make substantial programmatic cuts."
 
 'Centers of Excellence'
 But Mr. Levin acknowledged that he had been considering making the university smaller in some respects.
"You can't be good at everything," he said. "We don't have to deal with every subspecialty in every field. Instead we can create centers of excellence within departments and within professional schools."
On productivity, a term that academic circles use to focus on the cost of education per student, Mr. Levin, an industrial economist, said:
"When you talk about renovating the plant, most of our buildings were constructed in the 1920's and 1930's,and they need new heating and electrical systems. There, productivity is important. But if you think of students as our output, the only way you can produce more students per faculty member is to change the nature of education. I'm not for that. I don't want to substitute machines for teachers.
"At Harvard and Stanford new presidents have proclaimed that their No. 1 problem is to get their faculties to focus on teaching. But that's not a problem at Yale, where we pay close attention to it. Sure, we're not a four-year liberal-arts college, where teaching is given greater emphasis than research. We're committed to increasing human knowledge. But we have very few courses taught by graduate students."
 
Doctorate in 1974
 Mr. Levin was born in San Francisco. He received a bachelor's in history from Stanford and studied politics and philosophy at Oxford, where he received a graduate degree in political science in 1971. He received a Ph.D. in economics from Yale in 1974 and joined the economics faculty that year.
In addition to serving on policy committees, Mr. Levin was the chairman of the economics department from 1987 to last year, when he was appointed dean of the largest of the 11 graduate and professional schools at Yale.

HEADLINE: Seeking A Chance For a Home

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY

 BODY:
Lydia Watt stuffs pillows, blankets and sheets under the door to keep rats out of her bedroom at night in her small apartment in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. Some mornings, she wakes up to find her small kitchen ransacked by the rodents, with cereal, sugar and flour spilled everywhere.
"I just got fed up," she said, speaking through the window of a second-floor, two-bedroom apartment that she invaded with friends on Friday in a nearly completed public housing project at South 10th and Berry Streets in Williamsburg. "What we've done here should put everyone on notice that we're not going to tolerate these living conditions. It's not by choice that some of us live like this. The system forces it on us." 
 Ms. Watt was among 200 Hispanic protesters who took over the 150 units of the boxy brick project about 6 P.M. on Friday, fearing that Hasidic Jews in the neighborhood might receive preferential treatment in gaining apartments when they become available. They were organized by the Southside Fair Housing Committee, which works to counter discrimination in housing.
Yesterday, after a standoff of about 18 hours, the occupants left the project, declaring a small victory. The Housing Authority, which has about 600,000 tenants citywide, essentially agreed that when the project opens in November, it will rent the apartments to a fair mix of Hispanic and Hasidic tenants, as housing officials said had been their intent all along.
 
Dreams of Stability
 Many of the invaders, single mothers and unemployed people who have been on the New York City Housing Authority waiting list of 300,000 families for years, had similar stories. They fantasized about what they would do if they lived in the apartments and how, finally, they would be able to make ends meet.
While most of them slept in the project Friday night huddled on cold concrete floors without lights, electricity or plumbing, they said the conditions were far better than where they lived, mostly doubled up with family and friends in cramped apartments with rats and roaches. Those who live in Housing Authority apartments say they are in crime-plagued neighborhoods where they live in fear.
Before they left the apartments, with views of the graceful peaks of the Williamsburg Bridge and the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan, the protesters, although tired, were upbeat. They consumed a steady flow of milk and doughnuts as they spoke through windows. Peering through black burglar bars, they looked as if they were in prison.
 
Affordable, and No Rats
 Many said they had heard about the invasion by word of mouth and had not hesitated to join in.
"I was cold last night," said Mildred Montero, 21, a single mother of two children, "but I knew I had to stay. I was just praying to God that what we were doing would somehow end in something good. Even though I had no plumbing or electricity in this apartment, it is much better than where I live."
Ms. Montero, a data processer, has lived in a one-bedroom railroad flat in Williamsburg for five months, paying $550 a month. On Friday night she occupied the tallest building in the Housing Authority project, six stories. Because it has not been completed, there is no electricity or plumbing yet.
"I can't afford it, but I have no place else to go," she said of her apartment. "After I'm done paying rent, I barely have enough to buy food for me and my children. At least if I lived here, the city would set my rent according to what I can pay."
Ms. Watt, 40, who has two daughters, said she spends most of the $468 she receives monthly from public assistance on rent for her $317 apartment on Berry Street and Broadway, she said.
"The rent here would be affordable," she said. "I would be rid of the rats and for the first time in life, I would proud of where I lived." She said she had been on the waiting list for public housing for two years.
 
Looking for Choices
 Norma Alvarez, 24, lives in a two-bedroom apartment in Bushwick with her three children. Receiving public assistance, she pays $750 a month in rent.
"I did this because I've been on a waiting list for a public-housing apartment for four years," she said, speaking from the ground floor of one of the three-story apartment buildings that has electricity and plumbing. She has been trying to find work and would like to go to college, she said, but she feels trapped.
"I don't want to be on public assistance anymore," she said. "But as long as I'm in that apartment, I don't have any choice."

HEADLINE: China's Fix for Runaway Economy Is Falling Short

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIJING, Oct. 2

 BODY:
Just a few weeks after China's economic czar, Zhu Rongji, opened his 16-point austerity program this summer, Asian and Western financiers were congratulating him on his early success in reining in China's runaway economy.
He had reimposed some central authority over China's bounding expansion by canceling scores of ill-conceived projects to pave over rice paddies with casinos and office towers and by calling in loans that were feeding a speculative frenzy in everything from condos to jetliners. 
 But more recently, the 65-year-old Mr. Zhu has admitted that the financial state of the nation is still "relatively grim" and that his progress has not been what he had hoped.
The United States Central Intelligence Agency, in a report to Congress that appears to be contested by other Government economists, is warning that economic growth and inflation in China are "threatening to spiral out of control," raising fears that social disorder could follow.
 
An Unpredictable Mess
 If there is any consensus about what is going on in China's economy today it is that it is a mess, perhaps an enviable mess to other countries that would like to see as many investors pouring into their airports as are pouring into China, but an unpredictable mess nonetheless.
Partly as a result of the new austerity measures combined with the effects of unabated inflation, some of China's state-owned factories are having trouble meeting their payrolls, and others have been forced to cut production drastically. A General Motors Corporation joint venture to build light trucks in northeastern China saw its output wither by half in the first two months of the austerity program as bank credits dried up.
Meanwhile, prices are still soaring. The cost of industrial raw materials is 40 percent higher than last year, as is the price of steel.
Inflation in big cities is at a four-year high of more than 20 percent, and China's money supply, which no central authority seems to be able to control, has been expanding at a rate of 30 percent a year since early 1992.
Still, with the steps that have been taken so far to stop wasteful investments, real estate speculation and an explosion of credit, Government economists like Fan Gang at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences assert that "the bubble" of speculation "has been stopped." But he acknowledged that "inflation is still not under control."
A World Bank economist here, who said he might have agreed with the C.I.A. analysis three months ago, added that "we were very concerned that if measures were not taken," the Chinese economy would have revved up so high that the country's transportation, energy and raw material bottlenecks would have brought on a catastrophic gridlock and crash.
 
'Too Early to Tell'
 But now, he added, "I would not say the Chinese economy is running out of control." The evidence for this assertion, he said, is that "the tremendous growth in investment has slowed down, but it is too early to tell whether that will be sufficient."
Since early summer, when China's leaders became so alarmed that they sacked the Central Bank chief and replaced him with Mr. Zhu, there has been an expectation that the acerbic former Mayor of Shanghai could somehow get the genie of money supply expansion and rampant speculation back in the bottle and China back on a footing for more rational growth.
He sent investigators to the provinces to gather information and to bully local officials who were circumventing Beijing's commands. He found some provinces building so many bridges, highways, ports and skyscrapers on concurrent schedules that they were driving material prices skyward and overloading the system.
Worse, the provincial authorities were paying their bills with a "triangular" pattern of debt passed among regional banks that was devaluing the national currency and sapping revenues needed to buy summer crops from farmers, meet factory payrolls and pay for high-priority transportation and energy projects.
 
Trying to Recover Loans
 One of Mr. Zhu's biggest gambles was that he could suck back into the banking system more than $38 billion that regional banks had lent to one another to cover credits extended out the back door to factories, developers and other investors trying to spend and get rich as fast as they could.
But in his report to the leadership on Aug. 30, Mr. Zhu admitted that he had recovered only a third of those loans, and he has now extended the deadline for regional bank officials to recover these funds to the end of the year.
Now that Mr. Zhu, by his own accounting, has failed to get inflation under control, many of China's economic reformers fear that their rivals, those old Communists who never met a free market they didn't want to bulldoze, might once again emerge.
"I think there were a lot of naive expectations outside of China that because Zhu Rongji is so competent, he would be able to engineer a soft landing for the Chinese economy," said a Western economist based here. "But there is no way for anyone to perform that kind of miracle."
 
Mostly Flying Blind
 The reason, many economists say, is that China's leaders, even when they agree on how to run their economy, are flying blind most of the time. In developed nations, central banks track money supply daily and impose discipline on credit through regulation and interest rates. In China, statistics are gathered monthly and controls are virtually nonexistent. Local officials often deceive Beijing about their lending.
In China under Communism, the People's Bank has been little more than a cash cow dispensing money to state-owned enterprises under a central plan. Taking responsibility for bad loans, maintaining capital reserves to cover loan losses and responding to money supply directives from a central authority are concepts that are still embryonic in China.
In the West, tax systems increase government revenues as the economy expands, but China's economic boomers, especially in the newly rich coastal provinces, have hoarded their money and left the Government with fewer funds to subsidize China's bottomless pit of state industries, which still soak up more than 70 percent of Government revenues each year.
 
Deng Spurred Investment
 In 1992, when China's senior leader, Deng Xiaoping, crusaded through the country's southern provinces exhorting factory managers and local officials to speed up their investment plans and thus China's economic miracle, he only added gasoline to the fire, though at the time his motive was to defeat hard-liners who were blocking progress toward a market economy.
"Right now the dangers of appearing to lose control of the economy are seen to be paramount political dangers," said David M. Lampton, president of the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations Inc., a nonprofit group that promotes American-Chinese ties.
"All of China's modern leaders have personal experience with what economic chaos brings in terms of mass suffering, not to mention its impact on political careers," Mr. Lampton said.
Mr. Zhu appears to be no exception. While one part of the Government was recently churning out anti-American propaganda over the search of the suspect Chinese freighter Yinhe in the Persian Gulf, Mr. Zhu was busy making soothing speeches to Western and Asian investors.
 
Commitment to Market
 His message is that this summer's austerity program and its reliance on the old levers of central Communist control have not dampened China's enthusiasm for "deepening" reform and building a market economy by the end of the decade. He pledged to press forward with plans to put state industries on a sink-or-swim financial footing, to build a central bank and a commercial banking system that will take responsibility for bad lending decisions and to revamp China's tax system so the Government can finance urgently needed projects.
"My guess is that he will use administrative measures that look serious to the Chen Yun and Li Peng forces," Mr. Lampton said, referring to the leaders of the conservative camp, "but I think Zhu can balance the factions and on the other hand still be seen as a pro-reform force."
One Chinese official suggested that Mr. Zhu may already be running into some resistance from the hard-liners and that his failure to control inflation has weakened his position.
"The conservatives have been saying Zhu Rongji is in charge of the economy and it is still going to the cows," the Chinese official said. "So the conservatives are a little stronger, but so far they have no alternative program."
 
Price Freezes Ordered
 This week, in a move that must have pleased the hard-liners, Mr. Zhu stomped harder on the brakes when the Government ordered price freezes on most commodities and services for the remainder of the year.
The C.I.A.'s warning aside, predictions for the outcome of the austerity program are hard to nail down.
An economist at one Western embassy said he thought that growth would decline to 6 or 7 percent next year and that China would take a one- or two-year breather to absorb the stupendous expansion of the last 18 months.
But Professor Fan predicted that China's growth rate would stay at 10 percent or more next year with continued high inflation, "but not out of control," because the leaders fear the social consequences of bringing down the boom too hard.
"So my prediction," he concluded, "is for relatively stable chaos."

HEADLINE: POLITICAL NOTES;
For Florio, Comfort From Other Governors' Distress?

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN

 BODY:
Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey may have reason to be grateful for the fiscal problems in New York and Connecticut as he campaigns for re-election, based on research by two Princeton University economists.
In their study of the impact of tax increases on the re-election chances of incumbent governors in 48 states between 1960 and 1989, Timothy Besley and Anne Case said that a governor who has presided over an increase of at least $100 per year in the tax bills of households earning $40,000 or more in 1976 dollars is 15 percent less likely to win another term than governors in states with lower increases or none at all. 
 But if a neighboring state has undergone a similar tax increase, then the incumbent is only 2 percent less likely to be re-elected, they said.
Mr. Florio, who pushed a record $2.8 billion in tax increases through the Legislature a few months after taking office in 1990, has argued that his hand was forced by an unforeseen budget deficit and a State Supreme Court decision that ordered increased state school aid to poor urban districts. He also argued that 83 percent of New Jersey taxpayers, all except those in the higher brackets, were not affected by the tax changes, although all taxpayers were affected by a sales tax increase.
But an angry voter reaction dropped Mr. Florio's approval rating to about 20 percent, nearly unseated United States Senator Bill Bradley in 1990 and allowed the Republican Party to wrest control of both houses of the Legislature from Mr. Florio's Democratic Party the following year.
Republicans are eager to continue capitalizing on the tax-increase anger to defeat Mr. Florio in the Nov. 2 election, but recent public opinion polls have found that some voters are more willing to credit Mr. Florio with making a tough, but necessary, decision.
The polls by various organizations seem to indicate that the Governor may be pulling ahead of his Republican opponent, Christine Todd Whitman, who has made criticism of Mr. Florio's decision to raise taxes the cornerstone of her campaign.
If the Princeton economists are correct, Mr. Florio may have the budget problems in New York and Connecticut to thank for the softening of voter outrage.
"New York State has had several years of budget crises, and that alone should help Florio," Ms. Case said. "And Connecticut, whose struggles should be familiar to New Jerseyans since it shares the same New York-area media market as much of New Jersey, has enacted its first income tax."
Mr. Besley said voters are aware of what is happening in neighboring states and can apply it to Mr. Florio's situation. "Viewing the election in isolation might give a misleading conclusion about his prospects," he said.
 
Inquiry on an Aid Bonus
 How Lyndhurst received $1.5 million in state aid that it wasn't entitled to continues to fascinate the Republican majority in the State Senate, which hopes to capitalize on it in next month's legislative races.
According to a report by the State Attorney General's office in August, a Democratic Senator, Gabriel M. Ambrosio, persuaded John Ellis, then the Education Commissioner, to increase school aid to the town by $1.5 million in 1991, even though, the Attorney General's report said, Mr. Ambrosio intended that the money would not go to schools but to hold the line on local property taxes.
Mr. Ellis subsequently rescinded the award, and Mr. Ambrosio got the $1.5 million restored through the Legislature, according to the report. All of this happened before the 1991 elections, when Mr. Ambrosio and other Democrats were fighting unsuccessfully to keep control of the Senate.
The former Attorney General, Robert J. Del Tufo, nullified the special aid award, and the office has said it will attempt to recover the money.
But the Senate Law and Public Safety Committee has been conducting its own hearings on the Lyndhurst aid, and Senator Louis F. Kosco, Republican of Paramus, said two Education Department officials testified that the Attorney General's office tried to pressure them into dropping their request for an investigation.
The Senate passed a bill that would create an independent counsel to conduct an investigation and sent it to the Assembly, which probably won't vote until after the election. It remains to be seen if the Republicans' interest will be as strong then.
 
A Hatch Act Opening
 Senator Dick LaRossa, Republican of Trenton, wants his opponent, former Senator Gerry Stockman and Mr. Stockman's Assembly running mates to drop out of the race, because, he says, they violated the Federal Hatch Act, which prohibits partisan election activities by Federal officials or state officials who handle Federal money.
Mr. LaRossa points to an invitation to a $200-per-person fund-raiser for Mr. Stockman's running mates, Shirley Turner and Joe Yuhas, that lists Dr. Bruce Siegal, the New Jersey Health Commissioner, and two other state officials as the hosts. Mr. La Rossa said the participation by the state officials violates the Hatch Act.
Rich McClellan, the campaign director for the Democratic candidates, said the propriety of the officials' sponsorship of the reception was checked and cleared. However, he said the event was canceled to avoid giving Mr. LaRossa anything to complain about. "The people involved are blameless, but as they say in the hot dog commercial, we'll answer to a higher authority."

HEADLINE: Walking Away, While He Still Can;
Troubled and Fearing Injury, Timm Rosenbach Quit Football

BYLINE: By IRA BERKOW, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PULLMAN, Wash.

 BODY:
Timm Rosenbach remembers clearly the beginning of the end because everything was pitch black.
He woke up in a dark room with his head strapped to a table, still wearing his Phoenix Cardinals uniform and shoulder pads and hip pads and cleats. He was frightened and alone, not sure if he was alive or dead. He couldn't move, didn't want to move. He knew he had been hurt, but didn't know how badly. He thought about his friend and former college teammate, Mike Utley of the Lions, who the year before had taken a tumble in a game and been left paralyzed for life from the chest down. 
 Then Rosenbach remembered the hit he had taken earlier that day. Was it minutes ago? Was it hours? Rosenbach, a 6-foot quarterback, was dropping back to pass in the third quarter of the season opener when he was blindsided by Santana Dodson, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' 6--5, 270-pound defensive end, in one of the brutal encounters that is commonplace in a National Football League game.
Rosenbach remembered only the resounding impact, as if being leveled by a tank, and then nothing. Until that moment in the room. And then, just as suddenly, he blacked out again.
This was Sunday, Sept. 6, 1992, in an X-ray room at St. Joseph's Hospital in Phoenix. Rosenbach was not aware that he had been taken, unmoving, from the field at Sun Devils Stadium on a stretcher and rushed to the emergency room. He was not aware that he had suffered only a severe concussion when his head slammed into the turf.
He would walk and talk normally again, even report back for work two days later, but the grim experience would not leave him. In the following game, he returned to the lineup only to be blindsided again, this time by Clyde Simmons, Philadelphia's 6-6, 280-pound defensive end, on the Cardinals' second series of the game.
"I made sure that the next time I get hit, I don't go head first," Rosenbach recalled, "and I didn't. I went shoulder first." And he suffered a separated shoulder. He was out of action for a month.
After the last game of the season, Dec. 27, 1992, Rosenbach, at age 26, did what some thought was unthinkable: He walked away from professional football and $1.05 million, the salary for the fifth and last year of his $5.3 million contract. He left the field and the money because he had developed fears that he might be crippled if he continued to play and because he began to "despise," as he said, the dehumanizing aspects of football that "can turn you into an animal."
It wasn't always that way. Two years earlier, in 1990, in his second year in the N.F.L., he took every snap for the Cardinals, all 1,001 of them, throwing for 3,098 yards to rank third in the National Football Conference. He ranked second in the N.F.L. in rushing yardage for a quarterback, behind Randall Cunningham. He threw 16 touchdown passes. He was admired, as one Phoenix sports reporter wrote, because "He was feisty. Gutsy. Combative. Ornery." His coach, Joe Bugel, called him "a throwback," a "gun-slingin', beer-drinkin' tough" in the mold of the late and colorful Bobby Layne.
Last summer, when it became apparent that Rosenbach had made his decision to quit football and return to Washington State University -- where he had starred in football and where he was 38 hours short of a bachelor's degree in general studies with an emphasis in psychology -- he didn't call the team. His agent, Gary Wichard, did. Rosenbach changed his unlisted phone number so that no one from the Cardinals organization could call to try to talk him out of retiring and no reporter could call and ask why.
Football generally had been fun for Rosenbach in school, and even into the pros -- he once relished the contact, proudly looking in the mirror at his bruises as an affirmation of manhood. But he was not prepared, as a 22-year-old right out of college for the hard-edged business of professional football, nor for the debilitating injuries that had sidelined him. And while his associations with a number of his teammates remained close, his view of this odd occupation became deeper, and darker.
There was speculation that Rosenbach had decided to become a professional rodeo rider, since he had participated as a team roper in a half-dozen events. When he married Carrie Serrano in June 1992, at his new 10-acre ranch in Gilbert, Ariz., the ceremony was held outdoors under a sagebrush arch with groom and groomsmen bedecked in black cowboy hats, tuxedo tops, black jeans and black cowboy boots.
"It's all a mystery to me," said Bugel. "I'd like for him to tell me right to my face what the problem is."
"I've seen young guys retire, un-retire, but certainly not a player of Timm's stature," said Larry Wilson, the Cardinals' general manager. "This is kind of strange."
But there was more to it than just the bruises of the business. "I thought I was turning into some kind of animal," Rosenbach said in a recent interview. "You go through a week getting yourself up for a game by hating the other team, the other players. You're so mean and hateful, you want to kill somebody. Football's so aggressive. Things get done by force. And then you come home, you're supposed to turn it off? 'Oh, here's your lovin' daddy.' It's not that easy. It was like I was an idiot. I felt programmed. I had become a machine. I became sick of it."
He remembered those "barbaric yawps," as he called them, when breaking from a huddle and the players began screaming like maniacs. "It lightened things up," said Rosenbach, "but it's still a part of the craziness of football. Like screaming at the other team at the top of your lungs all kinds of threats and obscenities."
He remembers his center, Bill Lewis, telling an opposing lineman, "You touch my quarterback and I'll end your career." He remembers players like Refrigerator Perry snarling with his huge face scrunched up inside his tight helmet. And then there was Reggie White: "He is very religious, and he'd hit you a murderous shot and then say, 'God bless you,' as he pulled you off the ground."
Rosenbach also felt the pressures that go with winning, or losing. "I began to despise the whole business of the N.F.L.," he said. When he was injured, he felt that the coaches, particularly head coaches, hardly recognized him. Since he was of no value to them, he was a virtual nonentity. When he was hurt, he wasn't even asked to travel with the team. "They asked, 'How're you feelin'?' But with no feeling," he said. "Their answer to injury is to give you painkiller pills. And the whole concept of medicine is to get you ready to perform -- what happens to you down the road is not of any interest to them.
"Team doctors often lose touch with humanity, too. They are working for the team, and love the association. So you hear players on the plane after a game and saying, 'Hey, Doc, give me some Percodin or Percoset or Codeine Tylenol or something else. When did players become pharmacists?
"And coaches are so absorbed in the X's and O's that they lose any feeling of being a human being. I guess the pressure is so great on them. I feel they viewed me -- us -- as robots. A mechanism. And if you don't fit the slot you're nothing to them."
 
Daredevil Turns Cautious
 One trick of being a professional athlete, he understood, was not to think too much. He had been a kind of daredevil quarterback, enjoying the contact, loving that glazed feeling when you hardly know where you are, even baiting some of the huge opponents like Perry during the heat of a game -- "It takes a long time to get all that into motion, doesn't it?" -- but when he returned to the lineup in the latter part of last season, things were different.
He couldn't move the way he used to because his knee was wrapped in a brace, and for the first time he felt fear on a football field, the fear of ending up a cripple. He had already missed the entire 1991 season because of a severed ligament incurred in a preseason practice a week before the opener. The injury required reconstructive surgery and rehabilitation and made him question his existence as a pro football player.
The challenge of going against ferocious linemen like Lawrence Taylor and White and Simmons and Perry, which had whetted his competitive appetite, had taken a different turn. "I got scared looking at the linemen before the snap," he said. "I remember I could feel the earth pounding when they chased me. When I went back to pass now, I was more concerned with where those guys were and less about where my receivers were going."
He said there was a lot of fear in the N.F.L. "Guys don't talk about it," he said, "but they feel it. And when you really know the game, you can spot them. But a lot aren't making the kind of money I did. And when a guy's making, say, $65,000 a year, and this is the only place he can make that kind of money, he's not about to get out."
After the injuries, his confidence, as well as his enthusiasm ebbed noticeably. He was booed. He remembers the discomfort of meeting people and feeling he had to apologize for his performance or the team's losses.
"Timm would come home in these moods," said his wife, Carrie, "and we were newlyweds. I didn't know what the problem was. He'd sit in a dark corner. I thought it was me. I thought, 'Why can't I make him happy?' But then I began to understand all the pressures he was under. And of course the pain. After some games, Timm was so bruised and battered it would take him a half-hour to get out of bed. And sometimes it would take him a half-hour to get off the couch and into bed."
The other side of life in the N.F.L. for Rosenbach was that of "royalty," as he describes it. In those earlier, more relaxed days, he felt pampered, and that it was his due.
"I had a lot of money -- more than I ever dreamed -- a great apartment, several cars, and wanted for nothing," he said. "I had become pretty arrogant. My neighbors hated me. I lived in an exclusive condominium in my first few years and played my music loud and didn't throw my garbage in the dumpster but left it on the porch."
"I almost never washed my clothes," he said. "When they got dirty, I threw them into the closet and went down to the mall and bought some more. I was young and rich and a professional athlete and I had no sense of reality. Just like most of the rest of the guys I played with."
 
Happy With a Lot Less
 Rosenbach's late father, Lynn, was a high school football coach and later the assistant athletic director at Washington State. His mother, Rosie, is an interior decorator. His brother, Todd, teaches special education, and his sister, Dana, is a high school teacher.
"When I went back and saw their lives," he said, "saw how they were all doing well on salaries that weren't a million dollars a year, and happy with their lives, I felt embarrassed for myself."
He spoke with Carrie about quitting and giving up that $1 million, as well as the millions that he might earn in football in the coming years.
"I didn't know how he could just give up all that money," said Carrie. "But after a while I understood. He said that if he had to pump gas, he'd do it rather than play football. And it was true."
In Phoenix, he was being called a "no-show," and a "mystery man."
But his agent, Gary Wichard, said: "Timm's an intelligent, sensitive guy, and he has made a decision that he's had it with football. He could have come in for a year and held for extra points and field goals, but that's just not Timm."
"I'm proud of Rosey," said Jim Wahler, a defensive lineman for the Redskins and a former Cardinal teammate of Rosenbach's. "I'm glad he did it. There are not many people in that position to do that. That's a standup thing to walk out on your own terms and not somebody else's. Most guys would like that opportunity."
He still has his ranch in Gilbert, but now lives with Carrie and seven dogs in a small house in an isolated area about eight miles outside of Pullman, Wash. She is a graduate of Arizona State and is in school at Washington State going for a master's degree in agricultural economy. Rosenbach has returned to general studies with a psychology emphasis.
Is he happier? "Yes," he said. "I was getting no enjoyment out of football anymore.
"It's funny, but when I was in school here before I sat in the back of the class and never said a word. Now I'm involved in the classes, and I'm always raising my hand. I'm sure some of the students are saying, 'Why doesn't that old guy just shut up?' "
Rosenbach hardly looks ancient in his sweatshirt and jeans. He still has that broad, boyish look and a cowlick in his short blond hair. And he also hasn't totally given up on football. He says a college game is still one of the exciting spectacles for him. And he still watches pro games on television, remembering the pleasure of the camaraderie of teammates, though he sees the action differently than he once did.
And he still has his memories of playing the game, every morning. His knees, his back, his shoulders still ache when he wakes up and slowly gets out of bed. When he drives for any distance in his truck, or walks distances when he is out hunting birds, his body hurts.
"And I'm still an alumnus of the N.F.L., it is still something I'm proud of," he said. "And I guess one day I'll be invited to some of those alumni golf tournaments, and wear an N.F.L. cap and play, if I can stand up."

HEADLINE: A Practical Woman With Dreams Intact

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE

 BODY:
Willye B. White's grandfather led her out to the rattlesnake-infested fields of Greenwood, Miss., and laid out the options; she could get pregnant, drop out of school and spend her life right here chopping cotton or she could go to college and create her own destiny. By the time she was 10 years old, Willye had plotted her escape. She would run to freedom.
That was 43 years ago, and Willye White is still running, slower now, through the South Side of Chicago, so she can talk to girls along the way, tell them to take control of their lives, to be free and independent people. A five-time Olympian who has never struck gold but who has always supported herself and spoken her mind, White has reached middle age a practical woman with dreams. 
 She was in a typically chatty mood this week. She is unemployed for the first time in 28 years, and has been using the time to hit the charity golf and banquet circuit and pitch her plan for a sports and education center. She's in town for the annual conference and award dinner Monday of the Women's Sports Foundation.
"This is such a society of the now," she said, "and we athletes think we will always be loved. We aren't taught, we don't want to hear, that once the lights go out, it's over.
"You would not believe how many athletes are struggling. Big names. Legends that are destitute. And they're hiding, they're so ashamed. They don't know how to take care of themselves. If I had won a gold medal in 1956, when I was 16, I might have stopped growing, too.
"We are taught to believe that the object in life is to win the gold, and that will open all the doors. Well, they don't tell us that it will open the door only a crack, and that you need lots more to open it all the way. You need presence and personality and marketability."
She added: "I came out of a challenging situation. My father left my mother after I was born because I was so much lighter than he was. And my eyes were green. He said I wasn't his. Ignorance. My mother gave me away to her parents. Turned out, I was his spit image. On his deathbed, he said, 'You are my child.'
"By the time I was 10, I knew there was something I could do. I was running on the high school varsity. By 12, I was starting on the high school basketball team. All I had to do was keep running and not get pregnant and I'd get out of Mississippi."
As a high school student, Willye spent summers at Tennessee State's track and field camp. Ed Temple was the coach, Wilma Rudolph her most illustrious teammate. White went to her first Olympics, in Melbourne, Australia, as a Tigerbelle and won a silver medal in the long jump.
"It was almost an embarrassment, coming in second," White remembered. "Worth one line in the paper. Second best in the world is treated like a shame. In the long run, I think athletes who win silvers and bronzes may do better than athletes who win the gold because we're still out there trying to get better."
She won another silver in 1960, in Rome, on the 400-meter relay team. She transferred out of Tennessee State after six months.
"Coach Temple wanted to control every aspect of your life, training, classes, who you dated, and I was too much of a free spirit for that."
She moved to Chicago State. When she couldn't crack the black quotas in nursing schools, she became a practical nurse. She began running for Mayor Daley's Youth Foundation and by 1965 got the first of a string of patronage city jobs, usually in the Board of Education or the Health Department. Along the way, she got a degree in public administration. A month ago, her job was phased out.
While White is well-known in national sports circles as a lively, generous resource, her public voice is less well-known; her energies have been spent in her community promoting programs for children rather than deals for herself. A visionary, White has never lost the athlete's compulsion to find a lesson in every loss.
"When Pennell died," she said, referring to the death last Sunday of a fellow Olympian, pole-vaulter John Pennell, "I decided I'm going to divorce from my life all unkind, unhappy people with attitudes. Even on a date with a man, from here on in, if you don't make me laugh right away, you are gone."
At 53 years old, like Pennell, Willye White has a plan.
"The hook would be a 200-meter indoor track that kids could reach by public transportation. And once I had them, I would teach them everything," she said."
White is not the only person who wants to shake the corporate money trees to give poor kids a running start. But hers is a voice worth listening to. She remained on the South Side of Chicago when she could have afforded the lake because she felt it was her responsibility to be "hands-on" rather than another flashy ex-jock showing up only for the photo-op.
"Now, Billie Jean King is a person who went out and helped people hands-on. But all these years in Chicago, I've never seen Bo Jackson on the street. I like Michael Jordan because he's got personality and he cares about family, but I've only met him at functions. I think William Perry was a disgrace, that tooth out, so fat. Charles Barkley is disgusting.
"I still live in the inner city because I don't want kids to think I deserted them. You know, there's a movement of middle-class blacks coming back. If we don't, we'll lose our schools and our neighborhoods to the gangsters.
"Kids will listen to me because they see me around. And I'll listen to them. What do they want to do, let's ask them. All we seem to do is tell them 'Just say no.'
"How can you tell that to a kid who saw her father get shot, who got shot herself in a drive-by, who has to walk an extra mile to get to school to circle around gang turf? Go ask that girl why she got pregnant at 15 and she might tell you the truth, she wanted someone to love her, and then you ask her how can you get someone to love you if you don't love yourself?"
Although her last city job was phased out, White is looking at the loss as a gain to find a corporation interested in the future.
"How about the Willye White Developmental Center? I'd bring in friends who are great hands-on, Nancy Lieberman, Pat Connolly, Ralph Boston, and I'd staff the place with senior citizens, they'll work for the minimum wage.
"I'm not interested in developing athletes, sports is just my hook to get that grass-roots kid. Athletes are prostituted in this society and the coaches aren't helping, they're not teaching kids that sports is just for a short time, you need other skills."
White's strength, she feels, came from the grandparents who raised her and also from that pre-integration, separate-but-equal world in which black teachers and coaches and ministers lived in the same community with the children who most needed their helping hands. She would like to find a way to recreate some of that sense of community.
"What do you think of Willye White World?"

To the Editor:
Regarding "Hey Boomers: Share the Wealth, Dudes" (Viewpoints, Sept. 26), it's about time for the geniuses in corporate America to wake up and recognize the danger of destroying their customer base as demonstrated by their unwillingness to provide real jobs for the twentysomething generation. The brain trust of business once again illustrates their wonderful capacity to think solely in terms of short-run profits. Just who do these companies expect to buy their goods and services in the future? 
 The notion of failing to provide real, well-paying jobs goes against all common sense. First of all, if twentysomethings are not given an opportunity to earn a decent paycheck, where are they supposed to get the money to purchase the goods and services provided by these companies? Secondly, paying people obscenely low wages is a guaranteed way to lower employee morale and increase turnover. It does not take a rocket scientist to recognize how stupid it is to continue such a policy, yet business owners and executives show no signs of reversing this trend. Obviously, these people are not as smart as they hold themselves out to be.
To all you Boomers hoarding the wealth and arrogantly overstating your self-importance, remember what goes around comes around. The twentysomethings will not soon forget your selfishness. When they somehow manage to put themselves in a position to purchase goods and services, do not count on them making your company their first choice. The double whammy of consumer backlash and a sizable segment of the customer base lacking sufficient purchasing power will put a significant dent in your profits. Instead of thinking in terms of the bottom line, try using some vision. Inevitably the future will arrive, but will you be prepared?

To the Editor:
The suggestion that employers hire more of the members of the generation born after 1961, not as temps but in real jobs with real opportunities, should prompt any fair-minded employer to make the following reply: 
 Sure, I'll hire a young person who happens to be the best candidate for the job, just as I'll hire a middle-aged or old person who happens to be the best candidate. But giving priority to people born after 1961 is age discrimination in favor of the young, a form of bias the job market has plenty of already.

HEADLINE: A Sounder Pesticide Law

 BODY:
Lost in the hullabaloo surrounding President Clinton's health care speech last month was another important Administration proposal: a comprehensive overhaul of pesticide laws. The proposal was promptly denounced by environmentalists as too permissive and by industry groups as too restrictive. But it looks like a reasonable compromise that should make the food supply safer.
The core of the compromise is a swap that makes both sides angry. The Administration proposes to do away with the 35-year-old Delaney Clause, a law that absolutely prohibits adding cancer-causing substances to processed foods but does not apply to fresh foods, which are allowed to contain cancer-causing residues. 
 In its place, the Administration would impose a tough uniform health standard on all foods that allows almost no room to consider the economic benefits of using pesticides. This new standard would be weaker in screening carcinogens from processed foods but stronger in screening them from fresh foods and stronger in curbing pesticides that cause illnesses other than cancer. The net result should be a gain in safety.
Even so, many environmentalists are vehemently opposed to scrapping the Delaney Clause, with its stipulation that no substance shown to cause cancer in humans or animals can be added to processed foods. With respect to pesticides, that provision means no cancer-causing residues can concentrate in processed foods at levels above those allowed on fresh foods.
Delaney's absolutist approach is undeniably appealing. Cancer is a scary disease, and no one is eager to deliberately add carcinogens to the diet. But the Delaney Clause does not really keep all carcinogens out of processed foods. If a carcinogenic residue is allowed on tomatoes, for example, the same level of residue can remain in tomato paste or tomato soup. Only if the residue concentrates at a higher level is the pesticide likely to be banned or curtailed.
That can lead to absurd situations in which a new, safer pesticide is rejected simply because it concentrates somewhat during processing, while an old, more dangerous pesticide, apt to cause more cancer deaths, is retained.
In practice, the Delaney Clause has only intermittently been invoked against pesticides. But a pivotal court decision now requires the Government to enforce it more vigorously, or change the law. The Administration's proposed compromise -- replacement of Delaney with a tough uniform health standard -- mirrors the approach suggested by the National Academy of Sciences and Democratic health leaders in Congress. Both Senator Edward Kennedy and Representative Henry Waxman, leaders of key health committees and known as advocates for public health, have sought a similar compromise for years.
The new Administration proposal would allow carcinogenic residues that pose no more than a negligible risk, defined as a one-in-a-million chance of causing cancer over a lifetime of use. That is not zero, but it is a very tough standard -- far tougher than could be met by some existing pesticides, which can pose risks as high as one in 10,000 of developing cancer.
The Administration also proposes other strong measures: extra protections for children and infants; strict deadlines to comply with the new standards; stronger Government powers to remove suspect pesticides from the market, and a new Federal campaign to reduce pesticide use and switch to other forms of pest control.
Critics in the food and agricultural industries, though delighted to see Delaney go, oppose expansion of the Government's enforcement powers and elimination of any consideration of pesticide benefits. But if the zero-risk approach of the Delaney Clause is to be abandoned, it is only right to stiffen pesticide regulation across the board.

HEADLINE: Foreign Policy, Left Unclear

 BODY:
What is the Clinton Administration really trying to tell the American people about its foreign policy intentions?
First, a series of high-profile speeches dutifully affirms the importance of continued U.S. leadership and international engagement. Then a series of real-world policy decisions signals an unmistakable scaling back of Washington's commitments to participate in actual international peacekeeping operations, starting with Somalia and Bosnia. 
 Is there any relation between theory and practice? Probably. But to tease it out, the ideas in the speeches need to be decoded from the maddeningly abstract and elliptical language favored by foreign policy specialists. Only then can they be brought into the realm of democratic political debate.
Bill Clinton is no isolationist. But he wants his Presidency to be known for domestic achievements like health care reform and economic revival. So he has tried to avoid distracting foreign policy arguments by leaving the talking to key aides, stressing the rhetoric of continuity and, where possible, quickly changing the subject.
Trouble is, events haven't cooperated. Mr. Clinton has had to deal with real international crises, and has performed reasonably well. But mumbling the old verities of international engagement just sounds silly in a world radically transformed by the end of superpower confrontation.
The Administration now proclaims that America's global responsibilities are as compelling as ever even though the goal has shifted from containing Communism to enlarging the domain of democracy and markets. But that glides past today's most interesting challenges. At last, America's role in the world can be driven by choices instead of threats -- choices about where and where not to intervene, and by what means.
When should America resort to military force, and when should it limit itself to diplomatic and economic pressures? To what extent should it accept the constraints of U.N. or NATO joint decision-making and under what conditions should it act unilaterally? And how can foreign aid programs and trade liberalization strategies be made more compatible with foreign policy?
The Administration's speechmakers stabbed at sorting out these choices, but then seemed to give up, leaving too many agenda items on its crowded plate. And where they most needed to invite public debate, they called for reining it in.
"All of us who support engagement," proclaimed Anthony Lake, the President's national security adviser, "should be careful to debate tactics in a way that does not prevent us from coming together in common cause around that fundamental importance of the goal of American engagement and American leadership in the world."
Yet Americans are entitled to clear explanations whenever they are called upon to risk their lives and spend their treasure far from home -- especially at a time when foreign crises are less obviously threatening to America's security. The Administration's best hope of maintaining a consensus for engagement lies in demonstrating to Americans that the specific elements of its foreign policy bear directly on their lives and livelihoods. Failure to do so produced the public backlash against overambitious military goals in Somalia and Bosnia that Mr. Clinton was reacting to last week. In a different way, the same failure is reflected in exaggerated public fears over the pending North American Free Trade Agreement.
Mr. Clinton may yet discover that he can build a stronger mandate for domestic change not by dissembling on foreign policy but by facing up to the challenges of a new era and making clear his own choices.

HEADLINE: Trade Agreement Means Fat Cats Get Fatter

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Caterpillar Sees Free-Trade Boon" (Business Day, Sept. 21) shows a disturbing class conflict arising in the United States over the North American Free Trade Agreement. It is between the organized money class and the disorganized masses. Working class, middle class, manufacturing and clerical workers, even white-collar professionals like schoolteachers, lower management people and engineers, all have a nagging fear that the treaty will further redistribute income and jobs from them to the executives of large corporations, Wall Street bankers and brokers, corporate lawyers and politicians. 
 Caterpillar's executives are hoping the treaty will eventually add $45 million a year to the company's export sales to Mexico. But even this optimistic estimate amounts to a mere 4 percent increase in Caterpillar's sales and production. This is hardly enough for it to add new jobs, but large enough to add about $20 million to annual profits. Caterpillar's increased profits will most likely be attained by an immediate migration of at least 1,000 apparel-making and electronics assembly jobs from the United States to Mexico.
Like those 300 economists who endorsed the trade agreement and chief executives of large corporations and their lobbyists, the loudest endorsers are touting a brighter future prospect for the United States macroeconomy. But real people are saying that they cannot live on a fattened macroeconomic pie eaten by the organized money class. Long gone are the days when improved macroeconomic indexes like gross domestic product, the balance of payments and the Dow Jones stock price index also meant improved job and earning prospects for the working classes to middle classes of the United States.
Ironically, President Bill Clinton is asking Lee Iaccoca, a retired chairman of Chrysler, to sell the trade treaty to ordinary Americans. To ordinary Americans, Mr. Iaccoca has epitomized the cynical and self-serving executives who would heartlessly discharge their rank-and-file employees and help themselves to obscenely large salaries and bonuses.
President George Bush took Mr. Iaccoca on his politically disastrous trip to Japan in January 1992. Japanese and Americans both found it repugnant for the President to let Mr. Iaccoca demand that the Japanese give "jobs, jobs and more jobs" to the United States. Particularly to the bemused Japanese, Mr. Iaccoca and his traveling executives represented what was wrong with the United States economy.
Instead of spending his meager political capital on the trade agreement, President Clinton had best salvage the Uruguay Round Agreement to revive the multilateral and freer trading system of the world, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The United States, Canada and Mexico would benefit more from the revived and expanded GATT than from the trade agreement, which will divert a limited amount of trade from the United States and Asia to Mexico, at the expense of American jobs.
Japan's new Hosokawa Administration is even ready to open the rice market and work with the United States to persuade France to back reviving GATT before it expires Dec. 15. For the United States and the world, trading the treaty for GATT is a bad deal indeed.

HEADLINE: Trade Agreement Means Fat Cats Get Fatter;
The March of the Jobs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
One problem with the analysis of the North American Free Trade Agreement by the academic community is summed up in a revealing phrase by Prof. Paul Krugman, "on the average" (front page, Sept. 17). Like the river whose average depth is one foot, there are some very deep areas that cannot be easily crossed. 
 Thus, economists speak of tariffs "averaging 4 percent." But some tariffs, like those on apparel, are much higher. They have been kept high because of the product's high labor intensity and resulting sensitivity to competition from low-wage imports.
While there will be winner and loser industries in a deal like this, that does not mean employment will average out. A victory in machine tools helps an industry whose employment is reported by the Commerce Department as less than 40,000. But a loss in apparel jeopardizes the jobs of nearly 1 million.
Even economists seem to agree that the industries at greatest risk are those with the highest labor intensity. They, and the President, talk about new hi-tech jobs, but there are fewer of these than of more basic jobs, which we must assume will persist for years. Even our high-tech industries are shrinking -- computers, aerospace and defense. The idea that Mexico will be the market to create "better" jobs for Americans is ludicrous. When and with what will Mexico's struggling campesinos begin buying computers and jet planes?
Just as textiles and other manufacturing moved out of the Northeast to the South for cheaper labor, the trade agreement will force the same march on other manufacturing industries wherever they are in the United States.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER;
Protection Plans Are Eroding

BYLINE: By BETSY WADE

 BODY:
THERE is a shrinking safety net under travelers who make payments to companies that later collapse. Two major organizations in the travel industry are cutting back on consumer protection plans and a third is looking for alternatives.
Here are the recent developments: 
 * Because of hefty claims, the Chubb insurance company would not renew the $5 million consumer protection plan it underwrote for three years for the United States Tour Operators Association, whose 30-odd member operators handle more than half of the tours sold in the United States. The plan, which could cover $5 million in losses in a year among the group's members, ceased Sept. 1. A modified plan protects $1 million in deposits for each company. However, that amount may not be enough: When Olsen Travelworld failed last year, the association had to make good on $1.7 million in payments for tours. Under the modified plan, those customers would have received only 60 cents on the dollar.
* The American Society of Travel Agents' leadership decided late last year that its $250,000 fund was not big enough to insure deposits paid by customers and agents to participating tour operator members. Unable to get support for premiums to provide a $1 million or $2 million fund, this group agreed early this year to terminate its plan in December.
* The National Tour Association, a large group of operators of mainly bus tours, will raise dues in 1994 to $600 a year from $400, to cover its $100,000 consumer protection program. The leadership is consideringalternative plans for 1995 lest insurance costs limit the organization's ability to serve its members.
These changes do not mean that the insurance plans were badly set up; they were battered by a deteriorating economy and tight profit margins in the travel industry. The changes also result from a decision by some big, solid companies to discontinue paying premiums into a pool fund that might permit weaker members to close their doors, or possibly take the money and run, leaving the pool to cover refunds.
 
Stranded Passengers
 Such anxieties are not unfounded. Travel industry experts estimate that 30 major tour operators have failed in the last five or six years, some, like Hemphill-Harris of California, which abruptly stopped operating in 1989, stranding passengers in exotic places. Other failures in the period include Asti, Flyfaire, Lindblad and Caribbean Holidays.
The plan maintained by the National Tour Association, which has a core membership of 575 bus-tour companies that operate in the United States, Canada and Mexico, has paid out $700,000 in the bankruptcies of 18 members since it began in 1988. At the most recent quarterly meeting, 68 percent of the membership wanted to continue the program, which is financed out of dues.
"Our plan is not going to go away," said the association's president, Dottie Maitland of Maitland Travel Service in Kalispell, Mont. "We are not going to bag it; it separates us from the hobbyists in travel, and we want the public to be protected. But we don't know how much more of a hit we can go on taking. We need to find a more cost-effective method."
The biggest fund, the United States Tour Operators', which was raised to the $5 million level in 1990, has paid out more than $7.5 million since then, including the $1.7 million on Olsen; the other failures among U.S.T.O.A. members were First Family of Travel-Hawaii, Four Winds and K.L.R. Members of this organization, now a total of 33, are estimated to serve 55 to 60 percent of people buying package tours in the United States.
Sadly, the net effect is that the pat advice, "be sure your operator belongs to an established national association," is not going to be a talisman against all evils. A logo on a brochure is not insurance.
The new plan of the United States Tour Operators Association requires members to give the association a $1 million bond, letter of credit or certificate of deposit. Robert Whitley, the president, said that this security would be used to refund payments for tours in the event of bankruptcy, cessation of operations or nonpayment of refunds within 120 days.
 
3 Operators Resign
 Three of this organization's members resigned at the changeover: Allied Tours, which arranges travel for overseas visitors to the United States; Domenico Tours of Bayonne, N.J., and Maupintour of Lawrence, Kan.
Three other members no longer qualify under the bylaws, according to Mr. Whitley. Supercities of Minneapolis, and General Tours, formerly linked to Olsen and Cartan in the First Family group, have new owners and new management, and the bylaws require three years' continuous ownership or management, or both. The third, Travellers International, changed the name of its tour program and is also disqualified.
Mr. Whitley cautioned that since brochures were usually printed once a year, the six operators' material might still show coverage by the protection plan. U.S.T.O.A., which was founded in 1972, will answer questions about membership at (212) 944-5727.
Thomas Di Domenico, executive vice president of Domenico Tours, a 30-year-old organization, said his company left because it had assets in the tens of millions, including 70 buses, that would protect customers. "We can stand on our own," he said. "It is not within our thinking that an association can police the standards of the industry. We hoped that the $5 million plan would work. We were committed to the U.S.T.O.A. plan as a wonderful vehicle for consumer confidence. But no insurer would cover."
Now, with protection for $1 million per company, he said, "the integrity of the program is gone if someone goes out holding more than $1 million."
Don Johnston, president of Maupintour, which was founded in 1951 and was a pioneer member, said that U.S.T.O.A. "is supposed to be a marketing organization, but it's spent all its time with the consumer protection program. We've been looking out for our customers for 42 years and we are weary of putting up more and more money. It's driving up the costs."
The American Society of Travel Agents' program for tour operator members, designed to protect its primary members, travel agents, and their clients, began to lose participants as the cost climbed. It had only 23 members by early 1993. When the group's executives concluded that the coverage would pay only pennies on the dollar in the event of a big failure, the members would not support a larger fund. The group then set up a voluntary escrow plan through the First of America Bank in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., which holds tour payments until the trip takes place. So far, five operators have joined: Future Tours of Boca Raton, Fla.; Bahamas Vacations of Allentown, Pa.; Cartours-Prima Holidays of Los Angeles; Goway Travel of Toronto, and Places to Go of Coral Springs, Fla.
There is little comfort in all this for consumers, who must check the stability and track record of the companies from which they are buying tours. Any assertion that deposits are being held in an escrow account should be checked with the bank. Note that if you buy travel insurance that covers for operator failure, you should not buy it from the operator. The insurance will be invalid if the operator fails.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 17, 1993, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
The Practical Traveler column on Oct. 3, about protection for consumers against tour operators who go out of business, referred incompletely to a company that failed last year, and misspelled its name. The company was Olson-Travelworld; its name was purchased in January by John M. Noel, president and chief executive of the Travel Guard Internationale insurance company. The new Olson-Travelworld is functioning as a tour operator.

HEADLINE: Stamp Collection Sold for Record $9.5 Million

BYLINE: By BARTH HEALEY

 BODY:
What was widely regarded as the premier collection of classic 19th-century American stamps has been broken up and sold for $9.5 million by a Japanese businessman. Christie's, the New York auction house that conducted the sale, said it was the highest single sale for such a collection.
Before the sale, which took place on Tuesday and Wednesday, Christie's had valued the collection at $9 million to $12 million. 
 The highlight of the 746 lots was an envelope that was mailed in May 1851 from Montreal to England by way of New York, and that has one Canadian stamp, to pay postage to New York, and five United States stamps, to pay postage to England. The price was $717,500, which Christie's said was a record for any such piece of United States postal history. It was bought by an Italian collector whom the auction house would not identify.
The collection, which covered all postage stamps issued in the United States from 1847 to 1869, had been built up over the last two decades by Ryohei Ishikawa. He is chairman of the Chubu Bank and of the Teisan Group, which has interests in transportation, finance and real estate.
Despite the prices, Mr. Ishikawa probably lost money on the sale because when he was building the collection, he was paying 150 yen or more for every dollar he invested. But the dollar has weakened over the past decade, and each dollar he earned from the sale is now worth about 105 yen.
Ben Schafer of Denver, who described himself as Mr. Ishikawa's North American lawyer, accepted this arithmetic. But in an interview in the auction room on Wednesday, he said that Mr. Ishikawa was not really an investor, adding, "He also got a lot of real pleasure from his stamps."
The banker had shown parts of his collection at stamp conventions over the years and had won several gold medals.
The most notable trend during the sale was a renewed interest in stamps rather than artifacts of postal history, like envelopes that bear markings showing how the mail was carried. In the late 1970's and early 1980's, a speculative boom in stamp prices drove many stamp collectors to postal history, where making a smart purchase depends far more on research than on the mere appearance of an item.
Colin Fraser, head of Christie's stamp department, said he was impressed by the large number of bidders.
Michael Laurence, editor of Linn's Stamp News, a weekly, said, "This sale shows that the hobby is basically healthy, and that people will pay for nice-looking stamps."
The big prices went to a few famous pieces of postal history and a few error stamps, two-color issues from 1869 whose centers had been printed upside down. But more modest items, typically sound, fresh-looking single stamps, sold in some cases for many times more than their pre-sale estimates. An 1869 3-cent stamp, for example, with an interesting cancellation reading "O-K," was estimated at $30 to $50; it sold for $241.50.
Most fancy stuff still brought fancy prices: a 24-cent error stamp of 1869, whose center is inverted, was estimated at $80,000 to $100,000; it sold for $228,000, the second-highest price ever paid for a United States stamp. In 1986, at the peak of a speculative surge, a 1-cent stamp printed in 1867 on special paper brought $418,000.

HEADLINE: Little-Noted Advantages Of Alternate-Side Parking

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 I was interested in your article on automobiles. As a disabled New Yorker, I am "automobile dependent." 
Because the city provides no designated spaces for drivers with Special Vehicle Identification permits, we are permitted to park on the "wrong" side of the street, and to use meters indefinitely.
 If the city is decreasing alternate-side parking to four days, and eliminating penalties for abusing meters, then perhaps it is time for the city to designate parking spaces in every area for drivers with disabilities.

Story of My Life? Glad You Asked.

BYLINE: By ANITA GATES

 BODY:
EVERY FALL THEY TURN UP: new television characters with new families, workplaces or both, hoping viewers will learn to love them. But when networks may only give a show six episodes to live or die, viewers had better get acquainted fast. Maybe that's why, when it comes to exposition, some stars are saying it all in one speech. Here's how six new sitcoms handled things. ANITA GATES "The Boys" (CBS)
 Setting: A book signing. A customer asks a writer, Doug Kirkfield (Chris Meloni), when his next book is coming out. 
Speech: "Soon. We just bought this big old house in Washington State, and we're going to get away from the hustle and bustle and crime and pollution of New York and settle down in a sleepy little town where there's nothing for me to do but write."
 Reaction: The customer says, "I just asked you when it's coming out."
 
"Cafe Americain" (NBC)
 Setting: The first-class cabin of a trans-Atlantic flight. Holly Aldridge (Valerie Bertinelli) is seated next to a French model in a micro-mini, who asks, "And you are?"
 Speech: "Moving to Paris. Which is what I wish I'd done when I was 20, instead of marrying that jerk of an ex-husband who my sister tried to warn me about. She said, 'He is not right for you.' But I just had to prove her wrong."
 Reaction: "Is fantastic to know this," the model says. "I was asking your name."
 
"Family Album" (CBS)
 Setting: A contentious, multi-generational family dinner at the Lerners' new home. Jonathan Lerner (Peter Scolari) suddenly stands and angrily addresses his parents and his wife's mother.
 Speech: "Enough! Now look, we moved back here because we love you. We love your company, and we love your brisket, which you will never bring again. Until we ask you to. Now you have every right to make us as crazy as you want to. That's your job. But when it comes to our kids, just back off!"
 Reaction: From his mother-in-law: "Screw 'em up any way you want to."
 
"Frasier" (NBC)
 Setting: A call-in radio show. Dr. Frasier Crane (Kelsey Grammer) is on the air.
 Speech: "Hello, Russell. . . . Let me see if I can cut to the chase by using myself as an example. Six months ago I was living in Boston. My wife had left me, which was very painful. Then she came back to me, which was excruciating.
 "You see, I thought I could forgive her indiscretion, but I was only kidding myself. On top of that, my practice had grown stagnant. And my social life consisted of hanging around a bar night after night. You see, I was clinging to a life that wasn't working anymore. And I knew I had to do something, anything. So I ended the marriage once and for all, packed up my things and moved back here to my hometown of Seattle. Go, Seahawks!
 "I took action, Russell. And you can, too!" Reaction: A colleague informs Dr. Crane, "We cut to the news 30 seconds ago."
 
"Grace Under Fire" (ABC)
 Setting: A highway. Grace Kelly's (Brett Butler's) car has been pulled over by a highway patrolman (John Goodman).
 Speech: "I can't afford a ticket. I can barely afford this balloon. Do you have any idea what my life is like? . . . I'm going to tell you. You see those kids in there? I'm raising them by myself. No child support. No alimony. And you know what? It's hard. It's damn hard. Nobody gives you a medal at the end of a day. . . . Nobody comes up and pats you on the back and says, 'Way to go, Mom.' . . ."
 Reaction: The policeman speaks into his radio: "21 bravo. I may need backup here."
 
"The John Larroquette Show" (NBC)
 Setting: An Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. John Hemingway (John Larroquette) is at the podium.
 Speech: "I'm standing here tonight with good news. If I can still trust my ability to count, I have been sober well over five and a half days. You know what? And I've discovered some things that I didn't know when I was drunk. For instance, I'm in St. Louis. How the hell did I get here? I've discovered a few other things too. I was astounded to find out that a majority of people are offended by nudity in church. I discovered that wives get very upset when they're lied to for over a decade. And trying to kiss a dog on the lips can also have legal ramifications.
 "But seriously, folks, tonight I start a new job. As station manager of the Crossroads Bus Terminal. And I really, really, really have to make it work this time. I got the job because I have a master's degree in English literature, which is essential for working in a bus station. Did I mention I was the only one who applied?
 "Tonight may be the most important night of my life. And all I have to do is get through it without taking a drink."
 Reaction: The scene changes to the bus station, where a bum asks Mr. Hemingway, "Want a drink?"

HEADLINE: Debunking the Myths About Public Schools

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 As a public-school teacher and a parent of two children attending public school -- all of us in District 2 in Manhattan -- I wholeheartedly support the main idea of Eric Rothenberg's article on his daughter's switch from private to public school: "I can't help but wonder what might be accomplished citywide if those of us who have been running away from the public schools stopped running" ("When a Product of the Private Schools Goes Public," Sept. 19). 
If today's parents would research the public-school choices, many of the negative myths and horror stories would quickly dissipate. District 2, for example, has a diversity of wonderful programs run by talented and innovative administrators and teachers and supported by involved parents.
 My oldest child will be graduating from P.S. 6 in June. When I was recently asked by another New York City parent which junior high school we were considering for next year, I was both amused and appalled by this parent's contemptuous attitude when I said, "Probably Wagner," meaning Junior High School 167. I wish I had asked this parent if she had ever set foot in this school, let alone spoken with one of its teachers or students.
 We all need to replace our fear and ignorance with responsibility and knowledge.

HEADLINE: Luxury-Tax Repeal Encourages Sellers

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
LAST month, Thomas G. Caruso, owner of Total Marine Ltd. in Mamaroneck, sold a 37-foot Phoenix convertible sports fishing boat for $400,000. "It's a beauty," he said. "Sleeps six. Has everything, including air-conditioning, a microwave and two big diesel engines."
Mr. Caruso added that negotiations for the sale had begun earlier in anticipation of the repeal of the 10 percent excise or luxury tax on boats costing more than $110,000 and on other expensive items like jewelry and furs, but not on automobiles. "The customer told me he would have never bought the boat if he had had to pay the luxury tax, which would have added $30,000 more to the purchase price," Mr. Caruso said. 
 The 10 percent excise tax on expensive boats was imposed three years ago as a way to generate new revenue from the rich. The tax, say those in the boating industry, began having an immediate impact on sales as buyers adopted a wait-and-see attitude.
After waging a two-year battle that eventually led to the Congressional repeal of the tax in August, the boating industry now expects the repeal to have an immediate impact on sales, production and work-force levels, said Jeff W. Napier, president of the National Marine Manufacturer's Association, the principal trade group of the recreational marine industry.
 
Recouping Losses; Not a Victory
 Mr. Caruso said: "It will certainly help our industry, where activity doesn't start in the factory but on the showroom floor. Sales of boats at the retail level give manufacturers the incentive to produce. Our sales are starting to pick up a bit. And despite the recession we were not hurt too badly overall this year. Luckily, we are in an affluent area so the revenues we didn't generate in sales we were able to pretty much make up in service. And our marina was 100 percent occupied, so this season turned out to be a pretty good one for us."
But, Mr. Napier said, manufacturers don't view repeal so much as a victory as a chance to return to where they were before enactment of the tax.
"It's hard to be elated when our own government activity created a loss of 30,000 American jobs and destroyed dozens of companies in the process," Mr. Napier said. "And the revenues weren't there. For every dollar that was collected on the luxury tax, we estimated the Federal Government paid out $5 for each dollar collected in unemployment benefits and other costs caused by layoffs. Then, too, a contracting economy brought sales that were subject to the tax to a virtual standstill, causing unemployment, plant closings and foreclosures in the marine industry."
In addition, he said, big-boat sales were down from peak levels in 1988 to a historic low.
Edward Tomanek, manager of the Nichols Yacht Yard in Mamaroneck, said: "The tax certainly hurt the industry, no doubt about it. But we phased out our sales department sometime before the tax was enacted so it didn't affect us directly. Our revenues come from our marina. We have 170 slips and our service department."
 
Major Recovery Expected
 At Shongut Marine in Rye, the manager, Thomas Consolazio, said that although he knew the tax had had a severe impact on the marine industry, causing unemployment and hardship, his company was not adversely affected.
"One major reason is that we don't carry those very expensive boats," Mr. Consolazio said. "Our top price is $70,000, with the average boat we sell costing about $26,000. In fact, we had a good year. Our sales of new and used boats were up 12 to 13 percent, the highest it has been since the early 80's, and the service department was extremely busy."
Mr. Napier said the industry's feeling is that boat sales and jobs will now make a significant recovery.
"We think the pent-up demand from customers who refused to pay the tax will help the boat builders re-employ 5,000 workers within six months," Mr. Napier said. He also observed that renewed boat sales would help American manufacturers regain their competitive position in world markets.
 
Middle Class Also Affected
 People who earn their living in the jewelry and fur industries are also encouraged by the repeal of the luxury tax, which hurts their businesses, too. Barbara Greenberg, manager of H. L. Gross and Brothers, a jewelry store in the Galleria in White Plains, is also the immediate past president of the New York State Jewelry Association, a trade group.
"The association and I worked hard for two years to get that ill-conceived tax repealed," Mrs. Greenberg said. "It was extremely detrimental to us. Even before the tax was enacted, the jewelry industry was hit hard by the recession. Business has not been good across the board, and the tax certainly hurt us when we needed help the most."
The tax, aimed at the wealthy, actually hurt the middle class, Mrs. Greenberg said.
"We had to collect 10 percent luxury tax on all items that carried a price tag of more than $10,000," she said. "This actually affected middle-class customers, those who had saved up, for instance, to buy an engagement ring or an expensive watch for a once-in-a-lifetime occasion. They were the ones who hesitated and did not buy because the 10 percent tax on top of the sales tax just put them too far over the edge."
Although Mrs. Greenberg said that she was delighted to see the tax repealed and that she hoped sales during the coming holiday season will show an improvement, she said the paperwork required for refunds of the tax, retroactive to Jan. 1 this year, is formidable.
 
Impact Hard to Trace
 "We will have to contact every customer who paid the tax over the past two years and refund the money to them. Only then will we be reimbursed in turn, by the Government, and you can imagine how long that will take."
Danny Fusco, a furrier who has a business in Mamaroneck, said that the impact of the tax on his business could not be accurately defined.
"I really didn't directly feel the effect, but on the other hand I don't know how much it hurt me," Mr. Fusco said, adding that he will never know how much the tax cost him in lost sales and potential business.
"The tax was mainly applicable to sable coats, Russian lynx and Russian broad-tail coats that are in the $18,000 to $44,000 range," Mr. Fusco said. "We don't normally sell quantities of those coats. Minks are a staple, and most of those were priced so they weren't affected by the luxury tax."

BYLINE: By RICHARD B. WOODWARD

 BODY:
RUDOLPH GREY has the wary, unshaven face of a New Yorker who finds sunlight irritating. Even in the dimness of his apartment, a second-floor walk-up in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood in New York, he squints. His hipster threads -- olive jacket with thin collar turned up, white shirt with big cufflinks, black jeans -- are nicely wrinkled. He chain-smokes thin brown Sherman MCD cigarettes, the ashes from which have, over time, formed a kind of fossil layer on his thousands of LP's and 45's.
Most of his adult life ("just say I'm in my late 30's," he insists) Mr. Grey has existed on the tattered fringe of New York's art and music scene. Since 1972, he has been known professionally and to his friends as Rudolph Grey, a persona chosen because "Rudolph is colorful and Grey is sort of neutral," he says. He won't give his real name. 
 Born in Brooklyn and trained as a painter at the School of Art and Design and the Institute of Technology in Manhattan, he has played guitar in small clubs, often with just a drummer, for about 15 years. His remarkably loud style, made from abstract slabs of noise laced with squealing feedback, can be heard on independent labels like New Alliance and Ecstatic Peace. But his following has never been large or devoted. "I don't want to talk about my music career," he snaps. "It confuses people."
The confusion rests, if only in his mind, on the fact that now Mr. Grey is better-known as an author. "Nightmare of Ecstasy," his oral biography of Edward Wood Jr., B-movie director and renowned transvestite, was published last year to outstanding reviews. ("Delirious and horrifying -- and All True!" Richard Corliss wrote in Time magazine.)
The production company for the director Tim Burton, who made "Batman Returns" and the new, animated "Nightmare Before Christmas," paid a reported $250,000 for the film rights. Now shooting in Los Angeles, it has become an $18 million black-and-white feature for Walt Disney's Touchstone Pictures, starring Johnny Depp, Patricia Arquette, Martin Landau, Sarah Jessica Parker, Lisa Marie Smith and Bill Murray.
Mr. Wood, for those who missed this summer's retrospective at the Film Forum, an alternative theater in SoHo, wrote and directed several of the most peculiar films to come out of Hollywood. Produced on trifling budgets that wouldn't pay the Perrier bill for a feature film today, Mr. Wood's efforts veer between bold, cut-rate experimentation and pure lunacy. Some, like "Plan 9 from Outer Space" and "Bride of the Monster," have become kitsch classics for their gimcrack props and plots.
Fascination with Mr. Wood has burgeoned as researchers like Mr. Grey have fleshed out the sad absurdities of his life. According to Mr. Grey's book, Mr. Wood was a none-too-secret cross-dresser. A decorated Marine in World War II, he is known to have worn a pink bra and panties beneath his fatigues during the invasion of Tarawa. As a director, he borrowed or stole wardrobe items from his actresses, especially anything soft and fuzzy, like angora socks or sweaters. And he often pounded out scripts or novels on a typewriter at the kitchen table while costumed in a wig, makeup, a skirt and high heels.
In Mr. Grey's book, the director John Waters sums up Mr. Wood as "brave, eccentric and sometimes insane."
"I knew from the very beginning," Mr. Grey says, "that this was an incredible story, the kind that a writer would invent -- if he could. Someone who was out there, all alone, writing these novels that nobody read or reviewed -- I mean nobody -- and making movies that no one ever saw. I knew they would be making million-dollar movies about him some day. I knew it."
Mr. Burton clearly shares an affection for Mr. Wood's work and an empathy for his travails. "There is something beautiful about somebody doing what they love to do, no matter how misguided, and remaining optimistic and upbeat against all odds," he says by fax from Los Angeles.
Mr. Grey, who has been hired as a consultant for Mr. Wood's film, grouses that his services have not yet been enlisted. "Ask Tim Burton why he hasn't called me," he says. Mr. Grey's recent, happy spin of the wheel of fortune seems only to have increased his apprehensions.
"Don't blow it for me," he warns as I sit down on the fake-fur sofa in his living room. It's two days before he is supposed to receive his money (he won't say how much) and he fears a last-minute snag. "These studios, you never know what they'll do," he says.
Mr. Grey has had no previous relationship with large sums of money. Getting by as a paste-up artist for publishers because his music jobs never covered the rent, he hasn't earned enough to pay taxes in 10 years, he says. His book proposal was turned down by 12 houses.
The book might not have found a home at all had a friend, the writer Jimmy McDonough, not told him to contact Adam Parfrey, editor and publisher of Feral House in Los Angeles. The renegade purveyor of underground classics like "Apocalypse Culture," an anthology of articles on various cults and conspiracies, Mr. Parfrey quickly signed the project.
"Adam was an Ed Wood fan," Mr. Grey says. "And he was hip enough to know this was important." Enthusiasm seems to have compensated for advance money. Mr. Grey received $1,000 to embark on the book.
As a teen-ager, Mr. Grey watched Mr. Wood's low-budget shockers with amazement on Channel 11's "Chiller Theater." After dozens of viewings, he still finds "Plan 9 from Outer Space" to be "perfectly charming, like a pulp supernatural fairy tale."
But not until December 1978 ("the fateful month," as he puts it in the introduction to his book), during a midnight screening at the old Thalia theater on the Upper West Side, did Mr. Grey experience the "revelation" that led to more than a decade of obsessive labor. The epiphany was "Glen or Glenda," Mr. Wood's most notorious and personal film. Violating most of the rules of cinema, this thinly disguised autobiography includes, among many jarring elements, clinical accounts of transvestism, Bela Lugosi reciting demented nursery rhymes and a confused young man who must tell his fiancee a dark secret -- and it isn't that he's been seeing another woman.
A MONG the many B-movie directors whose work ran on the bottom halves of twin bills during the 1950's and 60's, Mr. Wood has been singled out by some critics for special scorn. He was once voted the Worst Director of All Time by Harry and Michael Medved, creators of the Golden Turkey Awards. Videos of his films are marketed with campy warning labels that read: "Do not watch this film. It is so bad you may not be able to stand it."
The topic of Mr. Wood's supposed incompetence taps a hot gusher of emotion in Mr. Grey. "It's continually 'Ed Wood, Worst Film Maker,' " he said. "I don't see how these so-called critics can justify it. If he was such a bad film maker, why would anyone put his films out on video, right? The worst directors make some TV movie that no one ever thinks about. Movies that are insipid, bland, stupid, boring. That's the worst director."
"Anyone who does something really different in this country, the Bozo element of the press will attack him," he continues. "It's easy to make fun of low-budget movies. But Ed Wood grew up on the pulp movies of the 30's and the 40's. The Monogram films like 'The Apeman,' 'The Corpse Vanishes,' 'Bowery at Midnight,' which the French picked up on. And radio shows like 'I Love a Mystery' or 'Chandu the Magician.' His movies evolve perfectly out of that."
Mr. Grey spent more than 10 years researching and writing his book. To finance his many trips to Los Angeles, he sold off his huge collection of horror- and science-fiction-movie posters. Of the more than 600 he once owned, 40 are left. Prime examples, from "Attack of the 50-Ft. Woman," "Jail Bait" and "Bride of the Monster," still adorn his walls.
"In the early 70's, you could get them for about 50 cents," he says. "By the early 80's, they were worth $300 or $400 each. That paid for a lot of my research. And I borrowed money, of course."
He economized every way he knew. Unless he could find a ride from friends in Los Angeles, Mr. Grey took public transportation to interviews.
Mr. Grey managed to round up an enormous cast of Mr. Wood's cronies, including his mother and his widow. With help from actors and distributors, he has reconstructed the making of and atmosphere around each of the films, many shot in three or four days for $5,000. He has also read every Wood novel he could find. There may have been as many as 75 paperbacks, written under various pseudonyms for the pornography market, with titles like "The Sexecutives," "Side-Show Siren," "To Make a Homo" and "Death of a Transvestite Hooker."
Mr. Wood died in 1978 at 54, before anyone thought he might one day be infamous. "There was never an interview with Ed Wood on Ed Wood," Mr. Grey says, shaking his head. "No one took him seriously. Every time anyone interviewed him it was about Bela Lugosi. Ed Wood was the rotten mushroom at the bottom of the hill, as far as most people were concerned."
As described in the book, Mr. Wood's last years were wretched. Destitute and a drunk, he fought often and loudly with his wife. The police made regular calls to his apartment in a crime-ridden complex in Hollywood. The couple and their few possessions were finally tossed out on the street. Mr. Wood died of a heart attack three days later.
From Mr. Grey's apartment, one can look out on a theater complex where Mr. Burton's film could open next year; Mr. Wood's movies would have been lucky to play for a week in a few grind houses. The disparity troubles Mr. Grey.
"Here you have this director whom no one respected at all when he was alive, and now he's a legend in death," he says with agitation. "Don't think I'm not aware of the ironies in that. I'm not about to let that slip by. They're making an $18 million movie about him, which may be low-budget these days. But for $18 million, Ed Wood could have made about 300 movies."
Like Mr. Grey, Mr. Burton grew up watching Mr. Wood's movies on television. "Like everyone else, I remember thinking, 'Wow, what is this," he says. "But then I began to realize that even though they are bad, they are good. He didn't let technicalities like visible wires and bad sets distract him from his storytelling. There's a twisted form of integrity in that."
Mr. Grey's years of poorly paid research show a similar integrity, with a happy ending. But as self-righteous as his crusade may sound, it hasn't made him smug. Enchanted by anything Woodian, he has adapted one of the novels, "Killer in Drag," for a 10-minute film, using actors from Charles Ludlam's Ridiculous Theatrical Company. It has never had a public showing; nor has his 55-minute video "Whip Me Daddy." Sensing a publicity opportunity, Mr. Grey plugs an original screenplay, co-written with the critic Cole Gagne, "Dracula vs. Hitler."
"It's definitely a first-rate script," he says, outlining a plot wherein the Nazis take a supernatural book from the library in Dracula's castle to learn the secrets of ultimate power. The script concludes with an epic battle between the two evil protagonists of the title. "Dracula does actually fight Hitler," Grey promises. "We do deliver."
Mr. Grey will no doubt have to pay taxes this year on his windfall, although he seems not yet to comprehend his new financial standing. At lunch at a local Chinese restaurant, he asks for investment advice. "People tell me I should buy real estate," he says. "What do you think?" He would like to put some money away and use the rest to make movies.
As he sweats out the last days before his money arrives, he allows himself a few moments to relax and forget his fears of a snafu. The bill arrives and he looks on with puzzled admiration. "I've got to get one of those American Express green cards now," he says, nodding. "That's what my tax accountant told me."
He leans over the table, exhales some brown smoke toward the ceiling, and letting slip a rare smile, says, "I'm moving up in the world."

A Free-Spirited Survivor Lands on Her Feet

BYLINE: By JAMES GAVIN; James Gavin is the author of "Intimate Nights: The Golden Age of New York Cabaret."

 BODY:
For Annie Ross, living on the edge has become a fine art. In 1958, this cool-yet-sultry redhead earned a place in jazz vocal history when she became the female third of Lambert, Hendricks and Ross, the trio famous for setting bullet-fire lyrics to jazz instrumentals. Ms. Ross's octave-leaping, sweet-and-sour voice intrigued Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie and other musicians who had little time for female singers. So did her capacity for partying -- until drugs nearly ended the fun permanently.
But her instinct for self-destruction was exceeded by a knack for survival. After beating heroin addiction, bankruptcy and chronic unemployment, the 63-year-old singer and actress has landed on her feet again. In Robert Altman's new film "Short Cuts," she plays a ravaged jazz singer named Tess Trainer who tries to block out reality with booze, pot, cynical love songs and bittersweet memories of a rocky past. 
 While almost every other character in the movie is drawn from the short stories of Raymond Carver, Mr. Altman created this one especially for her. "I heard her sing at my house a lot after dinner," he says, "and I became infatuated with her passion for her music. She hears a whole band inside her head. Every time she was bored or things weren't going well, she'd sing. And that's just what this character does."
The newly released soundtrack album for the film, which opened the New York Film Festival last week and is being released commercially starting today, is her biggest recording project since the 1960's. In it she gives a jazz spin to tunes by the likes of Dr. John, Elvis Costello and U2, whose "Conversation on a Bar Stool" -- a dark dramatic monologue that is heard throughout the film -- shows how Ms. Ross has made the transition from singer to singing actress. She has just kicked off a string of national singing appearances, performing songs from the album along with a repertory that salutes the masters of pop and modern jazz.
Years of overindulgence may have roughened her once-silky voice, but her impeccable rhythm and sense of swing remain -- not to mention a combination of worldliness and wry humor. As Jon Hendricks, her former partner, has said, "Annie Ross has that feeling you can't learn in no school, that feeling that the men in the old Basie band had from birth."
Recently, in her living room on the East Side of New York, Ms. Ross lit a cigarette and recalled a life story laced with mythology -- some of it her own invention. Her measured speech reminds one of England, where she was born Annabelle Short in 1930. Rumor has always had it that she is the daughter of Ella Logan, who starred in the 1947 Broadway musical "Finian's Rainbow." Ms. Ross, however, claims that Logan was her aunt -- and that her parents, a touring Scottish vaudeville duo, sent her to live with the singer in Hollywood at age 4.
As Annabelle Logan, she landed a singing role in the M-G-M short "Our Gang Follies of 1938," then played Judy Garland's kid sister in the 1943 film "Presenting Lily Mars." But she resented Logan's frequent absences and burned to make her way in jazz like her idols Duke Ellington, Lena Horne and Erroll Garner. After the 10th grade, she quit school, took the name Annie Ross and fled to Europe, where she quickly found work as a revue performer and band singer.
Things grew complicated in 1949, when she had a brief affair with the black jazz drummer Kenny Clarke and gave birth to a son, Kenny Clarke Jr. She left the child in the care of Mr. Clarke's family, then moved to New York in 1950. After two lean years, a producer at the jazz record label Prestige asked her to try her hand at "vocalese," the technique later immortalized by Lambert, Hendricks and Ross. She returned the next day with "Twisted," a witty tale of split personalities set to a solo by the tenor saxophonist Wardell Gray. She recorded it, then flew to Scotland to join her family's vaudeville act.
While she was gone, the song became an underground hit. "Someone sent me a clipping saying that I'd won the Down Beat New Star Award," she says. "So I came back. It got me a few more gigs." She spent the next five years working in jazz clubs and theater, recording occasionally, and hanging out with musicians, happy as long as she was having fun. "I only wanted to sing and be free," she says.
Stardom came unexpectedly in 1958. Mr. Hendricks had written lyrics to a set of instrumentals by Count Basie, and he and Dave Lambert, a be-bop singer and arranger, asked Ms. Ross to join a chorus assembled to record them. Except for her, the group "couldn't swing if you hung 'em," in Mr. Hendricks's words.
The three singers recorded their voices four times each to simulate the whole Basie band. The album, "Sing a Song of Basie," officially launched them as Lambert, Hendricks and Ross. Thereafter, they wrote dozens of other vocalese story-songs that kept them on top of the jazz polls for four years. Ms. Ross stood in the middle wearing couture dresses and a tiara, her high-flying voice winning a few awards of its own. Life, she says, was "like a party."
But in the jazz world, partying often meant drugs -- and her try-anything attitude turned her into an addict in short order. Ms. Ross stiffens at the mention of it. "Yeah, I had a hangup," she says, expressionless. "A little bit here, a little bit there, and that was it. It was the culture of the time -- the long hours, having to produce every night, needing stimulation. I guess you're young and fearless and think you're going to live forever."
In the late 50's, Ms. Ross fell in love with the comic Lenny Bruce, whose own drug problems were reaching their height. In the book, "Ladies and Gentlemen, Lenny Bruce!!," the writer Albert Goldman paints a grisly picture of their affair, recounting how Bruce and a friend once managed to revive her after a near-fatal heroin fix. By 1960, the singer Carol Sloane was subbing regularly for Ms. Ross. After the group finished a date in London in May 1962, Ms. Ross stayed there to try and go straight. "I kind of knew that if I came back to America I might die," she says.
She kicked her habit, but other trials lay in store. In 1963, she married the actor Sean Lynch, who helped her run a London cabaret called Annie's Room. Eighteen months later the investors replaced music with gambling, and Ms. Ross was out of a job. By that time, the British rock scene had made singers like her seem antique.
What's more, colleagues say that Lynch had a violent streak. The revue and record producer Ben Bagley recalls running into Ms. Ross at Ronnie Scott's, a London jazz club. "She had a black eye and was quite unsteady," he says. "She embraced me and cried as if we were old friends. We sat and talked for quite a while. Her self-esteem was down to nothing."
By 1975, she had declared bankruptcy, lost her home and divorced Lynch, who died soon after in a car crash. "They say that each of these is a traumatic thing -- well, boy, I had 'em all," she says. "Work? Meager. You know, if you can't do what you really want to do, you tell yourself you don't care, when in your heart you care a lot. People say, 'Oh, there, there -- you were a great singer.' You say thank you, but you think, damn it, I'm still a great singer."
Her luck took a turn in 1979, when she won a small acting role in the film "Yanks." Thereafter, parts in films like "Superman III" and "Pump Up the Volume," occasional theater and nightclub work, and the generosity of friends helped keep her afloat. Then in the mid-80's, she met Mr. Altman's wife, Kathryn, who introduced her to the director. He became a fan and gave her a cameo in his 1992 film "The Player." When the deal for "Short Cuts" came through last year, he signed her immediately.
Through the prodding of Mrs. Altman, she has now started an autobiography. Her 43-year-old son lives in Los Angeles, apparently without much of a career. "He's kind of in music," she says. "Sometimes he plays drums." As for Ms. Ross, the future is full of hope but not illusion. " 'As Bob said, 'If nothing else, at least you'll get to sing in better places.' Whatever happens, I could never give up music. That's my heart."
She leans forward on the sofa, and for a moment her hazel eyes come vividly to life. "What a gift Robert Altman gave me, to have this opportunity at my age," she says. "By rights I should be dead. But I'm just happy I survived."
And is the Annie Ross of today any different from the young woman who won Down Beat's New Star Award of 1952? Her brow furrows. "I've come down to earth," she says. Her eyes twinkling, she adds, "but only a little bit."

About the Baby, The Bathwater And Beyond

BYLINE: By ELLEN PALL; Ellen Pall teaches arts journalism at Fordham/The College at Lincoln Center.

 BODY:
Long before parent became a verb, mothers and fathers were driving themselves crazy over how best to care for their babies. That's one lesson of "Total Baby," one of 62 works in the 17th annual Margaret Mead Film and Video Festival. The six-day event opens tomorrow at the American Museum of Natural History, then travels to half a dozen cities.
"Total Baby," which was written and directed by two New Yorkers, Kate Davis and Alyson Denny, trains an anthropologist's cool eye on the staggering array of new products and programs (womb-simulating pillows, video mobiles, exercise workouts for newborns, cooking classes for toddlers) aimed at perfecting the American middle-class child from birth to 3 years of age. 
 "Would you like to see Rembrandt? I can show you some Rembrandt," chirps a carefully-groomed young mother, displaying a reproduction to her squirming baby. "This is Aristotle contemplating the bust of Homer."
In classic anthropological style, the film makers stand a bit outside the culture they scrutinized. Neither Ms. Denny nor Ms. Davis has children (though both were inspired by making the film to speed up plans to do so).
Ms. Denny, 30, became interested in modern child rearing when a friend mentioned how well she was doing with her investment in La Petite Academy, a chain of child-care and early education centers that accepts children from the age of six weeks. Intrigued, Ms. Denny mentioned the phenomenon to Ms. Davis, whom she had met when both studied film at Harvard. When the two began to look into the child-rearing business, they found a roiling world of high-energy entrepreneurship. "Once we jumped into the pool," said Ms. Davis, 33, "we learned: Forget the toddlers; the hottest stuff going was newborns."
Cutting back and forth from present to past, the film makers place current infant-rearing trends in historical context, telescoping 2,300 years of Western notions about babies into just under an hour. The emphasis on Western thought appealed to the festival's programmer, Elaine S. Charnov.
"We rarely look at our own child-rearing habits," she said, adding that the subject was of particular interest as a contrast to Margaret Mead's own film study of child rearing in non-Western cultures. Though the festival presents many studies by outsiders of so-called exotic cultures, it strives for diversity by including films on Western subjects as well as works by non-Western film makers about their own societies.
Ms. Davis and Ms. Denny believe that theories about infants are shaped by contemporary social forces. Thus the Victorians, surrounded by the Dickensian nightmare of the Industrial Revolution, made sheltered gardens of their nurseries, celebrating a cult of innocent babies nurtured by doting mothers. Around 1900, the assembly line inspired a model of baby-as-machine (aluminum mittens to prevent thumb sucking, for example). Today's elaborate attempts to sharpen skills in infancy, said Ms. Davis, reflect "a kind of mass generational anxiety" brought on by a daunting environmental and economic future.
Does she fear that the barrage of attention may actually damage the children?
Not in the least. "Eventually, everybody gets toilet-trained," she said. "I'm not at all worried about the babies."

HEADLINE: Disappointed Black Voters Could Damage Dinkins's Bid

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
In a mayoral contest that most experts say is now too close to call, one sure bet is that most black votes will go to David N. Dinkins. But many black ministers, politicians and neighborhood leaders contend that the Mayor's support among black voters is neither as monolithic nor as enthusiastic as it once was, suggesting that more black people than usual might decide not to vote at all.
To be sure, recent opinion polls show the Mayor drawing support from about 90 percent of black people. It is not considered likely that black Democrats would switch to vote for Rudolph W. Giuliani. But some who have informally canvassed black voters suggest there is nonetheless disappointment with Mr. Dinkins and his nearly four years in office. 
 Any softening of support for Mr. Dinkins could cause him significant problems in November. In his 1989 race against Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Dinkins won 91 percent of the black vote, which accounted for 28 percent of the ballots cast. A shift in just 22,000 voters in the total electorate of 1.8 million voters would have swung the election to Mr. Giuliani.
"I have no doubt that the Mayor will enjoy the down-to-the-wire support of the vast majority of African-Americans and Caribbean-Americans," said Esmeralda Simmons, director of the Center for Law and Social Justice at Medgar Evers College, who is campaigning for the Mayor.
"But there is still continuing disappointment that many of the dreams, hopes and aspirations that came with the election of a black Mayor have not been realized," she said.
Although that disappointment may prompt some black Democrats to cross over to vote for Mr. Giuliani, it is considered unlikely that the Mayor would face a large defection. But if the disappointment causes any reduction in black turnout, the Mayor will likely suffer.
 
Enlisting Some Help
 Seeking to prevent that, the Dinkins camp has asked Representative Charles B. Rangel, to join the campaign as an adviser. Also, the Mayor has in recent weeks made black churches a staple of his campaign activity, sometimes visiting several in one Sunday.
In addition, the Mayor's strategists have set up four campaign offices in predominantly black neighborhoods, one each in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx. They have also worked with unions, black clergy and political clubs on a drive to get voters to the polls.
The Board of Elections does not compile information on voter turnout by race. But in 14 predominantly black Assembly districts -- including Central Harlem and Bedford-Stuyvesant -- 65.9 percent of the registered voters came to the polls in 1989, said John H. Mollenkopf, a professor of political science at the City University of New York Graduate Center. That compares with overall voter turnout of 63.6 percent citywide.
Black neighborhood leaders say that an erosion in enthusiasm toward the Mayor is the result of the high expectations that his election produced. Many hoped for a boom in jobs, a refurbishing of the city's tattered infrastructure and the stimulation of economic development in the city's predominantly black neighborhoods.
In interviews with several dozen black Democrats, most said they approved of the Mayor's handling of the city overall, but many had reservations about aspects of his leadership. Some, like Robert Gregg, a manager in a financial services company, say the Mayor has not been attentive enough to black neighborhoods. "He's trying to please one group in the city at the expense of his core constituency: the African-Americans," he said.
Mr. Gregg, who lives in the Cobble Hill section of Brooklyn, said he will vote for the Mayor, "but with declined enthusiasm."
 
Ambivalence About Voting
 But some black New Yorkers seem ambivalent about going to the polls. "I may vote and I may not," said David C. McKay, a dentist in the Bronx. "In my mind, his four years have been unremarkable, and I haven't seen things improve." Mr. McKay, who voted for Mr. Dinkins four years ago, is likely to do so again, "but that's if I vote." Privately, some senior aides suggest that Mr. Dinkins has been hurt by other factors. They say the Mayor has relied too heavily on subordinates who do not share his commitment to meeting the expectations of many black people. Also, they suggest that the Mayor has done a poor job of informing black voters about those initiatives that have benefited them.
And as Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Giuliani have battled for what they consider the crucial Hispanic vote, many black Democrats say they have felt ignored.
To be sure, the Mayor won high praise from many of the black Democrats interviewed. They suggested that their support was driven by a number of factors, including a longstanding history of support for Democratic candidates, racial pride and a strong antipathy toward Mr. Giuliani.
Mr. Dinkins's aides say that the Mayor must maintain a delicate balance, satisfying his black constituency while not alienating others. And with a brutal recession and a municipal budget that has had to cope with ever-growing social service needs, the Mayor has little flexibility to develop new programs and spend on business development, intensifying the frustration of many black residents, his aides say.
 
Helped by Controversy
 Several black politicians and other leaders say the Mayor's standing among black New Yorkers has been helped somewhat in the last two months by the perception that he has been under siege unduly.
The succession of crises -- from the state's report on the disturbances in Crown Heights to the furor over the Parking Violations Bureau contract -- might cause some black voters to rally to the Mayor, the officials say.
Certainly the racial issue gained visibility last week. President Clinton's suggestion that the Mayor's race might have subjected Mr. Dinkins to undue criticism have heartened some black supporters of the Mayor. And the Rev. William A. Jones's suggestion that "fascist" elements have gravitated toward Mr. Giuliani, while potentially embarrassing to Mr. Dinkins, was perhaps an indicator of a closing of ranks.
"To some extent these things work to the Mayor's advantage because people are beginning to feel he's been dumped on and persecuted by his critics," said Archie Spigner, a Democratic Councilman from Queens. "And they inevitably attribute it to the fact that the Mayor is an African-American. And that will help energize African-American voters."
Nonetheless, many who are active in black neighborhoods question whether that feeling will be sustained through Election Day.
Standing near a baseball diamond in the Crotona section of the Bronx, Austin L. Jacobo, the coach of a neighborhood baseball team, lamented the failure of the Dinkins administration to meet his expectations.
Mr. Jacobo, who is also president of the Crotona Community Coalition, said former Mayor Edward I. Koch had come to the area of neat, two-story homes more than a dozen times. "So whenever we needed something from City Hall, people at least listened to us when Koch was mayor," said the 64-year-old Mr. Jacobo.
"As black people we were glad when Dinkins was elected because we thought he would make more of a difference in our neighborhood," he said. "But that hasn't happened. In fact, he has never visited us."
When asked if he would vote for the Mayor, Mr. Jacobo said: "I don't know. It's something I have to think about."
Karl Stone, a 30-year-old analyst who lives in Flushing, Queens, also is disappointed with the Mayor. "It's become clear that he has not produced dramatic changes and probably won't," he said. "For people I know, there just isn't any sort of feeling like being part of a crusade like the last time. I think a lot of black people feel he has taken his base for granted."
Mr. Stone said he intended to vote for the Mayor but added that "I don't know how many of my friends will be motivated to go out and vote."
Alphonse C. Valbrune, a law student at Columbia University, said he expected to vote for the Mayor "even though my enthusiasm has waned." He also noted that many of his friends in his old Brooklyn neighborhood of East Flatbush will not likely vote. "The presence of a black Mayor hasn't made a difference to them. I don't think they feel motivated," Mr. Valbrune said.
There also is a perception among some black voters that in his effort to be seen as an impartial steward of the city's resources Mr. Dinkins has catered more to white constituents.
James Steele, a political consultant from Brooklyn, said, "When black people see the Mayor traveling to Israel during the Gulf War, but not visiting their community in New York City, it fuels the perception that he cares more about other communities in the city."
Top aides say Mr. Dinkins is virtually consumed by the notion of treating all groups fairly and is especially hurt by perceptions he has done otherwise.
Joyce F. Brown, deputy mayor for public and community affairs, said many of the Mayor's initiatives -- hiring more police and increasing the number of hours libraries are open, for example -- affect all communities. And she said that some programs have been particularly helpful for black and Hispanic citizens, like the city's Communicare centers, which offer preventive health care in neighborhoods where people had typically visited emergency rooms for treatment.
Furthermore, Mr. Dinkins's aides say he has repeatedly visited black neighborhoods -- just as he has a wide array of neighborhoods in the city.
If Mr. Dinkins chose to show favoritism toward black New Yorkers, it would not be unprecedented in city politics. Irish-American mayors, such as William O'Dwyer in the 1940's, were accused of favoring Irish constituents, and Italian-American mayors, such as Fiorello H. LaGuardia, were criticized for favoring New Yorkers of Italian descent.
But black advocates and clergy contend that many black New Yorkers expected Mr. Dinkins to be more successful at curbing joblessness and enhancing services in black areas of the city. In addition, they fault him for not offering what they consider at least more symbolic actions -- visits with local black community groups, for example.
Although Mr. Giuliani has done some campaigning in black churches and among black Republicans, his campaign officials indicate that there are no specific plans to capitalize on any discontent with the Mayor on the part of black voters. "People have the same concerns throughout the city," said Richard Bryers, a spokesman for Mr. Giuliani.
Clarence A. Norman Jr., a state Assemblyman from Brooklyn and chairman of the Democratic Party in Brooklyn, said disappointment with the Mayor among black voters might well fade once there is greater realization that a mayor cannot change everything.
"There was a sense of rising expectations for many black people because he was the first," Mr. Norman said. "But we have to realize that the Mayor cannot change things overnight. We have to have more realistic expectations."

Destroying Confidence

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Last week, as a U.S.-sponsored "donors conference" pledged billions to develop Gaza and the West Bank, Arab states and the P.L.O. rejected the Clinton plea to end the boycott designed to stunt the growth of Israel.
The Arab economic war not only denies Arab markets to Israelis, but -- in its secondary boycott -- has effectively frightened all but a tiny percentage of the world's thousand largest companies from investing or locating in Israel. And not just in oil-dependent Japan: Ask your favorite global bank if it has a branch in Tel Aviv -- you'll be directed to Cairo or Beirut. 
 Two years ago, Egypt's President, Hosni Mubarak, expressed his confidence, echoed by the Baker State Department, that a cessation of new Israeli settlements would lead to the boycott's end. When Yitzhak Rabin was elected, he stopped the settlements; the boycott goes on.
At the White House ceremony where Rabin shook hands with Yasir Arafat, President Clinton pointedly called for "ending boycotts." Sixteen days later, Warren Christopher met with the Saudi Foreign Minister, Saud al-Faisal, in New York's Waldorf Astoria to say that "now is the time for a concrete response. . . . The President wants demonstrable progress now."
The Saudi protested that "elements of secondary and tertiary aspects have been fixed at your urging" and that before "premature removal . . . more needs to be seen on the ground." When Christopher pressed, the Saudi promised only that the primary boycott would be "on the table for the Arab League."
Next day -- Thursday, Sept. 30 -- the Secretary met in Washington with the Saudi and other Arab foreign ministers to pass the hat for the P.L.O. When Christopher brought up the boycott, the gulf state leaders insisted that "Syria must take the first step," which gave Hafez al-Assad a veto on an Arab response to Israel's concession; his Damascus newspaper last week called for Arabs to "tighten rather than abolish the boycott."
"No, now," Christopher persisted vainly. "Arab states cannot continue to raise the ante." All he got back was that the league would "assess future steps." The P.L.O.'s man here, Yasir Abed Rabbo, promptly told reporters that the boycott should remain until Israel settled claims on Jerusalem.
Why didn't the U.S. link its half-billion dollar pledge to an end to the boycott? One reason is that Shimon Peres did not condition Israel's own $75 million donation on Arab reciprocation during Christopher's card-calling. Our Congress should link U.S. aid to an end to the boycott.
I asked Mr. Peres for his reaction to this thumb-in-the-eye to his strategy of sustained unilateral concession.
"We view peace as a process of give and take," he replied Friday. "Israel has given. It decided to stop settlements. The Arabs said they would put an end to the boycott in return. Israel lived up to its commitment; the Arabs did not.
"The Arabs then argued that -- should Israel recognize the P.L.O. -- they would 'stop turning their backs' on Israel. No such thing has happened."
"Peace is a matter of both mutuality and public conduct," states Peres. "It is impossible for one party to take its positions publicly with the other party applauding it in private. If this continues to be the case, Israel will view the Arab side as responsible for slowing and even endangering the continuation of the peace process."
Tough words. He then went on television to eagerly shake the hand of Jordan's smiling Prince Hassan, who said sternly afterward: "To those who have said the boycott is economic warfare, I would say removing the boycott is economic suicide."
Where are the denunciations of intransigence from doves now? Does anyone see the paradox in Israel and America helping make the P.L.O. financially strong enough to encourage Arab dictators to wage economic war on Israel?
"I am confident that in the course of time," Bill Clinton said after this latest confidence-destroying measure, "we will get the boycott lifted." After the West Bank withdrawal. After the Golan giveback. After the division of Jerusalem. After the dismantling of Israel's nuclear deterrent. And after that? Such is "the course of time."

Where House Numbers Are Secret, and at Issue

DATELINE: ALPINE, N.J.

 BODY:
SHHHHHH. There's a secret in Alpine. It's so closely guarded that even residents of this affluent Bergen County borough cannot get access to the information: their real house numbers.
The numbers are written on a tax map, which is rolled up in the desk of the Chief of Police, who is under orders from the Borough Council to keep it under wraps. 
 "We don't need house numbers," said Arthur Lair, a Republican councilman. "We have other ways of identifying our houses. I know of people who have put butterflies on their rocks. I have a brass placard on my driveway gate that says, Twin Oaks."
But some residents, mostly newcomers, disagree and say it is about time this tiny hamlet, a haven for executives and celebrities, steps in line with the rest of suburbia and adopts ordinary addresses.
"It's silly and dangerous not to have house numbers," said Karakian Bedrosian, a Democratic councilman. "It puts the borough in the position of a lawsuit if someone is ill and an ambulance can't find their house. The way it is now, people have to say things like, 'It's the sixth house on the right next to the blue house without the shutters.' If people want a house number, they should have it. I believe people are entitled to this information."
Whether to have house numbers is an issue, like whether to have sidewalks or door-to-door mail delivery (they don't have that either), that bubbles to the surface of the local political caldron here every few years. It has been raised again because the borough, anticipating becoming part of the 911 emergency network, hired an engineer who devised a numbering system to aid rescue vehicles.
Whereas residents of other towns take their house numbers in stride, in Alpine the proposal has been called both a threat to a rural, secluded way of life and the first step down the road to becoming just like hoi polloi in the rest of Bergen County.
"Not having numbers makes a house harder to find, and something less reachable takes on an aura of exclusivity," said Helen Feher, a real-estate broker who has lived in Alpine for seven years.
Instead of official numbers, some Alpine residents select numbers that appeal to them or, in other cases, name their houses and display the names on plaques. Most people simply post their own surnames, carved on wood plaques or painted on ceramic tile.
Mrs. Feher said her clients sometimes ask her for help in naming homes that are being put on the market. "A name gives it a sense of individuality, and some people relate individuality to importance and importance to dollar value," she said.
Some house names have a European ring, like "Mon Reve" ("My Dream" in French) or an Edwardian flavor, like Tatrawood. Then there are those homeowners who prefer landmarks. One resident had an arm with a hatchet carved from a tree stump on his front lawn. Another mounted a miniature gazebo on a post at the driveway. There is a white wood seagull on a brown plaque under a spotlight on Robin Lane, and a rearing white stallion at the corner of Hillside and Church Streets.
"It's a quirky town where people have all these weird little things to mark their houses," said a resident, Kathleen Sharma. "Everyone is very individualistic, and we were all perfectly content with this. We've always depended on there being the same people working in the Police Department, in the post office and on the U.P.S. delivery route, and they know where to find us."
Alpine, which is nine miles from Manhattan, is a borough of 1,716 residents whose median family income in 1989 was $115,426, according to the county Department of Planning and Economic Development. The average home sale in 1990, during the peak of the real-estate slump, was $852,000. Most houses are worth more than $1 million.
The house numbers issue has erupted into a partisan battle pitting the Republicans on the Borough Council, who oppose numbers, against the Democrats, who favor them. Republicans outnumber Democrats 4 to 2 on the Council.
"There's a difference between accessing the numbers and mandating their use," said Paul Tomasko, a Democratic councilman. "We thought the public would have a right to know this information. All we were trying to do is give residents the access to their numbers in the event they wish to use them."
After much debate over the last few months, the Council killed plans to mail residents the house numbers or to make them available at Borough Hall. The Council then voted to put the matter to a referendum in November, but that measure too, died.
"No one got back to me before the Aug. 20 deadline for adding it to the ballot, and it just slipped by," said Mayor Walter Duke, a Democrat, with a shrug. "It's just as well. The whole thing was getting out of hand. We're going to have house numbers one day, and that's that."
Not everyone agrees.
"People are attracted to Alpine because of its uniqueness, and one small part of its uniqueness is it doesn't have house numbers," said Mr. Lair, the councilman. "This comes up every once in a while because we have nothing else to make an issue of. The way it is now, if you want to put a number on your house, you can. You just do it. But to give out numbers, that might open up a Pandora's Box. I say things are nice the way they are."
And out of the box might come door-to-door mail delivery, which Mr. Lair said could result in having service coordinated from the neighboring town of Closter, and that could lead to a Closter mailing address.
Alpine residents must pick up their mail at the small post office in their municipal building.
For now, the numbers will stay in Chief William H. Grayson's desk. The chief, who has been on the Alpine police force for 26 years, said it was one responsibility he would just as soon not have. "I just wish this would be resolved," he said.

HEADLINE: SHOWDOWN IN MOSCOW: Washington;
Clinton, Reaffirming Support for Yeltsin, Blames Rutskoi's Faction for the Violence

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3

 BODY:
President Clinton today blamed opponents of Boris N. Yeltsin for the violence in Moscow and vowed that the United States would not waver in its backing for the Russian President as he sought to restore order.
A senior American official described events in Moscow as "a very, very serious crisis." But as the 13-day-old standoff lurched into the streets, Mr. Clinton made clear he had no intention of lessening his support for Mr. Yeltsin. 
 Mr. Clinton said he believed that the Russian President had "bent over backwards" to avoid resorting to force. President Clinton said he remained convinced that the United States "must support" Mr. Yeltsin in his struggle with defiant leaders of Parliament.
"We cannot afford to be in the position of wavering at this moment or backing off or giving any encouragement to people who clearly want to derail the election process and are not committed to reform," he said before leaving for California.
 
Faith In Yeltsin
 With the violent turn today leaving Moscow more dangerous and unpredictable, American backing for Mr. Yeltsin carries some risk. But just as they blessed Mr. Yeltsin's dissolution of the Parliament, Administration officials said, they still regarded the course the Russian President had set as the best guarantee of democracy.
"We want to see this end as quickly and as peacefully as possible, and we want to see Boris Yeltsin prevail," a senior American official said.
The official said the Russian soldiers dispatched tonight had orders from Mr. Yeltsin "not to initiate fire, and only to return fire if fired upon." But he said it was apparent that the troops had been instructed "to do what's necessary" to reclaim strategic sites.
[Early Monday, Mr. Yeltsin ordered Russian troops and armored personnel carriers to move in on the Parliament building.]
 
Yeltsin 'Calling the Shots'
 Strobe Talbott, the State Department's Ambassador at Large to the former Soviet republics, said Mr. Yeltsin was at the center of the "inner circle and still is calling the shots."
On Wednesday, when Mr. Clinton met here with Russia's Foreign Minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, American officials expressed confidence that Mr. Yeltsin had no intention of using the military to resolve the crisis. Today, they said Mr. Yeltsin's hand had been forced by a "cynical provocation."
They identified the instigators as Vice President Aleksandr V. Rutskoi, Mr. Yeltsin's rival, who was named acting president by the legislators, and Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, the Parliament leader.
 
Embassy as Liaison
 Mr. Talbott attributed "this serious situation today" to supporters of Mr. Rutskoi and Mr. Khasbulatov, saying they had "sent mobs out into the streets to attack people" to thwart efforts to resolve the dispute.
With Mr. Yeltsin and his top advisers huddled in the Kremlin, there was no direct contact today between Washington and Moscow over the crisis. Mr. Clinton said the Russian President "has more important things to do right now than to talk to me."
Instead, the Embassy was serving as the liaison to the Russian Government, with Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering maintaining contact with Mr. Yeltsin's forces and passing on messages to Washington, where officials were in contact with the Russian Embassy.
And despite their avowals of support, American officials remained clearly determined to avoid steps that could be portrayed by Mr. Yeltsin's opponents as a sign that he was in Washington's thrall. The officials said the United States had not been asked to provide intelligence information or other assistance to Mr. Yeltsin and did not expect such a request.
"We're not trying to micromanage their crisis management," a senior American official said this afternoon.
 
Bipartisan Support
 Congressional leaders from both parties expressed support today for the Administration's posture. Representative Richard Gephardt, the House Majority Leader, speaking on the NBC News program "Meet the Press," described the crisis as "probably the moment of great danger" for democratic change in Russia and said the United States had no option but "to stick with the person who up until now has been the reformer."
But while voicing the same sentiment, Senator Robert Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, speaking on the CNN program "Late Edition," said the United States might do well to consider whether it was wise to urge countries like Russia to impose economic shock therapies that carry the danger of political backlash.
A senior American official said Americans in Moscow were being advised to remain indoors. [Early Monday, non-essential personnel and families were evacuated from the Embassy compound.]
 
Uncertainty of Violence
 Tonight, Clinton Administration officials said it remained unclear to them how much violence might lie ahead, but they expressed scant doubt that the Russian President would survive the confrontation.
"I wouldn't overreact to this," Mr. Clinton said this afternoon. He said he believed that the Russian people remained "clearly still far more supportive" of Mr. Yeltsin than of his opponents.
"So we'll just have to wait for events to unfold. But I have no reason to believe that he'll be deposed.
"I think the United States should support Yeltsin as long as he is the person who embodies a commitment to democracy and to letting the Russian people chart their own course," Mr. Clinton. "And he does."

EUROPEANS BACK YELTSIN
 LONDON, Oct. 3 (Reuters) -- Britain, France and Germany expressed support today for President Yeltsin after thousands of opponents him clashed with police forces in Moscow.
Prime Minister John Major of Britain expressed support and said Mr. Yeltsin "has received a democratic mandate from the Russian people at the ballot box in this year's referendum and last year's presidential election. He deserves the support of all democrats inside and outside Russia."
In Bonn, the German Government declared its support for Mr. Yeltsin and urged the street combatants not to jeopardize democratic reforms.
"Every use of violence must be condemned," Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said, urging both sides to start negotiations.
France said it held anti-Yeltsin forces responsible for the casualties -- more than 20 people have been killed -- and it called for the free parliamentary elections that Mr. Yeltsin has promised. France "deplores the loss of human life for which forces opposed to President Yeltsin hold a heavy responsibility," the Foreign Ministry said.

HEADLINE: Clinton Offers Domestic Cures To Californians

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Oct. 3

 BODY:
President Clinton took his entire domestic agenda on the road today, using a rally and televised question-and-answer session to peddle his health care plan, urge the passage of gun-control legislation and promote a trade agreement that he promised would create, not cost, jobs.
Along the way, Mr. Clinton also pledged that he would appoint to the Federal bench only judges who would uphold the law allowing abortions, even if they are on record as being personally opposed to it. 
 Stating that his record as a supporter of abortion rights "is clear and unblemished," Mr. Clinton said he was considering at least two judicial nominees who are opposed to abortion.
"Some senators recommended judges to me who have been appointed who have questionable positions on that issue, but they're lower court judges," he said. "They have to uphold the law. If they won't do that, I won't appoint them."
Mr. Clinton's day had the random manner of a campaign whistle-stop tour. As he began the first of three days at work in California, Mr. Clinton found himself fielding questions as diverse as gay rights and job retraining.
At the raucous airport rally that began his visit here today, Mr. Clinton outlined his plan to ease some of the political discontent arising from the region's failing economy.
"We have got to focus on the economy of California, the state which has 12 percent of our nation's people, but 25 percent of our nation's unemployed," he said.
 
Expanding Issues
 The pressure to make a pitch to California, which remains a vital state, also changed the nature of Mr. Clinton's television appearance tonight, which was initially planned as part of the Administration's plan to educate the public about the universal health coverage it has proposed.
Instead, the 90-minute program broadcast from a Sacramento television station, was a grab-bag of issues and concerns, leaving Mr. Clinton little room to lobby for his health care plan.
"We are in a time of great change," Mr. Clinton said at the start of the program. "You know that out here. You've benefited from some of these changes in the last 10 years. Now you've suffered for the last three years from a lot of these economic changes."
Mr. Clinton suggested that one of the answers to the questions posed by this change was expanding security, a theme that he is using to tie the health care changes he proposes to issues like crime control and public education.
On health care, the questions were mostly the ones White House officials expected. Members of the studio audiences asked Mr. Clinton about whether they would be able to choose their doctors, afford experimental treatment and receive treatment from specialists.
 
Support for Brady Bill
 It was on other issues that Mr. Clinton forced to be more specific. He called once again for passage of the Brady Bill, the measure that would impose a five-day waiting period on the purchase of handguns.
"Congress should not drag its feet," Mr. Clinton said. "They have been debating this for two years. It is time to pass a crime bill. It is time to pass the Brady Bill. It is time to ban assault weapons, get them out of the hands of kids so the police can do their jobs and put more police on the street."
The President also offered a strong endorsement for the North American Free Trade Agreement that he supports despite complaints from opponents who have maintained it will drain the United States of critical jobs.
Mr. Clinton said that those who oppose the trade agreement "have some very good arguments, but they're arguing against things that happened for the last 12 years. They're arguing against the insecurity of the times our people have faced and the fact that our Government has not responded to them."
Mr. Clinton also said he supported efforts to stiffen controls on illegal immigration at the Mexican-American border. "If we permit our laws to be regularly violated and flagrantly violated, and impose those costs on a state that has the biggest economic problems, I think we run the risk of undermining support for immigration, which I think is a very important American value," he said.

HEADLINE: Businessman Details Case Involving Commerce Chief

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., Oct. 3

 BODY:
Suddenly, Ly Thanh Binh has found an audience.
For seven months, the small-time businessman has been spinning a wild tale of international intrigue, telling reporters and the Federal Bureau of Investigation that Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown sought a bribe from the Vietnamese Government in return for his help in lifting the trade embargo against Vietnam. 
 Mr. Brown has dismissed the story as the stuff of pure fantasy, and there is no evidence that he has received any money or done anything wrong. But the emergence of new details last week has helped bolster Mr. Binh's credibility and prompted criminal investigators to treat his story with a new respect, even though his accusations of misconduct remain unproven.
In five hours of interviews over the weekend, Mr. Binh, a 37-year-old American citizen who was born in Vietnam, recounted the unlikely adventure that he says plucked him from a series of unsuccessful business dealings here and landed him in a Hanoi guest house for a meeting with the Vietnamese Prime Minister.
It began, Mr. Binh said, in the summer of 1992, when Nguyen Van Hao, a former Vietnamese official then running a convenience store in Broward County, Fla., recruited him into a sketchy plan to pursue investment opportunities in Vietnam. It ended, he said, last winter, when he learned that Mr. Hao was arranging to bribe Mr. Brown.
Since then, he said, he has been so determined to get out the story that he even pawned a family ring to get gasoline money to drive to Washington to talk to Congressional staff members.
His detractors say he is being manipulated by conservative veterans groups opposed to normalizing relations with Vietnam. Mr. Binh angrily denies it, saying he supports normalization. "My motive purely is that I do not believe in unethical government conduct," he said.
Mr. Binh acknowledges that he has never met Mr. Brown. He said his entire understanding of Mr. Brown's role comes from information relayed to him by Mr. Hao.
His story got a flood of new publicity last week when Mr. Brown seemed to contradict statements put out earlier by his aides. Asked about Mr. Hao, a Commerce Department spokesman had previously said that Mr. Brown "didn't recall meeting with this man."
But speaking through his lawyer, Reid H. Weingarten, Mr. Brown acknowledged last week that he had met three times with Mr. Hao, once before his selection as Commerce Secretary and twice there after.
 
Binh's Story Got Boost
 Mr. Weingarten said Mr. Hao had sought advice on trade issues involving Vietnam. But he said that his client and Mr. Hao had never discussed any payment, and that once Mr. Brown had been nominated to the Cabinet he had told Mr. Hao that he could not help him.
Mr. Binh's story got another modest boost last week when the authorities said they had found evidence that suggested the Vietnamese were preparing to establish a bank account in Singapore. Mr. Binh has said Mr. Hao told him that $700,000 was supposed to be deposited there for Mr. Brown. But it is unclear whether the authorities were drawing any connection between the money and Mr. Brown.
Law-enforcement officials say Mr. Hao has testified before a grand jury in Miami that is investigating the accusations against Mr. Brown. Efforts to reach Mr. Hao have been unsuccessful.
In the interviews this weekend, Mr. Binh said he came to the United States in December 1973 as a 17-year-old high school graduate to pursue his education and was stranded in the United States when the Government of South Vietnam fell two years later.
He moved to New Orleans, he said, enrolled at Tulane University, and graduated in 1978 with an economics degree. Over the next dozen years, he pursued a variety livelihoods, most of which encountered financial difficulties -- working as a financial consultant in Louisiana, a restaurant owner in Mississippi and founder of E.S.P. Inc., a company in Broward County that sold electronic devices to remove barnacles from boats. He had closed that business and was looking for a new niche in 1992, he said, when met Mr. Hao.
At that point, Mr. Hao was running the convenience store. But he later told Mr. Binh something that Federal officials have confirmed: that Mr. Hao was the only top official in South Vietnam allowed to remain in power after the country fell to the Communists.
Government officials have said that Mr. Hao was South Vietnam's Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Development, but that he held lesser posts under the Communists. Mr. Binh said this weekend that the Communists appreciated Mr. Hao because he had preserved for them some of the country's gold reserves. He said Mr. Hao stayed in Vietnam for about seven years after the Communist victory, then left for Paris, Haiti, and then the United States. He said Mr. Hao is 57 years old and holds a French passport.
 
Asked for Business Help
 He said Mr. Hao had showed him a disorganized set of charts and that he had sought his help in converting them into a business plan. The idea was to help recruit businesses interested in investing in Vietnam in the event the trade embargo against Vietnam was lifted.
Mr. Binh said he threw himself into the enterprise with the understanding that he would be a partner and move back to Vietnam if normalization occurred. But he received no salary, he said, and borrowed money from his sister to support himself and his wife.
Though Mr. Hao rented a mailbox with a Manhattan address, Mr. Binh said, the enterprise was being run out of Mr. Hao's home in Coral Springs, Fla., and consisted mainly of sending their plan to potential investors. They called their endeavor the Vietnam Development Corporation.
But the focus began to change in November, Mr. Binh said, after Mr. Hao told him to send a copy of the plan to Mr. Brown. Mr. Binh said Mr. Hao and Mr. Brown had a mutual friend, a Haitian named Marc Ashton. Shortly thereafter, he said, Mr. Brown flew to South Florida on a private jet, met with Mr. Hao and told him he wanted to be "the exclusive lobbyist" for South Vietnam.
 
Plane Trip to Hanoi
 Mr. Binh was not at the meeting and says his understanding of it comes from Mr. Hao. Mr. Brown has now acknowledged meeting with Mr. Hao at a restaurant in South Florida in November.
Soon after, Mr. Binh said, he and Mr. Hao were on a plane heading for Hanoi, seeking to persuade the Vietnamese Government to give the lobbying contract to Mr. Brown.
Mr. Binh said they were treated as dignitaries in Vietnam, where they met with the Prime Minister, Vo Van Kiet. Mr. Binh said that the meeting concluded with a private discussion between Mr. Kiet and Mr. Hao and that afterward Mr. Hao had said the Prime Minister had agreed to hire Mr. Brown. They returned with a letter from Mr. Kiet to Mr. Brown, urging Mr. Brown to continue discussions with Mr. Hao.
By the time they arrived home in December, Mr. Brown had been nominated to the Cabinet.
Mr. Binh said Mr. Hao had then traveled without him to Washington, to meet with Mr. Brown, and returned saying Mr. Brown wanted $700,000 and other economic concessions. Mr. Binh said the money was to be placed in a Singapore bank account controlled by Mr. Ashton.
Mr. Brown has acknowledged a December meeting with Mr. Hao and Mr. Ashton. But Mr. Brown's lawyer said his client told Mr. Hao at that meeting that he could not help the enterprise since he was going into the Government. Mr. Ashton, who has also testified before the grand jury, has been unavailable for comment.
Upon learning of the plan, Mr. Binh said "my guts turned upside down." He said he told Mr. Hao that he could not support it. He said Mr. Hao tried to persuade him to stay with the group.
He said he last saw Mr. Hao on Feb. 15, when Mr. Hao offered "to pay me money to keep my mouth shut." Instead, Mr. Binh said, he began his campaign to publicize the plan.

HEADLINE: South Raises Stakes in Fight for Jobs

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Last week it was Mercedes-Benz going to Alabama. Last year it was BMW in South Carolina. Before that it was Saturn in Tennessee and Toyota in Kentucky.
Increasingly, in large ways and small, manufacturing in the United States has a Southern accent. 
 How much of that is the result of the region's strengths and how much reflects the fierce competition for jobs that allows companies to demand, and receive, major economic incentives is a question that is increasingly being debated by politicians and development officials.
In long-suffering Alabama, seldom thought of an industrial Mecca, there was widespread exultation over last week's announcement that Mercedes-Benz had chosen the state over 30 others bidding for a $300 million, 1,500-employee plant that will produce the German automaker's new four-wheel-drive sports utility vehicle.
 
Intense Competition
 "This kind of opportunity comes once in a lifetime," said Prof. Mac R. Holmes of Troy State University, who prepared an economic analysis that said the plant and businesses it attracted could lead to 15,000 to 17,000 new jobs over 10 years and additional wages of $5.9 billion over 20 years. "Not only are there the returns in terms of money, but the symbolism may be as important as the direct economic impact."
But outside the state there are widespread questions about an incentive package estimated as high as $300 million put together by a financially strapped Alabama. Some experts say the Mercedes bidding became so extravagant that it raised questions about the value of the prize.
"This is really what I'd call a quantum leap in incentive bidding wars," said Douglas P. Woodward, an economist at the University of South Carolina. "I think it's gotten to the point where you really have to seriously question the cost and benefits of doing this kind of thing."
For the nation, the questions go to what sort of guidelines, if any, should rule the increasingly cutthroat competition for a declining number of manufacturing jobs. For the South, they complicate the costs and benefits of what is largely a positive picture of economic growth.
"I couldn't begin to tell you how many speeches I've read by Southern governors saying: 'We're no longer going to get into that. We only want industry that can pay their way,' " said Prof. James C. Cobb, a University of Tennessee historian and author of "The Selling of the South" (University of Illinois Pressf, 1993), a history of economic development in the South. "It never means anything. And the sad fact is the situation is probably getting worse rather than better."
 
Not a New Trend
 The Mercedes decision comes at a time the Southern economy, particularly in manufacturing, is outperforming the national one. First Union Bank in Charlotte, N.C., recently reported that the Northeast and West Coast had lost more than 450,000 manufacturing jobs in the last two years while the Southeast had gained 23,000.
The trend is hardly new. Since the 1930's, the South has used the promise of low costs, non-union labor and economic incentives to lure manufacturing plants. In recent years, the region's newer roads and utilities, its growing network of suppliers and its lower living costs and more relaxed way of life have also been substantial inducements. And the South, particularly the Interstate 85 corridor from the Carolinas to Georgia, was well ahead of the rest of the nation in seeking out foreign manufacturing investment.
Whatever the cause, from 1990 to 1992, 9 of the top 12 states for new manufacturing plants and major expansions were in the South.
What apparently made the difference for Mercedes in Alabama was an extraordinary package of incentives. They include $77.5 million to improve water, sewer, gas and electrical services; $92.2 million to improve and develop the factory site, and $60 million to train Mercedes employees, suppliers and workers in related industries. The plant will be built on 1,000 acres of pine forest east of Tuscaloosa.
Professor Holmes said his economic analysis was conservative and indicated that over 20 years the plant would mean at least $320 million in increased state tax receipts, and $115 million in benefits to local governments.
But the sheer size of the incentive package led to widespread concerns that the bidding had become destructively competitive. Such concerns have been rising in recent years and were debated in August at the National Governors' Association convention. The governors approved a resolution saying competition for jobs "should not be characterized by how much direct assistance a state can provide to individual companies." They urged states to use incentives that could benefit an entire community, like worker training.
"The whole issue of economic development today is in many ways out of control," said David Cole, director of the Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation at the University of Michigan. "It's like the customer going into an automotive dealership with a high rebate and once he gets a taste, it becomes the price of entry. They keep going higher and higher and where does it stop?"
Some skeptics say the game is particularly perilous for a state like Alabama, which has crushing needs including an educational system so deficient the state's Supreme Court ruled that it failed to provide student with a minimally adequate education guaranteed by the state Constitution.
But for such states the lure can also be the greatest.
Kentucky raised eyebrows in 1985 when it lured Toyota with what was then a record $147 million incentive package.
But Charles Haywood, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Kentucky, said it has become clear the money was worth it. He said the plant, which was expected to bring 3,000 jobs, would bring a total of 6,000 by 1995. He said the plant would cost the state $305.2 million by 2005 but will produce $993.4 million in additional state revenues.
"It's been a heck of an investment," he said.
Still, Alabama will be investing twice as much money for only 1,500 direct jobs. Mr. Woodward of South Carolina said that in Europe there were controls on the kind of incentives bidders could offer. It is unlikely such controls can be adopted here, particularly at a time of growing international competition.
 
States Desperate
 No one suggests incentives account for the bulk of the South's economic success. Most relocation or expansion decisions are relatively routine and depend more on specific location, low wages, lack of unions and other considerations.
And even Professor Cobb says it is hard to that say the policy has been wrong headed. All the Southern states have seen significant income increases relative to national figures in recent decades. In 1960, per capita income in North Carolina was 71 percent of the national average, South Carolina was 62 percent and Georgia was 74 percent. In 1992, the figures were 89 percent, 81 percent and 91 percent.
Still, Professor Cobb said, it is a reflection of just how desperate states are for jobs that a practice that was supposed to be transitional has now become an entrenched and increasingly important part of economic development. That is true both for businesses choosing between New York and New Jersey or Alabama and South Carolina.
Few expect it to change.
"People have complained, not only citizens but elected officials, but it's sort of like talking about the weather," said Charlie Gatlin, of the Georgia Department of Industry, Trade and Tourism, one of the unsuccessful Mercedes bidders. "Everybody talks about it, but is anybody really going to do something about it? I don't know. I don't think so."

HEADLINE: With Strike Ended at Post, Job Applications Readied

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
After months of turmoil, The New York Post begins a new lease on life under the stern golden hand of Rupert Murdoch today, starting with the assembling of a new editorial and business staff to replace members of the Newspaper Guild of New York, whose strike fell apart last week.
At the request of the defeated guild's leadership, John Cardinal O'Connor appealed to Mr. Murdoch yesterday to be fair to 287 guild members -- reporters, editors and advertising and circulation staff -- who lost their jobs in the climactic confrontation, and may or may not be rehired. 
 Because he bought only The Post's assets, and not the corporation that owned them, Mr. Murdoch, according to his aides, is under no legal obligation to honor old union contracts or keep workers employed by the previous owner. But he said through a spokesman yesterday that he would let all guild members apply for their old jobs and would treat them as fairly as the needs of the money-losing newspaper allowed.
"Rupert Murdoch has great respect and affection for the Cardinal," Howard J. Rubenstein, a spokesman, said. "He will treat the workers fairly based on talent, experience and the needs of The New York Post. The process is expected to take weeks, perhaps months. The goals will be to stop its terrible economic hemorrhaging and provide a quality publication for the public."
Mr. Rubenstein said Mr. Murdoch had made no promises about the number of guild workers who would be rehired or the number of new employees or the wages to be offered. He noted only that each person offered a job would be asked to sign an agreement specifying employment terms and conditions. He declined to say what these would be.
Peter Faris, executive vice president of The Post, said in an interview that management was not planning to reduce the size of the newspaper's 700-member staff, would seek "the best and most aggressive" personnel for its news and business departments and would pay "competitive" salaries. The Post's most experienced guild editorial and business employees were paid about $900 a week.
"The entire staff will be approximately the same size, maybe a little less to begin with, but as we grow and become successful it will be back up," Mr. Faris said. While hiring continues, he said, executives and others, including some new workers hired last week, will produce the paper.
 
Other Agreements
 After repeated brushes with bankruptcy and flirtations with would-be owners, The Post has been rescued by Mr. Murdoch, whose global media interests had a profit of $605 million last year. Vowing to cut The Post's $14 million-a-year losses, he signed agreements in recent months with nine craft unions; they took effect when he bought the paper in Federal Bankruptcy Court on Friday. It had been owned by Peter S. Kalikow.
But no agreement was reached with the guild, and after Mr. Murdoch insisted upon a period of freedom to dismiss any worker, regardless of seniority, the guild struck last Monday. When craft unions refused to cross guild picket lines and The Post was unable to publish for three days, Mr. Murdoch threatened to walk away from his deal to buy the paper.
In the face of a threat that might have killed The Post and all its jobs, the craft unions crossed the lines and The Post resumed publication. While the strike technically continued, a guild unit that had represented Post workers for 50 years had been broken, its ties with production unions were cut and its own future was cast into doubt.
Barry F. Lipton, the guild president, said yesterday that the union, under Federal law, would continue to represent Post workers if Mr. Murdoch rehired a majority of the former guild staff; if he hired less than half, the guild would have to organize a new shop, which Mr. Lipton pledged to do if necessary.
Mr. Lipton said that Cardinal O'Connor, after meeting with guild leaders, sent a letter to Mr. Murdoch "basically asking for fairness in the way he treats guild people." That, Mr. Lipton said, meant restoring the jobs of as many as possible and providing severance and other benefits to those not rehired.
While guild members held a candlelight vigil and pickets continued to march outside The Post at 210 South Street last night, the symbolic end of the strike and the beginning of a new era for the paper was set for noon today, when the picket line is to come down and employment applications are to be handed out.
In January, when Mortimer B. Zuckerman bought The Daily News, his managers on the first night handed each guild employee an envelope -- thick ones with job offers, thin ones with dismissal notices. About 170 received thin ones. At The Post, the procedure is to be somewhat different.
When the picket line comes down, Mr. Faris plans to meet Mr. Lipton in the lobby and hand him application forms for all his members, sparing them, but not Mr. Lipton, from the first step in what many saw as a humiliating process of seeking their own jobs. Mr. Lipton said he had not decided whether to go into the lobby for the forms.

HEADLINE: Largest Publicly Held Hospital Chain Is Planned

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Richard L. Scott, a 40-year-old Texas lawyer who started a small Sun Belt hospital group five years ago by buying a pair of down-at-the-heels hospitals in El Paso, emerged yesterday as the head of the world's largest investor-owned hospital group.
Mr. Scott's Columbia Healthcare Corporation and the HCA-Hospital Corporation of America announced on Saturday that they had agreed to merge in a tax-free exchange of shares. It would be the seventh-largest merger in any American industry since 1981. 
 Columbia Healthcare had about 150 million shares outstanding as of Friday. HCA had about 180 million shares, which would be exchanged for about 188 million new Columbia shares. The two companies said the 338 million shares would be valued at $10.22 billion, based on Friday's closing price on the New York Stock Exchange of $30.25 a share for Columbia's stock. HCA shares closed Friday at $22.75 on the Big Board.
 
Would Create 190-Hospital Chain
 If the merger is approved by shareholders of both companies and Federal antitrust regulators, the new chain would have 190 hospitals with 42,000 beds. The new company would have hospitals in 26 states, concentrated mostly in the South.
Analysts said they were surprised by the speed with which the companies acted, although consolidation of hospitals seemed inevitable. "We did not expect it to be this big and this fast," said John F. Hindelong at Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette Securities.
Columbia's chairman, Rick Scott, celebrated last night at a restaurant on the East Side of Manhattan with Dr. Thomas F. Frist Jr., chairman of HCA, and Richard E. Rainwater, the financier from Fort Worth, who is a shareholder in both companies, and their wives.
Dr. Frist, whose father founded HCA, would be chairman of the new company, to be called Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation, and Mr. Scott would be president and chief executive. The new board would include Columbia's 11 current directors and 4 HCA directors.
The executives said that by merging they would get a jump on changes that have been gathering momentum in the health care system. They said the new company would dominate local markets in Miami, Houston and El Paso, and would squeeze costs to be low bidders in a string of Southern cities, including Louisville, Ky., and Nashville, where it will have executive offices.
"This will make us the low-cost provider of health care in the markets wherever we are," Mr. Frist said.
Mr. Scott said that although there were no plans to close any of the existing hospitals, the group would probably buy "10 or 20 hospitals in the next two to five years, which we would shut down."
Health economists say that hundreds of hospitals will close across the country as Government and private payers increasingly give their business to low bidders. Mr. Scott said health maintenance organizations in Miami were already reducing payments to hospitals by 10 percent compared with a year ago.
Some hospital experts were skeptical. "The for-profit hospitals are having a great deal of financial difficulty, primarily because of low rates of bed occupancy," said Gerard F. Anderson, director of the Center for Hospital Finance and Management at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Indeed, both Columbia and HCA have bed occupancy rates of less than 50 percent.
The companies said they expected to save $130 million a year by combining marketing, data processing and purchasing; trimming overhead, and borrowing working capital at lower rates. Columbia has a higher credit rating than HCA, which is still reducing debt it assumed in a 1988 leveraged buyout.
 
High Personal Stakes
 The principals in the merger have large personal stakes in the deal. The 18 million shares owned by the Frist family would be worth $545 million at Columbia's Friday price.
Mr. Scott and Mr. Rainwater, who each put up $125,000 in working capital in 1988 and borrowed to buy the El Paso hospitals, will also do well. Mr. Scott's six million shares were worth $181.5 million. Mr. Rainwater's stake would be $272 million; he has 5.3 million HCA shares and more than 3 million Columbia shares.
Columbia operates 94 general and specialty hospitals and HCA operates 96 general and specialty hospitals, including 20 psychiatric hospitals. Both companies also operate diagnostic, outpatient and other treatment centers.
Merrill Lynch & Company is advising Columbia and Goldman, Sachs & Company is advising HCA on the merger project.

HEADLINE: A Season When Quick Trips Aren't;
Autumn in New York: Trying to Get There With No Detour

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
When horn-honking, engine-revving, cut-'em-off-at-every-opportunity New York drivers look back on September 1993, what comes to mind almost sounds like a tin-eared rewrite of a song from the musical "The Fantasticks": Try to remember the kind of September when traffic flowed smoothly and roads were not under construction.
Mark Kulewicz tried to remember that far back, but could not. 
 "This September was worse than last September, which was worse than the September before, notwithstanding the recession, which has reduced traffic volume," said Mr. Kulewicz, the chief engineer for the Automobile Club of New York.
 
Some Sort of Detour
 As someone who makes his living studying traffic-artery-clogging phenomena like middle-of-the-day expressway bottlenecks and middle-of-the-road rubberneckers, Mr. Kulewicz has a lot he can study. To many motorists, the blocked-off lanes and under-construction streets have become a symbol of how the city doesn't work because getting there from here inevitably seems to involve some sort of detour.
A quick trip from the Upper East Side to the Upper West Side? The 79th Street transverse through Central Park has been closed for more than a year. A midday cab ride from the Upper West Side to Grand Central Terminal? The fastest way may be through -- yes -- the garment district, because two lanes of the Avenue of the Americas are torn up, creating long backups on eastbound side streets.
The conventional wisdom used to be that the three weeks at the end of the year, when holiday crowds jammed New York to see the tree in Rockefeller Center and maybe "The Nutcracker" at Lincoln Center, brought the worst traffic of the year.
Now, after a week with a Presidential visit that led to a huge traffic jam in Queens -- on a Sunday, no less -- as well as the opening of the United Nations General Assembly, which froze traffic on much of Manhattan's East Side, many motorists insist that autumn is worse. And on weekends it's street fair time.
"There's no second-guessing New York City traffic," said Barry A. P. Paduani, who was a taxi driver in the 1980's and now pilots an 18-wheel behemoth of a cement mixer. "It makes a fool out of you. In a cab, a passenger gets in and says, 'Take me the fastest way.' I don't know the fastest way. Every time you think you know a fast way, it's fouled up. I got to where I'd put it on the passenger and say, 'You tell me.' And usually, their way is about as good as anything."
Carrying cement instead of people has not moved Mr. Paduani into the fast lane. "Twice last week the inbound lanes on the Manhattan Bridge were closed," he said, "and you can't take a truck on the Williamsburg Bridge and it costs $26 to go on the Verrazano. The only free choice is the Manhattan Bridge, but last week it was just horrendous. It took two hours to get from College Point to Jersey City, just because they closed one lane."
Regular drivers like Mr. Paduani can recite a litany of lane and road closings. Last year, Mr. Kulewicz said, the Queens-Midtown Tunnel viaduct and the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway were under construction. Now the Long Island Expressway, and some lanes have been closed on the East River bridges.
"The light at the end of the tunnel, so to speak, is hard to see because it seems like as soon as one project ends, two more start," Mr. Kulewicz said. "Next September we will be talking about the Gowanus Expressway, and that one threatens to last 12 years."
 
Other Street Closings
 Work on the Cross Bronx Expressway was completed in the last year, he said, but that kind of welcome news is lost in other street closings.
In addition to the Avenue of the Americas project, Columbus Circle has been constricted for the last several weeks while work crews dig and repave. On weekends, traffic was funneled through the buses-only circle in front of the New York Coliseum. On Saturday, the part of the circle leading to Central Park South was blocked off.
A couple of weeks ago, when traffic was allowed onto on Central Park South, the block between the Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue was particularly slow because of lanes that had been closed for construction work.
 
A Two-Year Project
 Farther uptown, Columbus Avenue is scheduled for a two-year, $62 million water, sewer and utility project from 59th to 110th Streets. In a recent newsletter to constituents in that area, City Councilwoman Ronnie M. Eldridge claimed credit for getting Con Edison to limit its preliminary work to below 62d Street and above 88th Street.
Compounding all that is the fact that it is once again autumn. "In August, traffic's way down," said Lisa Daglian, a spokeswoman for the city's Transportation Department. "In September, it's back to normal. The comparison makes it seem worse. At Christmas, it's not concentrated in one area, except maybe Rockefeller Center. The General Assembly doesn't come close to bringing the same number of people over such a broad area."
She said that before the General Assembly session began last week, her agency considered declaring "delegate-lock" or "U.N.-lock," but officials feared that the first term was erroneous -- the delegates are generally not the ones stuck in traffic -- and the second would be pronounced "unlock." Also, the Transportation Department is trying to go easy on warnings. It stopped issuing gridlock alerts for the holiday season, she said, "because nobody was paying attention."
"People just say, 'Yeah, yeah, another gridlock day,' " Ms. Daglian said. "That's why we didn't issue one for last weekend, although in retrospect maybe we could have."
But it might not have mattered. "New York is accustomed to slow intracity traffic," said Mitchell Moss, director of New York University's Urban Research Center. Drivers know, he said, the fastest way from Brooklyn Heights to the Upper East Side is often the West Side Highway.
Last week, as the General Assembly gathered, diplomats' security personnel pleaded with ordinary motorists who stumbled across limousine-length parking spaces, and small motorcades tore through town, oblivious to red lights.
Dave Saunders, who works in a Mail Boxes Etc. store at 847A Second Avenue, near East 45th Street, said he was almost hit by a truck that was swerving out of the way of what appeared to be a diplomatic caravan.
"There were all these police" on the sidewalk, he said, "but it wasn't like anybody was doing anything to help pedestrians."
But Mr. Kulewicz of the Automobile Club said things could have been worse. Fortunately for drivers, he said, neither the Yankees nor the Mets made it to the playoffs this year.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Trying to Guess Economy's Pace

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The wide range of estimates for how much nonfarm payroll jobs increased last month signal that the bond market could be surprised by the report due on Friday from the Labor Department.
But even the high-side estimates of 200,000 new jobs do not represent a significant jump in the pace of economic growth. And the low-end estimates of about 75,000 would seem to assure that growth is still sluggish. 
 If 200,000 jobs were created last month, the average monthly increase for the third quarter would still be just 124,000, below the average of 179,000 for the second quarter, and the average of 162,000 for the first three months of 1993.
So the question going into Friday's report is unlikely to be: Is the rally that has pushed long-term yields down to 25-year lows over? The more likely question is this: Is the economy still growing slowly enough to open the way for a new drop in interest rates that would bring the yield on the 30-year bond to 5.75 percent, just below the 25-year low of 5.86 percent reached on Sept. 8?
 
Gauging Market Response
 It may still be difficult to gauge how the market will respond. One reason is that traders and investors will be waiting for the two important inflation reports -- the Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price Index -- to be released the following week. The consensus on the C.P.I. is that it will show an increase of about a tenth of a percent, which should be reassuring for the market after a disturbing rise of three-tenths of a percent in August.
But what still makes the guessing tough is figuring out how much growth -- even if it is still moderate -- it will take to worry the bond market. Given the near standstill pace of 1.3 percent for the first half of the year that has helped fuel the 1993 rally, it may take only a little pickup in growth to get traders and investors to sell.
"The market is going to be feeling skittish," said William Dudley, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company. The data will show that the economy is stronger than in the first half of the year, but it will be ambiguous about how much stronger, he said.
 
A Bet on Lower Rates
 Will it be stronger at a 2.5 percent growth rate, or stronger at a 3 percent growth rate? The answer, he said, would be unclear for a while. Goldman, Sachs is forecasting stronger, at 2.5 percent, with estimates of growth in the current quarter at 2.1 percent, and 2.7 percent in the last three months of the year. On this outlook, the firm is still betting that long-term interest rates will fall to new lows.
The Goldman, Sachs nonfarm payroll projection shows an increase of 100,000, Mr. Dudley said, a pace that should "reassure the bond market that while the economy is doing a little better, growth is not picking up to the point where they have to worry about the Fed" and inflation.
But he said growth over 3 percent would worry the market, because at that point there was a chance the Federal Reserve would raise short-term interest rates because the central bank would begin to worry that inflationary pressures were building.
Susan M. Phillips, a governor of the Federal Reserve, did not directly address this interpretive problem in a speech in New York City last week. But she seemed to indicate that growth would continue to be contained -- that is, continue at a pace that should not worry the bond market. And she expressed confidence about inflation, even admonishing the traders and analysts at the dinner to look beyond the C.P.I. to see the restraint on prices in the economy.
In a speech to the Money Marketeers of New York University, Ms. Phillips said, "This is indeed a slow recovery." In running through a description of the sectors of the economy, she noted that "spending is likely to remain fairly moderate" and housing is "surprisingly weak." She also said the Clinton plan to reduce the Federal budget deficit would not be the only drag on the economy. Tax increases and spending cuts at the state level will also slow growth.
 
'Look Beyond the C.P.I.'
 She was more upbeat on inflation. She said producer prices were "showing a disinflationary trend," industrial material prices "have been soft," and corn, soybean and precious metal prices had moved down again. "In trying to assess inflation, it is wise to look beyond the C.P.I.," she said.
The report on Friday that the price index of the National Association of Purchasing Managers plunged to 46.8 in September, from 54.6 in August, added to the data that indicate that the coming inflation reports should show minimal increases for September.
Donald Fine, the chief market analyst at Chase Securities, who is predicting a 200,000 increase in nonfarm jobs for September, said that if the C.P.I. for September increased only one-tenth of a percent, the yield on the 30-year bond, which closed on Friday at 5.99 percent, should stay near the bottom of its present trading range, which has taken the yield as low as 5.94 percent.
If the nonfarm employment number is lower -- in the 75,000 range -- and the C.P.I. is still up only one-tenth of a percent, "the rally would continue," he said. "You would be on the way to 5.75 percent."
 
An Impact of Tax Increases
 Mr. Fine argued, however, that even if the yield on the 30-year bond rose in the near term because the economic data were a little stronger than the market could take, interest rates would still remain low or even fall as the economy moved into next year.
He said he believed, as do other economists, that even if the growth rate of the economy jumped to 3.5 or 4 percent in the fourth quarter, the pace of growth would slow to the 2 percent level in the beginning of 1994. Why? Among the reasons, he said, are the impact of the tax increases to reduce the Federal budget deficit; the uncertainty surrounding the fate of the Clinton Administration's health care plan; continued cutbacks in military contracting and the recessions in Europe and Japan that are curtailing purchases of American exports.
"In light of that, it is hard to argue why interest rates should rise any time soon," he said.

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
As the magazine industry grimly continues to struggle through a recession that refuses to recede, Jack D. Rehm, the chairman, president and chief executive of the Meredith Corporation, is thinking positively.
His demeanor is in keeping with the typically cheerful spirit of the Des Moines-based company, best known for publishing two magazine industry giants: Better Homes and Gardens, with a circulation of 7.6 million, and The Ladies' Home Journal, with 5.1 million. In addition, Meredith publishes more than a dozen home-and-hearth magazines like Country Home, Country America, Midwest Living, Traditional Home and American Patchwork and Quilting. 
 The company also has a book publishing division and owns seven television stations. It is also involved in cable television systems and residential real estate.
About five years ago, in a prescient move, Meredith decided to refocus its magazine operations. It sold its printing operation and made plans to cut jobs, invest in new technology, build a data base of subscribers and start spinning off new magazines from existing publications.
 
Emphasis on Circulation
 Then, when advertising proved a fickle friend in hard times, the company turned circulation into its chief source of revenue.
"The reason we have succeeded with so many magazine titles in the last several years is that we are able to get readers to really pay for the magazines," Mr. Rehm said. "We must count much more on the reader to generate the revenue stream than the advertiser. Historically, that has not been true, and magazines who were overly dependent on advertising were the ones who really suffered."
"We will charge readers a lot of money on the theory that if they really like the magazine they will pay for it," he said.
They might also pay for new magazines on the same subject, Meredith has found. For instance, the company started Wood magazine in 1984 for people whose hobby is woodworking. Its circulation, initially 150,000, is now 650,000. Within the last few years, Wood has spawned a magazine called Weekend Woodworking Projects, then another called Decorative Wood Crafts, which is aimed at forlorn-feeling spouses of the mostly male readers of Wood. This was followed by Super Scrollsaw Patterns, for those woodworkers who like to use a scroll saw.
 
Profit for the Year
 Meredith's moves are paying off, Mr. Rehm said. Net earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30 were $18.6 million, in contrast to a net loss of $6.3 million the previous year. Magazine advertising revenues were $234.4 million, compared with $227.5 the previous year, according to the company.
Circulation is also up for most of the Meredith magazines tracked by the Audit Bureau of Circulations. The exceptions are Country Home and Better Homes and Gardens, which intentionally cut back its circulation last year to make the magazine more efficient.
New titles in 1993 have included American Patchwork and Quilting, with a circulation of 200,000; Craft and Wear, with 200,000, and a group of occasional publications called the Ladies' Home Journal Celebrity Spinoffs, each with circulation of 400,000. The first of these was devoted to Katharine Hepburn, who was interviewed by Myrna Blyth, editor in chief and publishing director of Ladies' Home Journal.
 
Data on Subscribers
 Another big step has been the investment of several million dollars in a central data base containing the names of 60 million subscribers to the company's books and magazines. Many publishing companies, including Time Inc. and Conde Nast, have been creating data bases with various kinds of information about their readers' interests. The giant is Reader's Digest, which has a worldwide data base of more than 100 million households, slightly more than half of which are in the United States.
"I don't think you can be in our business and not have a data base that is not state of the art," Mr. Rehm said. "It allows editors to know in detail about the people who read their products. If you subscribe to one or more of our magazines, we know that. If you are a member of a book club or have purchased a cookbook, we have it in the data base."
Meredith can use the data base to focus on specific groups of readers, thus reducing its mailing costs.
"We can also use it for advertising," he said. "For instance, if you are a Ford owner, Chevrolet might be interested in you."
Meredith is still testing the potential of its data base. By April, the company hopes it will be useful in a process called selective binding, which allows a magazine to place a special section into some copies. For instance, eight pages about gardening will be included next spring in issues going to readers identified in the data base as gardening enthusiasts.
So far, about 200 employees have left Meredith in connection with its refocusing of operations, including 119 who volunteered for an early retirement program offered last year.
 
Coping With the Flood
 One event that was unplanned, of course, was the flooding that devastated parts of the Midwest last summer. For two weeks, Des Moines was without a water supply, but Mr. Rehm said no deadlines were missed and every magazine went out on schedule.
The flood even brought about some efficiencies. A plan to convert from a mainframe computer system to desktop publishing was pushed forward by about eight months when the mainframe system broke down during the flooding. The company quickly invested $400,000 in new personal computers, rented a large space in a suburban area that had less damage from the flood, and gave about 150 of its editorial employees a crash course on desktop technology.
For the longer term, Meredith's plans include continued development of its newer magazines and maybe some new titles.
"I don't think we'll branch out in new directions," said Mr. Rehm, who will turn 61 this week and faces mandatory retirement at 65. "Our expertise is home and family; that's what we know best. We are going to concentrate on magazine and book products that fall under that umbrella.
"We are going to stick to our knitting," he added with a smile.

HEADLINE: Foreign Stocks Proved Wise Choice in Quarter

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Foreign stock prices posted impressive gains in the third quarter, aided by falling European interest rates and dynamic growth in a number of the Pacific Rim's smaller economies.
The improvement on foreign equity markets stood in contrast to what took place at home, where market averages, sloshing around at record highs, managed only a marginal increase. 
 Outside the United States, in dollar terms, stock prices rose by nearly 6 percent in the third quarter, according to The Financial Times world index. By comparison, the index showed that prices rose by just under 2 percent in the United States.
 
 
'Great Quarter'
 "It was a great quarter," said Richard R. Foulkes, whose $1.6 billion Vanguard International Growth Fund was up more than 11 percent for the quarter.
It also furthered a trend that has been in place since the start of the year, one in which Americans who have invested in international mutual funds have done much better than those who have invested their money at home.
"Historically, people invest outside their home market when the home market doesn't look all that attractive," A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services, said. "And on a year-to-date basis, the 350 world funds we track have outperformed the more than 1,200 general equity domestic funds we follow by roughly three times."
Despite that stellar performance, most managers of international portfolios have failed to outpace global market indexes.
Through the first nine months, The Financial Times' global stock index that excludes the United States was up by just under 30 percent in dollar terms. During the same period, prices in the United States rose by just under 6 percent.
 In the third quarter, Malaysia was the world's best-performing market, as stocks rose by 28 percent. That showing lifted it past Japan, the six-month leader, as the best performer for the first nine months. So far this year, Malaysian equity prices are up more than 60 percent.
"Malaysia was a classic situation," said Marcus Grubb, an international equity strategist at Salomon Brothers in London. "The economy was strong, interest rates were low and falling, and price-earnings ratios on Malaysian stocks were low."
After the third-quarter surge, Malaysian shares "are no longer cheap," Mr. Grubb added, "but people think it has a long way to go."
For much of the year, money has been flowing into European stock markets on the expectation that dismal economic conditions in a number of countries would force central bankers to ease interest rates.
Some countries did cut rates, but it took a major crisis in Europe's Exchange Rate Mechanism to do it.
Rates were not lowered much in Germany, but unexpectedly good economic news made Frankfurt the Continent's most successful exchange in the third quarter, with German stock prices rising 16.8 percent in dollar terms.
"In the third quarter we basically got paid for our view that interest rates in Europe were going to come down, and when they did that would be very supportive of stock and bond markets," said John R. Hickling, who manages more than $2 billion in international mutual fund money for Fidelity Investments. So far this year, the two funds Mr. Hickling manages are both up around 30 percent.
Portfolio managers said Britain, Japan and Hong Kong were the most disappointing markets in the third quarter.
Share prices in Britain were up just over 5 percent in the quarter, despite falling interest rates. Equities in Japan, the world's best-performing market for the first half of the year, advanced just under 4 percent. And Hong Kong stocks rose 6.24 percent.
 
 
'Better Value'
 Despite big price moves so far this year, the analysts said they expected share prices in Asia and in selected European countries to advance further.
"Right now Asian markets afford better value than in Europe or North America," Mr. Grubb from Salomon Brothers said. "We like Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong. And European markets outside the E.R.M. look cheap, like Britain and Switzerland."
Mr. Hickling said stocks in Europe that were sensitive to interest rates should continue to do well.

HEADLINE: THE AD CAMPAIGN;
Attacking Florio on Taxes

BYLINE: BY Jon Nordheimer

 BODY:

Candidate: Christine Todd Whitman
 
Producer: The Murphy Pintak Gautier Agency. Washington. 

Visual: This ad is dominated by images of Gov. Florio, first seen on a television set talking in a 1989 campaign interview and then as a stern, tight-lipped figure in a photorgraph that remains on the screen. Headlines appear reading "Record Income Tax Hike Becomes Law", "Killer Tax" and "Florio's Tax Package a Pain for the Middle Class." Images are shown of a closed factory and a shop window with a "Store Closed" sign posted as the lines "8,000 Business Failures" and "280,000 Lost Jobs" accompany the images. A news headline from the Newark Star-Ledger flashes on screen: "Florio Refuses to Rule Out Raising Taxes Again."
 
The Script: Jim Florio. Remember his promises? (Mr. Florio is heard talking in 1989) "And I'm convinced that there is not a need for new taxes..." (The narrator continues): After the election Florio pushed through the largest tax increase in state history, taxes that drove 8,000 businesses into failure and cost 280,000 people their jobs. Now Florio refuses to rule out raising taxes again. Jim Florio. He may be the worst Governor New Jersey's ever had.
 
Analysis: This third television spot in Mrs. Whitman's campaign is a departure from the first two in that she is not seen or heard from at all. Putting the opponent's picture on the screen, or using broken promises from an earlier campaign, are a tipoff that a campaign has abandoned the high ground and gone negative, something Mrs. Whitman said she disdained. Of course, Mr. Florio has made Mrs. Whitman the featured player in his ads. Hanging 8,000 business failings and 280,000 lost jobs around Mr. Florio's neck as a direct result of his tax program ignores the reality of an extended economic decline that has baffled Republicans as much as Democrats. The Governor counters that his "tough" decisions on taxes has helped the state maintain its credit and actually softened the hardships imposed by a national recession.

HEADLINE: Unions Gird for War Over Trade Pact

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Leaders of American labor unions, who are here to set goals for the next two years, say that nothing -- not health care, not the long erosion of blue-collar wages, not even the Reagan and Bush Presidencies -- has stirred worker passions as has the proposed North American Free Trade Agreement.
The prospect of deregulated trade with Mexico so angers some unions that they are vowing to take the unusual step of making the vote of a member of Congress on the agreement a single-issue test of loyalty to labor. The unions say they will use their money and skills to drive from office those who support the agreement. 
 "We see this as a life-and-death issue," said Jay Mazur, president of the ladies garment workers' union. "We won't support people who vote for Nafta."
William H. Bywater, president of the electrical workers and organized labor's most outspoken foe of the agreement, said, "We're going to go out and defeat every congressman who votes for Nafta."
In strong union states like California, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio and Pennsylvania, such threats carry real weight.
 
'They're Steamed Up'
 Leaders of the big teamsters and machinists unions are saying much the same. George J. Kourpias, president of the machinists union, said he had not yet issued ultimatums against lawmakers who vote for Nafta. "But," he added, "I can tell you, we will get no requests from our members back home to support them. They're steamed up about this." George Poulin, a machinists vice president for the Northeast who is also here, said: "Knock them off. That's our position."
Posturing over something that the Government or business is doing is routine among unions. It helps build cohesion among their diverse members whose numbers are sinking. But there is more to labor's opposition to the trade agreement. It presents the liveliest red-meat issue unions have faced in years. The jobs at greatest risk are in factories, where unions are strongest and where more lost jobs spells further erosion of labor's political influence. Today, less than 12 percent of the workers in private industry are unionized.
The trade issue is different, too, because for the first time in decades unions stand a chance of reversing a trend in international economic policy that they blame for many lost jobs. Most trade agreements are reached through negotiations with foreign governments. But because Congress must approve the agreement with Mexico, and Canada as well, labor has a chance to influence the vote.
Partly in response to labor's lobbying, several leading Democrats in Congress have broken with President Clinton to join labor in opposing the agreement, most recently Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the majority leader.
"No doubt about it," said Robert N. McGlotten, chief lobbyist for the American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations, "it's a lightning rod."
 
Little Dissent, No Change
 The union officials are in San Francisco preparing 200 policy resolutions that will be presented at the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s weeklong biannual convention here, beginning Monday.
Among other things, the resolutions will salute Mr. Clinton's universal health care proposal, a union goal for decades, condemn sexual harassment at work, call for overhauls of the labor laws and health and safety regulations in the workplace and urge legislation to prohibit employers from dismissing workers who strike. The delegates, some of whom are elected by the rank and file while others are selected by the union leaders, will vote on the resolutions with little dissent expected.
They will also elect their leaders, the 32 men and three women who make up the federation's policy-making executive council. It includes the federation's president, Lane Kirkland, 71, the secretary-treasurer, Thomas Donahue, 66, both first elected 14 years ago, and the leaders of 33 unions.
Whatever their respect for democratic traditions and the processes they would use to banish members of Congress, the delegates always elect and re-elect the council members by acclamation, without ballots or opposition.
Dissent, instead, is aimed at Washington and a President who, with the exception of his stance on the trade agreement, they tend to like.
 
Weighing Trade and Jobs
 Since his election, Mr. Clinton has answered one union prayer after another. He signed the Family and Medical Leave Act, lifted the hiring ban on the air traffic controllers dismissed by President Ronald Reagan, proposed an overhaul of the health care system that is close to what many unions wanted and has loaded his Administration with former union officers. Mr. Clinton will speak here on Monday.
But unions do not buy his endorsement of a trade agreement that the Bush Administration negotiated, fearing it will lead to lost jobs.
Many unions are also alarmed because for the first time ever, they have witnessed an economy climbing out of a recession for more than two years without restoring jobs lost in the recession or creating well-paid new jobs. Laid-off workers have enrolled in an immense variety of Government-sponsored courses and programs to learn new skills, only to find insecure jobs that pay half as much as the old jobs.
Union officials have begun to mock Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich's assurances that better training and education will lead to better jobs. A guest economist here, Thea Lee of the union-funded Economic Policy Institute in Washington, calls this the "field-of-dreams" theory of job creation.
"Raise people's skills, and new industries to hire people will come along," Ms. Lee said, citing the views of Mr. Reich, who will address the convention on Tuesday. "Then when corporations go shopping for workers, they will come to the United States." That's unlikely, she said. "Those workers will be cheaper somewhere else."
Not a single union here backs the trade agreement, but some unions, like the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees and the American Federation of Teachers, are less alarmed than others.
Two officials of the teachers union said that they thought that the potential threat to American jobs had been overstated and that American industries would keep moving to Mexico even if the agreement is not approved.
Some other officials said they feared that vituperative opposition to the agreement would provoke an anti-union backlash in the Administration or among legislators who support labor on many other issues. John N. Sturdivant, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, said he would not ask his members to banish members of Congress who support Nafta. "I'm not going to touch that one with a 10-foot pole," he said. "We might end up driving them against us."
Still, even among unions whose members face little direct threat from jobs moving to Mexico, there is fear of chain-reaction effects on their members' jobs.
Richard L. Trumka, president of the mine workers union, said that when factories shut down they stop using the fuel that runs many of them -- the coal his 75,000 members mine. "There will have to be extremely, extremely, extremely special circumstances," he said, "for us to support any congressman who votes for Nafta."

JACKSON LEADS RALLY IN CANADA
 NIAGARA FALLS, Ontario, Oct. 3 (AP) -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson came to Canada this weekend to join Canadian protesters in condemning the trade agreement.
Mr. Jackson led about 150 protesters across the international border on Saturday and was met by about 500 Canadians, including labor leaders. He had told an audience in Sudbury, Ontario, on Friday that corporations had pushed for the pact as a way of getting cheap labor.
But Mr. Jackson said Saturday that he did not blame Mexican laborers for problems the deal could pose for American and Canadian workers. "Our mission is to raise Mexican standards, not lower our own," he told the crowd.

HEADLINE: Salinas Offers Plan to Aid Mexican Economy

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Oct. 3

 BODY:
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari today announced a complex plan to raise Mexican wages and bolster the nation's economy. His proposals address United States concerns about American jobs displaced by cheap Mexican labor and lay the groundwork for the 1994 presidential election campaign.
At a ceremony in Los Pinos, the Mexican White House, Mr. Salinas said the complex package of economic measures would allow Mexico to "harvest and use the advantages" it earned in five years of fiscal discipline. In that time, inflation has been trimmed to a single-digit annual pace and Mexico's foreign debt has been substantially reduced. 
 The stimulus package includes individual and corporate tax cuts, lower prices for industrial electricity and diesel fuel, lower cargo rates at airports and on railroads, and accelerated corporate depreciation for investments like environmental controls and motor vehicles.
 
Productivity a Factor
 Those measures are being taken in addition to wage increases, which for the first time will take into account Mexican workers' increasing productivity. The higher wages were a promise Mr. Salinas made to President Clinton as side agreements on the North American Free Trade Agreement were being negotiated.
But today Mr. Salinas made a point of saying his actions were directed at the internal market "independently of external business circumstances or accords."
The package's cost is thought to be roughly $6 billion, an amount equal to the federal budget surplus, which Mr. Salinas has said he plans to use.
He has been criticized for waiting until now, just before the start of the election campaign, to start spending the money. Although he is prohibited from running for re-election, his party, which has governed Mexico for more than 60 years, has a lot at stake.
"It's an attempt at a fiscal act with obvious political overtones," said Jorge G. Castaneda, a professor at the Autonomous University of Mexico and a critic of the Salinas Government.
Government officials said they thought the package would bolster Mexico's economy enough to make up for the lower tax rates without creating a budget deficit.
Minimum wages are set each year by a national commission. For the coming year, minimum wages will be increased by the anticipated 1994 rate of inflation in Mexico -- 5 percent -- and the rate of increase in productivity for manual labor as a whole throughout the country. The formula for determining productivity has not been set, officials said, but will conform with international standards.
The Mexican Government has been taken to task for leaving vague its promise to link wages to productivity. Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader, was among those who criticized the pledge because only 16 percent of workers in Mexico earn the minimum wage.
 
Negotiating for Bonuses
 Mexico's Secretary of Labor, Arsenio Farell Cubillas, said today that the raise next year would be no less than 7 percent but no more than 10.8 percent. Mr. Farell also said that workers who earn more than the minimum wage would be able to negotiate for productivity bonuses with their employers.
Besides the wage increase, Mexican workers, especially those with the lowest incomes, would benefit from proposed adjustments to Mexico's income tax code. One big change would create what in effect would be a negative income tax. Workers at the lowest levels could use legal deductions resulting in their receiving an extra payment from the Government.
Tax rates for those earning up to four times the minimum wage would also be reduced so that 2.6 million workers, twice as many as before, would pay no taxes.
The income provisions are part of the Government's yearly program of wage and price controls, called El Pacto, which was renewed today for the eighth time. At the signing in Los Pinos, Mexico's labor unions, farm workers and business executives strongly supported the renewed agreement, saying it would usher in "a new culture of competitiveness and productivity."
The plan has something for everyone, though there are concerns that by spreading it so widely, the impact has been diluted. For farmers, Mr. Salinas pledged a new program of direct assistance. For businesses, corporate tax rates would drop to 34 percent from 35, depreciation would accelerate for environmental investments and motor vehicles, and prices on a range of government products and services would be lowered.


CORRECTION-DATE: October 23, 1993, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Oct. 4 about Mexico's plans to raise minimum wages misstated the range of the increases planned for next year. The minimum wage should rise at least 5 percent, not 7 percent, to match the expected rate of inflation in 1994. There is no Government-imposed ceiling on increases in the minimum wage; they are not limited to 10.8 percent.

HEADLINE: U.S. Reports Sharp Increase In Drug-Caused Emergencies

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER

 BODY:
Federal health officials in Washington yesterday reported sharp increases in the number of medical emergencies resulting from drug use. They said the numbers underscored the need for more rehabilitation programs and more effective prevention efforts.
While casual drug use has continued to decline, heavy users of cocaine, heroin and marijuana have been streaming into hospital emergency rooms in unprecedented numbers, the officials said. 
 The number of those seeking help for adverse reactions to cocaine in 1992 increased 18 percent over the previous year, to 119,800. At the same time, heroin overdoses and other reactions to the drug rose 34 percent, to 48,000, and adverse reactions to marijuana, like respiratory problems and paranoia, jumped 48 percent, to 24,000.
"These are the highest levels ever," said Daniel Melnick, a senior official in the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which released the data yesterday.
Dr. Mitchell S. Rosenthal, the president of Phoenix House, the largest residential treatment organization in the country, said: "These kinds of big rises suggest a desperation of use and a kind of hopelessness among users. They think they are trapped and can see no alternative but to keep using."
The emergency-room cases resulting from heroin and marijuana use included people of all ages, from adolescence up. But cases among cocaine users 12 to 17 years old declined, the data showed.
The unrelenting rise in drug cases in hospital emergency rooms from the mid-1980's, most of which reflects chronic, as opposed to casual, use, goes to the heart of the national health crisis, many drug experts said.
Emergency-room treatment is among the most expensive kind of care, the experts pointed out, and it has little affect in reversing chronic drug use.
 
Cry for More Treatment
 Both Donna E. Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the parent organization of the substance abuse agency, and Lee P. Brown, President Clinton's chief anti-drug aide, said the soaring drug casualties cried out for more spending on treatment and anti-drug education.
But President Clinton's proposed $13 billion anti-drug budget for the coming year sticks with the pattern established by Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, in which the biggest share of the money goes to trying to stop the flow of drugs rather than to programs aimed at rehabilitation and discouraging drug use. With the President's consent, Congress trimmed from his proposal $100 million that had been earmarked for treatment and $143 million designated for anti-drug education.
White House officials had promised that the Administration's overhaul of the national health system would include substantial increases in money for drug treatment. But the proposals include no provisions for the kind of long-term residential treatment that most experts say is needed to deal with the kind of chronic drug users now flooding emergency rooms.
Instead, Mr. Clinton's health insurance proposal would cover two periods of 30 days of hospital or clinic treatment in any year, along with 30 days of outpatient care.
"We're not talking about people who can use 30 days of inpatient treatment," Dr. Rosenthal said. "We're talking about people here who, if they are not in the emergency room, they are likely to be getting into all kinds of anti-social behavior that can lead to prisons, courts and everything else."
Many experts say that curtailing heavy drug use would sharply cut national health costs. The Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, for example, recently found that 20 percent of all Medicaid costs were related to drug abuse. Medicaid is the Federal-state program for the poor.
"Trying to cut health care costs without solving the drug crisis is like trying to sail a sinking ship without fixing the hole on the bottom," said Paul Samuels, the president of the Legal Action Center, a national drug policy organization based in New York.
Many experts said Mr. Clinton appeared to be avoiding the drug issue. He has seldom addressed the issue in public and has not presented a comprehensive national strategy.
 
'Feeling of Being Left Out'
 Herbert D. Kleber, the executive vice president of the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, said, "the President is so concerned about health care reform that he is not paying enough attention to drug abuse."
Dr. Kleber added: "And it is going to be hard to reform health care in a cost-effective way if he doesn't pay adequate attention to this group of heavy users that we're hearing about today. It's also going to be hard to stop violence."
A number of studies have shown that heavy drug users consume most of the illegal drugs sold in this country, and that they are often involved in property crimes and violence.
Representative Charles B. Rangel, the Manhattan Democrat who heads the House Caucus on Narcotics Abuse, said there was clearly a relationship between the steep increases in emergency-room cases due to drugs and "the feeling of being left out economically."
"If you plot the hospitals where the highest amounts of casualties are coming from," Mr. Rangel said, "you will also find the highest concentrations of AIDS, of unemployment, of people going off to jail, of teen-age pregnancies and of violent crime."

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
In Finagling on Trade Pact, Legislators' Barter Is Votes

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 4

 BODY:
It's a ritual as old as Congress itself.
The Louisiana delegation wants to change a provision in the North American Free Trade Agreement that could put local sugar farmers out of business. Florida lawmakers want safeguards to protect orange growers who fear a surge of Mexican citrus. And Iowa and Ohio legislators are urging a slower phase-out of tariffs on stoves and refrigerators to protect local producers. 
 The wheeling and dealing over Nafta is just beginning, and with the trade agreement expected to be approved or rejected by a handful of votes, President Clinton would be wise to watch his wallet. The trick for the Administration is to do a favor here and make a concession there without opening a floodgate of requests that would force it to go back to Mexico for last-minute rewrites of the Nafta text. And by satisfying one group of lawmakers, the Administration risks upsetting another.
"We've got teams of shoppers prowling the halls of Congress," said Senator Byron L. Dorgan, a North Dakota Democrat who is an ardent foe of the pact. "They're saying, 'What can we leverage?' or 'What can we do for you?' "
The deals lawmakers are seeking fit into two general categories: garden-variety personal favors and more specialized requests that deal with a particular tariff or environmental concern. In the first category, Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., Republican of Florida, has warned that he may not be able to vote for the agreement if the Administration cannot persuade Mexico to extradite a Mexican accused of kidnapping and raping the 4-year-old niece of the Congressman's secretary.
In the second category is Representative Esteban E. Torres, a California Democrat who has urged the Administration to help organize a North American Development Bank to finance roads, bridges and environmental cleanups along the border.
While many lawmakers are looking for nothing more than an invitation to dine at the White House before they promise to vote for the accord, negotiations have revolved mostly around sugar and wheat.
Mexico produces a lot of sugar, but because so many Mexicans have a sweet tooth, the country is a net importer, to the delight of American producers. But those producers are afraid the trade pact will foster a torrent of sugar imports from Mexico. They argue that when American corn flows south of the border, the Mexicans will replace the sugar in their sodas with corn syrup, freeing the cane for export.
Such fears have made a big impression on lawmakers from Louisiana, Texas, Florida and Hawaii. Senator John B. Breaux, the Louisiana Democrat who helped engineer a compromise energy tax in order to pass Mr. Clinton's budget, has again taken center stage by urging the Administration and Mexico to negotiate a letter of understanding to limit a possible sudden surge of sugar imports.
Many Midwestern lawmakers have voiced concerns that the pact will permit Canada to subsidize wheat shipped south, a situation that they say is already occurring despite a separate trade agreement that was supposed to prohibit such practices. The lawmakers argue that Canadians are dumping subsidized wheat and barley onto the American and Mexican markets and that the Administration must take action.
At a meeting with lawmakers last Tuesday, Mickey Kantor, the United States Trade Representative, and other senior officials promised that the Administration was pressing Canada on the issue. Mr. Dorgan, the Nafta opponent, said he interpreted the pledge as a quid pro quo, and then stormed out of the meeting.
"The message is, 'If we're willing to help you, are you willing to help us?' " the North Dakota Democrat said. "It's not a subtle message." Mr. Kantor said Mr. Dorgan's interpretation was "unfair," and denied that a deal was offered, or even implied.
Some supporters of the agreement, like Representative Jim Kolbe, Republican of Arizona, view the surge in deal-making as a positive sign. Mr. Kolbe said it shows lawmakers are looking for ways to shake their fears that big labor or Ross Perot's legions will punish them at the polls if they vote for the agreement.
But other boosters are losing patience, calling on the President to shake fewer hands and flex more muscle. Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, said of Mr. Clinton, "He's got to use a little more of the L.B.J. technique."

HEADLINE: Clinton Defends Trade Pact To Skeptical A.F.L.-C.I.O.

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 4

 BODY:
Taking his effort on behalf of a North American Free Trade Agreement to perhaps the unfriendliest audience he could find, President Clinton assured labor leaders today that the pact would not cost American jobs.
Mr. Clinton told 915 delegates at convention of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations that he was arguing on behalf of the trade agreement, "not so you'll agree with me, but so you will know what I want you to know, which is that I would never knowingly do anything to cost an American a job." 
 Arriving on the opening day of the convention, which the A.F.L.-C.I.O holds every other year, the President made his declaration as part of a speech devoted largely to his Administration's efforts on behalf of working people. It was met with lukewarm applause. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. has already declared itself solidly against the plan to eliminate trade barriers among the United States, Canada and Mexico.
Minutes before the President spoke, Lane Kirkland, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which represents 13.3 million members of 95 unions, said the federation would not budge in its opposition to the trade agreement. He added that it was a mistake for Mr. Clinton to continue to support it.
 
Pact as a 'Poison Pill'
 "By and large, his agenda is our agenda," Mr. Kirkland said of Mr. Clinton in a speech just before the President spoke. "But we do have one major difference of opinion. Among the poison pills left behind by George Bush is a lethal one called Nafta."
Nonetheless, Mr. Clinton insisted that the trade agreement would make the economy stronger. He contended that trade deficits with Asian nations posed a greater threat to American jobs than the prospect of lowering trade barriers with Mexico, a nation with which the United States enjoys a trade surplus.
"Is it a perfect agreement?" Mr. Clinton asked the mostly silent unionists. "No. But I don't want to make the perfect the enemy of the better."
Opposition to Nafta, as the trade agreement is known, has been led by labor unions and heavily promoted by Ross Perot, the former Presidential candidate.
This opposition, Mr. Clinton told the labor leaders, "has become the symbol of the legitimate grievances of the American working people about the way they've been worked over the last 12 years."
"I have got to lay a foundation of personal security for the working people of this country and their families in order to succeed as your President, and you have to help me do it," the President continued.
Later, speaking to a group of California business leaders and politicians, Mr. Clinton described the reception he received from the labor convention as "an interesting encounter" and launched into another defense of the plan.
He received a considerably warmer reception from the delegates when he turned to other items on his domestic agenda, including his opposition to a proposition on the California ballot that would allow the state to finance private school tuition.
Mr. Clinton said he objected to the proposal, Proposition 174, because he said it would divert government funds to parents of private school students who already had the money to pay for their children's education. Proponents have argued that the measure would improve public schools by enhancing private competition and making the education system more flexible.
"I can tell you this is not the way to get it done, and the people will regret this if we pass it," he said.
And the President tried to mend political fences in California by offering up a package of new economic incentives that would free Federal money to repair interstate highways damaged in the 1989 earthquake in the San Francisco area. The plan would send $36 million to Stanford University for the development of a high-energy physics center and provide $109 million in housing grants for the state.
 
Opposition in California
 These announcements were intended, in part, to slow the growing opposition to the trade agreement in California. The accord is widely perceived by politicians here as a job loser for the nation's most populous state.
But Mr. Clinton presented his support for the accord as a necessary ingredient in a formula to resolve entrenched national problems.
"We have to struggle to redefine a new balance between security and change in this country, because if we're not secure we won't change," he said. "And if we don't change, we'll get more insecure, because the circumstances of the world will continue to grind us down."
"And that's what makes this such a difficult time," he added, "because we have to rethink so many things at once."

HEADLINE: Poverty in U.S. Grew Faster Than Population Last Year

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 4

 BODY:
Despite the end of the recession, the number of poor people in the United States increased last year by 1.2 million, to 36.9 million, increasing three times as fast as the overall population, the Census Bureau reported today.
The number of poor people was higher than in any year since 1962, when John F. Kennedy was President. In that year, of course, the nation's population was much smaller, and the poor accounted for a larger proportion of the total population: 21 percent in 1962, as against 14.5 percent last year. 
 Census Bureau officials and economists said the rise in poverty last year reflected lingering unemployment and a slow recovery from the last recession, which ran from July 1990 to March 1991.
The poverty rate last year was three-tenths of a percentage point higher than in 1991, and it was the highest since the 15.2 percent level recorded in 1983.
 
Many Parallel Data
 At the same time, the Census Bureau reported that the number of Americans without health insurance rose 2 million last year, to 37.4 million. President Clinton has repeatedly cited such statistics in asserting that the Federal Government should guarantee health insurance coverage for all Americans.
The new poverty data reflect trends already evident in other statistics. Unemployment last year averaged 7.4 percent, up from 6.7 percent in 1991, the year the recession ended. The number of people receiving food stamps climbed steadily, to 26.6 million in December 1992, from 24.9 million in December 1991. And the number of people on welfare, in the program known as Aid to Families with Dependent Children, rose to 14 million in December 1992, from 13.4 million in December 1991.
Daniel H. Weinberg, chief of income and poverty statistics at the Census Bureau, said many analysts had predicted a drop in poverty last year after the recession ended.
Household income, after adjusting for inflation, declined last year in the Northeast, but was virtually unchanged in other regions and in the nation as a whole. But nationwide, a series of small declines from 1989 to 1992, cut the real purchasing power of the typical household's income by $2,000, to $30,786 in 1992.
 
Black Couples Not Immune
 Overall, the number of poor Americans rose 3.3 percent last year, while the total population rose just 1.1 percent.
For years, the Census Bureau has been saying that the high poverty rates for blacks resulted, in part, from the breakup of many black families. But last year the bureau also found a significant increase in the poverty rate for black married couples, to 13 percent from 11 percent.
A family of four was classified as poor if it had cash income less than $14,335 last year. A family of three was poor if its income was less than $11,186. The official poverty levels are updated each year to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index. Though living costs vary widely across the country, the poverty level is the same nationwide.
As defined by the Government, income includes wages and salaries, Social Security and welfare payments, but does not include the value of food stamps, Medicare, Medicaid or health insurance provided by employers. Counting these noncash benefits would make the poverty rate seem lower but would not change the trends in poverty observed in recent years, Census Bureau officials said.
Household income declined last year in 14 states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The poverty rate rose in 33 states, including Connecticut and New Jersey; in New York it was unchanged at 15.3 percent.
 
More Poor Children
 Mississippi, Louisiana, West Virginia and New Mexico had the highest poverty rates. Delaware, New Hampshire, Utah, Connecticut and Virginia had the lowest.
The Census Bureau found a slight increase in poverty among young children. Twenty-five percent of those under 6, and 21.9 percent of those under 18, were poor last year. Nearly half of black children under 18 were poor.
Clifford M. Johnson, policy director at the Children's Defense Fund, said the new data showed that "poor children are more likely to suffer extreme poverty than ever before."
Last year, 47 percent of all poor children -- 6.8 million of the 14.6 million poor people under 18 -- lived in households where incomes were less than half of the official poverty level.
"The rich clearly did get richer" from 1967 to 1992, Mr. Weinberg said. But he found some preliminary evidence to suggest that the trend toward greater inequality in the distribution of income, after accelerating in the early 1980's, had begun to slow.
Offering historical perspective, the Census Bureau said that the poverty rate fluctuated between 11.1 percent and 14.2 percent from 1967 to 1981. It peaked at 15.2 percent in 1983 -- the highest since the 17.3 percent recorded in 1965 -- and then declined to 12.8 percent in 1989. It has risen each year since then, to 13.5 percent in 1990, 14.2 percent in 1991 and 14.5 percent in 1992.
 
'Safety Net' Is Credited
 Wendell E. Primus, a deputy assistant secretary of health and human services, said the new data "show that Government programs are helping reduce poverty."
Poverty rates, excluding the value of Government assistance, increased significantly from 1991 to 1992, Mr. Primus said. "But after taking into account Government programs like Social Security and Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the poverty rate was not significantly higher in 1992 than 1991," he said.
"The rate did not go up nearly as much in the latest recession as in the 1980-82 recession, partly because safety-net programs were better used, and we didn't cut benefits as much under President Bush as under President Reagan," Mr. Primus said.
The data in the report are drawn from interviews with 60,000 households chosen to be representative of the entire population.
In its report, the Census Bureau also made these points:
*The poverty rate for children under 18, listed at 21.9 percent last year, was the highest since 1983 and was nearly as high as in 1964, when it stood at 23 percent. It was in 1964 that President Lyndon B. Johnson declared his War on Poverty.
*In 1992, only 47.2 percent of poor people were covered by Medicaid, the Federal-state program for low-income people. In many states, the income limit for those seeking Medicaid is substantially below the official poverty level. In some states, it is difficult for poor people to get Medicaid if they have no children.
*Among poor people 16 years old and over, 40 percent worked in 1992, and 9.2 percent had full-time jobs throughout the year.
 
And the Rich Got Richer
 Using a new measure of economic well-being, the Census Bureau reported that the condition of the most affluent families improved substantially in the last 25 years, while the condition of the least affluent families appeared to stagnate.
The most affluent one-fifth of all families had incomes averaging 8.4 times the poverty level in 1992, as against six times the poverty level in 1967. By contrast, the least affluent one-fifth of all families had incomes averaging 91 percent of the poverty level in 1992, down from 97 percent in 1967.
The 33.3 percent poverty rate for blacks last year was nearly three times the 11.6 percent rate for whites, the Census Bureau said. The rate for Hispanic people, who may be of any race, was 29.3 percent last year. For Asian Americans, it was 12.5 percent.
Whites account for two-thirds of the poor, even though their poverty rate was lower than the rates for Hispanic people and blacks.
The South, which has for years had a higher poverty rate than other parts of the nation, was the only region in which the rate increased significantly last year. The poverty rate was 16.9 percent in the South, 14.4 percent in the West, 13.1 percent in the Middle West and 12.3 percent in the Northeast. Forty percent of all poor people live in the South.

HEADLINE: Dinkins or Giuliani? Voters Equally Unimpressed

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Four weeks before Election Day, the race between Mayor David N. Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani remains a tossup. Fewer than half of voters trust either candidate to deal with New York City's problems and nearly half are concerned that each might make serious mistakes, according to the latest New York Times / WCBS-TV News poll.
In a bitter rematch between two well-known contenders, the electorate is strikingly unenthusiastic about both. Just 38 percent of voters expressed a favorable opinion of the Democratic Mayor, while a scant 31 percent had a favorable view of his Republican-Liberal challenger. About as many voters viewed each candidate unfavorably as viewed him favorably. 
 Mr. Dinkins held a slight edge, drawing the support of 44 percent of voters polled to 41 percent for Mr. Giuliani, and 2 percent for George J. Marlin, the Conservative and Right-to-Life Party candidate. But the Mayor's lead is within the poll's margin of error and thus statistically insignificant. Moreover, a national study of the vagaries of polling in racially mixed contests has shown that when black candidates led white ones by fewer than 8 percentage points in pre-election polls, chances are they had no lead at all.
At the same time, there were new danger signs for the Mayor: his support among Jewish voters has slipped to 23 percent, from one-third in May, and to 21 percent among white voters overall, down from 27 percent. Many such voters have apparently shifted to the undecided column, which now stands at 12 percent, compared with 7 percent last spring.
Mr. Dinkins won the last election by 2 percentage points with 35 percent of the Jewish vote and 27 percent of the overall white vote, and his aides have long held that he needs at least one-quarter of the white vote to win. No previous Times poll has found his support among Jewish voters so close to his support among whites as a whole. Coming at the end of three weeks of largely favorable publicity for Mr. Dinkins, beginning with his victory in the Democratic primary and including a visit from President Clinton, that is not encouraging.
"In the end, what's amazing about this race is it was close, it is close and it's going to be close," said Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. "The number Dinkins now has for whites is below a winning number for him. But it's a plague on both their houses. It's clear people do not find as many reasons to vote for the candidate of their choice as to vote against the other guy."
Despite the voters' entrenched views, the race remains volatile. One-third of Giuliani voters said they might change their minds, compared with just one-quarter of Dinkins supporters, and only 38 percent of Mr. Giuliani's voters strongly favor him, compared with 55 percent of Mr. Dinkins's backers.
The findings suggest risks and opportunities for each candidate, and make voter turnout, field organization, debates or last-minute events more important than ever in determining the outcome.
The telephone poll was conducted Sept. 29 to Oct. 3 -- the same period in which the Mayor began broadcasting his first television commercials attacking Mr. Giuliani's record. The poll included 1,223 adult city residents, of whom 804 said they were registered to vote. The margin of sampling error for voters was plus or minus four percentage points.
 
Hevesi and Green Ahead
 In the other citywide contests, Assemblyman Alan G. Hevesi of Queens led former Representative Herman Badillo, 48 percent to 31 percent, for city comptroller, while Mark Green led Councilwoman Susan D. Alter, 58 percent to 19 percent, for public advocate.
The poll contained some glimmers of good news for Mr. Dinkins. It suggested that his support among Hispanic voters has crept back up a bit, with 48 percent now backing him compared with 36 percent for Mr. Giuliani, although the margin of sampling error for this subgroup is plus or minus 9 percentage points, which means they could be roughly tied, as some other polls have suggested. In 1989, Mr. Dinkins won two-thirds of the Hispanic vote, compared with one-third for Mr. Giuliani.
The Mayor also appeared to have reopened the gap between male and female voters, and now has the support of 46 percent of women, compared with 36 percent for Mr. Giuliani, who held a slight edge among women last spring. And the Mayor's overall job rating has crept up slightly in the last six months, with 46 percent of registered voters approving of his performance in office and 44 percent disapproving, compared with 40 percent approval and 47 percent disapproval in May. That suggests the Mayor's advertising and campaign speeches around town stressing his record may have had some effect.
"To me, what this shows is that this thing is going to go down to the wire," said the Mayor's campaign manager, Bill Lynch, who said he was still optimistic that the Mayor could regain some of the white voters who have drifted away. "Turnout is obviously going to be key, and we've got to have a big vote-pulling operation out there. What we need to do for the next month is just keep working hard to get our message out there of the Mayor's accomplishments the last four years and of his vision for the future, versus Mr. Giuliani's non-record."
 
An Improvement for Giuliani
 Four years ago at this point in the race, most polls showed Mr. Giuliani trailing by double-digit margins. His chief strategist, David Garth, said: "My feeling is, considering the boom the Mayor's had the last couple of weeks, I think it puts us in a very good position, frankly. When you're within the margin of error, it's a very strong spot."
Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Giuliani had a clear edge among the voters on only one issue each. Three-fourths said Mr. Dinkins cared about the needs and problems of average New Yorkers, compared with 58 percent for Mr. Giuliani; while 68 percent said Mr. Giuliani was tough enough to deal with crime, compared with just 40 percent for the Mayor -- who has presided over the largest police hiring program in the city's history.
On almost every other personal attribute or issue facing the city, the poll found the electorate more evenly divided or with each candidate holding just the barest edge. Nearly half said each had strong qualities of leadership. Nearly 7 in 10 voters rated the local economy as bad, and one-quarter of voters polled said that if Mr. Dinkins was re-elected it would get worse, compared with 14 percent for Mr. Giuliani. But 21 percent said the economy would improve if Mr. Dinkins won, compared with 28 percent for Mr. Giuliani, and more than 4 in 10 said it would stay the same no matter who won.
Asked whether they were concerned that Mr. Dinkins, if re-elected, might make serious mistakes in office, 46 percent said yes. The figure was the same for Mr. Giuliani.
Sixty percent of voters said past Republican administrations were most to blame for lost jobs in the city, compared with just 16 percent who blamed Mr. Dinkins -- an argument the Mayor makes often. But 61 percent also said it makes no difference whether the President and the Mayor are of the same party -- negating an argument that Mr. Dinkins has tried to make into a cornerstone of his campaign.
Just over 20 percent said race relations would get better if Mr. Dinkins was re-elected, while just under 20 percent said they would get better if Mr. Giuliani won. One-quarter said race relations would get worse under Mr. Giuliani, while 18 percent said they would get worse under Mr. Dinkins. Most voters -- 55 percent for Mr. Dinkins and 44 percent for Mr. Giuliani -- said relations would stay the same whoever won.
Yet the poll showed that questions of race permeate the contest, and views of the candidates remain starkly polarized along racial lines. Mr. Dinkins had the support of 91 percent of black voters, compared with 2 percent for Mr. Giuliani, while Mr. Giuliani had the support of 61 percent of whites, to 21 percent for the Mayor.
Mr. Dinkins's favorable rating among whites is now just 16 percent, half what it was in June 1989, when he was a candidate for the Democratic nomination, while 54 percent of whites now view him unfavorably, three times the number of four years ago.
Voters were evenly divided -- and strictly along party lines -- over President Clinton's assertion that people are "still too unwilling to vote for people who are different than we are." Fifty-three percent of Dinkins backers said that was accurate, while 54 percent of Giuliani supporters said it was not.
 
Impact of Crown Heights
 The official state report issued in late July on Mr. Dinkins's handling of the black-Jewish violence in Crown Heights in 1991 appeared to have taken its toll. In May, when voters were asked to name the worst thing Mr. Dinkins had done in office, no answer stood out. In the current poll, 20 percent cited Crown Heights. Yet two-thirds of voters, the same as in May, continue to say that in conflicts between blacks and Jews, Mr. Dinkins had treated both sides fairly.
Crime remains the problem New Yorkers most want the next mayor to focus on, though nearly twice as many voters -- 46 percent -- cited this as a major problem as did so four years ago. None of the next most-cited issues -- not education, homelessness, unemployment, the economy or drugs -- was mentioned by even 10 percent of voters. Sixty-one percent of voters said the city was less safe than it was four years ago, yet 44 percent said they see more police in their own neighborhoods and 13 percent cited hiring more police officers as the best thing the Mayor had done.
Polls are merely a snapshot, and none can predict turnout or last-minute shifts in voter sentiment.
One obvious question is how Mr. Dinkins can have lost substantial support among every major voting group except blacks between now and the last election and still remain roughly within his previous margin of victory. The answer is that in the latest Times poll, some voter groups on balance favorable to the Mayor -- like Hispanic voters and women -- were represented in the electorate in slightly greater proportion than they were four years ago, while others -- like Jews -- were slightly less represented.
That may or may not accurately reflect the current electorate. The Times's sample was chosen randomly, weighted to reflect current census data, and respondents were then asked if they were registered voters, but there is no way to say with certainty who will vote on Nov. 2.
Allocating undecided voters further underscored the closeness of the mayoral contest. When those who initially expressed no preference in the trial heat were asked if they leaned toward either candidate, and were then added to the supporters of the candidate they mentioned, the trial heat became 47 percent for Mr. Dinkins and 44 percent for Mr. Giuliani.
When, following recommendations by analysts at the Gallup Organization, the remaining undecided voters were allocated to the candidate of their same racial group, the trial heat then tightened into an exact tie -- 48 percent for Mr. Dinkins and 48 percent for Mr. Giuliani.
One of the biggest uncertainties for Mr. Dinkins is whether white voters are unwilling to state their true preferences in a contest in which a black candidate is running, or whether pollsters are somehow otherwise unable to obtain an adequately representative sample because of some voters' refusal to answer questions.
In recent years, polls have frequently overstated black candidates' standing, compared with the actual results, and in 1989, Mr. Dinkins was leading substantially in late polls, only to win by just two points.
 
 
How the Survey Was Conducted
 The latest New York Times/WCBS-Tv News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Sept. 29 to Oct. 3 in all parts of New York City with 1,223 adults, 804 of whome said they were registered to vote. Interviews were conducted in English or Spanish.
 The telephone exchanges called were selected by a computer from a complete list of city exchanges. The exchanges were chosen to insure that each area in the city was represented inproportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus including both listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated at random to respond to the survey.
 The results have been weighted to take account of household size and number of telephone lines into the residence, and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to borough, race, sex, age and education.
 In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on suchsamples would differ by no more than 3 percentage points in either direction from a poll of al adult New Yorkers.
 For smaller subroups, the potential sampling error is larger. For example, it is 4 percentagepoints for all registered voters, 5 for white registered voters, 7 for black registered voters, and 9 for Hispanic registerd voters.
 Besides sampling error, the practical difficulties of ocnducting any opinion survey may introduce other errors. Differences in the wording and order of questions, for instance, can cause results to vary somewhat.

In WPIX vs. MSG, Benches Have Cleared

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir

 BODY:
Once upon a time, the MSG Network and WPIX-TV/Channel 11 got along quite nicely. Their executives claimed to be friends. They even had a three-year deal that made non-cable homes happy: MSG, which controls the rights to all 150 locally televised Yankees games, bought the time to put 50 of them on WPIX.
But that amity expired on Sept. 24. Now, as hopes flicker that MSG and WPIX will make a new deal to keep Yankees games on free TV, war has broken out.
"They're making it impossible to make a deal," said Michael Eigner, general manager of WPIX. Yesterday, he released a 31-page analysis of MSG's deal with the Yankees that WPIX says is irrefutable evidence of MSG's reluctance to make a deal with the station. MSG called it all nonsense. 
 "We're disturbed that WPIX, in the midst of negotiations, would distribute erroneous and misleading information about the MSG Network's financial picture," said Bob Gutkowski, president of Madison Square Garden, parent of the network. "It is unreasonable that WPIX would attempt to do a profit-and-loss statement on the MSG Network with no accurate knowledge of our numbers."
The WPIX treatise says that when MSG claims to have lost oodles on this deal, the network is not telling the full truth. Eigner did not offer to release the profits of WPIX, which is owned by Tribune Broadcasting. He said WPIX is making money.
Said Gutkowski: "MSG would be willing to submit to an independent audit of our profits if WPIX would submit to the same audit to show its profits."
Negotiations ended in late August, yielding little except mutual rejection of each side's suggestions, including one that WPIX buy 50 games a year from $15.3 million in 1994 to $18 million in 2000. MSG says those charges are not a penny more or a penny less than what they pay the Yankees in their nearly $500 million deal with the team through 2000.
WPIX says that's not fair, and hence their unseemly battling.
MSG does not want to repeat its misbegotten WPIX deal, which it wanted in 1991 but now regrets. The network says it has lost $22 million on the deal, including $7.5 million in 1993. By paying WPIX an average $93,000 a game to put 50 games annually on WPIX, MSG retained control over game advertising on its own network and on WPIX, a situation it found preferable to selling games to WPIX and letting the station compete for Yankees ad time.
WPIX claims to have lost on the deal, too, because it sold its time to MSG for one-third it would get for selling advertising on movies. "If you came off the street, those three hours would cost you $300,000," Eigner said.
In the WPIX world, MSG really made money but omitted from their calculation one large source of revenues: subscriber fees. MSG leveraged Yankees baseball to doubling its subscribers to 5 million since 1989, and for increasing the fees cable subscribers pay to get the service. WPIX calculates that 5 million subscribers pay $1 a month for six months of Yankees baseball, or $30 million.
The Yankees' acquisition has been so potent, WPIX's Eigner said, that by increasing subscriber rolls and fees, MSG's total subscriber revenues have increased by $46 million a year since 1988.
Because one-third of the 150-game package appears on free, over-the-air WPIX -- a channel that is a staple of local cable systems, which brings substantial and valuable exposure to the less available MSG -- Eigner reckons that one-third of the fees, $10 million, would offset the $7.5 million loss and produce a $2.5 million profit.
But MSG's Gutkowski said: "If we don't have games on the MSG Network, we don't charge subscribers fees for it. It's like saying, 'WPIX, you lose a little on the Yankees, but what do you make on those other shows?' "
WPIX's tortuous calculations also conclude that MSG made $8 million on its 150-game package this year.
MSG isn't hiding the fact that it wants to recoup from WPIX some of the money it paid to Boss George. By unsuccessfully demanding of WPIX a six-year rights fee that escalates to $18 million in 2000, it is seeking an (over)payment at precisely the per-game rate MSG now (over)pays Steinbrenner.
An offer by Douglas Moss, the president of the MSG Network, cited per-game fees that rise from $305,640 in 1994 to $368,300 in 2000. Those figures are within a few dollars of what WPIX alleges are the per-game charges MSG pays to Steinbrenner.
"They know we won't pay that," said Eigner. He said the fallacy with MSG's arithmetic is that games airing on MSG generate twice the revenue (because of the subscriber money) than those on WPIX, and should be valued at a lower rate than games on MSG in any offer to WPIX.
In 1989 and 1990, when WPIX paid the Yankees between $10 million and $11 million for rights to 75 games a season, its per-game fee was more like $133,000 than $300,000. "That was economically feasible," he said.
Eigner took his case yesterday to a city official, Bill Squadron, commissioner of the Department of Telecommunications and Energy.
And Gutkowski is saying: Let's go to the independent audit.
Can't anybody here make a deal?

HEADLINE: Too Rich a Soil: Scientists Find the Flaw That Undid the Biosphere

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
THE major flaw in the $150 million Biosphere 2 project has been discovered by a leading geochemist and his student, raising questions of whether the venture in the Arizona desert will be corrected in the interest of serious science or will be doomed to repeated cycles of failure in the years ahead. In theory, the experiment is to last 100 years.
A mysterious decline in oxygen during the two-year trial run of the project endangered the lives of crew members and forced its leaders to inject huge amounts of oxygen, spoiling the idea of a self-contained ecosystem that was supposedly a way to learn about living in space. 
 The cause of the life-threatening deficit, scientists now say, was a glut of organic material like peat and compost in the structure's soils. The organic matter set off an explosive growth of oxygen-eating bacteria, which in turn produced a rush of carbon dioxide in the course of bacterial respiration.
The main mystery was where this carbon dioxide was going, since so little of its calculated mass was found in the dome air.
The scientists who solved the riddle were Dr. Wallace S. Broecker, a geochemist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University in Palisades, N.Y., and one of his graduate students, Jeff Severing haus. Late this summer the two found that the missing carbon dioxide had been absorbed by the concrete that forms and lines the structure's interior. The 110,000 square feet of exposed concrete has a surface area greater than two football fields.
"The oxygen is disappearing because they were arrogant and put five to 10 times more organic matter in the soil than you'd get outside," Dr. Broecker said in an interview. "They made a fundamental day one mistake.
"Our assessment is that this decline will continue for decades," he said, unless major steps are taken to correct the mistake, like replacing all or most of the soils in the domes. All told, the soil weighs 30,000 tons.
Dr. Broecker advises the Arizona group but gets no fee, he said, in order to avoid the perception that his opinion is shaded in any way.
 
Search for Solutions
 Dr. John Corliss, the recently appointed scientific director of Biosphere 2, which is outside Tucson, said in an interview that the group was still considering options for dealing with the soil trouble, ranging from replacing the overly rich loam to doing nothing but continuing to pump tons of oxygen into the domes. Most of the possible actions would involve minor changes, he said, at least for the immediate future.
"My assumption is that we'll go ahead with the second mission the way it is," he said. "We're searching for ideas that might be alternatives to taking the soil out."
The next experiment in human habitation is scheduled to begin Feb. 26 and to last one year. The shorter period of occupation -- one year versus two -- in itself will lessen the severity of the problem since the decline in oxygen becomes more severe and dangerous over time. The crew of men and women for the new mission has yet to be selected, although a group of candidates is now training at the Arizona site.
During the two-year trial run, which ended Sept. 26 amid celebratory fanfare, four men and four women gasped increasingly thin air inside the 3.15 acres of glass domes. Beginning in January, then again in August and September, project officials injected 23 tons of pure oxygen into the sprawling glass bubble to avoid a medical emergency, raising levels from a low of 14 percent oxygen to the normal 21 percent.
Work on Biosphere 2 (project officials refer to Earth as Biosphere 1) began in earnest around 1984, financed by Edward P. Bass, the Texas billionaire and oil heir. The plan was that human inhabitants would thrive in a miniature world whose environmental cycles were powered by an ocean, rain forest, marshland, desert and farm. Everything would be recycled. Most importantly, the project sought to show that humans could for the first time create a life-support system that was totally self-sufficient and esthetically pleasing -- sort of a new Eden.
Despite its New Age overtones, the project was promoted as highly scientific. Its officials were quick to note the prestigious talent hired to get things under way, including the Smithsonian Institution's Marine Systems Laboratory, the New York Botanical Garden's Institute of Economic Botany and the University of Arizona's Environmental Research Laboratory.
 
Delicate Atmospheric Balance
 The university laboratory used powerful computers to predict how various combinations of plants, animals and soils would affect the structure's atmosphere. Dr. Robert J. Frye, a senior researcher there, said in an interview that all his mathematical models assumed that the agricultural soils would contain 4 or 5 percent organic matter -- what he called "representative figures" for standard enrichment.
Dr. Frye said that some project officials "wanted to use much higher amounts" and that an important issue in discussions was whether bacterial respiration would upset the atmospheric balance. Those questions, he said, "came up frequently in meetings." Limited to giving advice, the university laboratory apparently had little idea that the enrichment of some soils would turn out to be quite high.
As Dr. Frye remarked: "I don't think anybody here ever said, 'This is going to explode on you,' in a formal way, simply because our involvement was very small."
But other experts say the red flags were plentiful. "A lot of people warned them," said Dr. Mary W. Olsen, a plant pathologist at the laboratory who advised the project.
John Allen, the leader of the ecology project, has previously noted the importance of rich compost and soil microbes to decomposition. In a 1991 book, "Biosphere 2: The Human Experiment," published by Penguin, he wrote: "Bacteria help recycle nutrients. Without them, dead animals and plants would simply pile up until Biosphere 2 became a large heap."
 
High Level of Organic Matter
 The actual soil of the newly built structure, Mr. Allen wrote, was "rich in microbes." The all-important agricultural soil, he noted, was 70 percent dirt, 15 percent peat and 15 percent compost -- that is, about 30 percent organic matter, far higher than the university laboratory assumed in its calculations.
The first crew was sealed inside the structure in September 1991, along with 3,800 species of plants and animals. Things went downhill fast. Most distressing was the declining oxygen, which, after the repair of a faulty sensor, was measured as steadily going down throughout 1992.
Abigail Alling and Mark Nelson, two crew members, wrote in "Life Under Glass: The Inside Story of Biosphere 2," published last month by the Biosphere Press: "This drop in oxygen was particularly startling because during all the Test Module experiments we had never experienced a fall in oxygen levels. Nor had it been reported by other life-support facilities, so it had not been an area anyone in the field considered critical."
The outside experts were put on the problem in May 1992. The rich soils were immediately suspect. Dr. Broecker of Lamont-Doherty gave the riddle to his graduate student, Mr. Severinghaus, who for months struggled to find the missing oxygen or its metabolic byproduct, carbon dioxide. One suspect was urine. The original dirt, from a nearby pond, contained dung and urine from cattle, and the experts thought that perhaps urea in the urine was somehow responsible for the drop. It was not.
Many other theories were later tested and rejected, including one that the carbon dioxide was reacting directly throughout the soil to form calcium carbonate, the material found in limestone and caves.
Finally, Mr. Severinghaus's father, Dr. John W. Severinghaus, a high-altitude physiologist at the University of California at San Francisco, suggested in a telephone call to his son that the structure's concrete might be soaking up carbon dioxide from bacterial respiration. And so it was.
 
Tests Support Theory
 Careful tests of the hypothesis were done by the son this spring and summer. Concrete samples from inside and outside the structure showed strikingly different levels of calcium carbonate, which was rapidly being formed inside the domes as huge amounts of carbon dioxide reacted with calcium hydroxide in the concrete.
"Their concrete is dripping with it," Mr. Severinghaus said of the calcium carbonate. "It's 10 times more than outside."
Dr. Broecker and Mr. Severinghaus say the reaction increases the concrete's acidity, weakening it and creating a danger that reinforcing bars will eventually start to erode as the carbon dioxide works its way deeper.
The obvious cures, the scientific team says, are to paint the interior concrete with a nonporous coating and replace the offending soils, steps that would bring the project to a halt for months or perhaps years as fauna and flora are removed and then painstakingly reintroduced.
"Biosphere 2 management should take a very deep breath, start over, clean out all the topsoils, replace them with soils that are more representative of natural soils, and make a serious attempt to balance the carbon budget," Mr. Severinghaus wrote the group Sept. 22. "Although starting over seems like a lot of work now," he added, "in the long run, 10 years from now, it will more than pay for itself in a system that truly works instead of a lame one we are dealing with now."
Dr. Corliss, the project's scientific director, who joined the group this year, said many possible solutions were being considered, including painting the concrete and replacing some soils, although perhaps just those in the farming area.
Other possible solutions are to find new plant species that might soak up carbon dioxide faster, or perhaps to add a layer of dense soil that would block the flow of gases in and out of soil. "The question is whether we can slow down the rate," Dr. Corliss said.
The decision of the moment, he added, is simply to keep pumping in more oxygen and to do detailed studies of the concrete to see how fast it is being transformed.
Dr. Broecker said the original error occurred because the group was led by environmental zealots who chose the intuitive wisdom of organic gardening over scientific advice. Even so, he said, he still felt sympathy for the members of the project. He said they had done fairly well, considering the challenging goals they had set.
"It's not easy to think of all the possible things that could go wrong," he said. "Anybody else would have made equally bad blunders, but different ones. Over all, I'd give them an A-minus."


GRAPHIC: Researchers found that the Biosphere's oxygen shortage was connected with the microbe-rich soil under the dome. Oxygen-dependent bacteria produce carbon dioxide, which reacts with the calcium hydroxide in concrete to produce calcium carbonate. Abnormal levels of calcium carbonate were found in the dome's extensive concrete structures, confirming the diagnosis. (Sources: Dr. Wallace S. Broeker and Jeff Severinghaust/Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory) (pg. C10)

MAYORAL RACE IS A TOSSUP
Four weeks before Election Day, the race between Mayor David N. Dinkins and Rudolph W. Giuliani remains a tossup. Fewer than half of voters trust either candidate to deal with New York City's problems and nearly half are concerned that each might make serious mistakes, according to the latest New York Times / WCBS-TV News poll.

HEADLINE: In Real-Estate Slump, Some Owners Are Donating Buildings

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
It sounds like a bad one-liner: The market for commercial real estate in New York City is so bad, they're giving it away. But in isolated cases, it's true.
The latest example came last week, when a pair of Minnesota investors donated a 15-story office building at 30 West Broadway, in Manhattan's financial district, to the City University of New York. In June, General Electric donated the 50-story Art Deco masterpiece at 570 Lexington Avenue, at 51st Street, to Columbia University. 
 A close look at the situation at 30 Broadway demonstrates that the current market is so anemic that the owners of some buildings, particularly those more than 30 years old, are better off giving away real estate than trying to coax out a profit. "I won't be surprised if more owners decide to do this," said Bruce Surry, managing director of the Edward S. Gordon Company.
Just how many more is uncertain. Like the planets, the factors that make a donation economically sensible align themselves only rarely. The building must be empty or nearly so, and need modernization, and there must be a willing recipient who can use such a gift. It helps if the owner lacks either the resources or the patience to lose money for a while.
 
A Grim Situation
 Facing the departure of their sole tenant, Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, a heavy tax burden, the need for millions of dollars in renovations, and stiff competition in a renter's market, the owners of 30 West Broadway faced grim financial prospects. By some estimates, the landlords, Miles and Shirley Fiterman of Minneapolis, could expect to lose $40 million or more over the next year or two if they kept the building, and somewhat less if they tried to sell it.
"The charitable option may just have been the best for them, economically," said Peter R. Hauspurg, president of Eastern Consolidate Properties, a real-estate investment firm.
Experts were quick to add that they did not question the philanthropic instincts of the Fitermans, who have made previous charitable contributions worth millions of dollars. Miles Fiterman made a fortune in the 1960's selling do-it-yourself home building kits.
Among landlords in similar straits, some are overhauling their buildings to remain competitive, analysts noted, others are mothballing their properties, both betting that the slump will end and commercial real estate will become profitable again.
For the City University, the gift of the 375,000-square-foot structure is an unqualified windfall that will, at a single stroke, solve both an acute space shortage at the Borough of Manhattan Community College and worries about how to pay for more room. The building will become a secondary campus for the two-year community college, relieving the strain on the school's primary home four blocks away, at 199 Chambers Street, where nearly 17,000 students crowd a building designed for 10,000.
 
Paying Off the Mortgage
 Mr. Fiterman said he would pay off the $8 million mortgage on the property, giving it to the university free and clear, even though he could simply abandon the building and not be responsible for the mortgage.
University officials said the offices were easily converted to classrooms, so the cost of adapting the building will be relatively small. To build a new home of similar size would cost the university, at a conservative guess, about $112 million, said Robert I. Shapiro, president of City Center Real Estate. Analysts said that to rent the building, without any improvements, would have cost at least $5.5 million a year.
"This is a New York City miracle," Borough President Ruth W. Messinger said at a ceremony Thursday marking the transfer of the building, which has been renamed Miles and Shirley Fiterman Hall.
The deal came together remarkably quickly, following a late July overture by the university, which was interested in leasing the building, but concerned about the cost. In mid-August, after meeting with the University Chancellor, W. Ann Reynolds, the Fitermans agreed to the donation. Some of its office space was turned into classrooms in just three weeks, in time for the start of classes on Sept. 10.
The building, built in 1959 and bounded by West Broadway, Park Place, Barclay Street and Greenwich Street, sits on the original site of King's College, the precursor to today's Columbia University.
 
A Question of Value
 The actual value of the building depends on who is doing the counting. University officials said it is worth $30 million, based on an independent appraisal done this summer, making it the most valuable gift in the institution's history. The city assesses it for property taxes at $24,225,000. But real- estate professionals said its value to the Fitermans is far less, as is the price it would fetch on the open market.
"The values of a lot of these buildings if you try to sell them is perilously close to zero," Mr. Hauspurg said.
Another analyst, who asked that his name not be used, said the building, which the Fitermans bought in 1979 for $10 million, might sell for as much as $2 million if they were fortunate.
Even at that price, experts said, they would lose money on the sale, because the Internal Revenue Service would demand that the Fitermans pay income taxes on the depreciation allowances -- a form of tax deferral -- the owners have taken on the building. The I.R.S. also demands taxes on depreciation when a building is given away, but a donation could have another tax advantage, as a deduction for a charitable contribution.
Analysts agreed that with 20 million square feet of vacant office space in downtown Manhattan, the Fitermans would have had to undertake major renovation of the building to attract a tenant. Their estimates of the cost ranged from $12 million to $35 million. An overhaul could take a year or more, and in that time, the Fitermans would collect no rents and would continue to pay off the mortgage and nearly $2.6 million in property taxes.
Timing is also crucial.
"A lot of leases are going to expire in the next two years," Mr. Hauspurg said. "If the market doesn't pick up, you'll see a lot more owners looking at this option."

HEADLINE: Cuomo Picks Investment Banker For Municipal Assistance Post

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Oct. 4

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo today appointed Eugene J. Keilin, a Manhattan investment banker and longtime associate of Felix G. Rohatyn, to succeed Mr. Rohatyn as chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation.
Mr. Rohatyn announced his resignation last month from the agency he helped form 18 years ago to pull New York City from the brink of bankruptcy. When bankers closed the credit markets to the city in 1975, the state formed the corporation as a vehicle to borrow on the city's behalf. It continues to manage a large investment portfolio on the city's behalf, and its nine-member board oversees the city's finances in an advisory role. 
 Since the corporation's founding, it has served as a sturdy soapbox for Mr. Rohatyn, whose opinions on city finances shaped budgets and spending priorities over two decades. Whether the 51-year-old Mr. Keilin will carry similar influence remains to be seen.
 
'A Seamless Transition'
 For much of Mr. Rohatyn's tenure at the Municipal Assistance Corporation, Mr. Keilin served at his right hand. "He will provide a seamless transition from the superb leadership of Felix Rohatyn," Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. Mr. Keilin was traveling today and could not be reached for comment.
In 1976, Mr. Rohatyn plucked Mr. Keilin from the New York City Office of Management and Budget, where he was general counsel, to become executive director of the corporation. He worked there until 1979, when he left to join Lazard Freres & Company, where Mr. Rohatyn is a partner. He also was named a member of the corporation's board, which is appointed by the Governor with the consent of the Senate.
At Lazard Mr. Keilin developed a specialty in advising unions on buyout bids. He represented the Air Line Pilots Association in deals involving Frontier, United, Eastern and Trans World Airlines. He left the concern in 1990 to form his own company, Keilin and Bloom. Last year, he represented unions at The New York Daily News that were seeking buyers for the bankrupt paper.
A native of Houston, Mr. Keilin graduated from Rice University and Harvard Law School.
 
Director of Housing Is Named
 Also today, Mr. Cuomo appointed State Senator Donald M. Halperin of Brooklyn as state director of housing and Commissioner of the Division of Housing and Community Renewal.
Mr. Halperin, a Democrat who has served in the Senate since 1971, recently lost a race for his party's nomination for Public Advocate in New York City. He finished fifth out of six candidates with 8 percent of the vote. The race was won by Mark Green.
The 48-year-old Mr. Halperin will succeed Angelo J. Aponte, who resigned to join the investment banking firm of M. R. Beal. He will receive a salary of $100,528 a year, a raise from the $72,500 he received for his service in the Senate.
First elected at the age of 24, the youngest person ever elected to the Senate, Mr. Halperin will leave as the third most senior Democrat.

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TOKYO, Oct. 4

 BODY:
Japanese car makers may not meet their pledge to buy $19 billion worth of American auto parts in 1994-95 because of the economic climate, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said today.
"I cannot say we can achieve that figure," the association's chairman, Yutaka Kume, said at a news conference. He said that with the domestic economy in recession and the high yen inhibiting exports, times were hard for Japanese car makers. 
 In January 1992, the Japanese industry said it would buy $19 billion worth of parts in the fiscal year that begins in April 1994, including those for use in Japanese-owned plants in the United States.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS: A Mill for High-Grade Pulp;
Giving Recycled Paper A New Chance to Shine

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Not many mills can turn the waste paper pouring out of the nation's offices into high-quality pulp for recycling. That weak link in the recycling chain gets a little stronger today with the opening of Superior Recycled Fiber Industries' $76 million mill in Duluth, Minn.
"There are some larger plants that turn office waste into low- grade papers like tissue and some big higher-quality de-inking facilities attached to paper mills, but this will be the largest high-quality pulp producer for the open market," said Gerald Ostroski, president of Synertec Inc., which is Superior's majority owner. Synertec is a subsidiary of the Minnesota Power and Light Company. 
 Superior expects to take in 120,000 tons of waste annually, about 6 percent of the roughly two million tons of office waste collected for recycling nationwide. The waste will go through eight wash cycles to convert it to pulp for blending into coated paper used in annual reports, as paper stock by magazines like Time and for advertising inserts of mass merchants like Target stores.
Demand from such users has encouraged five nearby paper companies to sign up for nearly three-quarters of Superior's output. At current prices, they will pay up to 20 percent more than for virgin pulp, Mr. Ostroski said. But because virgin pulp will still account for as much as 90 percent of the finished products, the premium for the recycled portion will not add much to the users' costs.
Synertec will buy waste from as far away as Dallas, at least until more is collected closer to home. Most office waste -- about 90 percent, according to some estimates -- still goes directly into landfills or incinerators.
The company also said it had held preliminary discussions on building a second plant for high-quality recycled pulp. But don't look for it anywhere near cities like New York that generate most of the waste. "The economics favor making the pulp near the papermakers," Mr. Ostroski said.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Little Changed

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Treasury prices and yields were little changed yesterday with light volume and cautious trading ahead of the release of September employment data on Friday.
The end to the fighting in Moscow seemed to have little impact in the bond market or other financial markets because, some analysts said, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia seemed to be in control despite the bloodshed. 
 In fact, bond markets in Europe ended a little higher. In Frankfurt, after a selloff early in the trading day, the market recovered after reports of people leaving the Russian Parliament building. The 10-year Treasury note ended at a yield of 6.08 percent in Frankfurt, down from 6.10 percent Friday. In London, the 10-year note yield fell to 6.88 percent, from 6.90 percent Friday. The yields on short-term notes also declined
In trading at 5 P.M. yesterday in New York, the price of the 6.25 percent 30-year bond was off 4/32 point as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6 percent, from 5.99 percent Friday.
 
 
10-Year Note
 The yield on the 10-year note fell to 5.32 percent from 5.33 percent. The yields on short-term Treasury notes were a little lower as some investors may have bought them because they were a less risky investment than long-term maturities. The price of the two-year note was up 1/32 as the yield fell to 3.81 percent from 3.83 percent.
But at the weekly auction of Treasury bills, the discount rates were up sharply. The average discount rate on three-month bills was 2.96 percent, up from 2.90 percent last week, and the average rate on six-month bills was 3.08 percent, up from 3.02 percent.
Beyond Russia, the focus was on the wait for the September employment data. In this report, investors and traders hope to find clues to the near-term outlook for the economy. If economic expansion is still sluggish, and the Consumer Price Index report for September due a week later shows moderate inflation, there could be enough buying to push prices higher and yields lower again.
 
 
Chrysler Rating
 The Standard & Poor's Corporation raised the Chrysler Corporation's senior debt rating yesterday to investment grade.
Chrysler is now rated investment grade by all the major credit rating agencies for the first time in more than three years.
But traders and investors in the corporate bond market have been trading Chrysler at investment-grade prices and yields since around June, according to Geoffrey Kurinsky, a senior vice president at Massachusetts Financial Services in Boston.
He said that since then the spread between the yield on Chrysler bonds and comparable Treasury securities had been in a range that is equivalent to other investment-grade bonds.
The rating agencies often tend to lag behind the market "rating" of a company, in part because the rating agencies are taking longer views of financial developments in a company.
S.& P. cited the timely introduction of well-designed new products, improved operating efficiency enhancing competitiveness and financial results that have far exceeded expectations in raising its rating to triple B from double B+. Triple B is the bottom of the investment-grade category.
The upgrading will lower borrowing costs for Chrysler because there is less risk in owning the company's debt securities. With less risk, investors will accept lower interest rates.
The rating change by S.& P. affects about $12.8 billion in outstanding debt. Moody's Investors Service Inc. raised its rating to the investment-grade level of Baa3 from Ba2 on Sept. 7. Both S.& P. and Moody's had downgraded Chrysler to junk bond, or sub-investment-grade, level in June 1990.
 
 
Chrysler Financial
 In addition to this rating change on Chrysler's senior debt, S.& P. raised the subordinated debt rating of Chrysler Financial and the preferred stock rating of Chrysler to BBB- from BB-.
Scott Sprinzen, an S.& P. analyst, said in a report that he had upgraded the company because "well-designed and fortuitously timed new products, coupled with steps to improve operating efficiency, have enhanced Chrysler's competitive position."
For example, he said, Chrysler pushed ahead plans to begin second-shift production of its new Neon subcompact to Nov. 28 from May of next year.
Chrysler, which reported a loss of $795 million for 1991, earned $723 million last year; for the first six months of 1993 it earned $1.2 billion.

HEADLINE: Mexico Will Phase Out Price Supports for Corn

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Oct. 4

 BODY:
Mexico said today that it would phase out its politically sensitive system of price supports for corn and other crops and replace it with direct payments to farmers based on the amount of land they cultivate.
Mexican officials called the new system a "transitory scheme" that would last for 15 years and was intended to lead to the development of more economically competitive farms. The program is meant to complement an economic stimulus package of tax cuts and wage increases that Mr. Salinas announced on Sunday. 
 The 15-year period coincides with schedules for eliminating protection on corn and other sensitive products listed in the North American Free Trade Agreement. If the trade accord is approved, the last tariff on American-grown corn coming into Mexico would be lifted in 15 years, the longest period for any product covered by the pact.
Mexican officials said the subsidy program, announced today by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, complied with all terms of the trade pact, as well as with the free-trade requirements of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
 
Mexico's Basic Bread
 Mexico, more than most Latin American countries, has developed extensive agricultural subsidies. They cost the Government more than $3 billion a year and cover several basic commodities. The primary one is corn, which is consumed daily in the form of tortillas or other food by nearly every Mexican. About three million farmers throughout the country plant corn, even though much Mexican land is poorly suited for its production.
The subsidies hold down the price of tortillas and are thus as much a political matter as an economic one. While the current system is intended to help consumers and poor farmers, it allows well-to-do farmers with well-irrigated land to switch to corn and take advantage of the price supports. Poor farmers who grow corn only for their own use and do not sell it do not benefit.
About four million farmers who have grown corn or any of eight other grains over the last three years will be part of the new program, though there will be limits on the biggest farmers. Payments will be made on the basis of the number of acres under cultivation.
For example, a farmer with 20 acres of corn now sells his crop to a government buyer for more than $200 a ton, about twice the international price, and the total amount he receives would depend on how much corn he succeeds in producing on his land.
 
Influencing Choice of Crops
 Under the first year of the new system, that same farmer would receive about $50 an acre a year for each of his 20 acres regardless of the size of his harvest. In the future, the payment will increase and the farmer would not even have to continue growing corn to receive the money.
Mexican agricultural officials say this will allow farmers to grow crops that are best suited for their land or for the market.
But Steven E. Sanderson, an agricultural expert at the Center for Latin American Studies at the University of Florida in Gainesville, said there was little chance that the program would work that way.
"The poorest people with the crummiest land don't have much flexibility, regardless of the incentives," he said.
Basing the new program on the ownership of about 28 million acres of land is expected to cause political problems, even social unrest, because land claims have been a flash point since the Mexican Revolution of 1910.
"There will be conflicts, we cannot deny that," said a Government agriculture official who asked not to be identified by name. He said a program to verify land claims would be established, and in cases where poor owners could not produce title to their land, claims will be determined by local councils.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Lower As Some Global Jitters Ease

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar dropped against most major currencies yesterday as Boris N. Yeltsin triumphed over Russian hard-liners, easing investors' fears of an interruption in Russia's transition to a market economy.
Currency dealers said the dollar rose in early trading in Asia on reports of armed troops and gun battles in Moscow. But as Mr. Yeltsin's forces gained the upper hand, investors felt they no longer needed to hold dollars, traditionally considered a haven during political turmoil. 
 "It's very much a headline-driven market," said Matt Porio, a vice president at the Chase Manhattan Corporation. Once Yeltsin's foes surrendered, he said, "we saw a selloff of the dollar."
Margaret Kudarauskas, a foreign exchange analyst for the Technical Data analysis firm, said many traders had stocked up on dollars on Friday amid uncertainty about what would happen over the weekend in Russia.
The dollar lost nearly a pfennig yesterday against the German mark, which investors had earlier avoided because of that country's economic ties and proximity to Russia.
With the Russian turmoil apparently quieted, traders said their attention would turn to economic fundamentals, notably the United States jobs data due out on Friday.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 106.00 yen, down 0.38 yen from Friday's close. Later in London, it fell to 105.75 yen, compared with 106.05 on Friday. In New York, the dollar finished at 105.65 yen, down from 105.90 yen on Friday.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.5165, from $1.5050 late Friday. In New York, the pound was trading at $1.5140, up from $1.5050 on Friday.
Other dollar rates in New York late yesterday, compared with late Friday, were: 1.6235 German marks, down from 1.6315; 1.4190 Swiss francs, down from 1.4240; 5.6645 French francs, down from 5.6930; 1,588.00 Italian lire, down from 1,593.00, and 1.3413 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3379.
Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday, were: 1.6230 German marks, down from 1.6308; 1.4165 Swiss francs, down from 1.4240; 5.6560 French francs, down from 5.6875; 1.8222 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8211; 1,587.00 Italian lire, down from 1,591.00, and 1.3395 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3388.

HEADLINE: SHOWDOWN IN MOSCOW;
'Dear Compatriots': Yeltsin's Appeal to the People

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of yesterday's televised speech to the nation by President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, as translated by The Associated Press.
 Dear compatriots: 
I am turning to you at this difficult moment.
 Shots are thundering in Russia's capital and blood has been spilled. Fighters who have been brought from the whole country and have been incited by the White House leaders are sowing death and destruction.
 I know that it was a sleepless night for many of you. I know that you have understood everything.
 This troubled and tragic night has taught us a lot. We did not prepare for a war. We hoped that we could reach an agreement and preserve peace in the capital.
Those who moved against the peaceful city and unleashed the bloody massacre are criminals.
 But it was not just a crime committed by individual bandits and vandals. Everything that happened and is happening in Moscow -- it was an armed revolt planned in advance. It was organized by Communists seeking revenge, by fascist leaders and some of the former deputies -- representatives of the Soviets.
 
'Cynical Lies'
 Under the cover of negotiations, they have been building up their forces, gathering groups of mercenary bandits used to murders and violence. A tiny group of political conspirators has tried to impose its will on the entire country.
 The means they intended to use to control Russia have been revealed to the whole world. These are cynical lies and bribes. These are rocks, sharpened iron bars, automatic rifles and machine guns.
 Those waving red flags have once again covered Russia with blood.
 They hoped to use surprise, to sow fear and confusion with their impudence and unprecedented ruthlessness.
 They hoped that the military would stay away calmly and watch defenseless Muscovites be persecuted and a bloody dictatorship be established in our country.
 They hoped that the citizens of Russia would believe their lies. They hoped for a fast victory.
 For them and for those who gave them orders, there can be no forgiveness, because they lifted their hand against peaceful people, against Moscow, against Russia, against women, children and old people.
 The armed revolt is doomed. Troops are entering Moscow to restore order, peace and quiet.
 Their task is to liberate facilities seized by the criminals, to lift the blockade around them, and to disarm illegal armed groups.
 I am asking you, dear Muscovites, to give your moral support to boost the spirits of the Russian soldiers and officers. They belong to our national army and police. They have one task today: to defend our children, to defend our mothers and fathers, to stop and neutralize the rioters and murderers.
 Moscow and Russia are awaiting your courage and decisive action.
 
'The Decree Was Signed'
 The public organizations that took part in mass disorders and other unlawful actions are banned on the entire territory of Russia. The Central Bank has been instructed to immediately stop all operations involving their bank accounts. The Prosecutor General's office has been told to open a criminal investigation into the facts of mass disorders.
 The decree that calls for these measures and others was signed overnight and is already being implemented.
 I appeal to all political forces in Russia. For the sake of those whose lives have already ended, for the sake of those whose innocent blood has already been spilled, I appeal to you to forget your internal disputes that seemed important yesterday.
 All those who value peace and quiet, the honor and dignity of our country, and all those who are against war must stay together.
 I am appealing to the citizens of Russia. The armed fascist-Communist revolt in Moscow will be suppressed in the shortest possible time.
 The Russian state has all the forces necessary for it.
 
'I Consider It My Duty'
 I consider it my duty to turn to Muscovites. In the past day and night, our numbers have grown smaller. Let us bow to those who perished.
 Many of you followed the call of your hearts and spent last night in the center of Moscow, [guarding] the far and near approaches to the Kremlin. Tens of thousands of people risked their lives.
 Your will, your civic courage, your moral strength have proved to be the most effective weapon.
 I bow to you from my heart.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Which companies will suffer if tourists steer clear of Florida?

BYLINE: By Andrea Adelson

 BODY:
INVESTORS reacted to a spate of recent attacks on tourists in Florida by temporarily punishing the shares of the Walt Disney Company, on the assumption that some vacationers would stay away from Disney's theme parks in Florida. In the weeks since, other companies with ties to the state's $30 billion-a-year tourist business have braced for a similar backlash.
Because the fall is generally a slack period for Florida attractions, there is little evidence yet that the number of annual visitors, about 40 million, will decline. Even so, tourism officials and some amusement park operators expect the blizzard of negative publicity over the 10 visitors who have been killed in Florida since last October will curtail visits by 15 to 30 percent this winter and possibly hurt bookings thereafter. 
 Some leisure companies with ties to Florida may be large enough, or so geographically diverse, that they have little to fear. Even a 10 percent drop in car rentals will not depress General Motors' earnings, said one broker who advised against short selling any rental companies. G.M. has stakes in the Avis and National car rental agencies.
"They are spread out like ants," agreed Chase Burritt, a partner with Kenneth Leventhal & Company, real estate consultants in Tallahassee. "None will see earnings impact."
Other companies may be more vulnerable if tourism falls. Hotel consultants and tourism experts say other companies that could be hurt are American Airlines, which has a hub in Miami; USAir, which has the most service between Florida cities, and midpriced hotel chains like Holiday Inn and Choice Hotels' Quality and Comfort Inns, which cater to international tour groups. Nine of the 10 victims were foreigners.
A more speculative suggestion comes from Michael Murphy, editor of the Overpriced Stock Service, a newsletter in Half Moon Bay, Calif., that ferrets out stocks that he expects to decline.
"In general, when you're trying to play a geographic area, play the bank," Mr. Murphy said. "The health of a bank is totally intertwined with the economy."
Since he expects Florida tourism to decline, Mr. Murphy predicts that Barnett Banks, the state's largest bank company, will see a decline in its share price to the low $30's by late December. Barnett closed yesterday at $45.125, up 25 cents. "That's the only one we've shorted," he said.
Like many bank stocks, Barnett's share price has climbed over the last year. Industrywide, earnings have been buoyed by low interest rates and investors have been anticipating even greater profits because of the cost savings that resulted from a wave of consolidations.
Barnett, with $38 billion in assets, earned $104 million in the first half, up 66 percent from a year earlier. The company, based in Jacksonville, saw a 14-year streak of consecutive earnings gains end with Florida's real estate collapse in 1989. The bank has since trimmed its portfolio of bad loans, cut costs and merged with First Florida Banks.
Violence aimed at tourists could hurt Barnett by further depressing Florida real estate values and cutting the cash flow of the bank's business customers, Mr. Murphy said.
John Godfrey, Barnett's chief economist, dismissed the bearish prediction as premature, since tourism has not yet fallen off. "There's not any evidence of it happening yet," he said.
During most of September, when three fatal attacks on Florida visitors occurred, Barnett's stock lagged behind a regional bank index, but caught up in the final week, according to George Salem, a banking analyst for Prudential Securities.
The stock activity shows "the stock had been affected earlier, but in the most recent week shrugged it off," Mr. Salem said, adding, "Enough damage has been done that it's a nagging issue."
He expects American travelers, as well as foreigners, will avoid Florida. "It's fear and it's real and it's vivid," he said.

HEADLINE: The Last Gasp Of Russia's Communists

BYLINE: By Richard Pipes; Richard Pipes, professor of history at Harvard, is author of "The Russian Revolution."

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
Now begins the arduous task of reconciling the Russian nation and building a democratic state on the rubble of Communism. The prospects for success look better than at any time since the abdication of Czar Nicholas II in March 1917.
Unless President Boris Yeltsin repeats previous mistakes and seeks compromises with his defeated enemies, who interpret readiness to compromise as weakness, we are unlikely ever again to see a resurgence of a militant antidemocratic opposition. The events of the past two days are probably the last outbreak of violent counterrevolution in Russia. 
 The weekend riots in Moscow were much bloodier than the unsuccessful putsch of August 1991, but no less desperate and futile. A small minority of diehard Communists, out of touch with reality, inspired by a vision of a revived Soviet empire and by the desire to regain their privileges, tried again and failed again to rally the masses behind them.
This time they were much better organized. Vice President Alexander V. Rutskoi, who fancies himself a modern-day Lenin, tried to re-enact October 1917. His tactics emulated those of Leon Trotsky in the original Bolshevik coup d'etat: disguise the anti-democratic offensive as a defense of democracy, negotiate while seizing power and strike at the nerve centers of the state (which today include television broadcasting stations).
But October 1993 is not October 1917, and we can only marvel at the ability of the self-styled parliamentarians to delude themselves.
One problem with Russia's political vocabulary -- such as "Parliament" and "Constitution" -- is that it parrots Western words that bear little relationship to reality.
The self-styled Parliament, actually the Supreme Soviet, is an offshoot of a body elected under President Mikhail Gorbachev, when there was a Soviet Union and a Communist Party to rule it. Neither exists today, and the membership of the Supreme Soviet, composed overwhelmingly of Communists, represents a state that has passed into history. The Constitution is a document from the 1970's. Amended more than 300 times, it has only historical significance.
It is absurd to talk of a coup d'etat by President Yeltsin, because the concept presumes an "etat," a state -- a generally accepted and functioning system of government. Russia has not had such a system since autumn 1991, when the party was outlawed and the Soviet Union disintegrated into its constituent republics.
The state has to be created anew, and this can be accomplished only by elections, which require the dissolution of the unrepresentative Supreme Soviet and its parent body, the Congress of People's Deputies.
The inhabitants of Moscow recognize this situation. An opinion poll conducted in Moscow two days after President Yeltsin dissolved the Parliament showed that 62 percent supported the measure while 12 percent opposed it; only 6 percent acknowledged Mr. Rutskoi's claim to the presidency. If we are to judge by referendums and opinion polls, at most one-tenth of Russia's population subscribes to the ideology of Mr. Yeltsin's opponents.
An exhaustive survey conducted in 1989 and updated in 1992 under the direction of the sociologist Yuri Levada showed that a mere 4.9 percent of the people yearned for their country's lost superpower status -- and only 4.1 percent believed that it was surrounded by external enemies. The majority want, above all, democracy, better living conditions and civil rights. Nearly 45 percent believe that Russia's misfortunes are caused not by external enemies but by its own faults.
These statistics indicate that a sea change has occurred in the Russian psyche. In 1917, the masses could be rallied behind utopian visionaries of various ideological persuasions because they thought it possible to attain a perfect society and believed that Russia would show humanity the way. Today, Russians no longer believe that politics, least of all violent politics, can solve human problems or that Russia leads the world in anything except crime and the consumption of alcohol.
They have become thoroughly depoliticized. For this reason, the slogans with which the parliamentary opposition tried to arouse the masses fell on deaf ears. In Moscow, the diehards succeeded in assembling mobs of a few thousand embittered Communists and anti-Semites. In other cities, including St. Petersburg, they met with no response.
The failure of the antidemocratic forces was a foregone conclusion -- except for two unpredictable factors: Mr. Yeltsin's personality and the armed forces' loyalty.
The President combines courage and pugnacity with a tendency to fall into apathy after winning a fight. Desperately anxious to avoid dividing Russia into warring camps, he retreats when he should be advancing to consummate his victory. This he did after the August 1991 putsch and again after the referendum of April 1993, in which his proposals for new presidential and parliamentary elections and for economic reforms were solidly supported. This time, fortunately, he decided to act resolutely by meeting force with force.
Although the armed forces declared loyalty to Mr. Yeltsin, there was no assurance that they would obey orders to fire at civilians. The sympathies of most generals, almost to a man ex-members of the party, lie with Mr. Yeltsin's opponents, who promise to restore Russia's empire and return to the army its privileged status.
Some fraternization between the internal security forces and the rioters on Sunday gave cause for concern. Nevertheless, in the end the officer corps proved true to Russia's military tradition of obeying legitimate authority, and routed the armed rebels.
This is not an unmitigated good, because while Mr. Yeltsin's dependence on the military might have saved him, it may compel him to conduct a more nationalistic foreign policy than he would if he were free of it.
Mr. Yeltsin, one hopes, will continue to act firmly and adhere to his program of two-tiered elections: in December for the new Parliament, in June for the presidency.
Judging by what we know of Russian opinion, the likelihood is that he will win a comfortable majority, perhaps as much as two-thirds of the deputies. Another 10 percent may be expected to consist of members of the uncompromising nationalist and Communist opposition. The remaining 25 percent will probably represent the floating constituency of those who think of the past with nostalgia and yet realize that it is gone beyond recall, and are willing to promote democracy and privatization.
Western statesmen have acquitted themselves splendidly in this crisis -- much better than in August 1991, when, uncertain how definitive the collapse of Communism was, some held back support from Mr. Yeltsin.
In coming months, Western governments should continue to extend unstinting support -- moral, diplomatic, economic -- to those who have just brought Russia back from the brink of disaster.

HEADLINE: Tremors in Cuba Bending Exiles' Hard Line

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Oct. 5

 BODY:
As Cuba's economic and political crisis deepens, exiles here are reaching out to their kin on the island as never before by sending aid, exchanging visits and seeking their advice on how to ease Fidel Castro from power.
The monolithic core that once dominated exile politics is splintering, and moderates are emerging as a vital new force among Cuban-Americans. Convinced that Mr. Castro's fall is imminent, exiles here have plunged into an impassioned debate over how to bring down his 34-year dictatorship without inflicting further hardship on Cuba's 11 million people. 
 "There is a change in the air," said Maria Elena Torano, a business consultant active in both exile and local politics. "Something is happening. We don't know how it is going to end, but there is a new sense of freedom to speak up."
In place of a single organization, one that claimed to speak for all 1.2 million Cuban-Americans and preached unrelenting hostility toward Cuba's Communist government, new groups now openly urge negotiations. Thousands of exiles, responding to the pleas of family members still in Cuba, have defied calls to starve the island into submission and are sending money and supplies through the scores of shipping agencies that have sprung up here.
Still others have responded to Mr. Castro's recent invitation to exiles, whom he once spurned as "worms" and "scum," and are visiting their families in Cuba. New flights making the Miami-Havana run are booked weeks in advance, and relatives of top Cuban officials have also come to seek out moderates here to discuss ways the two groups can cooperate.
This war of words and ideas is being monitored in Havana and Washington. American officials say more flexibility on the part of Miami exiles would make it easer to deal with the crisis in Cuba, and the Cuban Goverment increasingly regards the prosperous exile community here as a source of financial and material support for an economy near collapse.
Although both Governments deny anything has changed in a hostile relationship that is one of the last vestiges of the cold war, exile groups here of every ideological stripe say the momentum for a transformation is building. Last week, the United States Government announced that Cuba had agreed to accept the forced repatriation of up to 1,500 Cuban prisoners being held in Federal prisons, an action that came shortly after Havana handed over to the Drug Enforcement Administration a pair of cocaine traffickers who had eluded American helicopters and fled into Cuban waters.
Since the Soviet Union disintegrated, Mr. Castro has been forced to do without billions of dollars in subsidies. As a result, food and fuel are increasingly scarce, the population now spends much of its time foraging for supplies, and discontent with the Government has grown increasingly open.
With the prospect, if not the reality, of change, "the crisis of Cuba is a crisis here as well," said Lisandro Perez, director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University. "The discourse in Miami has always been one of hostility and isolation," he added, but now "you get alternate positions emerging."
He labeled the sides "those who say 'Let's try something different' " and "another side which says, 'No, just hold on, and things will happen.' "
 
Exile Leadership Is Splintering
 During the Reagan and Bush years, exile politics were monopolized by the Cuban American National Foundation and its leader, Jorge Mas Canosa, a multi-millionaire contractor with a penchant for questioning the patriotism of his opponents. With generous donations to Republican presidential candidates and key members of Congress from both parties, the foundation, founded in 1981, gained entree to the White House and came to exercise a virtual veto power over American policy toward Cuba.
With the advent of the Clinton Administration, the foundation's stock dropped sharply. Hoping to capitalize on the opening, a coalition of business executives, academics and other professionals who say they represent "the moderate or progressive sector of the Cuban-American population" in August formed the Cuban Committee for Democracy to provide an alternative to the foundation.
The new coalition brings together several groups that have emerged here in recent months, including Cambio Cubano, led by a former guerrilla commander and political prisoner, Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo. The coalition also has ties to exile leaders in Spain and with dissidents still in Cuba.
"There are a whole bunch of people disturbed by the fact that a small group of Cubans here have been able to convince Washington that their views represent the totality of Cuban-American opinion," said Alfredo Duran, a Miami lawyer who is a founder of the coalition and a former state chairman of the Democratic Party.
A year ago, Mr. Duran said, it would have been pointless to form such a group. "But now there is a willingness to listen to new views" in Washington, he said, while at the same time "Cuba is in a position to be easily influenced to bring about change."
For years, the foundation and its allies have pushed the United States to tighten the screws on Mr. Castro, mainly through the economic embargo in effect since the Kennedy Administration. The apparent objective is to provoke a popular uprising or military revolt that would enable exile leaders like Mr. Mas to return to Cuba and perhaps even succeed Mr. Castro.
But the newly invigorated moderate groups oppose punitive economic steps, arguing in the Cuban Committee for Democracy manifesto that "such measures harm the living conditions of Cubans without affecting the present Communist leadership." In addition, the manifesto expresses a "willingness to meet with representatives of the present Cuban Government" as a step toward negotiating Mr. Castro's departure from power.
The foundation camp, which remains dominant and continues to regard itself as a sort of government-in-exile, has responded to those suggestions with a mixture of alarm and contempt. Mr. Mas has a policy of not responding to inquiries by The New York Times, saying through a spokesman that he regards the newspaper's reports of Cuban affairs since the mid-1950's as sympathetic to Mr. Castro. He did not return phone calls asking for comment on the changing political situation here.
But his allies, including most Spanish-language radio stations here, have fulminated against suggestions of a new approach. Arguing that any call for dialogue only prolongs the agony of the Cuban people, they have questioned the motives of the moderates and threatened to punish them in a post-Castro Cuba.
"Many of them serve Fidel Castro, while others are simply accomplices or collaborationists," said Armando Perez Roura, director of Radio Mambi, a Spanish-language radio station. "No honest person with any level of political development can believe the promises of third-rate Cuban bureaucrats.
 
Families Come First For Many From Cuba
 For many ordinary Cuban exiles, though, worries about the living conditions of relatives on the island now seem to carry more weight than demands for ideological purity.
"I feel disoriented," said Jesus Menendez, a retired factory worker who left Cuba for Miami three decades ago but who has never given up his dream of returning. "I no longer believe either the politicians or the people in exile."
Dozens of freight companies now dot the Miami area and, for $10 a pound or more, ship packages of food and medicine to Cuba. Under American law, exiles are permitted to send up to $300 worth of such items to close relatives in Cuba every three months, a loophole in the embargo that exiles exploit with a combination of relief and guilt.
"You don't want to help Fidel, but you feel sorry for your family, and you don't want them to have to suffer," Maria Pinera Suttles explained as she left one such company recently. "It's like you are torn between two desires."
Mrs. Suttles, 46, and her mother, Zoila Pinera, 86, said that as often as they were able, they sent packages containing sugar, cereal, coffee, vitamins, aspirin, toothpaste, powdered milk, peanut butter and beef jerky to Mrs. Pinera's two sisters in Cuba.
But other exiles argue that it is wrong to put personal concerns above the national interest.
"I won't send anything, not a single cent, to Cuba," said Aldo Schwerert, 65, a mechanic. "I have a 94-year-old father and two sisters still over there, and they've asked me, but I have sent them nothing because I am an anti-Communist. Those places are only playing Castro's game."
Nevertheless, Mr. Schwerert made his comments after coming out of one of the same freight companies he said he would like to see shut. He said that despite his own opposition, his wife, Estela Martinez, insists on sending packages to her relatives, and that he had come to inquire about one such shipment.
Hungry for hard currency, Mr. Castro this summer announced that Cubans could now own dollars and urged exiles to visit Cuba. Despite a campaign in Miami to discourage such trips, including bumper stickers that read "I'm Not Going to Cuba" and "No $ For Cuba," the first flights permitted under the new rules began leaving here in September, with every seat taken and a waiting list for future bookings.
 
New Arrivals Versus the Old
 The debate over humanitarian aid and travel has intensified political differences among exiles. The exile establishment, which for the most part arrived here in the early 1960's, has done well in business, and generally has fewer close relations on the island. The newer arrivals, who tend to be poor and less educated, include the 125,000 refugees who fled Cuba in the Mariel boat lift of 1980, as well as the growing number of "balseros," or "rafters," who have resorted to that even more dangerous form of escape in the past five years.
Many of the newer refugees say the first wave of exiles has a vision of Cuba that is, by turns, romantic, intransigent and hopelessly outdated.
"I was born into Communism, and lived through it in my own skin," said Jorge Luis Velazquez, a 31-year-old chauffeur who left Cuba in 1991, leaving behind his mother and daughter, who he helps support with occasional packages of food, medicine and clothing. "I know what it is like over there. These people do not."
For their part, some established exiles are suspicious of the new arrivals, questioning why they waited so long to break with Castro.
"There are dozens of people arriving here now who are really seeking exile from the next government of Cuba," said Tomas Garcia Fuste, a prominent radio commentator. "We know that there are people here who have done bad things over there and think that they are better off being here when the Castro regime falls."
Hard-liners admit they are worried that Washington may soften its stance on Mr. Castro now that a Democratic Administration is in office. Already, the Clinton Administration has liberalized guidelines on humanitarian aid and travel to Cuba by American citizens and offered Havana a new telecommunications agreement that would provide Cuba with tens of millions of badly needed dollars each year.
Though encouraged by what they see as subtle indications of a lessening of hostility in both capitals, the moderate exiles say they are fearful that events on the island are developing faster than Washington's ability to absorb them.
Mr. Duran of the Cuban Committee for Democracy, said, "There doesn't seem to be a plan for what to do to bring about democracy in Cuba." The Clinton Administration, he said, seems to be "in a position to react to something, but not in a position to bring about change in an orderly way."
Many moderates are forging their own network of contacts with Cuban officials they see as likely to play a role in a post-Castro era.
Several close relatives of senior members Cuban Communist Party officials recently visited Miami on tourist visas and sought out exile leaders who favor dialogue, according to people who have taken part in such conversations. In several instances, the relatives have returned to Cuba with letters or verbal messages from exile groups here.
"There are people in Cuba in the government who are very concerned" about the disintegration of Cuban society, said one prominent exile figure who has received emissaries from Havana, speaking on condition that he not be identified. "They are looking for changes too."

HEADLINE: WORLD MORATORIUM ON NUCLEAR TESTS IS BROKEN BY CHINA

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 5

 BODY:
Rejecting a plea from President Clinton, China exploded a nuclear weapon at a test site beneath its western desert today, breaking an informal testing moratorium. In response, the Administration ordered preparations for a resumption of American tests.
"The United States deeply regrets this action," Mr. Clinton said in a statement issued this morning after receiving reports that the Chinese had set off a nuclear device in Xinjiang province. Mr. Clinton added that he had "directed the Department of Energy to take such actions as are needed to put the U.S. in a position to be able to conduct nuclear tests next year." 
 The action comes when relations between the United States and China were already in rough water over China's record on human rights, weapons sales and nuclear proliferation issues. Early this summer, the Administration reluctantly agreed to extend China's favored trading status, but only for one year.
 
Crucial Issue
 Dee Dee Myers, the White House press secretary, said today that nuclear non-proliferation "is one of the issues on which our relationship with China depends."
While Mr. Clinton today set in motion plans that could lead to the first nuclear test by the United States since September 1992, the Administration by law must win approval from Congress before exploding a nuclear bomb. And the President placed a number of stringent conditions to be met before the United States could resume its nuclear testing program.
Mr. Clinton's response reflects internal divisons in his Administration over the wisdom and the need for the United States to resume nuclear testing.
Officials from the Pentagon and the National Security Council, as well as some from the State Department, have argued that if other countries resume testing then so must United States, to make sure that its nuclear arsenal is being maintained safely. On the other side, officials from the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the Department of Energy say there is no need to resume detonations because the safety of the nuclear weapons can be determined without testing.
Administration officials also say there is intense concern that a resumption of nuclear testing by the United States would set off an international political chain reaction that could sink Mr. Clinton's efforts to secure an indefinite extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and to negotiate a comprehensive test ban treaty.
"With each additional test by any nation, whether it's France or Britain or China or the U.S., for that matter, the chances of getting a comprehensive test ban treaty are that much weaker," said a State Department official who asked not to be identified.
On July 3, after an intensive debate within the Administration, Mr. Clinton extended by 15 months a 9-month moratorium Congress had imposed on nuclear weapons testing. At the same time, he warned that the United States might resume testing if any other nation detonated a nuclear device.
Russia and Great Britain have said they would not resume testing unless the United States did. President Francois Mitterrand of France is awaiting a report from a panel of experts on whether French adherence to the moratorium would compromise France's nuclear weapons.
Early indications are that such a request would face rough going in Congress, where there is growing sentiment that the United States should apply economic pressure on China, rather than resume testing.
Officials say it is doubtful that the Administration would resume testing until sometime next summer, if at all.
A letter to the President being circulated on Capitol Hill by Senator Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, asks that the Administration hold up granting an export license for a Cray supercomputer and other "sensitive sales of dual-use advanced technology" ordered by the Chinese until Beijing guarantees that it will not conduct more nuclear tests.
Another letter circulated by Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, and Senator Mark O. Hatfield, Republican of Oregon, was signed by 24 Senators. It said it would be "inappropriate and counterproductive" for the United States to conduct a nuclear test in response to the one by China.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Experts See Maneuvering
 HONG KONG, Oct. 5 (Special to The New York Times) -- A statement issued late today by the official New China News Agency confirmed the test, but provided no details. "It is entirely for the purpose of self-defense that China develops and possesses a small number of nuclear weapons," the statement said.
China asked the nuclear powers to conclude a comprehensive test ban treaty by 1996, but also called for the commencement of a "parallel negotiation" to conclude a treaty in which nuclear powers would pledge no first use of nuclear weapons and not to use or threaten to use "nuclear weapons against non-nuclear states and nuclear-free zones."
Western analysts said China's unwillingness to heed international pressure over the nuclear test fits a pattern of recent Chinese behavior that is assertive and unaccommodating in its international relations. A number of analysts attribute this behavior to the pending leadership succession in China, where the country's longtime senior leader, Deng Xiaoping, recently passed his 89th birthday and is reported to be increasingly frail.
These analysts say they believe that the Chinese leaders under Mr. Deng are taking tough and uncompromising positions to demonstrate their qualifications to succeed him.

HEADLINE: THE SOMALIA MISSION;
CLINTON REVIEWS POLICY IN SOMALIA AS UNEASE GROWS

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 5

 BODY:
President Clinton met with his top advisers tonight to review the American role in the international military operation in Somalia. He sought to balance the need to remain in Somalia to recover American hostages with mounting calls from Congress for a clear withdrawal strategy and the President's own goal of putting Somalia on the road to recovery.
After a 90-minute meeting, during which the President reviewed options ranging from a quick pullout to a large-scale buildup of American forces in Somalia, Mr. Clinton told his aides he wanted to think more about the alternatives and asked them to reconvene Wednesday morning. 
 Aides said the President seemed to be tilting toward an approach that still focused on putting Somalia on a road to political recovery so an indigenous government could sustain and feed the country on its own. But the aides said the President was insisting on accomplishing this much more quickly and with a clear exit strategy that he could hold up to Congress.
 
Complications of Hostages

The deaths on Sunday of 12 American soldiers, the wounding of 75 others and the capture by Somali gunmen of at least one American soldier has thrown the Administration off balance, adding a layer of complications and crystallizing Congressional opposition.
"If we had a vote today, we'd be out today," Senator Robert Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, said. But, he added, "We can't get out with hostages there."
As hundreds of additional United States troops with special weapons and aircraft began heading to Somalia, a wave of hostility toward the widening operation swept Congress. The opposition led the White House to send Secretary of Defense Les Aspin and Secretary of State Warren Christopher to Capitol Hill to try to calm critics from the left and right of both parties and to beg lawmakers for additional time to draw up a new policy. [Page A16.]
 
Angry Legislators
 But Mr. Aspin and Mr. Christopher were besieged by skeptical lawmakers, who scorched them with demands for a clear road map for an exit from Somalia, coupled with bitter complaints that the policy goals were unclear or unrealistic.
It is not clear whether the critics can assemble sufficient votes to pass a law requiring Mr. Clinton to stop the operation. But Congressional anxiety, already high, has been fueled by a wave of constituents' telephone calls reflecting outrage over the prospect of a new hostage crisis, and television pictures of Somali crowds dragging a dead American servicemen through the streets.
Public sentiment appeared to be less in favor of exacting revenge and more in favor of simply leaving Somalia and letting the Somalis deal with their violent factions.
The leader of the most aggressive faction, Mohammed Farah Aidid, warned today that sending additional troops would solve nothing, and he urged Somalis to defend themselves against "colonialism."
After a meeting at the White House that included Mr. Aspin; Mr. Christopher; the United Nations representative, Madeleine K. Albright, and the national security adviser, Anthony Lake, aides said the President still seemed to be leaning away from the two extreme options, an immediate pullout or a major expansion of the American military presence.
 
What the President Wants
 His instinct, said one adviser, was to remain committed to building up a government in Somalia, but to do it in a way that American troops did not become the focus of local opposition.
At the same time, though, the United States has to find a way to negotiate the return of American prisoners without making a hero of General Aidid, whose limited popularity in Mogadishu could easily be enhanced if he appeared to be the strongman against the Americans.
The fact that General Aidid holds one or more American soldiers makes an immediate American withdrawal from Somalia impossible, officials said, while the mounting opposition in Congress makes any large-scale expansion much more complicated.
"I detect no inclination to pull out in a panicky reaction to this week's events," a senior Administration official said of the President's mood. "But we need to rethink it."
 
Resolve of Boutros-Ghali
 Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said the United Nations had to remain resolute in Somalia against those seeking to destabilize the nation. In a lunch toast to heads of state and governments at the General Assembly, Mr. Boutros-Ghali said:
"Those who were responsible for Somalia's collapse now seek to prevent Somalia's rescue and to destroy all that has so far been achieved. They must not succeed. We must show ourselves to be resolute and firm as we confront the challenges ahead."
But the call by Mr. Boutros-Ghali found little support on Capitol Hill.
Mr. Clinton was considering three basic options. One, now being urged by many in Congress, is to pull American forces off shore. The danger with that option, officials said, is that although the 4,700 American troops are just a fraction of the 28,000-member United Nations force in Somalia, they are its backbone, and it is highly likely that the whole peacekeeping force from 33 nations would collapse.
 
Possibility of Discredit
 Some 3,000 American troops perform logistics, providing water, food and transportation for all the other units. About 1,300 other Americans, bolstered recently by 400 Rangers, make up the Quick Reaction Force, which was intended to provide rapid support for other nations' peacekeeping units that found themselves under attack.
But the other argument against a quick pullout -- that the Administration would be discredited around the world and even at home -- is dismissed by some top Presidential advisers.
Their view is that the world understands very well the difference between vital American interests and ones like Somalia that are not vital. Therefore, even if the United States pulls out, no one would be misled into thinking that the United States is not ready to stand and fight when its vital interests are at stake.
When the Reagan Administration suddenly pulled out of the peacekeeping in Lebanon in 1982, many analysts argued that American credibility in the Middle East would never be the same. But as soon as Washington demonstrated its resolve in the Persian Gulf war, that perception vanished.
The second option, officials say, is to go to the other extreme and beef up the military presence in Somalia to a point where it can break the back of General Aidid's opposition movement.
The problem with that, a senior official said, is that it could effectively mean "going to war with Somalia in order to save Somalia."
"Clearly our goal has not changed -- that is, to restore order so that humanitarian relief can continue," the official said. "But given the active opposition of Aidid, what is involved in doing that is a much larger effort. We have to decide: do we raise the ante to meet him? And by raising the ante, do we increase the likelihood that we will be going to war against Somalia so that we can never really achieve our original goals?"
 
Examination of a Third Option
 Summing up the first two options, the official said, "In one case you kill Somalia by going to war to save it, and the other case you kill Somalia by not going to war to save it."
This leaves a third option, officials said, a new mix of political and military steps that would upgrade the American presence so that troops will be somewhat better able to protect themselves and provide a secure environment.
The head of the United States Central Command, Gen. Joseph Hoar, the overall commander of American forces in Somalia, met this afternoon for two hours with the Joint Chiefs of Staff to discuss Somalia. General Hoar counseled against dispatching many more troops, officials said.
One military option under consideration, though, is sending two additional Marine amphibious groups. That would involve 3,800 marines and several ships, but would certainly give American forces on the ground greater strength.
Judging from their public comments, the Clinton team is heading toward some variation of the third option. Mr. Christopher said today that with the attacks on United Nations forces over the weekend and American personnel missing, "it certainly is not the time for us to depart."
Mr. Christopher said the United States wanted to withdraw its forces when possible, "but not before our job is done of providing some security."
"At the same time," he added, "it is vital that a political solution be sought there."

HEADLINE: U.S. OFFICIALS HAIL YELTSIN FOES' ROUT

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 5

 BODY:
American officials expressed hope today that the defeat of President Boris N. Yeltsin's opponents in Moscow had swept aside the vestiges of the old Soviet system. But they said they remained unsure that the opening would make way for true democracy.
With their vision of a democratic Russia still embodied almost solely in Mr. Yeltsin, the officials said they recognized that the path toward democratization remained littered with obstacles within Russian society and perhaps presented by the Russian President himself. 
 In a telephone conversation with President Clinton today, their first since violence erupted in Moscow, Mr. Yeltsin renewed his pledge to hold free parliamentary elections on Dec. 12 and "to proceed resolutely on political and economic reform," a White House spokesman said.
 
A Sense of Relief
 Across the Administration, there was a powerful sense of relief today that Mr. Yeltsin had triumphed in his showdown, and that he had done so at a smaller human cost than was initially feared.
But an initial American headiness at Mr. Yeltsin's subduing of his foes was tinged with some apprehension about what lies ahead. Officials said they were concerned that in a country lacking a democratic tradition, the elections could be sidetracked, run into logistical problems or produce another parliament unfriendly to reform.
Clinton Administration officials said they would be watching particularly closely to see whether Mr. Yeltsin, who used Government television stations as an instrument in his standoff with Parliament, would prove willing to allow the press freedoms necessary for a fair ballot.
Today, Senator Claiborne Pell, Democrat of Rhode Island and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, made clear that such conduct would also be a focus of concern in Congress, which holds the purse strings on Russian aid.
Thomas Pickering, the American Ambassador to Moscow, today described the elections promised by Mr. Yeltsin as "a significant factor in whether he can institutionalize the new democracy in Russia." But he also spoke of "the wide-ranging views" continuing to divide Russia even after the quelling of the parliamentary revolt.
 
Envoy Expresses Confidence
 In a television interview, Mr. Pickering hinted at what remains the unspoken worry of American policy, expressing confidence in Mr. Yeltsin's leadership "if he maintains his democratic credentials."
Without election law, electoral districts or a political party system, Mr. Yeltsin's pledge to hold free and fair parliamentary elections by Dec. 13 will not be simple to fulfill. And while Clinton Administration officials continued to express confidence in the Russian President's commitment to reform, the events of recent days have served as an uncomfortable reminder of a leader who has displayed an unpredictable streak.
In the most optimistic scenario, the December elections will establish in Russia a new cadre of legitimate, democratic leaders, making it possible for Washington to grow less reliant on Mr. Yeltsin even before he convenes presidential elections in June.
But that outcome relies not just on Russian sentiment, but on Mr. Yeltsin's health, which has been far from perfect. And American officials said today that it would also depend on how quickly he was willing to relax the controls he had imposed on the news media and his political opponents.
At the State Department's daily briefing, a spokesman said the United States had "every indication from the Yeltsin Government" that the restrictions would be no more than temporary. As a sign of Russian intentions, Mr. Pickering and others said they took heart in Mr. Yeltsin's apparent decision to free all but the leaders among the parliamentary rebels in Moscow.

HEADLINE: The Deepest Dive Yet For Gulf of Mexico Oil

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS

 BODY:
The Shell Oil Company announced yesterday that it would spend $1.2 billion to bring into production a giant oilfield in the Gulf of Mexico, a project intended to push offshore-recovery technology to the deepest levels yet and to create 2,200 jobs, most in Texas and Louisiana, and thousands more among subcontractors in 34 states.
The announcement, made in Houston, was welcome news to the domestic oil industry, which in the last year has seen its drilling activity at the lowest level in decades amid falling prices for crude oil and a slowdown in the rate of increased demand for gasoline and other petroleum products. 
 The company said that in the first phase of the project, it hoped to recover about 500 million barrels of oil. It intends to begin production in 1996 at a daily rate of about 100,000 barrels of oil and 110 million cubic feet of gas.
"It's a very significant project," said Fred Leuffer, an oil analyst with Bear, Stearns & Company. "It's also going to be very profitable."
Indeed, the domestic oil industry has not seen a project of such size and technological challenge in about a decade and in the gulf in the last 20 years.
Still, Jack E. Little, executive vice president for exploration and production at Shell, said that such quantities would have only a small effect on oil imports. These now total more than seven million barrels a day and account for about half of American consumption.
The recession, and the slump in oil prices -- which are now near a four-year low, settling late today at $18.39 for benchmark West Texas intermediate crude -- have led to a prolonged decline in exploration, drilling, refining and related activity, with the loss of about half a million jobs.
Although it was well known within the industry that Shell had been working for years to prepare to develop the field in the Gulf of Mexico, the industrywide slump created uncertainty whether the company would go ahead with such a major project.
Over the last decade, Shell has been a pioneer in offshore development and has taken steps leading toward yesterday's announcement. Shell struck the huge field, called Mars, in 1989 on a block in the Mississippi Canyon, which is about 130 miles southeast of New Orleans. The company estimates that about 700 million barrels of oil can be recovered from the field.
Mr. Little said that by gulf standards, a field that yielded 100 million barrels was considered a giant find.
 
Other Efforts by Shell
 Shell Oil is building another platfrom in the Auger field in the gulf, at a depth of 2,860 feet, and at about the same cost. It estimates it will recover 250 million barrels of oil from the project, which was announced in 1989.
Mr. Leuffer, the Bear, Stearns analyst, said the Mars project would bring twice the oil for about the same investment, making it a very attractive venture for Shell.
He added that it could encourage other companies, notably Amoco, which have found oil in deep water in the gulf, to begin to extract it. And Mr. Leuffer said that British Petroleum, which has a 28.5 percent interest in the Shell project, would benefit, too.
"While the potential is very great, the challenge is also very great," Philip J. Carroll, the president of Shell Oil, said at a news conference yesterday at Shell's headquarters in Houston.
The development will be watched by the oil industry because Shell will install a tension-leg platform in a depth of 2,933 feet, the deepest offshore recovery platform yet. That is 203 feet more than if the two World Trade Towers stood one atop the other, and greater, too, than most other American skyscrapers.
Tension-leg platforms, made of steel and concrete, are anchored to the ocean floor by vertical tendons that eliminate up and down motion. Twenty-four production wells are to be placed on the platform. Once the platform has been built, a staff of about 25 will be needed to run it.
 
Vicissitudes of Geology
 The technology has been 10 years in the making and could enable companies to begin to get oil out of fields that had been thought too expensive and risky to develop.
The idea of a tension-leg platform was first explored about 20 years ago, but was not proved until Conoco built one in the Hutton field in the North Sea in 1984.
In addition, improvements in seismic reading have enabled Shell to go ahead. The geology at such deep ocean levels is different from that of fields in shallower water.
Mr. Little said that because of the greater depth and geological considerations, Shell would approach the Mars project in phases, adding, "Mars represents a departure from the way we have traditionally developed fields in the gulf."
The wells are expected to be much more productive, yielding about 5,000 barrels a day each, five times that of the average well in the gulf, which yields about 1,000 barrels.
Shell has the largest operation in the gulf, with about 500 tracts under lease -- roughly 2.5 million acres. This represents about a third of areas leased by the entire industry.


GRAPHIC: Shell's plan to develop the Mars oilfield depends on building offshore rigs that can extract oil at depths below 2,933 feet in the Gulf of Mexico, the deepest attempted so far. One platform would handle the flow from 24 wells on the sea floor.

HEADLINE: A.M.A. Says Compromise Is Possible on Budgets

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The American Medical Association soft-pedaled its unhappiness with parts of President Clinton's health plan in Senate testimony today, saying it could even agree to overall national health care budgets if doctors were involved in setting them.
Meanwhile, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna E. Shalala, faced a flurry of questions today when she appeared in two House hearings. She said the Administration would deliver its bill in two weeks, in answer to Republicans who repeatedly complained that it was hard to focus on an unfinished proposal. 
 The A.M.A. has called on its members to lobby patients against financial restrictions on health care, including cuts in the growth of Medicare and Medicaid and limits on the cost of insurance premiums. So Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, asked Dr. James S. Todd, the A.M.A.'s executive vice president, whether the group was so dissatisfied that it could not work on developing the plan.
Dr. Todd replied: "Absolutely not. The need for reform is now. The President has provided a good foundation from which to start. We have found him to be responsive to some of the concerns which we have raised; we need to go forward with the President, with this committee and with the Congress and get it done."
 
Praises and Worries
 He was one of five spokesmen for major organizations of doctors, hospitals and nurses who testified and praised the Clinton plan in general terms, while raising particular concerns over whether it would provide enough money for nurses' training, whether its overall timetable was impracticably rapid and whether Medicare should be integrated into the proposed new system.
Of the groups testifying today, those representing hospitals and doctors have fought recent national health care efforts. But today Dr. Robert Graham, executive vice president of the American Academy of Family Practice, rebuffed Republican senators who tried to get him to say that the President's plan involved limiting choices.
He said the plan "maintains pluralism." In any event, he said, patients have less and less room in the current system to choose their doctors.
 
The Abortion Factor
 Sister Maryanna Coyle, head of the board of the Catholic Health Association of the United States, said that while the organization was firmly against including abortion coverage in a plan, it was not saying it would oppose the bill solely for that reason.
In the House, Ms. Shalala's businesslike reception by the Energy and Commerce Committee and the Ways and Means Committee provided a clear contrast with the amiable way Hillary Rodham Clinton was greeted on Capitol Hill last week.
Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr., Republican of Virginia, began, "Let me say, first, Dr. Shalala, I would have strongly preferred that your testimony be based on an introduced bill so that all members could work off actual legislative language and not just the unofficial Sept. 7 draft document."
Mr. Bliley added that he was particularly intent on getting more details from the Administration on its financing. "I am not aware of one independent health care expert or economist who has found your financing and cost containment proposals credible," he said.
Ms. Shalala said a bill would be submitted in about two weeks. She also indicated that some of the financing details were not settled, including planned subsidy levels for small business. At one point, under questioning from Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who heads the Energy and Commerce Committee, she said, "We're not actually locking ourselves into any of the subsidy numbers at this moment."
Ms. Shalala also played down the size of the bureaucracy that would be created under the proposal. The National Health Board, she said, would be "a relatively minor oversight group" with a staff of about 100. She also said she hoped the regional health alliances that would negotiate insurance purchases for its members would be "lean and mean."
 
Complaints of Vagueness
 This afternoon, at the House Ways and Means Committee, she encountered the same complaints about vagueness from Democrats.
Representative Pete Stark of California, chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee on health, said, "I have my doubts about the advisability of enacting a comprehensive benefit package for the under-65 population which is substantially more generous than the benefit package guaranteed under Medicare to my mother."
Representative J. J. Pickle, Democrat of Texas, said, "Until we get legislation, we're just going to be talking generalities."

HEADLINE: On the Plains, a Huge Rail Yard Starts to Hum

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NORTH PLATTE, Neb.

 BODY:
Day and night, freight trains up to one and a half miles long rumble past Buffalo Bill Cody's ranch on the outskirts of town and into the world's biggest railroad yard in a rhythm that seems to gauge the nation's economic pulse more plausibly than any Government statistic.
More than half of Union Pacific's traffic moves through the Bailey Yard, a web of 250 miles of track and 800 switches on which cars from all directions pause briefly in cross-country treks carrying plywood, tires, sugar, bicycles, grain and a myriad of other raw materials and manufactures. 
 From the air, Bailey seems part of a silent but impossibly intricate model railroad, the east classification yard alone being 64 tracks wide. The view from the ground, though, is both gritty and high-tech as nearly 3,000 cars a day are uncoupled and -- at exactly 4 miles an hour -- recoupled to the sound of thunks and squeals.
And what's happening in the Bailey Yard as autumn begins is quickened activity, a pace associated with economic expansion and, if product patterns hold, probably further pickup in the months ahead.
 
Economics Are Promising
 "The volumes have grown so much we've gotten to the point where we're hiring new people," said Cathy Andrews, the 2,000-employee yard's manager for quality and reliability. "The business is definitely there."
The Union Pacific is more diversified in its freight than many carriers, with routes stretching from New Orleans to Canada and to all the major West Coast ports. The Bailey Yard thus provides a useful window through which to view the United States economy, a microcosm of what, and how much, is being produced, sold and shipped.
After making allowances for the likes of summer flooding and the installation of concrete ties in the 125-mile corridor between here and Gibbon, Neb., the busiest freight corridor on earth, the Union Pacific is rolling well.
"Right now, we're running flat out," James A. Shattuck, the railroad's executive vice president for marketing, said in an interview at railroad headquarters in Omaha, the city through which President Lincoln himself decided the transcontinental railroad would move west. "We look for a strong fourth quarter."
[On Sept. 30, the Union Pacific set a system record of 97,787 cars loaded in a seven-day period, 3 percent more than in the comparable 1992 week. On Oct. 4 the railroad broke its seven-day carloading record again -- 98,221 cars, 5 percent above the 1992 period.]
For the Bailey Yard, where trains are disassembled one or two cars at a time and sent rolling over a hump and down an incline to be reconfigured into new trains, the year-to-year comparisons are striking.
 
Increases Each Month
 Trains built here rose each month from May through August, by an average 11 percent from 1992 periods, after posting declines in three of the first four months of the year.
At the same time, however, the figures as well as anecdotal and other information gleaned in a two-day visit to Nebraska in late September and some follow-up phone calls, are subject to various interpretation. This includes the possibility that livelier train activity here may reflect a business pickup already on the wane.
For decades, economists paid close attention to rail carloadings as a barometer of business activity, but truck tonnage, reflecting a growing share of the market, gradually supplanted it during the 1970's. Carloadings still tell a tale, particularly now that trucks themselves are increasingly likely to make part of their journeys aboard trains.
And the widespread adoption of just-in-time inventory practices by corporations has also helped improve carloadings as an indicator of economic health. In this strategy, components are shipped to factories only as they are needed, causing orders to fluctuate more directly with demand.
Still, officials caution that the various figures are just erratic enough to make trends hard to discern. For example, truck trailers and ship containers making part of their journey by rail had been falling short of the targets set, suggesting to some a 1993 holiday shopping season less robust than last year's. September-October is a peak period for carrying imported goods from the Far East like electronics.
Lately, however, shipments have accelerated. According to Tim J. Rhein, president of APL Land Transport Services, a shipping line affiliate that is the Union Pacific's biggest customer, imports are "pretty strong" and about equal to the 1992 pace. What Mr. Rhein wonders about is what happens after these goods arrive to replenish generally low stocks on merchants' shelves.
"I still don't see where people are getting the money to buy," he said.
Richard K. Davidson, the Union Pacific's chairman, frets about drag from weak overseas economies and what he sees as lackluster demand for such basics as lumber, paper and building products. "The economy is just not that vibrant," he said.
Nonetheless, Mr. Davidson projects a 4 percent to 5 percent traffic gain in 1994, partly reflecting a larger share of the market. This year, with floods costing it 47,000 carloads -- less than half of which is likely to be recovered -- the Union Pacific expects to post a 3.5 percent gain, shy of its 5 percent goal.
In the aggregate, carloadings are generally regarded by economists as coincident indicators, those that move about the same time as the economy at large. But Union Pacific officials, who estimate that two-thirds of what the railroad carries is sensitive to the business cycle (grain and coal for utilities are relatively unaffected), find that the goods showing the most variation do not provide much help to forecasters. And much rail data tend to look backward, rather than forward, in economic time.
 
Autos and Forecasting
 "In looking at past recessionary periods, we found that the automobile business actually lags because what typically happens is that the manufacturers make one last push to get inventory out into the field," said J. J. (Jack) Koraleski, executive vice president for finance and information technologies. "So even after things have cooled down, we can see our automobile business keep up."
During the first 24 weeks of this year, until flooding began, the Union Pacific carried 7.7 percent more carloads of motor vehicles and other equipment like tractors than it did in the comparable 1992 period.
Other products seem to lag less or perhaps not at all. "When you see chemicals heating up, it's usually that the economy's starting to turn around," Mr. Shattuck said. This spring, chemicals matched their best quarter in nearly three years.
But those more optimistic than Mr. Davidson, who associates say is typically cautious, point to iron, copper, lead and other metals -- demand for which the economics fraternity widely accepts as leading, or predictive, indicators.
Shipments of metallic ores on the Union Pacific spurted 6.6 percent during the first half of 1993, while coke, used for making steel, jumped 9.9 percent. Crushed stone and other construction materials are also perking up, causing some congestion in Texas, where much of this material is both produced and consumed.
"We can really see when they have a good highway program or something going," Mr. Shattuck said. "It reflects itself pretty considerably in our numbers."

HEADLINE: Arts World: Many Tiny Economic Stars

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN

 BODY:
For all the acknowledged importance of Broadway theater, Woody Allen's movies or a blockbuster show at the Museum of Modern Art, a new study by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has found that the arts in New York exert their greatest economic impact through a myriad of far smaller and more obscure enterprises and organizations.
According to the comprehensive, yearlong research project, the arts and other cultural activities have grown substantially in importance over the last decade. They now pump at least $9.8 billion a year into the New York metropolitan area and, directly and indirectly, support more than 107,000 jobs. The arts directly employ some 41,000, appreciably more than the 36,000 employed in advertising. 
 "This sector of the regional economy has grown even as the region itself has suffered through difficult times," the study found.
Within the New York-New Jersey region that the Port Authority serves, the arts remain largely concentrated in the city. It accounted for 91 percent of the direct jobs and 93 percent of total expenditures by cultural institutions.
 
A Broad Reach
 The authors argue that the very diversity of New York's extensive cultural complex has helped it thrive: "stimulating it to grow some 14 percent in real terms over the 10 years. In many ways it was the creativity of the institutions themselves that allowed them to prosper, increasing their revenues from operations and concessions sales to fuel their growth."
While giant institutions like the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Lincoln Center are highly visible, the authors concluded that the strength of the cultural community rests on thousands of individuals and organizations who make toe shoes for ballet dancers, build stage sets for dramatic productions, devise lighting for television commercials and produce buffets for movie crews.
"Today the cultural world extends far beyond Madison Avenue and SoHo art galleries and is not just those museums and institutions within a mile of Central Park," said Mitchell Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University and an adviser to the study group.
The sponsors of the report -- which include the business-supported New York City Partnership and the Partnership for New Jersey -- intend to use the findings to lobby for additional backing for the arts from public agencies. While the City of New York, after a round of cuts in 1991, has largely maintained its arts budget, state and Federal support for cultural activities has fallen sharply since the late 1980's as the recession has carved a deep hole out of government tax revenues.
 
Theater-in-Meadowlands
 But louder voices are also clamoring for Albany's attention. Local leaders of the arts complain that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo largely ignores the contribution of cultural activities, but bends over backward to respond to the threat by George M. Steinbrenner 3d, principal owner of the New York Yankees, to move his baseball team out of the Bronx. The Governor has suggested building a $500 million stadium in Manhattan if that is necessary to prevent the Yankees from leaving for the Meadowlands in New Jersey.
"Twice as many people go to theater, dance, museums and concerts as all the sports combined in New York," declared Martin E. Segal, chairman of the New York International Festival of the Arts. "The Governor is charming, intelligent, a marvelous orator, but he doesn't go to the cultural attractions of the city." Gerald Schoenfeld, president of the Shubert Organization, which owns 16 Broadway theaters, said: "Unfortunately, we can't exactly pick up and move, but what you do see is that nobody has built a new theater in New York for a very long time."
Vincent Tese, director of the state's Urban Development Corporation, replied: "I don't think that keeping the Yankees is counterproductive to the state's involvement in the arts. I understand there is frustration that the arts got cut back in the recession, like everything else. That should improve as the economy recovers. But the important thing to remember is that we need to maintain a critical mass of all types of entertainment and culture."
Another state official joked, "When Lincoln Center says they are going to move to New Jersey, we'll pay attention."
The study found that visitors to New York for the City's cultural offerings generated an estimated $2.3 billion a year in economic activity, up by 13 percent in real terms from 1982.
The report was supported by foundations, business groups and arts organizations and it is the first installment of a larger $650,000 study of the impact of tourism and the arts.
To some extent, the rosy health of the arts in New York today may serve to undermine its advocates' case for greater government support. Since most cultural institutions have managed to survive and even expand on their own despite recent public austerity, state officials argue that other recipients have greater needs.
But supporters of the arts contend that that is a short-sighted view. Investment in cultural activities pays big dividends, they say.
Lawrence P. Goldman, president of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, is leading the effort to build a large $200 million to $250 million cultural complex, similar in scale to Lincoln Center, in downtown Newark. At least 625 new construction jobs will be created directly in the initial phase, and Mr. Goldman said he hoped to attract as many as 650,000 visitors a year once the center is completed, providing permanent employment at the center for more than 470 people. The ripple effect would help support 6,700 jobs in Newark, according to an economic analysis of the project.
"An arts center is not something that is in the exclusive province of the culturally elite," Mr. Goldman said. "People in Newark and other central cities also need things to be proud of."
 
'Part of the Infrastructure'
 While most of the money to expand such institutions as the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Guggenheim Museum was raised privately during the Wall Street boom of the 1980's, government funds also helped fuel what Randall Bourscheidt, president of the Alliance for the Arts, a nonprofit organization that represents a wide range of local cultural institutions, called "the greatest period of building cultural institutions in this region since the 19th century." He said that the decadelong investment of $1.5 billion, which followed years of public and private neglect, "is now an unequaled part of the infrastructure of the city, just like bridges, roads and mass transit."
As in the broader society, though, New York's 80's business boom and subsequent bust helped widen the gap between the cultural haves and have-nots.
Private art collecting soared, helping boost the economic impact of roughly 500 major art galleries and auction houses by 48 percent from 1982 to 1992, to a total of $840 million in payrolls and purchases. That measure excludes the value of art bought and sold.
With the nonprofit sector, which includes nearly 1,400 institutions -- museums, dance companies, orchestras and numerous other arts organizations -- growth was concentrated in prominent large institutions. In recent years some smaller nonprofit groups have been forced to close and others have shrunk.
"An across-the-board cut may look equitable on the surface, but when you recognize that smaller institutions are more dependent on public dollars, they suffer more," said Kinshasha Holman Conwill, director of the Studio Museum of Harlem.

HEADLINE: Bellwether Area Cool to Whitman

BYLINE: By KIMBERLY J. McLARIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EDISON, N.J., Sept. 30

 BODY:
If Middlesex County is any indication, and Middlesex County usually is, Christine Todd Whitman has run smack into a wall of voter skepticism in her bid to defeat Gov. Jim Florio.
Here in the heart of New Jersey, in the blue-collar neighborhoods of Carteret and along the cheek-to-jowl strip malls of Route 1, Mrs. Whitman's anti-Florio message and promises of economic reform seem to have fallen largely on disbelieving ears. 
 "Her program is not realistic," said Hunter Ward, a carpenter who stood last week outside a department store under construction in New Brunswick, protesting what he said was the use of nonunion workers inside. "How can she cut taxes by 30 percent? No way can you do it without cutting services."
Traditionally hardcore Democratic, but with a Reagan Democrat streak, the county has a history of going with the winner in nearly every important race: Ronald Reagan in 1980, George Bush in 1988 and Bill Clinton last year. In one notable exception, the county picked Mr. Florio over Thomas Kean in the 1981 race for governor.
Middlesex County's political importance lies in its size -- its block of 339,448 registered voters is surpassed only by the huge population centers of Bergen County and Essex County -- and its eclectic mix of residents who have become a bellwether for New Jersey politics.
The county is home to factories, oil refineries, farms, sprawling office parks, Rutgers University and some of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies.
Unemployment in the county stood at 6.9 percent in August, just below the statewide rate of 7.1 percent. The rate has risen steadily from 3.3 percent in 1989.
It would unfair to say that campaign fever has hit Middlesex County. Many residents stopped at random last week said they were not that interested in the governor's race.
"I haven't been paying that much attention, to be honest," said one young woman quizzed at a beauty parlor in Edison Township. "Maybe you should try the bank next door. The people there are older."
 
Questions of Qualification
 But the voters who are paying attention expressed a common theme. Although disappointed with Mr. Florio or still angry with him for ushering through a record $2.8 billion tax increase in 1990, they do not see Mrs. Whitman as a viable alternative.
"I really don't think she's going to be too qualified," said Ann Cunningham of Edison, who was shopping at a supermarket on Route 1. "I think the state's going to be in worse shape than it is if she wins. I guess he's the better of two evils."
Mrs. Whitman, the Republican candidate who almost upset Senator Bill Bradley in 1990, entered the race for governor hoping to capitalize on lingering voter anger against Mr. Florio over the tax increase, and, to be sure, plenty of that anger remains.
"I probably wouldn't vote for the Governor now," said Robert Kay, who manages a video store in Edison. "I just don't like the way things are now. I don't like the taxes."
Mrs. Whitman has tried to rekindle that anger by accusing Mr. Florio of misrepresenting the state's fiscal situation in 1990. At a news conference this week, Mrs. Whitman said Mr. Florio exaggerated the size of the deficit he faced upon taking office to justify his decision to raise taxes.
"He wanted to raise taxes in order to increase spending," she said.
 
Elections and Lies
 But a surprising number of voters seem to have forgiven Mr. Florio. They say they believe him when he says he had no choice.
"When he raised taxes everybody was up in arms," said Lillian Handerhand, who oversees senior citizen programs for the city of Perth Amboy. "But with the good that it has done, I think everybody now says, 'Well, we needed it.' I think they understand more than they thought they would."
Phil Milazzo, who operates two small convenience stores in Edison, said he disliked Mr. Florio's raising taxes after promising not to do so. He even believes the governor intended to raise taxes all along. Still, he will not hold any of that against Mr. Florio on Election Day.
"He's a politician," Mr. Milazzo said. "He's not going to get in if he doesn't lie to people. People don't want to hear the truth."
Mr. Milazzo said he did not know much about Mrs. Whitman except that she was wealthy and that she had proposed cutting the state income tax by 30 percent over three years.
"I don't see how she's going to do that," he said. "It's a nice thought," he said. "But my first impression is that she is lying."
 
Commercials Have Effect
 What little else he knows about the candidate has come largely from a string of negative commercials run by the Florio campaign. Although Mr. Milazzo said he realized that the commercials may distort Mrs. Whitman's views, he acknowledged they had affected his thinking.
He said Mrs. Whitman seemed wealthy, stiff and out-of-touch with the way most people live.
"I didn't like the idea that her husband made about $4 million last year," he said. "It's hard for her to say, 'Yeah, I'm a down-to-earth person.' "
Mrs. Whitman has also staked her candidacy on her tax cut proposals, which she says will stimulate the economy and create jobs in New Jersey. But Mrs. Handerhan of Perth Amboy is skeptical.
"That's not easy to do," she said. "You can say anything you want before an election. The question is are you going to come through after the election."
John Craig, a photographer in Edison, said many of his friends who were considering voting for Mrs. Whitman before she announced her tax cut plan were now questioning her thinking, and her honesty.
"She stretched the bounds of credibility when she came out with that tax cut," Mr. Craig said.
 
Local Parties Reinvigorated
 Still, Republican Party officials say they believe Mrs. Whitman will carry the county in November. Although registered Democrats still outnumber Republicans three-to-one, the Republicans have managed to break the stranglehold Democrats held on Middlesex for six decades.
In the backlash of public anger over the state tax increase, voters in 1991 gave Republicans control of the County Board of Chosen Freeholders for the first time this century. Republicans claim either the mayor or a majority of council members in 12 of the counties' 25 towns.
On the state level, the county, which includes parts of five legislative districts, is represented by four senators and eight assembly members who are Republican and one senator and two assembly members who are Democratic.
"We have built a base there for Republicans," said the county Republican chairman, Sam Thompson. "It's a very different picture than you might have seen five years ago when you could just take it and stick it in the Democrat column."
But Democratic officials are much more optimistic about their candidate's chances in Middlesex County than they were two years ago.
The Democratic Party organization has been reinvigorated by a 1992 reform movement that gave more decision-making power to the 1,200 committee people, said Democratic county chairman Harry Pozycki.
Mr. Pozycki said he believed the reenergize party bodes well for Mr. Florio in Middlesex County.
"Because of this new enthusiasm, people are willing to engage in one-on-one conversations with their neighbors," he said. "All the candidates report being much more warmly received that in the past two years."

HEADLINE: LOAN GUARANTEES FOR ISRAEL ARE CUT

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Oct. 5

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration has slashed the loan guarantees that it will give Israel next year because of Israel's continued settlement in the occupied territories and its disputed construction in East Jerusalem, officials here said today.
Instead of receiving guarantees on $2 billion, Israel will have to settle for assurances on less than $1.6 billion. In all, the officials said, the Administration has recommended to Congress that $437 million be sliced from the program, a dollar-for-dollar penalty because of Israeli spending on settlements in the territories. 
 Israeli officials had expected a reduction, but not such a large one, and the action raises a question of whether Israel might challenge it either in Congress or by asking Mr. Clinton to reconsider the issue. Some Israelis see the cut as a political blow to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, even though the economic consequences may not be severe.
No issue has created greater tensions between Israel and the United States in recent years than the $10 billion worth of guarantees, spread over five years in annual installments of $2 billion. Some Israeli economists question whether the assistance is even needed, but the Government insists that it is and it used the guarantees to borrow the full $2 billion in 1993, the first year of the program.
 
Request to Bush
 Originally the idea was to help Israel absorb a huge wave of arrivals from the former Soviet Union. But with immigration down, the assistance has evolved into a more general development program, including an opportunity to reduce borrowing costs. What the United States provides are not actual loans, but rather assurances that it will cover the debts should Israel default -- something that officials here say has never happened and never will.
In 1991, Yitzhak Shamir, who was then Prime Minister, asked President George Bush for the guarantees. In no time the guarantees turned from an economic issue into a political battle, largely over Mr. Bush's strong displeasure with Mr. Shamir's aggressive policy of building settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Mr. Bush withheld the assistance until Mr. Rabin's Labor Party was elected in June 1992 on a promise to change spending priorities.
Against that background, the big chunk taken out of the total for the 1994 United States fiscal year, which began on Friday, was seen by some officials here as a political blow. The fact that it was delivered by an Administration regarded as one of the friendliest that this country has seen in many years only intensified the sting.
 
'Timing of the Slap Is Crazy'
 "Technically it's a fine on paper that may not even hurt the Israelis," an official of an American Jewish group said. "But it's a slap, and the timing of the slap is crazy." By that he meant that it occurs at a moment that many Israelis feel they are taking considerable risks by agreeing to Palestinian self-rule in the territories.
But Israeli Government spokesmen insisted that they were not caught off-guard by the Administration action. It was based on spending figures that they had provided, as required under the guarantee agreement, they said. They knew that they faced penalties, they added, and there was no way for Mr. Rabin to reverse Mr. Shamir's settlements policy fully.

1968, Soaked in Student Blood, Refuses to Fade

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Oct. 5

 BODY:
Francisco Buendia was not born when angry students shook this city with demonstrations as it prepared to be host to the 1968 Olympic Games. Although he looks something like a throwback in shredded jeans and long hair, he conceded that he was not much of a counterculturalist, either.
"I agree with the economic modernization of this country," Mr. Buendia, 20, a student, said, lowering his voice lest other protesters overhear him. Referring to accords that Mexico has signed with Canada and the United States, he added, "I'm probably one of the only people here who supports the free-trade agreement." 
 But there was Mr. Buendia on Saturday, one of thousands of young people who tramped through the rain in demonstrations to commemorate the student movement that flowered here 25 years ago and the army massacre that crushed it on Oct. 2. "I owe the students from those days a lot," he said. "This struggle is not over."
For all the nostalgia that the year holds for reluctantly middle-age people from California to the Czech Republic, the power of 1968 is different in Mexico. Here the moment is inevitably represented as a wound or scar, one that will not or cannot heal.
 
Silence on Files and Death Toll
 Even after 25 years the Government has yet to account fully for what occurred on the evening when the army fired on the 5,000 or 10,000 protesters gathered in the square of a housing project called Tlatelolco. Dozens, perhaps hundreds, were killed, and more than 1,000 were wounded. But lists of the dead are only now being compiled by a group of intellectuals who have volunteered to investigate.
When thousands of people marched to the Tlatelolco square on the anniversary of the killings on Saturday chanting for the release of official files on the shooting, the Government answered with silence. Last year, when the shooting was so much as mentioned in new elementary-school history textbooks, military leaders became incensed. When the books were provisionally rewritten the chronology stopped before 1968.
Few officials question that the killings helped destroy myths that had until 1968 helped hold together Mexican society -- a legitimate Government and a sacrosanct President; a clear, bright future, and a broad national consensus. Yet as the generation that was studying in 1968 has taken political hold -- President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and many important aides were in college then -- the legacy of the movement has continued to divide Mexico deeply.
 
'Never Joined in the Questioning'
 "The men in power now learned a great deal from 1968," said Lorenzo Meyer, a leading historian who is campaigning for the release of the files. "But they never joined in the questioning of authority. Their question was, 'What do we have to change in order to remain in power?' "
The demands that fueled the movement, drawing as many as 350,000 people to the main square, the Zocalo, included greater autonomy for the universities and freedom for political prisoners. As it has been handed down to students today the goal takes a simpler form. Then as now, current and former students say, the struggle is for democracy.
"Of that great wave of '68, France and Czechoslovakia and the United States and Germany, they don't still do this anywhere else," a former student leader, Pedro Penalosa, 45, said. "In all of those other countries the basic problems of democracy have been resolved."
As he looked out at the demonstrators on the Zocalo again Mr. Penalosa recounted an odyssey that is in some ways typical. From radical groups, he moved through small leftist parties, serving as a member of congress in the 80's. After the 1988 presidential election, he joined the governing-party dissident who ran against Mr. Salinas, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, and he helped focus the left on issues like electoral fraud and the iniquities of political competition.
Standing nearby at the demonstration, a lawyer in a pin-striped suit, Manuel Reyes Retana, 50, said he could not disagree more with Mr. Penalosa. "What all of this achieved is that these people can be out here saying whatever they want," said Mr. Reyes, who joined the movement as a young law student. "All of this asking for democracy is just about trying to make the country look bad."
Nodding to a group of young long-haired men, he added: "These kids don't know what repression is. They have never been repressed like we were."
In 1968, Mr. Salinas was a 20-year-old economics student at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and the son of a former cabinet minister. But neither he nor any of the 40-ish men in his cabinet are known to have joined the marches.
Although a few former student leaders have joined the Administration in lesser roles, the man who is perhaps most associated with Tlatelolco in the Administration is Manuel Camacho Solis, a student friend and close adviser of the President. Now Mayor of Mexico City and an undeclared candidate to succeed Mr. Salinas, Mr. Camacho has insistently advocated talks rather than force to defuse opposition protests. That strategy has helped restore the governing party's strength in the capital.
 
Essayist on Problems
 Months after the massacre Mr. Camacho won a national student prize for an essay on political and economic problems. The work quoted Mao and spoke of an urgent need to organize the masses. But Mr. Camacho argued that only the Government had been able to win the support of "the great majorities." He dismissed the students' alternatives as "confusing in the extreme" and condemned to complete failure.
Later Mr. Camacho met President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz, a move that would have been unthinkable for many other students.
Once each week now in a small cafe above a bookstore a group of intellectuals has been interviewing old students, formalizing requests for interviews with former officials and writing to request the declassifying of Government documents. By year's end, the group says, it hopes to have a preliminary report on what occurred 25 years ago.

HEADLINE: Clinton Pitch on Health Takes Zigs and Zags

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CULVER CITY, Calif., Oct. 5

 BODY:
President Clinton's appearance at a picturesque park here today was staged with utmost care to take advantage of all of the things the Administration wanted to emphasize this week. Most of the crowd was elderly and they all lived in California, a state that remains crucial to Mr. Clinton's political success. The topic was health care.
But after little more than half an hour of reassuring his audience that Medicare benefits would not be cut, the President apologized and ducked offstage to his waiting motorcade and rushed back to Washington to meet with his national security advisers on developments in Somalia, leaving a policy adviser, Ira C. Magaziner, behind. 
 The onlookers, many of whom had been bused into the site, streamed away anyway, forcing the event's organizer to plead with them to stay.
"Buses will not leave until Mr. Magaziner has had an opportunity to answer questions," said Judith Brown, a board member of the American Association of Retired Persons as she watched the elaborate health care forum disintegrate before her eyes.
 
Series of Obstacles
 It has been like that for three days for the Administration's great health care sales pitch to Californians. Mr. Clinton arrived in California on Sunday to take part in a 90-minute statewide question-and-answer broadcast that his aides had planned as a health care program. But the local stations broadcasting the session balked at limiting the questions to health care, and the President ended up spending most of his time answering questions about crime, immigration and education.
At the end, when Mr. Clinton suggested wistfully that he would not mind taking a few more questions, the local host intervened brusquely to insist that the NBC affiliates broadcasting the program really had to rush back to their regular programming, in this case "seaQuest DSV," a new underwater science fiction program.
The President tried again the next day in San Francisco, where he addressed the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s convention. But by the time Mr. Clinton finished talking about his commitment to working people, his dread of a California school voucher proposal and his support for the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Lane Kirkland, the president of the labor federation had just denounced as a "poison pill," there was little time left to talk health.
When the other pressing domestic concerns were not enough to distract the President, events in Russia and Somalia sealed his fate.
"It's a good example of how difficult it is to fashion a message and stick to it," said a White House official who traveled with the President.
Mr. Clinton left Washington on Sunday afternoon with good intentions. He brought his health care advisers along and was also accompanied by political advisers with special expertise in California politics. Most of the time, the health care advisers had little to do.
But Mr. Clinton made the first efforts at what aides have predicted will be a new running theme of tying together many of the Administration's initiatives into a single package. By stressing the interrelatedness of personal and economic security, Mr. Clinton is trying to make every element of his domestic agenda dependent on each other.
 
A Glittering Audience
 Aides said he honed the pitch further at a fund-raising dinner held in Los Angeles on Monday night, which drew Hollywood luminaries like Barbra Streisand and Lew R. Wasserman, the chairman of MCA Inc., as well as political leaders who were contributing to a fund for Senate candidates.
Mr. Clinton, the aides said, spoke for more than an hour without notes, stressing the security theme to an audience that is arguably the most secure group he will ever speak to.
Then he walked upstairs to his hotel suite and watched the brutal footage of dead American soldiers being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu.
"The best-laid plans of mice and men," said Dee Dee Myers, the press secretary. "That just comes with the territory. We just keep trying."

HEADLINE: Tom Bristol Coughran, Banking Executive, 87

 BODY:
Tom Bristol Coughran, a banking executive who was an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury during the Eisenhower Administration, died on Saturday at Alexandria Hospital in Virginia. He was 87 and lived in Falls Church, Va.
The cause was heart failure, his family said. 
 Mr. Coughran was Assistant Secretary for International Affairs from 1957 to 1958, and also served as the United States executive director of the World Bank and the International Finance Corporation.
He began his career at the Bank of America in Exeter, Calif., after graduating from Stanford University in 1927. In the next 30 years, he rose from branch manager to vice president and manager of the bank's international banking department in San Francisco.
After his stint at the Treasury Department, he returned to the Bank of America in New York, becoming executive vice president, vice chairman and chief executive officer of the Bank of America International in New York.
He retired from the bank in 1971 and was one of the founders of the Wobaco Holding Corporation of Luxembourg. He served as Wobaco's chairman before retiring in 1975.
He is survived by his wife of 63 years, Florence, and a daughter, Jane, of Alexandria.

HEADLINE: Office Towers in 42d St. Project May Be Getting Taller

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
While public attention has focused on an interim plan to rehabilitate 42d Street with honky-tonk flourishes, New York State officials have also been considering changes to the longer-term redevelopment plan that could lead to office towers far taller than previously envisioned.
For instance, the skyscraper planned on the site of Nathan's Famous restaurant, at Broadway and 43d Street, would grow to 895 feet from 750 feet. That would make it the eighth tallest building in New York City -- two and a half times taller than One Times Square Plaza, where the ball drops on New Year's Eve. 
 The discovery that tower heights are being renegotiated with the developers has set off protests from civic groups and local leaders. They said their attention had been diverted by the interim plan, which conveyed a future 42d Street where Damon Runyon might feel at home, full of neon, noise and razzmatazz.
 
'No Longer Blinding'
 "The glare of the neon is no longer blinding people," Nicholas Fish, chairman of Community Board 5 in mid-Manhattan, said yesterday.
Even though the skyscrapers would not be built until the next century, their future is tied into talks about the interim rehabilitation project because both would be undertaken by the same team, the Prudential Insurance Company of America and Park Tower Realty.
Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan, who praised the interim plan when it was unveiled last month, said she had been unaware until a few days ago that the planned tower heights were being reconsidered.
"It is my strong hope that reason will prevail," she said, "and that the incredible growing towers will become incredible shrinking towers. And soon."
The plan to construct four office towers at 42d Street, Broadway and Seventh Avenue was approved by the city's Board of Estimate in 1984, revised in 1988 and postponed last year in the face of a devastated real-estate market. Until the market improves, existing buildings on those four sites are to be rehabilitated as stores and restaurants.
 
Shades of 'Guys and Dolls'
 Gov. Mario M. Cuomo presided over the unveiling of the interim plan on Sept. 15, at the Academy Theater on West 42d Street. On easels behind him were vivid, evocative renderings by Robert A. M. Stern Architects, which might have been backdrops for "Guys and Dolls." The images were well publicized and much discussed.
"The trouble is," said Kent L. Barwick, president of the Municipal Art Society, "every aspect of that plan is slated for demolition as soon as the office market returns."
On the same day as the Governor's announcement, the enlargement of the future office towers appeared on the agenda of the State Urban Development Corporation, as an amendment to the 42d Street plan.
Under this amendment, floor-to-ceiling heights would grow to 13 feet -- an increase of from 3 to 6 inches a floor, depending on the tower. This added height is meant to accommodate extra computer and telecommunications lines overhead and underfoot. If the buildings are better suited for technological expansion, they would presumably be that much more attractive to prospective tenants.
"A 13-foot height is not an uncommon requirement for new buildings," said Rebecca Robertson, president of the 42d Street Development Project, a subsidiary of the Urban Development Corporation.
 
Overall Floor Area
 State officials said there would be no increase in the overall floor area of the four office towers, which would amount to more than 4 million square feet. Two towers would gain a story, one would stay the same and the largest, on the Nathan's Famous site, would actually lose two floors even as it grew in height.
No decision has been reached by the corporation, which has scheduled a public hearing for Nov. 15 on this and other amendments to the 42d Street plan.
"Our feeling," Mr. Barwick said, "is that it's time to consider whether or not the original concept has outlived its usefulness."
"It was arresting or ironic," he added, "that at the very moment that all the focus was on the interim plan, the city and state were on the verge of agreeing to make the office buildings even larger. That's insult to injury."
Joseph B. Rose, executive director of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, said that "under the guise of the lights and signs of Robert Stern are a whole bunch of substantive changes that alarmed people who've been following the project closely."
 
To Urge Opposition
 Actors' Equity Association has not yet taken a position, but Jack L. Goldstein, the special assistant to its president, said he would urge opposition.
"I don't think those buildings should be taller than they are now for any reason," Mr. Goldstein said. "If they need greater floor-to-ceiling heights, they can have fewer floors."
Mr. Fish said the community board had not yet taken a position but that "once the attention shifted from the design elements of this so-called interim plan to the details, certain things became clear that were potentially a problem for our community board."

HEADLINE: Weicker's Lieutenant to Run for Governor

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Oct. 5

 BODY:
Lieut. Gov. Eunice S. Groark, who joined Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.'s fledgling independent third party as his running mate in 1990, announced today that she would run for governor next year.
"Governor Weicker and I have worked hard to provide leadership, and we have established a record of getting things done," Mrs. Groark said at a news conference at the State Capitol. "I believe for Connecticut to succeed that that leadership must continue." 
 Mr. Weicker, who said last week that he would not seek a second term, was on hand to pledge his support for Mrs. Groark and promise victory. So he stood in the background applauding someone else, a rare place for a man who has so dominated the spotlight through most of his political career. When he stepped up to the microphones to address Mrs. Groark's supporters, he conceded the oddness of the moment.
"I have been so roused by the reception that you gave Eunice, it's sort of like that fellow who was on the bench that leaped off onto the field to tackle somebody," Mr. Weicker said. "I know that A Connecticut Party could not have a finer standard bearer."
 
Tie-Breaking Votes
 Mrs. Groark, a soft-spoken 55-year-old former Republican from Hartford, has been a pivotal figure in some of the key moments of the Weicker administration. As presiding officer in the State Senate, she cast the deciding, tie-breaking vote in 1991 that gave Connecticut a state income tax. She also broke a tie earlier this year in favor of a law that made Connecticut only the third state in the nation to ban the sale of some semiautomatic assault rifles.
But until today, she was very much in Mr. Weicker's large shadow. She admitted that many people around the state still do not know her, and that her starting place is far different from Mr. Weicker's, who had served for 18 years in the United States Senate before his third-party bid and whose name and face were known across Connecticut.
The saving grace, she said, is that the other candidates in the race so far -- State Senator John B. Larson of East Hartford, and State Senator Richard J. Balducci from Newington, both Democrats -- are not well known either.
"I don't think I'm any more unknown than any other possible candidate," she said.
 
Continuation of Policies
 Mrs. Groark, who served as corporation counsel for Hartford and who ran unsuccessfully for mayor of that city in 1985, promised to continue the policies of the Weicker administration, which she identified as economic development and job creation. She said she hoped to retain many of the administration's appointees, many of whom were in the room cheering.
But where else she might draw support was a matter of dispute. Edward L. Marcus, the Democratic state chairman, said that Mrs. Groark was simply another Republican who would draw Republican voters to the benefit of Democrats. The Republican state chairman, John A. Mastropietro, on the other hand, said that just as Mr. Weicker had "crucified" the Democrats in 1990 -- when the state's largest political party drew barely 20 percent of the popular vote -- so would Mrs. Groark draw Democratic votes.
There is little formal structure within A Connecticut Party for her to draw on. After three years, the Governor's party had only 1,783 members statewide in early March, according to the most recent figures from the Secretary of the State's office. By contrast, there were 736,336 registered Democrats, 501,022 Republicans and 706,320 unaffiliated voters.
Officials in the two major parties say that however much Mr. Weicker might help Mrs. Groark, his long shadow may also be a great liability.
"She is not Lowell Weicker," said Mr. Marcus, the Democrat. "A Connecticut Party is Lowell Weicker, and you're just not going to be able to transfer that."

DATELINE: WARSAW, Oct. 5

 BODY:
Poles love pizza. But Pizza Hut didn't know they loved pizza that much. Or that they would fall for corn on the cob, or burritos, or for that matter, Taco Bells.
After six weeks, Pepsico's first "three in one" restaurant outside the United States, with a Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Taco Bell under one roof, has proved an overwhelming success. 
 So much so, planned television advertisements were shelved for fear of swamping the restaurant with too many customers. For two days, corn on the cob ran out.
"We're doing much more business than in Moscow," gloated Nick Howle, business development manager in Eastern Europe for Pizza Hut, who was involved in the company's Moscow opening three years ago. "In Moscow we thought we had to be there if business was going to happen. We thought of it as a stepping stone. But Poland is a main focus for Pizza Hut. We're committed."
The American fast-food chains have discovered that Poland is a wide-open market. The only real questions are whether Polish corn is up to snuff with the Hungarian corn the restaurants have been importing and whether local potatoes will ever make a decent french fry. For now, Pepsico is importing those, too.
Four years along the road to a market economy, the Poles are showing many of the attributes of fast-food devotees. More Poles have more disposable income than before. Life styles are changing so that the traditional heavy hot meal at 4 P.M. at the end of the workday has given way to the Western convention of lunch, more work and then dinner.
And like fast-food eaters the world over, Poles like to be in American-style, squeaky clean surroundings. The interior of the "three in one" restaurant at Warsaw's Bank Square is decorated with murals of Chicago, which has the largest population of Poles outside Poland.
"We're doing about double the number of transactions we expected," said Paul Clark, the operations manager as he passed an eye over the crowded tables and checked how the sour cream was being prepared for the burritos in one of the three kitchens. "We'd predicted about 15,000 transactions a week. We're doing 25,000."
Usually, the novelty factor wears off after the first few weeks at a new fast-food location and sales dip before picking up into a solid business, Mr. Clark said. The novelty seems to have strong staying power at the Pizza Hut troika. Transactions -- one of the standard measurements in fast food -- are up 15 percent over the opening week, he said.
The restaurant's flying start seems to confirm Pepsico's faith in Poland. In August, the company announced it was investing $500 million over the next five years in Poland. About 40 percent of the Pepsi stake would go to soft drinks, 20 percent to the snack-food market and 20 percent to the restaurants, said D. Wayne Calloway, Pepsico's chairman and chief executive, when he opened the new restaurant.
So far, Pepsico has one other Pizza Hut restaurant in Warsaw, a gleaming shopping mall location in a well-to-do suburb. Four more openings are planned in the capital before the end of the year, including a Pizza Hut in the restored Old Town. Next year, the company will venture to some of Poland's other major cities, including the cultural and university center of Cracow.
The McDonald's Corporation has been in the Polish market longer and set records of its own here, too. In 1992, the Warsaw McDonald's had 31,000 transactions on its opening day and last month the new venue in Gdansk on the Baltic Sea outdid that number by 3,000 on opening day.
Tim Fenton, McDonald's manager in Poland, won't say how many transactions are being done at each of his six restaurants. But he defies New Yorkers to find a McDonald's in Manhattan that bustles like the main two-story Warsaw outlet with 18 cash registers. "We're doing very well," he said.
Burger King, the other entrant in the fast-food trade, has opened four restaurants in Warsaw and plans 50 across the country in the next five years, said Magdalena Grzelewska, the marketing director for the International Fast Food Corporation, the franchiser in Poland for Burger King and a wholly owned American subsidiary of Capital Acquisitions Inc.
"There's still lots and lots of room for all of us in Poland," Ms. Grzelewska said. "The market is far from saturated."
Doing business in Poland is still not easy, the fast-food executives said. Inflation at 35 percent and the recent 8 percent devaluation of the zloty complicate matters. But costs for Pizza Hut in Poland are substantially lower than in Moscow, where most of the food has to be imported, Mr. Howle said.
But even in Poland, Pizza Hut is still perfecting food ingredients from local suppliers.
As Mr. Clark toured the kitchens, three rich yellow chunky cobs of corn were being carefully placed on trays for a tasting. This was an important moment: would Jerzy Zajaczkowski, a food chemist and the restaurant's technical manager, find that Polish corn was as good as Hungarian corn? Until now, the restaurant's corn has come from Hungary, which proved a big problem when supplies ran short in the opening week and frantic Pizza Hut managers couldn't pry their Hungarian corn out of the Polish customs inspectors.
"We'll be testing for moisture, defects, and looking at the micro biology results," said Mr. Zajaczkowski of the samples slathered in melted butter. Three different corn varieties had been given to Polish growers in the north of the country in an effort to get them to match the Hungarian quality, he said.
Similarly, the company imports its french fries from the Netherlands because the local potatoes make inferior fries. In one year of trying to grow American and Canadian potatoes, the farmers have made strides but have yet to reach the quality required by Kentucky Fried Chicken, Mr. Zajaczkowski said.
And needless to say, all the ingredients for Taco Bell items -- except for the iceberg lettuce -- are imported. "It's so foreign, it's all flown in," Mr. Clark said.
The pizza by the slice is the big hit at the "three in one" restaurant. It seems to be priced just right, from 15,000 zlotys to 24,000 zlotys (63 cents to $1.20). The crust is chunkier than the feeble, pale efforts of most Polish pizza, and the Hawaiian recipe with ham and pineapple -- an almost unknown fruit in Poland -- is the best seller, said Jacek Bresckiewicz, the Pizza Hut manager.
"We've been to the United States three times," said Leszek Bubel, a businessman who brought his wife and two children to the Pizza Hut for a Sunday meal. "When I'm here I feel I'm back in the States. This is our second time. We're going to come and try everything on the menu."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Mixed as Traders Await U.S. Report on Jobs

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended mixed against other major currencies yesterday as traders awaited the latest employment data.
Gold prices were little changed after falling overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for October delivery closed at $353 an ounce, up 30 cents. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold at $353 a troy ounce, unchanged from Monday. 
 Earl I. Johnson, a vice president at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago, said dollar trading was quiet ahead of Friday's report on September unemployment.
"There's still a lot of question about the underlying strength of the U.S. economy," Mr. Johnson said. He predicted the unemployment report would show an increase of around 150,000 nonfarm jobs last month.
 
Impact on Interest Rates
 An improved employment picture would help strengthen the dollar because it would mean that the economy is improving and interest rates are less likely to fall.
A drop in rates often depresses the dollar by making dollar-denominated securities less valuable.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 105.80 Japanese yen, up from 105.65 yen on Monday. The dollar also rose to 1.6260 German marks from 1.6235 marks.
The British pound rose to $1.5150 in New York from $1.5140.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday's late quotes, were: 1.4225 Swiss francs, up from 1.4190; 5.6780 French francs, up from 5.6645; 1,591 Italian lire, up from 1,588, and 1.3386 Canadian dollars, down from 1.3413.
Silver prices were mixed. On the Comex in New York, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $4.063 a troy ounce, up from $4.054 late Monday.

HEADLINE: Trade Pact to Give Latin America a Big Boost

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"One Specious Argument for Nafta" (editorial, Sept. 23) misconstrues the Clinton Administration's argument that the North American Free Trade Agreement is in our fundamental foreign policy interest. You suggest that this Administration's support for the agreement is intended to bolster the Government in Mexico, which faces elections next year. 
 The United States does not take sides in Latin America's elections. But we do have a stake in reform, political and economic, in Mexico and throughout the hemisphere. The development of democratic institutions and emergence of free markets reflect our values and reinforce our national interests. We pursue these objectives daily in our diplomacy.
That is why the United States has a direct stake in Congressional approval of the trade agreement. It will create the world's largest free trade area, a common market of more than 370 million consumers. And as President Clinton has said, "Free trade and open markets not only enrich people; they empower them."
If we approve the trade agreement, we will strengthen the drive toward economic liberalization and political reform in Mexico. Approval will also increase Mexico's capacity to cooperate with the United States on a range of issues -- including narcotics, illegal immigration and environmental protection -- that affect Americans.
If we reject the trade agreement, protectionists and those opposing reform will almost certainly be emboldened by such a clear signal of American retrenchment. We hope you are correct in your assertion that Latin American countries would continue their reforms if the agreement were defeated. But we see no need to test that proposition.
The foreign policy arguments for the North American Free Trade Agreement make the strong case on its economic merits more compelling. We are confident the American people and Congress will recognize, and seize, this once-in-a-generation opportunity.

HEADLINE: THE PLAYOFFS;
National League Championship Matchup

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON

 BODY:

ON THE MOUND
 
Can They Get The Final Outs?
 
The rotation gave the revolution the club staged over the second half in the N.L. West its momentum. It's deep and often unmerciful, paid multi-millions to allow as close to nothing as possible. The team's collective e.r.a. of 3.14 wasted the rest of the competition in the N.L. Greg Maddux should win his second straight Cy Young Award, Tom Glavine won 20 games for the third straight season and Steve Avery has the most sinister stuff of all of them. John Smoltz, the man with all the pitches and all too often the habit of wasting a great part of his talent, is a post-season deity in Atlanta. He seems to find his zone when the October moonlight finds him on the mound. Avery split his season record against the Phillies, his e.r.a. a full half a point higher versus Philadelphia than it was for the season. He will also be facing the club's right-handed lineup, certainly its more lethal incarnation. Maddux simply is the best pitcher in baseball at the moment. He walks no one, gives up a hit every five innings or so and always takes his club deep into games. Glavine, who has a mixed post-season resume at best, may enter the scene with the most to personally prove. The bullpen, as almost virtually all in baseball are, is ordinary. Mark Wohlers throws hard, but straight, and so is turning around a lot on the mound. Kent Mercker never seems to throw strikes when he has to. Steve Bedrosian and Jay Howell have been effective surprises. But the Braves have not won the World Series the last two seasons because they never seemed able to get the final out. Greg McMichael, barely invited to spring training, gets the invitation to make history for the Braves as the club's closer. But the right-hander, whose out pitches are not strikes, has been awfully suspect after a summer-long run of fantasy finishes. The Phillies, who have faced McMichael six tmes in 1993, stuck him with an 8.53 e.r.a.
 
At Least They're Healthy
 
Conventional wisdom says the Phillies are at the wrong end of a mismatch in this department. As usual, there's considerable truth to standard thinking. The club's starters, a revelation over the first half, were often wounded and worked over across the team's uneven trek to October's promised land. Tommy Greene has been hurt, and Terry Mulholland was once feared done for the season. All are now available and certainly capable. They may have to be much more. Their track record, though, says the corps, one augmented Danny Jackson's left-handed presence, will give the Phillies innings, keep them close enough for there to be hope that the offensive engine will wear down the opposition. Certainly, turning the games over to the bullpen will be a mortifying option. The contingent of relievers, one the front office sought all season to improve and alter, was ranked 11th in the N.L. They together amassed 24 blown saves. The Phillies, not surprisingly, were a marginal 23-20 in one-run games. Mitch Williams, the theoretical closer, is the perfect top man for a below average bullpen. His final pitching line of the season about captured the perpetually potential downside to his dramatics: 1 IP, 1 hit, 2 runs, 2 walks, 2 wild pitches.
 
Advantage Braves
 
IN THE FIELD
 
Sometimes Vulnerable
 
You don't win three straight division titles without a line of defense, and the fielding fortifications for the Braves got more imposing when McGriff was added. His bat gets people's attention and headlines and it might have got him more than a handful of MVP votes (McGriff's arrival sparked the inflation of everyone's averageinfalted the averages of his cohorts at the chop shop, but his play aty first might get the Braves an extra out or two when it counts most this series. But Atlanta, whose overall fielding efforts ranked third in the N.L., isn't without its departments of defense that trouble Manager Bobby Cox. Terry Pendleton, garnerer of Gold Gloves, has been erratic this season at third. Ron Gant, for all his speed and hustle, still can seem unrefined three years after his conversion to an outfielder. David Justice can launch the odd throw that looks more like one of his home runs. And the defense's vulnerability was on full and painful display over the season's final stretch.
 
Freddy Krueger With a Glove
 
It can be Nightmare on Broad Street when the Phillies slip into their slapstick routine in the field. It can happen anytime with this club, and there won't be a worse time than if the Phillies don't make the routine and remarkable plays in October that win championships. Dave Hollins is the first baseman of the future, only he now plays third base in the present. He doesn't do it soundly. John Kruk, the man who does play first, hasn't of late played it nearly as efficiently and airtightly as he had earlier in the season. The club turned the fewest number of double plays of any club in the N.L. in 1993. It also made 141 errors, their defense finding its rightfully mediocre place in the second tier of the league (9th place.) Pete Incaviglia, the man with the World's Gym upper body and world's worst set of wheels, can be an adventure in left. Lenny Dykstra still runs into walls in cnter, but doesn't pick himself up with the ball in his glove quite as often.
 
Advantage Braves.
 
AT THE PLATE
 
Well-Balanced and Hot
 
"There are good lineups at the plate - Texas, San Francisco, Philadelphia," said Ron Gant, the left-fielder for the Braves. "None are hot like we are hot." The temperature turned out these numbers - Atlanta's 169 homers led the N.L. and Gant, David Justice and Fred McGriff all hit 30 or more homers and drove in 100 or more runs. It's a lineup blessed with fabulous balance - Otis Nixon's basehit bunts and afterburners (his 47 stolen bases were good enough for 3rd in N.L.), Jeff Blauser's hit parade out of the No. 2 hole (182 for a shortstop), Terry Pendleton's decision to go nuts with the bat the last week of the season (the third baseman drove in nine over the final weekend), and Mark Lemke's repeated flair for post-season mass production. The lineup had a perfectly healthy appetitite for the strong-arm offerings of the Phillies, as Justice, Pendleton and McGriff combined to hit .333, with Justice homering three times. Gant, though, could be the wild card. With right-handers Tommy Greene and Curt Schilling coming at the Braves in Game 1 and Game 2, Gant, who hit only .191 against the Phillies, will be under the microscope to see if the breakthrough in the clutch he made throughout the second half of 1993 extends to the second season.
 
They Score in Bunches
 
The club nearly scored 900 runs in 1993, a staggering total that wasn't hurt by the 5.3 runs a game the club scored on average in its 12 games with the Braves. Len Dykstra, who might have been the runaway choice for N.L. MVP in the absence of Barry Bonds, is a machine of offensive menace, on base always and across the plate more than any other player in baseball this season. He's a lifetime .312 hitter against Atlanta. The heart of the order is as patient and muscular as they come - John Kruk (.430 on-base percentage, .316 average), Darren Daulton (105 r.b.i., 117 walks) and Dave Hollins (.330 against left-handers.) And the attack - Philadelphia's club average of .274 trailed only the Giants - has been aided by assorted phenomena - Pete Incaviglia drove in an astonishing 89 runs in only 368 at-bats (the left-fielder hit four homers against Atlanta pitching) and and Kevin Stocker, a minor-league promotion halfway through the season, hit .324 in 70 games. Key questions would involve how fast Daulton's bat still is (the catcher played in 147 games), how a lack of team speed might hurt the club in a short series (the Phillies were next to last in the N.L. in stolen bases), and the ability of players with great numbers but inconclusive track records (Mariano Duncan, Jim Eisenreich) to produce in the passion of post-season.
 
Advantage Phillies.
 
OFF THE BENCH
 
Not Glamorous, But Solid
 
Sid Bream, Rafael Belliard, Bill Pecota. They aren't glamorous names, but they are the estimable backbone of the bench for the Braves. They'll provide professional defense and the occasional quality at bat in a big spot. And the dugout isn't devoid entirely of intriguing mercenaries. Deion Sanders can steal a base and make an impact if asked to start. And Francisco Cabrera, whose 15 minutes of fame might have been among the most intense in baseball history hit .357 with a homer and three r.b.i. against the Phillies this year.
 
Which Ones Are They?
 
It's hard to separate the bench from the regulars. Jim Eisenreich hit .318 as the right-fielder against right-handers and Milt Thompson drove in 44 runs as the left-fielder against right-handers. Pete Incaviglia wreaked havoc against lefties and Wes Chamberlain hit 12 homers and 20 doubles in under 300 at-bats. The bench is deep beyond the platoon, too. Todd Pratt 87 as the backup catcher and pinch-hitter. Rickey Jordan who can homer on half-swings, hit .289. And Kim Batiste can fill the role of home-run threat.
 
Advantage Phillies.

HEADLINE: THE SOMALIA MISSION;
Clinton Sending More Troops to Somalia

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 6

 BODY:
President Clinton has decided to order about 2,000 more United States troops to Somalia to try to stabilize the country and has set a deadline of roughly six months for the withdrawal of all American forces, White House officials said today.
By setting a specific withdrawal date, Mr. Clinton hoped to ease Congressional pressure to end the Somalia operation immediately. The President also planned to spell out more clearly the precise goals he is setting for the American troops, who have been in Somalia for nine months on a mission that has already been extended and redefined. 
 "It is essential that we conclude our mission in Somalia but that we do it with firmness and steadiness of purpose," Mr. Clinton said today after two days of policy discussions with his top advisers. "We are anxious to conclude our role there honorably, but we do not want to see a reversion to the absolute chaos and the terrible misery which existed before."
 
Risky Strategy
 The emerging strategy includes the sort of timetable and definable, limited goals that the Congress has been demanding. But it also comes with great risks. If Somalia is not able to run its own affairs and feed itself, and the United Nations is not able to put together an effective military and logistical force to replace the Americans, a United States pullout would almost certainly result in a reversion to chaos there, a failure for which Mr. Clinton could be blamed.
Summing up the mood in the Administration, one White House official said: "You do what you can reasonably do to give the Somalis and the United Nations a chance to get on the road to recovery. We know it won't happen tomorrow. But if in a reasonable period it does not happen, at least we will have done what we can do."
The United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, appealed today to the United States and other countries with troops in Somalia to keep them there despite recent losses. At the same time the Secretary General announced plans for a stepped-up drive to promote political reconciliation and start the process of economic recovery when he visits Somalia and countries of the region next week.
Mr. Clinton will brief Congressional leaders on Thursday on his new strategy and then will outline it for the nation in a public appearance.
 
Clinton to Define Objectives
 He is expected to define the American objective as fostering a more peaceful and more secure environment in Somalia than the one that existed before the United States arrived, and one that is stable enough that a United Nations peacekeeping force, without American troops, can maintain order and continue the relief operations and the process of political reconciliation.
To realize that objective, Mr. Clinton is ordering several policy moves.
First, he will set a timetable for the withdrawal of American troops. The deadline will be no later than roughly six months from now, so other countries in the peacekeeping force do not decide to pull out before the mission has any chance of completion.
Officials said they want to send the message to Somalis that the United States is definitely not staying forever, in hopes of easing any Somali fears that the United States has colonial ambitions. They also want to make clear to the Somali leaders that the United States armed forces are not leaving tomorrow, in the hope of enlisting greater cooperation from them.
The message to the American Congress, officials said, is that the United States is not in an open-ended mission with undefinable goals.
Officials said the President has a fixed date for withdrawal in mind but he does not want to disclose it before he has a chance to consult with Congressional leaders.
 
Bush Sent First Troops
 The Bush Administration, which sent the first troops to Somalia in December, initially projected that the mission would be over in a couple of months.
As the Clinton team took over, they set a timetable to remove American combat forces by early fall and the remaining logistical units supporting other United Nations troops by the end of 1994. But that timetable presumed a relatively peaceful environment.
The second element in the strategy calls for the United States to spur Mr. Boutros-Ghali to act much more vigorously to put more United Nations troops from other countries into Somalia, so that the force that remains after an American withdrawal will be credible and effective.
American officials say they are convinced that other countries will come in if more pressure is brought to bear from the United Nations and if they are convinced that the United States is staying long enough for an effective hand-off.
 
'Tough' Message to U.N.
 They said the American delegate to the United Nations, Madeleine K. Albright, who took part in strategy sessions yesterday and today, was dispatched to deliver "a very tough" message in this vein to Mr. Boutros-Ghali. She was accompanied by Gen. Joseph P. Hoar, head of the United States Central Command with responsibility for Somalia, officials said.
Third, Mr. Boutros-Ghali is also being asked to use his influence to reinvigorate the process of political reconciliation among Somalis that had begun last year but was aborted in June, when the forces of Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid first attacked the United Nations peacekeeping force, killing 24 Pakistani soldiers.
American officials believe that the United Nations should press leaders of neighboring African countries with a stake in stability on the Horn of Africa, particularly Eritrea and Ethiopia, to take the lead in fostering this political reconciliation process so that it does not appear that the United States, or even the United Nations, is trying to impose a solution from the outside.
 
Peace Talks Threatened Aidid
 Two peace conferences have already been held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to nurture reconciliation among the Somali factions. American officials believe that General Aidid felt threatened by this process, which was developing alternative power centers, and that was why he went after United Nations forces in June. American officials concede, though, that they played right into his hands by allowing the whole political reconciliation process to be sidetracked by the manhunt for General Aidid.
Fourth, Mr. Boutros-Ghali is being asked to intensify his efforts to shift responsibility for logistical support of the 28,000-strong United Nations peacekeeping force in Somalia from American troops to civilian contractors who would be hired by the United Nations, or to the armies of other nations.
Fifth, in addition to increasing American troop strength in Somalia from the current level of 4,700 soldiers to between 6,200 and 6,700 troops, covert and overt efforts will be made to free the missing Americans.
Some 50 more armored Bradley fighting vehicles are also likely to be dispatched, along with the 650 fresh troops with tanks and other armored vehicles Mr. Clinton ordered to Somalia after Sunday's shootout in which 12 Americans were killed.
Although 65 House Republicans sent Mr. Clinton a letter criticizing his "indecisive and naive approach to foreign policy," for the most part tempers appeared to cool on Capitol Hill today.
 
Clinton Conferred With Senators
 President Clinton spoke on the telephone with his fiercest critic on Somalia, Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, and promised to rush a report on his policy to Congress. Mr. Byrd expressed satisfaction with Mr. Clinton's concession and agreed to put off a vote by the Senate to cut off funding for the military mission until the middle of next week at the earliest.
Senator Robert Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, rose on the floor to say that Congress should give the President time to define his policy before it cuts off funding precipitiously.
"It is not a time for panic," Senator Dole said. "I think we need to come to a resolution over what is happening in Somalia, but we should not do it in any way that would either now or later impact on the integrity and the honor of American forces."

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN;
Tests Added for Women in Health Plan

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 6

 BODY:
Responding to complaints from women's advocates, the Clinton Administration announced today that its health plan would pay for more frequent mammograms than it had originally recommended.
Donna E. Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, told the Senate Labor Committee that in addition to free mammograms every two years for women over the age of 50, the Administration had decided it wanted additional breast X-rays for women in high-risk categories, like those with a family history of breast cancer, to be fully paid by the program.
 
Worried About Bureaucracy
 When it gets the Administration's final proposal, Congress is expected to alter many details, and more liberal benefits for women's health concerns are politically inviting to many lawmakers. Last week, 36 women in the House urged Hillary Rodham Clinton to see that more generous standards were adopted. 
 Another complaint about the plan was answered today at the White House. The Administration trotted out its big economic guns at a news conference to rebuff charges that the health plan would hurt the economy and result in the layoffs of more than one million workers.
And at the House, Representative Jim Cooper, Democrat of Tennessee, and 45 colleagues proposed an alternative health care plan that would require no employer contributions to insurance premiums. It would make insurance available to everyone by regulating premiums and prohibiting insurers from refusing people with health problems. Mr. Cooper said their program would avoid building a new Government bureaucracy.
When Dr. Shalala appeared before the Labor Committee, she promised several times that the final version of the Administration's proposal would be ready in two weeks.
She said that the plan already provided twice as much as most insurance plans offer in preventive care, and that "the preventive part is free" for patients. But she was chided by several senators who want more preventive measures, like more frequent physicals for children, or nutrition counseling, in the plan.
But none of those issues affect as many people as women's health questions.
The women in the House have urged the Administration to follow guidelines set by the American Cancer Society, which recommends annual mammograms for women over 50 and mammograms every one to two years for women 40 to 50.
Dr. Shalala insisted that the Administration was acting on the best scientific evidence. "We're making these decisions now," she said, "and we're still in conversations both with the groups, with members of Congress. They are not finalized on this whole prevention package, but will be in the next two weeks."
She told Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, that she shared a concern that not enough has traditionally been done on women's health concerns. "You can be assured that both Mrs. Clinton and I are going to personally look at the package of women's health services that go into this package," Dr. Shalala said.
And she insisted that Administration decisions were not being made on the basis of cost.
 
Alternative Plan
 Representative Cooper, along with 26 other generally conservative Democrats, mostly Southerners, and 19 usually moderate Republicans, listed their disagreements with the Administration's plan. Besides requiring employers to pay for workers' insurance, these areas included a national health budget, price controls and continued tax deductibility for generous insurance plans.
Mr. Cooper's insurance purchasing cooperatives would have less authority than their counterparts in the Clinton proposal. Mr. Cooper contended that even without budgets and controls the improved level of competition created by the cooperatives would save money.
He insisted that under his plan "we should help all the poor and near-poor buy coverage." Mr. Cooper suggested that the Government raise the money by ending what he called excessive tax deductions. Noting that many of those who are not insured are well above the poverty line, he said the Government's obligation was to make sure that such people could buy insurance, and he said a combination of competition and restrictions on the ability of insurance companies to deny coverage would insure that.
At the White House news conference on the economy, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, head of the Council of Economic Advisers, said the Clinton plan would make American industries more competitive by preventing their health costs from galloping upwards. She also said the Administration's economic studies showed that the health plan would have a small effect, perhaps positive, perhaps negative, on the total number of jobs. It was impossible to give a precise number, she said.
Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, said the President's plan would make it easier for workers to move to better jobs because they would no longer have to worry about losing their health insurance. He also said the plan would encourage many people on welfare to return to work because they would not lose their insurance when they took jobs.
In arranging the news conference, the Administration wanted to make sure it did not make the same mistakes on its health plan that it made on the budget package in March and April, when it hardly responded when Republicans argued that the plan would devastate the economy and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. to Give Hanoi a $223 Million Loan

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 6

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund announced today that it would make a loan to Vietnam of about $223 million to help Hanoi rebuild the economy. The loan is another step in Vietnam's bid to become a fully integrated member of the world economy.
Last week Vietnam became eligible for new funds when it paid the I.M.F. about $140 million in arrears on previous loans, with the help of a group of donor countries, particularly France and Japan. That repayment was made possible when the United States dropped its opposition to the French-Japanese plan in July. 
 More funds for Vietnam are expected to come from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
In a statement, the I.M.F. said Vietnam has made "major progress" in moving toward a market-oriented system. The fund especially cited the move toward family-based farming, the liberalization of agricultural prices, reform of the tax system and the establishment of a two-tier banking system as positive factors.

HEADLINE: Gun in Home? Study Finds It a Deadly Mix

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 6

 BODY:
Instead of increasing protection, a handgun in a home almost triples the chances that someone will be killed there, a study of homicides in three metropolitan areas has found.
The conclusions of the study contradict the popular notion that keeping a gun at home increases personal safety, the researchers said today. 
 "This study is the first to clearly link the risk of homicide to the immediate availability of a gun," said Dr. Arthur L. Kellermann of Emory University in Atlanta, the lead researcher.
"In light of these results, people who are considering buying a gun for protection should think again," he said in an interview, "and families who keep guns in their homes should strongly consider getting them out of the house."
 
Findings From 3 States
 In a report in Thursday's issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, the researchers said they looked at homicides from August 1987 to August 1992 in Shelby County, Tenn., which includes Memphis, and in King County, Wash., which includes Seattle. Another team looked at murders in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, which includes Cleveland, from January 1990 to August 1992.
Studying 420 homicides that occurred in the homes of the victims, about a quarter of the total, the researchers found that a majority of victims, 76.7 percent, were killed by a spouse, family member or someone they knew, and that in 85 percent of cases there was no forced entry into the home.
Documented homicides by a stranger accounted for only 3.6 percent of the cases, although in 17.4 percent of the cases the identity of the killer was not known.
Gunshot wounds were by far the most common cause of death, killing half, or 49.8 percent, of the victims killed at home.
Even in the 14 percent of cases involving forced entry, which often involved a spouse or other family member, a gun in the home offered little protection, Dr. Kellermann said at a news briefing here.
 
Variety of Sources
 "Guns were not found to be associated with decreased risk of homicide in any subset, or subgroup, that we studied," Dr. Kellermann said, "even when we just looked at cases involving forced entry or cases in which the victim actively resisted the assailant."
To get a detailed picture of each household where a homicide occurred, the researchers said they not only examined reports by the police and medical examiners, but also interviewed surviving family members or others who knew the victim well. In addition, they developed a matching control group for comparison by interviewing an adult member of a randomly selected household in the neighborhood of the victim. Such a household included a person of the same age range, sex, race and economic circumstance as the victim.
Dr. Kellermann and colleagues at the University of Tennessee, the University of Washington and Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland found six risk factors for homicide in the home: living alone, having a household member who was ever arrested or who used illicit drugs, living in rental housing, having someone who was ever hit or hurt in a family fight, and keeping one or more guns.
Domestic violence and the use of illegal drugs were the strongest risk factors for domestic homicide. But even when these were factored out, the researchers said, they found that the risk of being killed was 2.7 times higher, or nearly triple, in homes with guns than in homes without them.
The National Rifle Association criticized the findings, saying that a study of homicides could not reflect the effectiveness of guns for personal protection. That is because "99.8 percent of the protective uses of guns do not involve homicides," said Paul H. Blackman, research coordinator for the group. Such uses, he said, would include brandishing a weapon to deter assault, holding an assailant at bay or firing a weapon to wound or frighten off an attacker.

HEADLINE: CLINTON'S HEALTH PLAN;
Bradley Asks U.S. to Confront Middle-Class Economic Fears

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 6

 BODY:
Hoping to prod the Clinton Administration into paying more attention to the economic anxieties of middle-class Americans, Senator Bill Bradley is arguing that the Government should guarantee all workers not just health care but also the opportunity for lifetime education and training and pension protection.
One of the most influential legislators on economic issues, Senator Bradley has been working for weeks on a speech addressing the insecurity that American workers feel in light of changing economic conditions. This anxiety underlies the strong opposition in Congress, particularly among Democrats, to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which the New Jersey Senator and the Clinton Administration strongly favor. 
 Senator Bradley plans to deliver the speech on Thursday to the Center for National Policy, a public affairs research institute here, and he discussed its elements in an interview today.
Four transformations, he said, are "running through the economy like a powerful river," promising long-term economic benefit to most Americans but threatening some workers' jobs.
 
Four Changes Listed
 He said the four changes are these:
*The end of the cold war, which has cost jobs in defense industries.
*International competition, which has opened markets for American exports but forced American workers to compete with those abroad who work for less.
*The increased demand in the workplace for knowledge and technology, which has left some low-skilled, poorly educated Americans behind.
*And the drive to lower the Federal budget deficit, which has meant that the Government is spending less on construction and other projects that would produce jobs.
"The one thing we can't do is hold on to the old ways, because if you simply hold on, you lose," the Senator said.
President Clinton, Mr. Bradley continued, is properly focusing on promising health care coverage for all workers. But he said the President had not paid enough attention to two other matters that contribute to workers' insecurity. They are "the inability to get access to the means by which you can get another job and a high-paying job, and the fear that you'll work 30 years and end up with no pension."
"The Administration could do more," the Senator said. "It's a matter of emphasis. It's not a matter of omission. It's a matter of raising people's consciousness of just how important this is in the overall scheme of things."
 
Influence With Clinton
 Senator Bradley has considerable influence with the Clinton Administration, not only because of his position as a senior Democrat on the Finance Committee but also because he is one of the President's most reliable supporters in the Senate and one of the few lawmakers who tackle sophisticated economic issues with the same relish as Mr. Clinton.
The Senator said he was not proposing specific new programs now but hoped his speech would start a debate within the Government about how to address the anxieties of the middle class. In the same vein, he said he planned to hold a series of Finance Committee hearings on pension issues.
Beyond guaranteeing health care, access to education and training and pension protection to all workers, Mr. Bradley said, the Government should generally stay out of business's hair and let the free market run its course.
With that in mind, he said, the Government should abolish the payroll taxes that workers and employers pay for Social Security, Medicare and unemployment insurance and replace them with some form of consumption tax. That, the Senator said, would make it less expensive for companies to create new jobs and hire new workers.

HEADLINE: Another Vote

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
While the Mayoral race captures the attention of most of New York City, another campaign is taking place this week. For the first time in the history of their migration to the continental United States, mainland residents of Puerto Rican ancestry will have a chance to voice their preference on the island's future -- whether it should remain a commonwealth, form an independent nation or become the 51st state.
The vote will begin today in polling places in schools, community centers and storefronts in New York, with other cities to follow over the next few weeks. It was organized by a group of mainland Puerto Rican politicians and advocacy groups who were angered by their exclusion from the island's Nov. 14 nonbinding plebiscite on Puerto Rico's political status. 
 So many organizers support commonwealth status, say supporters of statehood, that the statehood advocates are suspicious that the whole effort is intended to encourage support for a continued commonwealth.
The vote's organizers say members of the island's ruling, pro-statehood, party, have urged their followers on the mainland to boycott the vote. They say pro-commonwealth sentiment runs high on the mainland, especially among older voters who saw the island develop under its present status. Representatives of the statehood party deny urging a boycott.
 
Organization Criticized
 There have been persistent criticisms that the vote was poorly organized and rushed without reaching out to the scores of community groups that could help educate voters and turn out the vote.
The vote was organized this summer by the Coalition Pro-Puerto Rican Participation '93, a group of Puerto Rican elected officials and community advocates. In New York and other cities, they are being aided by local election boards, which will provide voting machines and tally the vote. Mainland Puerto Ricans who live where no formal vote is occurring can send in ballots that will be counted by the National Puerto Rican Coalition, a national advocacy group.
The results from different cities will be counted by the organizers, witnessed by representatives of the island's three political parties and its bar association. They have yet to set a date for releasing the final count.
In New York State, the vote will take place today through Saturday. Similar votes in Springfield, Mass., and Orlando, Fla., are slated for late October and early November. Balloting is also planned for New Jersey, in sites not yet announced, and Chicago.
 
Getting Out the Vote
 Although the turnout is not expected to be large, the organizers have run public service announcements on the vote, while some parties, most notably the pro-commonwealth Popular Democratic Party, have sent operatives to get out the vote in New York and other cities.
On Monday, Ruth Fernandez displayed the zest of a campaigner skilled at pulling both heartstrings and votes as she reminded a crowd of elderly people in Brooklyn just how far they had come from their childhoods in Puerto Rico.
The five dozen elderly men and women murmured and nodded in sad recognition as the 74-year-old singer and former member of the Puerto Rican Senate recounted how in her youth children went barefoot and hungry, and dark-skinned Puerto Ricans like herself faced discrimination. But progress, she said, came to the island through the economic and social benefits of its commonwealth status, one which she urged the crowd to reaffirm this week.
"Go to any Latin American country," she said as volunteers pressed pro-Commonwealth fliers into eager hands. "Who is the most advanced in education, health? Puerto Rico. You don't change what's good."
 
Word Slow to Spread
 Elsewhere in the city, campaign workers handed out fliers at subway stops and busy intersections while supporters of various political parties arranged information meetings.
Still, word has been slow to spread.
"Here all they talk about is Dinkins and Giuliani," said Martha Cuello, bringing home an armful of groceries in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. "I don't know about Puerto Rico; I just know about here."
But the organizers said that whatever the turnout, the vote would send a strong message that the mainland community is entitled to have their say on the island's dominant political issue. They argue that the Government of Puerto Rico has often courted mainland residents for their support on such important island issues as this year's fight to preserve tax breaks for American corporations doing business on the island.
They also say that the mainland community will play an important role in lobbying its Congressional representatives on the island's status, since any decision on Puerto Rico's future rests with Congress.
"We want to be involved and we have a right to be in on any decision that affects Puerto Rico on a permanent basis," said Manuel Mirabal, the coordinator of the Coalition Pro-Puerto Rican Participation '93. "By doing what we're doing now strengthens our position and right to be a part of that process."
Political analysts say they expect a modest turnout, not because of a lack of conviction on the issue but because of doubts about the referendum's usefulness. They say the mainland vote is seen by some as an effort by Puerto Rican politicians in New York to boost their own visibility and show the mayoral candidates that they can pull Puerto Rican votes.
"People want to participate in something that has concrete ramifications, not someone else's agenda," said Hector Cordero-Guzman, research director for political economy at the City University of New York's Center for Puerto Rican Studies. "People see it as cosmetic and they don't want to waste their time. I suspect there will be low participation, which is not a lack of interest as much as the process not having much credibility."
 
Little Debate, Ferrer Says
 The balloting will be open to registered voters who were born in Puerto Rico or have at least one Puerto Rican parent and can prove it with a birth certificate, passport or other official paper. Those lacking papers can sign an affadavit and vote, and those who are not registered to vote can register the day they vote.
Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President and a supporter of the mainland vote, acknowledged that there had been little time to educate voters on the implications. "I don't think there has been as much of a recent debate as I would like to see," he said. He would not say how he intends to vote.
While the clout of the city's Puerto Rican politicians allowed them to organize the local vote in time for October, advocates in other cities, like Hartford and Bridgeport, said they lacked the time and resources to hold a vote.
"If it is going to have any validity you have to have had enough time for discussion and consensus," said Edwin Vargas, Jr., education director for the Hartford Federation of Teachers and a member of the board of the National Puerto Rican Coalition.
Mr. Vargas, whose city is home to some 50,000 Puerto Ricans, said he supported the plebiscite in principle but warned that it would not be representative of the national picture.
Organizers said Chicago would be voting, but a number of community advocates there said they had yet to hear the details.
Mr. Ferrer countered that while other cities lacked the political resources to carry out the vote, voters could still send in their ballots. Further, he said, the lack of participation in other cities will not detract from the effort's impact, since New York is home to about 40 percent of the nation's mainland Puerto Ricans.
Angelo Falcon, president of the Institute for Puerto Rican Policy, has faulted such New York-centered comments as betraying an arrogance that diminishes any impact of the vote. He said the organizers, like Mr. Ferrer, seized on the emotional issue of the island's status to generate a higher profile for themselves.
"A group of these guys all sat down and figured out how they can get some mileage out of this thing, then found out they had to try to do something," Mr. Falcon said. "They were arrogant in not seeing the importance of this issue across the nation and that this goes beyond playing narrow political games."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The wisdom of managing trade is coming under scrutiny.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to trade, everybody knows that the Japanese are different, and that the only way to make economic peace with them is to dispense with the vague promises and insist on specific trade results.
Well not quite everybody. Last week an elite, mostly American group of economists (including four Nobel Prize winners) wrote to President Clinton and Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in preface to the Japanese leader's official visit, deploring America's drift toward a "results oriented" trade policy and pleading for a return to what might be called internationalism by the rules. 
 Why the harsh message? There is serious disagreement among serious economists about whether Japan's economic system creates unique barriers to trade, said Gary Saxonhouse, an economist at the University of Michigan and an organizer of the letter campaign. It galls him, though, that the results-oriented faction captured the Clinton Administration virtually without a fight.
The now-conventional wisdom about Japan goes something like this:
Japan has lowered formal barriers to imports to the point where, with a few important exceptions, the restrictions have little effect. But in the words of C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, "a very pervasive pattern of exclusionary practices" still makes it exceptionally difficult for foreigners to crack the local market.
In some cases, this pattern is laughably transparent: Washington State apples pampered to Japanese specifications are not likely to carry disease to the locally grown crop. More typically, the pattern is explained away by foreigners' failure to unlock the secrets of Japanese marketing.
Either way, though, the solution of choice is not issue-by-issue head-butting, but negotiated import targets -- tangible goals with tangible measures of success or failure. That's apparently why even soft-liners in the Clinton Administration -- notably Lawrence H. Summers in the Treasury Department -- want to hold Japan to a timetable for reducing its overall export surplus. And it explains why the hawks in Congress and the Commerce Department want to go further, "managing trade" to guarantee a minimum fraction of the Japanese market to foreigners and limiting Japan's trade surplus with America to a specific dollar figure.
Mr. Saxonhouse said, however, that "it is by no means clear who wins on anecdotes." Well-documented horror stories about America's own exclusionary trade practices filled "Fair Trade Fraud," a recent book by James Bovard, a former researcher at the Cato Institute. And the statistics-based research on the question of whether Japan is different is inconclusive.
Work by Robert Lawrence of Harvard University suggests that Japan does indeed import fewer manufactured goods than can be accounted for by the island's endowments of natural resources, capital and labor. And evidence from 12 individual industries just published by Mr. Bergsten and his colleague, Marcus Noland, supports the view that Japan is under-importing by about 30 percent.
On the other hand, parallel research by Mr. Saxonhouse places Japan's import behavior squarely in the middle of industrial nations. And those who care to look will find another dozen studies that come out on the Saxonhouse end of the argument.
Moreover, even if the "results oriented" crowd is right about the problem, they may not be right about the solution. If the Japanese are breaking the rules, Mr. Lawrence suggested, we have to be tougher about calling them to task. But "I don't think the managed-trade game is the right answer," he says.
Why are reputable economists ranging from Paul Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to Anne Kreuger, the former chief economist of the World Bank, so out of synch with a President who prides himself on his knowledge of the subject?
A simple explanation is that the Clinton Administration's trade agenda was hijacked early on by partisans: Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the President's chief economic adviser, made her reputation as a defender of managed trade. But the simple explanation isn't necessarily the right one.
An equally plausible view is that President Clinton is driven by the need to build coalitions to replace the crumbling New Deal amalgam. And managed trade neatly bridges the interests of diverse constituencies that Mr. Clinton courted during the campaign. After all, activist government appeals to the bedrock of the Democratic Party: trade unionists in steel, autos and other well-paid industries threatened by foreign competition. But it also intrigues Silicon Valley executives, whose support lent credibility to Mr. Clinton's claim to represent the New Democratic values of the suburbs.
Managed trade may thus prove a political winner. The unanswered question, though -- one Mr. Clinton is hardly the first occupant of the White House to face -- is whether good politics makes for good policy.

HEADLINE: A Disabled Child Is Seen More Likely to Be Abused

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 6

 BODY:
Disabled children are abused and neglected far more frequently than other children, according to a Federal study.
The report, by the National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect, is the first nationwide look at the extent of maltreatment among children with a physical, mental or emotional disability. 
 Researchers found that disabled children are physically abused at twice the rate of other children, sexually abused at nearly twice the rate and emotionally neglected at almost three times the rate.
Overall, children with disabilities are maltreated at 1.7 times the rate of other children. And in nearly half of those abuse cases, the child's disability was at the root of the abuse or neglect, according to the report by the agency, a part of the Health and Human Services Department.
In all but 14 percent of the cases studied, the maltreatment was either committed or permitted by a child's primary caretaker, who is generally the mother, the study said.
The study was based on reports of maltreatment, substantiated by child welfare agencies, involving 1,834 children.
The report underscores both the "tremendous economic and social pressures that are crushing" many families with a disabled child as well as the need to help them, said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, who sponsored the 1988 legislation requiring the study.
"Children are vulnerable," Mr. Dodd said in an interview. "But children with disabilities are the most vulnerable. It's terribly disturbing to realize that children with disabilities are being maltreated to such a high degree."
The researchers' findings are based on data collected from 35 child protective services agencies. Each agency provided information on all cases of substantiated maltreatment over a period of four to six weeks in early 1991.
Dr. Edward Schor, associate professor of pediatrics at Tufts Medical School, and Dr. James M. Perrin, associate professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, noted that caring for a disabled child can be expensive, stressful and physically exhausting.
Parents may also become isolated from friends, family and their community. "It just makes their situation and their ability to parent a little bit more fragile, a little bit more likely to take a direction that is not good for the child or good for their relationship with the child," Dr. Schor said.
For the study, children were considered disabled if they had one or more of a variety of mental or physical ailments and, because of the ailments, they were limited in mobility, self-care or expression.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL MEMO;
Two Candidates Present Two New Yorks

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT

 BODY:
In the New York City of Rudolph W. Giuliani's television ads, people live in fear. They worry about drug dealers, high taxes and bad schools. They are scrappy and strident, and their voice has a timbre that is straight out of Brooklyn.
They resent the implication that a vote for Mr. Giuliani has anything to do with race.
In the New York of David N. Dinkins's ads, people live in harmony. They favor conciliation and healing, and in times of trouble, they walk the streets together. They are optimistic and hopeful, yet, paradoxically, they see racial unrest as an ever-present possibility. 
 Their most pressing fear, it seems, is Mr. Giuliani.
Television advertising is, of course, only one of the means that the New York City mayoral candidates are using to try to get their message out to voters in this media-saturated city. But amid all of their appearances on the six o'clock news, at newspaper editorial board meetings, on radio talk shows and Sunday morning public affairs programs, their ads remain the candidates' clearest statement of their election strategies.
As such, they show that the two major candidates are waging campaigns that depend on very different senses of the city -- and its electorate. They also show how both candidates are trying -- sometimes subtly and sometimes not -- to capitalize on the city's racial antagonisms.
 
Two Views of City
 Mr. Giuliani's campaign is intended to appeal to a New York weary of crime, scared about job loss and eager for change. Polls show that this is a sizable portion of the city; a recent New York Times/WCBS-TV poll, for example, showed that 58 percent of all New Yorkers believe that the city is less safe today than it was four years ago.
Mr. Dinkins's campaign, in contrast, is intended to appeal to a New York that is proud of its liberal Democratic tradition, feels victimized by outside -- meaning Republican -- forces and believes that under Mr. Giuliani conditions can only get worse. This, polls suggest, is also a significant portion of the city; the same poll showed that 58 percent of New Yorkers blame Republican administrations in Washington for the loss of jobs in New York.
Many voters, particularly the undecided voters crucial to each side, may share both senses of the city; it is the goal of each candidate's commercials to make his vision somehow seem the more compelling one.
Both candidates began their advertising campaigns with positive commercials intended to give viewers some affirmative associations. But over the last few weeks both have moved firmly into the attack mode. And just in the last few days both Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Guiliani have introduced ads that criticize the other directly.
In his most recent ads the Mayor accuses Mr. Giuliani of waffling on the issue of abortion rights and, as a member of the Reagan Administration, working to undermine civil rights and environmental laws. In a separate ad, the Mayor stresses his own reputation as a conciliator, implicitly questioning his opponent's ability to keep the peace in troubled times. "Four years ago a great city chose the path of conciliation instead of confrontation," the narrator says in this ad, "and through both criticism and praise, David Dinkins has continued to work for peace, because in the end he knows that is the only way New York can live."
 
Surrogates on the Attack
 In his most recent ads, Mr. Giuliani -- through his surrogates -- tries to undermine Mr. Dinkins's image as a healer and accuses him of playing to what might be called reverse-racial fears. In one ad, Mr. Giuliani's running mate, Herman Badillo, running on the Republican and Liberal lines for city comptroller, says: "The Dinkins campaign is trying to make this an election about race because they want to avoid the issue of competence. One of his supporters attacked me for marrying a Jewish woman, and another stood right next to Dinkins and called Rudy Giuliani a fascist. And while people who support the Mayor are called proud, people who support Rudy and me are called racist."
Through what they say and what they do not say, each candidate's ads show what he -- or at least his campaign consultants -- believes to be his major strengths and weakness heading into November.
Mr. Giuliani's first ads, which were broadcast in early August, were clearly intended to "humanize" the candidate, who, in his last campaign, often seemed to come across as cold, even wooden. They showed the Republican-Liberal candidate playing with his children and reflecting on his family in gentle tones.
His next group of ads focused on the city's problems, fertile territory for the challenger. They featured ordinary New Yorkers, voicing their fears and frustrations, and, in the trademark style of Mr. Giuliani's media consultant, David Garth, they had a gritty, low-budget look that seemed to underscore the candidate's ties to financially strapped voters.
In a commercial focusing on crime, Paul Balsamo, a restaurant worker in Brooklyn, wearing an apron, said: "I remember when I was a kid Avenue N used to be lined with people sitting out in front of their houses or in front of their apartments at night to cool off. You don't see that any more because everyone's afraid to come out at night."
The Giuliani campaign in its ads has never laid out in any detail what the Republican-Liberal candidate would do to solve the city's problems, apparently believing that simply outlining the problems will suffice. "Giuliani's overall strategy is to present himself as calm, competent, in touch with ordinary people and to portray the city we live in as a disaster," said Phil Friedman, a consultant who worked on Andrew J. Stein's failed mayoral bid.
 
Listing Accomplishments
 Mayor Dinkins began his television ad campaign almost three weeks after Mr. Giuliani, at the end of August. He started out by trying to remind voters of the things that he has accomplished over the last four years -- and trying to blame others for what he has not. The ads, after the style of Mr. Dinkins's media consultants, David Doak and Bob Shrum, had a Madison Avenue feel, with inspirational background music, a soothing, baritone narrative and lots of children to personify hope.
"Along with the oath of office, they gave him a massive deficit, a hostile administration in Washington and a city at the boiling point," the narrator of one ad intoned. "He's balanced four budgets, cut waste, and in a recession, saved jobs by persuading companies like CBS and Prudential to stay in New York City." Another ad featured boys of many races playing ball on a lot the city has converted into a practice field, and a third showed a boy using a public library whose hours the Dinkins administration has extended. At the end of each one, a message of harmony -- "One City, One Future" -- flashed on the screen.
In his most recent commercials, Mr. Dinkins has shifted his attention to Mr. Giuliani. The shift seemed to represent an acknowledgement that the Mayor's record -- or at least the public's perception of it -- is not strong enough to win him re-election on its own and that to do that the Mayor will have to make his opponent seem an unpalatable choice. "If they're going to win this," one Democratic consultant said of the Dinkins campaign, "they have to turn this into an election about two bad choices."
Mr. Dinkins's negative ads -- which conclude with the tag line "Can we elect a man who's fought against everything we stand for?" -- portray Mr. Giuliani as the type of Republican that Democrats cannot in good conscience make Mayor. They show Mr. Giuliani looking awkwardly in the wrong direction, and are clearly aimed at the white, liberal voters who, polls indicate, may well decide the outcome of the election.
 
Accusation of Race-Baiting
 The latest campaign commercials to go on the air are the Giuliani ads accusing the Mayor of a minority candidate's version of race-baiting. These ads are aimed at the same white liberals, and intended to neutralize the notion -- voiced by President Clinton in his visit to New York -- that a vote for Mr. Giuliani is an implicitly racist vote. One ad features Mr. Badillo, another Mr. Giuliani's wife, Donna. "This election shouldn't be about race, it should be about competence," Ms. Giuliani says.
It is one of the rules of media politics that a negative campaign only becomes more so. As the candidates try to sway voters, viewers in both of their New Yorks, it seems, should be prepared for a television campaign that grows increasingly divisive as the election draws near.

Mr. Dinkins's commercials appeal to a city proud of its liberal Democratic tradition; Mr. Giuliani's appeal is to a New York weary of crime, scared about job loss and eager for change.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Bonds Trade in Tight Range

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The bond market was on hold again yesterday, with prices and yields bouncing around in a narrow range.
But the hold may be lifted tomorrow, when the Labor Department releases its September employment report. That data may give traders and investors an indication of whether interest rates should remain in their current trading range or break out in one direction or another. 
 A signal of slow economic growth, which could come with a report showing nonfarm payroll jobs rising just 75,000 last month, could get interest rates drifting lower again if inflation remains at a pace of just below 3 percent.
 
 
Biggest Worrry
 The biggest concern in the market right now seems to be that the employment data and the inflation data that follow the next week will be inconclusive. If this is the case, the bond market would stay in a narrow trading range, which is the kind of activity that not only bores traders but also makes it a lot harder to make money.
In late trading yesterday, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond was down 2/32 point, with the yield remaining unchanged at 6.01 percent. The 10-year Treasury note was up 4/32 point as the yield slipped to 5.31 percent, from 5.33 percent Tuesday.
Short-term notes and Treasury bills recovered from the losses yesterday in response to the unexpected increase of $2 billion in the size of the weekly auction of Treasury bills. The increased reliance on short-term financing to cover the Government's budget deficit had been expected. But the $2 billion increase came sooner and was larger than anticipated.
The price of the two-year note rose 1/32 point, with the yield dipping to 3.83 percent from 3.84 percent. The discount rate on the three-month Treasury bill was down to 2.96 percent from 2.99 percent.
 
 
Corporate Bonds
 Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's No. 1 retailer, sold $1 billion of corporate bonds yesterday; the issues were bought up fairly quickly.
Jon Winkelried, the head of the fixed-income syndicate at Goldman, Sachs & Company, the lead underwriter, said that the demand for the $250 million of 30-year bonds that Wal-Mart offered was another sign of the scramble for higher yields in a time of low or declining interest rates.
He also said that the overall interest in the sale signaled that some of the upward pressure on yields in the corporate bond market from recent issues may be easing a little.
He said that Wal-Mart chose a mix of 12-year and 30-year bonds because together they brought the maturity of the company's total debt to the average the firm is aiming for. Both maturities were new for the company, which is based in Bentonville, Ark.
The first portion of the issue was $750 million of 5 7/8 percent notes with a maturity date of Oct. 15, 2005. They were offered at a price of 99.617 to yield 5.92 percent, or 58 basis points more than yield on the current 10-year Treasury note. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
 
 
Second Part
 In the second part, Wal-Mart sold $250 million in 6 3/4 percent notes with a maturity date of Oct. 15, 2023. The price was 99.693 to yield 6.774 percent, or 60 basis points more than the yield on the 7.125 percent 30-year Treasury bond that is due in February 2023.
The corporate bond market has used the older 30-year Treasury bond as a benchmark for pricing long-term debt because underwriters do not have confidence that the new 6.25 percent bond properly reflects the yields at 30 years out. One reason for this concern is that with the Treasury issue of the new 6.25 percent bond last month, the Government cut the annual sales of 30-year bonds by about 40 percent, making supply a factor that could distort the performance of the bond.
Both issues were rated aa-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and AA by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Trades a Bit Lower As Dealers Await Incentives

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar ended slightly lower against other leading currencies yesterday as dealers awaited fresh incentives to step into the market. Trading was light.
Rumors that European central banks were selling dollars at 1.6300 marks to build German mark reserves kept the dollar from advancing beyond that level, while good buying interest at 1.6200 marks defined the United States currency's bottom. 
 "It's just the typical dollar malaise," Chuck Spence of Standard Chartered Bank in Los Angeles said. "With the dollar staying in the 1.6150-to-1.6500-mark range, customers really don't have any reason to hedge and all we get is interbank trading."
 
 
Thin Trading Band
 In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6225 marks, down from 1.6245 marks Tuesday. The dollar also slipped to 105.75 Japanese yen from 105.80 yen.
Dealers said they expect the dollar to trade in a thin band until important American employment data are released tomorrow.
There was little market reaction to news that an influential economist, C. Fred Bergsten, had urged the Clinton administration to fix the dollar at 100 to 110 yen.
Comments by Mr. Bergsten, whose views are thought to mirror President Clinton's, have roiled the currency market in the past.
Mr. Bergsten was speaking after releasing a report of the bipartisan Competitiveness Policy Council, of which he is a member. It suggested the White House reach an agreement with Japan or rich industrial nations to lock in the stronger yen to help United States competitiveness.
 
 
'Works for Everyone'
 But Mr. Bergsten said the report itself did not include a specific exchange rate target. Laura Tyson, the White House's chief economist and a representative on the council, did not contribute to the report.
"The Japanese won't tolerate the dollar below 100 and the Americans don't want it above 110, so 105 works for everyone," Frank Pusateri, vice president at Bank of Boston, said.
The British pound finished in New York at $1.5245, compared with $1.5145 late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
A new company's process excites investors in waste disposal.

BYLINE: By John Holusha

 BODY:
INNOVATIVE technology combined with a careful reading of rules governing the handling and disposal of hazardous waste may turn into a winning combination for a start-up company named Molten Metal Technology Inc. of Waltham, Mass. Early buyers of its stock have done pretty well, even though the company is not expected to earn any money for at least another calendar year.
Molten Metal made an initial public offering in February at $14 a share. The price slipped briefly to $10 in April but has been rising, more or less steadily, since July. The shares passed $20 in early August and have stayed over that level, closing yesterday at $23.125, down 37.5 cents in Nasdaq trading. 
 Why has Molten Metal attracted favorable attention even as the hazardous waste business over all has been slumping? Because Molten Metal's approach, if it works on a commercial scale, will allow customers to dispose of problem substances much more economically than if they had to treat them as hazardous waste.
Molten Metal says it can treat nasty stuff like polychlorinated biphenyls, better known as PCB's, and break them down into their chemical elements -- carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and chlorine -- which can then be recovered for re-use.
The value of the recycled substances is minimal. The market's enthusiasm for the process comes more from its potential ability to help users of the technology avoid a costly liability.
Once classified as hazardous, waste must be carefully handled and disposed of under complex government regulations. Thus, the technology could not only save companies the enormous cost of having to dispose of their hazardous waste, it should also free them from having to deal with mountains of paperwork and permits.
"People want to avoid disposal to the maximum extent possible," said Douglas R. Augenthaler, an analyst who follows the company for Oppenheimer & Company. "If you recycle, the waste is never a waste, it's a product, and so it is not regulated."
As the name might suggest, the core of the company's technology is a bath of molten metal, usually iron. The materials to be destroyed are injected into the bottom of the bath, and the mixture is heated to 2,500 to 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. At that temperature, even exceptionally stable compounds tend to break down into their basic components, which can then be drawn off as gases from the sealed system.
Molten Metal has built a commercial-scale demonstration unit in Fall River, Mass., and has begun testing the system on materials supplied by potential customers. But it has no intention of becoming a contract disposer of other people's wastes, as Chemical Waste Management is. Instead it plans to sell the devices to companies, like chemical producers, so that they can incorporate them into their own production processes.
One thing that has apparently impressed investors is the cmpany that Molten Metal keeps. E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company has invested in the Fall River plant and has closely followed the development of the technology. Molten Metal also has alliances with Fluor Daniel Inc., an engineering specialist unit of the Fluor Corporation; Am-Re Services, a big environmental insurer; L'Air Liquide, a French chemical company, and Rollins Environmental, which operates incinerators.
As with any new technology, the biggest risk is that it might not work as well in the real world as it appears to do in the laboratory. A crucial question is whether the process will cleanly break materials down into gases that can be separated or instead will generate large amounts of slag that have to be dumped in a landfill at a heavy cost.
"That's obviously the key question," Mr. Augenthaler said. "If it does not work, the stock is overpriced. If it does, it is a bargain."

HEADLINE: PRO BASKETBALL;
Across the Globe, Expressions of Regret and Gratitude

BYLINE: By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
From the "Say It Ain't So, Mike," headline in The Chicago Sun-Times to the special news report on Romanian television, Michael Jordan's abrupt retirement sent shock waves around the globe yesterday. And in a world where basketball has become a rare unifying force, the world reacted as one, with surprise, admiration, understanding and dismay.
The dismay may have been more pronounced in Chicago, where children cried and grown-ups groped for words, but Jordan's retirement was major news in virtually every international capital, confirming that Jordan is the world's most famous and admired athlete. 
 While the Bulls owner, Jerry Reinsdorf, was comparing Jordan to Babe Ruth, Romanian television in Bucharest sought a more locally compatible cultural metaphor, ending a special report with the lament, "Basketball without Jordan is like ballet without Maya Plisetskaya," the legendary Bolshoi ballerina.
 
The Tour Stops Here
 In the United States, there were predictable expressions of praise, regret and understanding, and some surprising insights.
At the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Mass., it suddenly struck a visitor from South Carolina that unlike, say, Martina Navratilova, who recently announced her retirement from singles tennis a year in advance, Jordan will have no farewell season.
"You know how sometimes people have a gift and you don't get to say thank you?" said Allen McCoy. "We didn't get a chance to say thank you."
It was a football player who focused on the special sense of loss to a generation of fans who have never known basketball without Jordan. "There's millions and millions of disappointed kids," said Lawrence Taylor, the Giants' linebacker, who also echoed the day's dominant sentiments.
"What more can he do?" Taylor said. "He's absolutely the best athlete to ever play organized sports."
 
 
A Question of Timing
 Like others, Taylor expressed admiration for Jordan's decision to walk away at the peak of his career. "No one could write a book or do a movie and do it better than this."
Maybe not, but encouraged by Jordan's refusal to rule out a comeback, some seized on the hope for a sequel.
At the Hall of Fame, Kenny Boucher, a Springfield resident, said he was sorry Jordan was going to retire, then added, "Maybe he won't for long."
The same hope was voiced by Magic Johnson in Geneva, Switzerland, where the former Los Angeles Laker is beginning an all-star tour.
"I think that Michael is a guy who probably wants to be left alone now," said Johnson, suggesting that Jordan would eventually return. "Maybe one year off and then come back to show everybody he's still king."
From all the hope that Jordan might some day resume his basketball career, there was an alternate line suggesting that Jordan might seek to become king of another hill.
"From what I've seen he's not ready for the tour yet, but it's amazing what you can achieve from desire and effort," said Payne Stewart, the professional golfer.
 
An Omen?
 Many basketball figures focused on Jordan's transforming contributions to the N.B.A. "His economic impact has been tremendous," said Charlie Grantham of the N.B.A. Players Association, describing Jordan as irreplacable.
George Raveling, head coach at Southern Cal, said Jordan might have given the public a hint about his thoughts not long ago in a commercial. "I reflect back to that Nike commercial where he is shooting by himself and wonders what it would be like if he wasn't Michael Jordan," Raveling said. "I wonder if that wasn't an omen of this whole event. Maybe there's more truth to that commercial than we realize."
Dean Smith, who coached Jordan at the University of North Carolina, endorsed his decision. "I personally think it's a good decision based on all he must go through and to certainly go out on top."
Phoenix Suns star Charles Barkley said winning a third consecutive N.B.A. title probably gave Jordan a sense of uniqueness after years of being compared with Magic Johnson and Larry Bird.
"I think Michael, once he won three championships in a row, in his mind that distinguished him above those guys, and there was nothing left for him to accomplish," Barkley said.
Even President Clinton weighed in, offering best wishes and adding, "We may never see his like again."
The President added that Jordan will be missed "in every small-town backyard and paved city lot where kids play one-on-one and dream of being like Mike."

HEADLINE: What Can Be Done for the New South Africa

 BODY:
To the Editor:
We commend the democratic sentiments of "South Africa, Outcast No Longer" (editorial, Sept. 26). Indeed, if Nelson Mandela's goal of helping to create a "united, democratic, nonracial and nonsexist country" comes to fruition, it will be an example not only for other states, but for the United States as well. 
 What concerns us is how this new country might be born, and who might want to abort such a birth. You state that a South Africa synonymous with "democracy, peace, human dignity and prosperity for all its people" will require "leadership and luck" and public investment.
Building a democratic South Africa will be long and arduous. Apartheid has left a terrible legacy. Blacks, and to a lesser extent Indians and coloreds, have been left out of the South African income pie. People of color have been marginalized in housing, education, health, access to wealth and in political power.
Whites, 15 percent of the population, own 87 percent of the land. Four white-owned conglomerates dominate the Johannesburg stock exchange. Blacks, who account for 75 percent of the population, own 1 percent of South Africa's businesses. Life expectancy and infant mortality rates for whites are comparable to Sweden's and for blacks to the poorest countries of the region.
How to turn this dismal picture around? Elections, it may be hoped, will bring relative peace and basic democracy, but they will not right the wrongs of centuries of racism and decades of apartheid. Outsiders should be asking: What kinds of economic programs and foreign investment will benefit the majority of South Africans? Who will participate in such decisions?
It is important to remember that in the years before sanctions and divestment became commonplace, foreign investment in South Africa helped a minority build and maintain its privileges, while a few large domestic and international companies profited. Little of this wealth trickled down to the majority. Blacks had no say where these investments went.
Without change in who has access to public and private credit, interest and pension funds, private sector and government contracts, public spending and asset ownership, little will change. If a new democratic government has austerity policies imposed upon it by international financial institutions, the aspirations of millions of South Africans will effectively be checked by an outside veto.
White South Africans attained high economic standing largely on the backs of blacks. Repentance is more than saying you are sorry, as President F. W. de Klerk has finally done. Archbishop Desmond Tutu says: "If you apologize for wrongs done, I have no way of judging the sincerity of your contrition . . . Deeds -- what you do after the apology -- is how this is judged. To say you are sorry means, almost automatically, that you make restitution."
The South African Council of Churches is stressing responsible reinvestment. It is calling on all South African and overseas investors to uphold worker rights; develop training and education programs; maintain safe and healthy working conditions; recognize representative unions and the right to strike; end all forms of racial, gender, political, religious and physical handicap discrimination; engage in environmentally responsible investment; invest in developing the productive capacities of all South Africans; uphold standards comparable to the best conditions in the relevant sector of the South African economy; work to empower black-owned businesses, and consult the communities in which they invest to develop social programs.
We need to be vigilant about those who would derail change. Evidence compiled by churches, the independent press, human rights groups and South African courts points to significant government involvement in the strife and violence racking township communities. People cannot speak and organize freely in some parts of the country. In the apartheid "homelands" of Bophuthatswana and KwaZulu, political activists and organizers fear for their lives.
For there to be free and fair elections next year, the international community must provide monitors of violence and the elections. Nelson Mandela's dream of a new South Africa is a call of hope, as well as a challenge to show our solidarity by our actions.

HEADLINE: Poverty and Callousness in America

 BODY:
The Census Bureau released some ugly data this week: The number of poor Americans rose last year and is now higher than at any time since the 1960's. Some observers dismiss the new data, saying the increase wasn't large and that year-to-year changes aren't important.
The small increase wouldn't be very important -- except for the fact that last year's experience is part of a disturbing story that's been unfolding for a decade or more. The proportion of Americans living in poverty -- for a family of four, that means living on less than $14,335 in 1992 -- is now 14.5 percent, which is only slightly lower than it was in the 1960's. Poverty is not decreasing -- despite Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, despite the economic boom of the 60's and despite the longest peacetime recovery ever during the 1980's. That's no statistical fluke. 
 There are many causes for chronic poverty, including sluggish productivity, persistent unemployment and sharp increases in the number of single-parent families. But the big villain is the steep slide in wages, adjusted for inflation, of the lowest-paid workers. That problem wasn't created by government and it won't be solved any time soon.
But government can extend a helping hand to the victims. Instead, Washington and state governments pulled back on welfare and unemployment benefits. More than 40 states, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, froze or cut back welfare benefits in 1992. This callous policy has hit children hardest. The richest country in history leaves nearly a quarter of its children poor -- including half its black children.
President Clinton's economic program offers some relief. The tax credit that he proposed and Congress passed will raise earnings of low-paid workers; his health care reform would extend coverage to millions of poor families. But more can be done. For example, the Federal program to provide emergency relief to the long-term unemployed expired this week and Congress is debating whether to extend it, though only to year's end.
For those who doubt what government can do, gaze north. Canada, like the U.S., stagnated during the 1980's; as here, low-paid workers in Canada suffered most of all. But in contrast to the U.S. pattern, poverty rates in Canada steadily declined -- testimony to its humane social welfare programs. The U.S. has the power to lift its citizens out of poverty; so far it has lacked the will.

Eric the Unemployed?

 BODY:
ERIC DICKERSON, the National Football League's second-leading career rusher, hasn't been waived after all by the Atlanta Falcons.
Tuesday night, Dickerson concluded he was being released after conversations with assistant coaches JUNE JONES and OLLIE WILSON. 
 Yesterday, the Falcons president, TAYLOR SMITH, and Coach JERRY GLANVILLE took turns labeling Dickerson's conclusion a "misunderstanding."
Both said he is welcome to remain with the Falcons, provided he accepts a role that will be further reduced beginning with next Thursday's game against the Los Angeles Rams.
"We told him his playing time wasn't going to be what he wanted," Glanville said. "That we were going to play the young guy, like we've been doing, and that the choice was his as to what he wanted to do. Needless to say, we were all shocked to read that he thought he had been waived. I think there was probably a misunderstanding." The 'young man' Glanville was referring to is ERRIC PEGRAM. (AP)

HEADLINE: U.S. Looking Ahead to Swell of Cuban Refugees

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 6

 BODY:
Acting on reports that the Cuban economy is on the verge of collapse, the Clinton Administration is drafting contingency plans for dealing with a potential wave of Cuban refugees, officials say.
A new task force of representatives of about 40 different Federal agencies met on Tuesday for the first time to "look at possible U.S. responses" to a political crisis in Cuba. 
 "Cuban society has reached the state of total exhaustion," said a report submitted to the State Department by experts from Florida International University. "When Fidel Castro leaves power, Cuba will be bankrupted."
Administration officials said the task force was a "working-level" group and that its work would "not touch on the basic U.S.-Cuba relationship."
 But the creation of the group is the Administration's first step toward developing a long-term policy for responding to the instability facing President Fidel Castro, whose 35-year grip on power has been severely weakened by the collapse of Communism and the loss of his patrons in Moscow.
Included in the group are the National Security Agency staff, the State Department, the Defense Department, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Coast Guard, the Federal Emergency Management Administration and the Agency for International Development.
"The focus will be on the kinds of scenarios that could produce a large 'out-migration' and other things would require a rapid response," said an official familiar with the planning who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Officials said they wanted to avert a crisis like the Mariel boatlift, which began when Mr. Castro freed waves of inmates from hospitals and prisons and allowed them to flee Cuba. The Carter Administration was ill prepared for the 125,000 refugees who sailed for the United States.
One Clinton Administration official involved in policy on Cuba said the group would take up a 1991 contingency plan developed by the Bush Administration as a starting point. The plan called for appointment of a coordinator of Federal efforts to deal with an exodus of Cubans; the interdiction of boats of refugees at sea; the detention of refugees in processing centers throughout the United States, and screening for illness and criminal records.
 
Cuban-American Pressure
 An official who attended the meeting said that various Federal agencies were asked to help update the 1991 report.
In recent weeks some Administration officials have complained that thinking about Cuba has been stunted by a desire to please the politically powerful constituencies of Cuban-Americans in Florida and New Jersey.
"People have been intimidated by the political pressure from taking out a clean sheet of paper and saying, what are our options," said an Administration official involved in Cuba policy. Some officials say that some kind of dialogue is needed with Mr. Castro or other political figures in Cuba if democracy is to be fostered there, despite the objections of many conservative Cuban-Americans to such contacts.
But, some officials say, a broader spectrum of views is emerging from Cuban-Americans that is allowing the Administration to start to expand its options.
Though the Administration has allowed American telephone companies to increase the volume of calls between the United States and Cuba and permitted more food and medicine to be sent to the island on a private basis, they say it is doubtful there will any significant easing of United States economic pressure on Mr. Castro's regime. "The tough part of the embargo is going to stay in place," said an Administration official involved in developing policy towards Cuba.
But American policy makers believe that with the collapse of the Soviet Union, which provided up to $1 million a day in subsidies to the Castro regime, the 32-year-old economic embargo has been transformed from a symbolic gesture into a blunt instrument that drives up the costs of Cuba's imports and further drains the country's meager foreign exchange reserves.

HEADLINE: Whitman Plan to Cut Taxes: Experts Taking It Seriously

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
By most accounts, Christine Todd Whitman committed a colossal political blunder when she proposed a $1.2 billion cut in income and business taxes for the financially strapped state of New Jersey. The states' editorial pages have heaped scorn on her plan and, according to polls, 70 percent of the state's citizens -- including a majority of her fellow Republicans -- simply do not believe that she can deliver on her promise to cut taxes.
But there is more to Mrs. Whitman's plan than an outlandish notion -- even though her Democratic opponent, Gov. Jim Florio, promptly labeled it a "voodoo re-do," a reference to Ronald Reagan and supply-side economics. Mrs. Whitman is not promising something for nothing. 
 Unlike supply-side enthusiasts, who theorized that steep cuts in income tax rates would pay for themselves painlessly by spurring the economy, she says she intends to slash spending a dollar for every dollar of tax relief. She would follow the course of governors in other states who have struggled to turn back the rising tax tide.
The true test of Ms. Whitman's plan is precisely how she proposes to curb spending and finance the tax cut. And the task is even tougher than it appears. She says she is prepared to pare 4.5 percent from the current level of spending over the next 18 months, but, despite Governor Florio's doubling of the income tax, the next year's budget may already be $1 billion or more in the red.
"The challenge for her is to say more concretely how she can get there," said David Kehler, president of the Public Affairs Research Institute of New Jersey.
But many economists and state budget experts say the glib comparison to Reaganomics is misleading. They say that in some circumstances state tax cuts of similar scope have in fact curbed the growth of state government. And they say lower taxes and smaller government can improve a state's economic performance, provided that cutbacks do not jeopardize the quality of education or the state's infrastructure.
 
'Looks Very Doable'
 "From what I've seen of the plan, it looks very doable," said Patricia A. Woodworth, Michigan's state budget director. "Given the magnitude of the program and the amount that needs to be saved, it looks not dissimilar to the kinds of things we've achieved in Michigan."
"I don't know anyone believes you'd shake the foundations of government if you did this thing," said Harvey Rosen, the chairman of Princeton University's economics department and a specialist in public finance. "My attitude toward Whitman's spending reduction is the same as toward Gore's reinvention of government. If the political will is there, it can be done." He noted that New Jersey now spends more per citizen than most other states,
His colleague, David Bradford, who did a study on New Jersey's economy, said that a quarter-century ago, New Jersey was "well known as a state where it was good to do business." Increasingly, he said, "that's been reversed and nowhere more radically than by Florio."
To be sure, Ms. Woodworth is a political appointee in a Republican administration.
Professor Rosen headed the tax analysis office in the Reagan Treasury, and Professor Bradford was a member of President George Bush's Council of Economic Advisers. Both support Mrs. Whitman's tax cuts.
But regardless of political stripe, economists tend to agree that it makes no sense to assume facilely that in the 1990's things would work in a state capital as they did in Washington in the 1980's.
A 30 percent cut in income tax rates over three years may be, as one Whitman economic adviser put it, "Kemp-Roth dusted off." But the Whitman plan does not rely on rosy revenue assumptions. "I built in no supply-side revenue flows, no big spurts in income or revenue growth," said Lawrence Kudlow, who devised the Whitman proposal. Mr. Kudlow, chief economist for Bear Stearns, was a ranking aide to David Stockman, Mr. Reagan's first budget director.
 
Deficits Not Allowed
 In Washington, of course, the Federal tax cuts never held down Uncle Sam's spending, as Mr. Stockman and other proponents predicted they would. But Steven Gold, director of the Center for the Study of the States in Albany pointed out that as governor, Mrs. Whitman could not run a deficit even if she wanted to. New Jersey's Constitution forbids it.
New York's experience may be relevant. A budget official in New York credits Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's $2 billion tax cut in the late 1980's for curtailing the growth of government even though the final round of tax reduction was canceled when the recession hit. "The changes in the tax law and threat of future changes have served as a brake on spending growth," the official said.
And unlike President Clinton, the governor of New Jersey is armed with a line-item veto and clear authority to withhold spending.
"It's a question of political will," said Feather O'Connor Houstoun, who served as New Jersey's treasurer for eight years under Gov. Thomas H. Kean. The governor of New Jersey has remarkable power, she said. "The question of whether it's an exercisable control or not gets back to the reasonableness of what the money needs to be spent on."
 
Political Skills
 In that light, New Jersey voters have to judge whether Mrs. Whitman has the political will, and the political skills, to put through substantial cuts in state government, or whether, to the contrary, the benefits of keeping taxes and government about the same size as when Governor Florio took office outweigh the costs.
As for potential benefits, Mrs. Whitman argues that cutting taxes on personal incomes and businesses is the cure for the state's lagging job growth and an exodus of manufacturers. While experts say her claim that the tax cuts would create 450,000 new jobs is absurd -- that figure is more than the number of unemployed people in the state -- several said lower taxes could improve the economy's health.
Mr. Gold is skeptical of Mrs. Whitman's proposal because she has yet to outline specific cuts, but he pointed out that a similar tax cut program worked in Delaware. That state slashed its income tax rates in the early 1980's and again in the late 1980's.
Delaware's first round of tax cuts was as ambitious in magnitude as Mrs. Whitman's, reducing state revenues by roughly 3 percent the first year. Though Gov. Pete du Pont's plan was enacted while the economy was expanding, the actual cuts took place during a harsh recession. The state, which had run chronic deficits for a dozen years, balanced its budget partly with cuts and partly by dipping into a rainy-day fund.
"We did benefit, and the benefit was also perceived by those who kind of felt forced into supporting it," said Weston Nellius, then Delaware's Secretary of Finance. "The whole business climate of Delaware turned around." And its economy, weathered the recession better than surrounding states, he said.
Of course, it is hard to say whether something that worked in one state would work in another. While studies of tax changes at the Federal level suggest that their net effect is small, the few statistical studies of how changes in state income tax rates affect the states' economies have found that low tax rates promote growth, though how much growth remains unclear.
"It's easier to move from New Jersey to New York than it is to move from New Jersey out of country," said Professor Rosen. "Therefore, it makes it a heck of a lot more plausible that taxation can affect the level of activity in the state."
Cuts in business taxes -- including a corporate tax surcharge, a truckers' tax and a telephone tax -- account for about a third of the Whitman tax-cut proposal, although they have so far received little attention. Research studies have shown that businesses really do look at taxes in deciding where to locate. A new study, for example, has found that when foreign businesses locate in this country, they are very conscious of a state's tax environment. "It makes the story about growth more plausible," Mr. Rosen said.
 
Comparable Cuts
 According to Ms. Woodworth, the budget director, Michigan's budget was cut by a comparable amount, closing mental hospitals, double-bunking prisoners and imposing a state hiring moratorium and a pay freeze. The state did not, however, squeeze education spending.
In Massachusetts, Gov. William F. Weld, who refused to raise taxes to balance the budget, cut spending by 6.5 percent. "We didn't have the ability to give tax relief other than repealing the state sales tax on services and making sure that the scheduled income tax cut went through," said Dominick Slowey, assistant secretary for administration and finance. Spending was shifted toward infrastructure, job training and preventive health services, he said; this year the state is cutting business taxes.
At least one study has found that whether tax cuts help or hurt an economy can depend on how the budget is cut. If both taxes and benefit programs are cut simultaneously, the spur to income growth can be substantial. But if taxes are cut and so is spending on edcuation and infrastructure, growth can actually slip.
"One of the things that attracts employers to New Jersey is a well-educated work force and good infrastrucure," said Alan Krueger, a labor economist at Princeton. "I'd want to be assured that the cuts aren't going to affect those."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about Christine Todd Whitman's tax-cutting proposals in the New Jersey campaign for governor referred incompletely to two Princeton scholars, Harvey Rosen and David Bradford, who spoke favorably of her plan. Both Mr. Rosen and Mr. Bradford belonged to Mrs. Whitman's Economic Recovery Council, but they attended no meetings and did not help draft the plan.

HEADLINE: A Higher Alcohol Tax Should Pay for Health

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 I agree with the recommendation of President and Mrs. Clinton that there should be still more substantial taxes on tobacco products to pay for the health care for all Americans that they propose (front page, Sept. 23). 
However, it is difficult to accept their reluctance to tax alcoholic beverages more substantially. One argument in support of this inconsistent policy is that, while tobacco is harmful to health whether it is used moderately or excessively, alcohol in moderation is probably not harmful.
 But, logically, this argument should lead to recognizing the need for higher taxes on alcohol.
 Consider, for example, an additional tax of $1 a quart on hard liquor. At approximately 20 shots to a quart, the moderate drinker of, say, one or two shots a day would be taxed an additional 5 cents or 10 cents, hardly an onerous penalty compared with that for moderate smoking.
 More significant, the effect on the heavy drinker could only be beneficial. Either he or she would be forced to cut down on consumption or to contribute more to the medical expenses that are caused by excessive drinking, including those that are the result of drunken driving and other "accidents."

HEADLINE: Whitman and Florio Spar in a Civilized Gubernatorial Debate

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
In a debate civilized in its tone but full of pointed attacks, Gov. Jim Florio, the Democratic incumbent, and Christine Todd Whitman, his Republican rival, sparred tonight before a statewide television audience.
The debate was the first time since the general election campaign began in June that voters statewide had the chance to compare the candidates side by side and to get more than the one-sided information that could be gleaned from either candidate's ads. 
 With two more debates to go, Mr. Florio and Mrs. Whitman each seemed more content tonight to poke at the other than to try to deliver a knockout blow before the audience in the Trenton studio of WPVI-TV of Philadelphia.
The format of tonight's debate, which was also broadcast on WABC-TV in New York, was not conducive to drawn-out slugfests between the candidates, but each tried to score points by questioning the other's leadership abilities, veracity and ethics.
 
Carefully Scripted Responses
 Whatever the question put to them by a panel of reporters based in New Jersey, Mr. Florio and Mrs. Whitman each reacted with carefully scripted responses intended to provide safe political ground and positions from which to launch an attack at the opponent.
That made for few surprises until the closing moments of the debate, when Mrs. Whitman tried to outmaneuver the Governor with a challenge that they declare a moratorium on negative campaigning during the last three weeks of what has become an increasingly nasty race.
"It's become very clear that we need to change the way we govern and the way we campaign," Mrs. Whitman said. "So I'd like to offer a challenge tonight. To date, Governor, you've spent almost $2 million in negative advertising on me. I propose that starting next week, we ban all negative ads, that from now forward it's you talking about your record and what you're going to do for the future, and me talking about my economic program for the state of New Jersey."
Mr. Florio initially ignored her challenge, but when pressed by one of the co-moderators he said: "I'm telling you we have not been having negative advertising. Taking about the record may seem negative to Mrs. Whitman. What we're talking about is the facts, and Mrs. Whitman is not comfortable with that."
After the debate, Mrs. Whitman's chief political strategist, Edward J. Rollins, said the offer was sincere, but he also indicated that the campaign was prepared to escalate the war of negative campaigning.
"We have offered the voters an opportunity and offered the Governor an opportunity to have a different type of campaign," Mr. Rollins said. "I hope he takes us up on it. But we reserve the right to fight the fight the way it's fought."
 
Debate Over, Battle Resumes
 The sharp blows that were missing from the debate began landing only moments after it ended, with both campaigns rushing to hand out news releases documenting the other side's "lies."
After the debate, the candidates stood on opposite sides of the studio platform, each surrounded by a throng of reporters.
"I'm very happy," Mrs. Whitman said. "It was an opportunity for once to be side by side with the Governor and when he starts his spin on things to be able to put my own right back on it and try to set the record straight."
Mr. Florio said the debate clearly showed the differences between him and Mrs. Whitman.
"The debate was a good debate," he said.
 
2 Debates Required by Law
 Tonight's face-off, sponsored by the New Jersey League of Women Voters, was the first of two debates required by law because both candidates have accepted public financing for their campaigns. The second is scheduled for Oct. 19, sponsored by the New Jersey State Chamber of Commerce and to be broadcast live over WCBS-TV (Channel 2) in New York City, WCAU-TV (Channel 10) in Philadelphia and the New Jersey Network, the state-supported public television system.
The candidates have agreed to a third and final debate on Oct. 24 on WNBC-TV (Channel 4) in New York City.
Until tonight, when Mrs. Whitman and Mr. Florio have appeared at the same gatherings, they have taken pains to avoid face-to-face meetings. When circumstances have placed them at some event at the same time, one has waited out of sight until the other departed.
The debate opened with a reference to an issue seemingly more relevant to a Presidential debate: the fighting in Somalia. Mrs. Whitman offered condolences to the families of the two New Jersey soldiers killed there this week. Mr. Florio did the same, noting that he had called the families of the victims to extend sympathy for the state as a whole.
It was an early and deft example of how the power of incumbency helped Mr. Florio in the debate.
With 30 years in elected office, Mr. Florio clearly held the upper hand on questions of policy. But Mrs. Whitman was able to hold her ground, presenting herself from the opening question as an outsider who would change government in Trenton.
"I haven't spent the last 30 years running for office," she said. "That means that I have a standard that I work to; that's the ability to come home at night and tell my children they can be proud of everything I have done and said over the day."
The candidates were questioned by the panel of reporters -- Darlene Superville of The Associated Press, Nora Muchanic of WPVI-TV and David Navarro of WABC-TV -- along with the news anchors from each television station, Bill Beutel of WABC-TV and Jim Gardner of WPVI-TV, who acted as moderators.
Both candidates found themselves on the defensive early from questions that zeroed in on weaknesses in their campaigns. For Mrs. Whitman it was an economic plan short on specifics, in which she pledges to cut nearly $1.5 billion in taxes in the first three years of her administration. For Mr. Florio it was the record $2.8 billion tax increase he ushered in three years ago.
Pressed to give specifics on her tax-cut proposal, Mrs. Whitman gave Mr. Florio his clearest shot of the night when she said she would focus on government waste and cited as an example what she said was the State Department of Corrections' purchase of Adidas athletic shoes for prison inmates.
"There are plenty of ways to do it," she said. "I expect the Governor to say the world is going to end if we try."
Mr. Florio was swift to ridicule his opponent's response and plan.
"One and a half billion dollars of sneaker is a lot of sneakers," he said. "Tonight we hear the first degree of specificity -- Adidas sneakers are going to be cut."
But for every criticism of her plan, Mrs. Whitmanhad an assault on the Governor's tax increase.
 
'Deep Denial' on Taxes
 "I expect the Governor to be in deep denial about cutting taxes; he's never met a tax hike he didn't like," she said.
Each candidate was given a minute to answer questions and 45 seconds to rebut the opponent during the hourlong debate.
The most contentious moment of the evening came during a question over the state's ban on semiautomatic weapons. It is an issue on which the public rates Mr. Florio the strongest, and one he has tried to make a central theme of the gubernatorial race by portraying Mrs. Whitman as sympathetic to efforts by the National Rifle Association to overturn the ban.

HEADLINE: Gonzalez Intensifies Battle With Fed

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, chairman of the House Banking Committee, began a push today to change the Federal Reserve System so that the President would be given more power to appoint the central bank's officials.
Mr. Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat, focused in particular on the presidents of the Federal Reserve's 12 regional banks, who are now chosen by boards dominated by local bankers and business executives. Calling the practice undemocratic, Mr. Gonzalez said these officials, who help shape the nation's monetary policy, should be named by the President. 
 Mr. Gonzalez has pressed such proposals before, and they have been perenially popular with many Democrats in Congress, who see the Fed as out of tune with the public's desire for faster economic growth.
But this time he is making his biggest push to turn the ideas into law. In the first of four days of Banking Committee hearings, Mr. Gonzalez was joined by several other Democrats, who agreed that Fed officials should represent the public and that Fed operations should be more open.
A bill introduced by Mr. Gonzalez would require the central bank to release detailed minutes a week after its policy-making meetings, instead of the vague summaries that are now released six weeks afterward.
He has called Alan Greenspan, the central bank's chairman, to testify on Wednesday about the House and Senate proposals to change the Federal Reserve's structure.
Fed officials say Mr. Gonzalez's proposals could threaten the central bank's independence, and they warn that the financial markets might see them as weakening the Fed's ability to fight inflation.
Mr. Gonzalez sees things otherwise. "The changes I am proposing to the Federal Reserve System are quite modest," he said. "There is nothing to fear. I am not seeking to politicize the central bank nor take away its independence."
Two weeks ago, President Clinton sent Mr. Gonzalez a letter saying he was "disinclined" to support the proposal, saying the Fed was operating well. But some legislators say one of the many bills to change the Fed could squeeze through Congress.
Representative Kweisi Mfume, Democrat of Maryland and chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, strongly backed Mr. Gonzalez's proposals, arguing that having the President appoint, and the Senate confirm, regional bank presidents would lead to more diversity by race and sex. Mr. Mfume released a study showing that only a small percentage of top officials working for the Fed and its banks are female, black or Hispanic.
Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland and vice chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, testified in favor of his proposal to strip regional bank presidents of their votes on the Fed's main policy-making group, the Federal Open Market Committee. At each committee meeting, five of the Fed's regional bank presidents have votes, while the others are cast by the Federal Reserve Board's seven members, who are appointed by the President.
"Although most Government agencies, including the Fed, make extensive use of private citizens as advisers," Mr. Sarbanes said, "in no other agency is actual decision-making power vested in individuals who are formally accountable to private parties instead of to the public."

HEADLINE: Health Insurance Data Called Faulty

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
The White House estimates of insurance costs for individuals and families in President Clinton's health plan were sophisticated guesses based on incomplete and largely outdated information. That is the conclusion of actuaries from several large accounting organizations who reviewed the estimating process for the Administration.
The actuaries said the estimates were probably as accurate as possible, given the surprising dearth of up-to-date information on medical costs for various groups. But health care experts warned that the nation should be aware of the uncertainty over future insurance costs as it debates how to extend universal coverage and overhaul the health care system. 
 The Administration estimates that the standard package of benefits it wants to guarantee for all Americans would cost an average of $1,800 a year for individuals and $4,200 for families, at projected 1994 prices.
 
Significant Figures
 These figures are central to the financial viability of the plan, in turn determining the size of the Government subsidies that would be required to help low-income people and small and low-wage companies pay their share of the premiums. The White House estimates that $80 billion in subsidies would be required in 1997.
If the premiums turned out to be understated, the subsidies would be higher and the burden would be heavier for taxpayers and businesses, with far-reaching political implications.
A group of actuaries and an economist from an accounting concern who were consulted by the White House said in interviews that the premiums had been estimated on the basis of correctly applied economic modeling. But several said the information available to construct the models was not fully current and comprehensive.
Richard Ostuw, the chief health care actuary of Towers Perrin, a large benefits consulting firm, said the outside advisers were still reviewing the premium numbers.
 
Estimates May Be Omitted
 Indeed, Richard Kronick, a senior White House health care adviser, said the current premium estimates would probably be omitted when the President sends the plan to Congress in a few weeks. He said the proposal might include only "the methodology for getting to the numbers."
The outside actuaries were called in last spring, after two Government health care agencies produced cost estimates that were tens of billions of dollars apart.
"Because of the nature of the health care industry and the many self-funded employer health plans, it is virtually impossible to collect the data," said John Bertko, an actuary who volunteered to review the process.
"It comes down to a leap of faith," said Linda Bergthold, a principal with William M. Mercer Inc., a benefits consulting firm, who spent four months as co-director of a White House group that developed the Clinton proposals. "Most people probably don't appreciate how difficult it is to get good numbers."
The latest comprehensive National Medical Expenditures Survey, for example, is six years old, so it does not reflect recent, far-reaching changes in health care, said Mr. Bertko, a partner in San Francisco with Coopers & Lybrand, a Chicago accounting firm.
Information about health spending in most states is even more outdated. The last detailed Government survey of the states was in 1982.
Although the Administration issued new state health spending numbers this week, experts said the information, which was pulled together from a variety of sources, including a hospital trade association, was not precise enough to be used in setting premiums.
The actuaries said the Administration also had relatively little hard information to help estimate the costs of covering people who are now uninsured. And they struggled to reconcile widely varying estimates of the cost of bringing low-income Medicaid recipients into the general health system.
The premium numbers have been criticized as low in comparison with what many employers now pay. But there are important differences between offering basic coverage to all Americans under the age of 65 and the plans that many employers now offer, the actuaries said.
For one thing, many of the uninsured are young and healthy, so their health costs would bring down the averages.
Even the 2.5 million people with health problems who have been rejected by insurers can be absorbed when their costs are spread across large groups, Mr. Bertko said. "Even in California, where costs are high," he added, "people who are considered uninsurable are only three times as expensive, on average, as other people."
The outside advisers did not challenge the $1,800 and $4,200 estimates, which were based on 1994 projected costs for traditional fee-for-service medical care, not for people in prepaid H.M.O.'s. Indeed, several said they felt reasonably comfortable with the results, given the many limitations.
But contrary to what the President seemed to imply in a carefully worded paragraph of his Sept. 22 address to Congress, the actuaries have not endorsed the overall financial assumptions in the White House proposal.
"The group will be providing a document, probably within the month, summarizing the process and what we looked at and the items we did not look at," said Brent Greenwood, a principal in Minneapolis with Tillinghast, a unit of Towers Perrin.
 
'Poetic License' Suggested
 Mr. Clinton said in his speech: "We gave these numbers to actuaries from major accounting firms and major Fortune 500 companies who have no stake in this other than to see that our efforts succeed. So I believe our numbers are good and achievable."
Ken Porter, chief actuary of the E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company, suggested that the President may have been exercising "poetic license." The volunteer actuaries were "never asked to support the policy," Mr. Porter said. "They were looking for our expertise: did the numbers hang together?"
Last spring, when Government economists and actuaries were unable to make their estimates of future health costs match, Ira C. Magaziner, the chief White House health policy adviser, sent an S.O.S. to Mr. Ostuw of Towers Perrin, where Mr. Magaziner had worked for a time after selling his own consulting firm to Towers.
With help from the American Academy of Actuaries, a professional group, Mr. Ostuw enlisted five fellow actuaries and an economist, Jack Rodgers, who works in the Washington office of Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm.
Members of the group said they helped to reconcile a wide gap in estimates between two agencies, the Office of the Actuary of the Health Care Financing Administration, which runs Medicare, and the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research in the Public Health Service.

HEADLINE: A New Breed of Merger Banker

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Way back in the 1980's, when mergers were all the rage on Wall Street, the names of those involved in the deals occasionally eclipsed the companies that were being combined.
Today, even though business could scarcely be better -- last quarter was the busiest ever in terms of the number of announced transactions -- there is less focus on the personalities behind the deals. 
 For one thing, merger and acquisition fees contribute far less than they once did to Wall Street's bottom line. And the deals make more sense.
The Columbia Healthcare Corporation's plan to purchase the HCA-Hospital Corporation of America strikes many as a smart consolidation. Likewise, whether QVC Network Inc. or Viacom Inc. wins Paramount Communications, both have a lot to offer as potential partners.
As a result, brash young superstars have been supplanted by seasoned specialists, bankers who have spent years dealing with a particular industry, its economics, its people. Telecommunications, media, health care and chemicals, industries in which consolidation is crucial to long-term success, have been particularly busy.
Focusing on four bankers in a world that remains full of sizable egos is dangerous business. But these four were cited by a number of sources as being some of Wall Street's hottest hotshots.
 
John L. Garcia
Chemicals
 Unlike many investment bankers who get on-the-job training in the industries they cover, John L. Garcia, a managing director at Wertheim Schroder & Company, knew scads about the chemical business before he ever did his first deal.
A native of London, he holds an M.B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business and a doctorate in chemistry from Princeton. Mr. Garcia, 37, also spent six years in a variety of jobs at ARCO Chemical before he ever got to Wall Street and another six as Wertheim's senior chemical industry analyst before he moved from research to corporate finance.
Now, after 18 months as a banker, Mr. Garcia said his background was proving invaluable. "It's a necessity to have industry expertise in investment banking," he said. "Because as the companies become more sophisticated themselves they can do the valuation work" once done by investment bankers.
Mr. Garcia is part of a 15-member group at Wertheim that covers the chemical industry worldwide. In the last year, Mr. Garcia said, his team participated in about 10 merger deals in the industry -- the largest was the recently announced sale of Texaco's chemicals division to Huntsman Chemical for just over $1 billion.
His detailed knowledge of the industry has helped pry loose clients who were otherwise spoken for by better-known investment banks.
"To the extent we are competing with a Goldman or a Morgan Stanley, firms that have senior old-line relationships, it is very hard for an investment bank like Wertheim to penetrate unless we have something really unique," he said.
That means young, aggressive bankers should be prepared to spend time learning the ropes.
"You need both the idea generation capability and the contacts," Mr. Garcia continued. "That usually means you have to pay your dues for 10 years before you get there. I don't think you will see 25-year-old whiz kids running industry groups."
 
 
Eduardo Mestre
Telecommunications
 When Eduardo Mestre left Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton in 1977 for Salomon Brothers, he was one of many bright young professionals who gave up the law to seek gold on Wall Street.
The plan was to have him ply Latin America for deals. His father had been a prominent Cuban businessman who brought television to the island in the 1950's, fled to Argentina in 1960 after Fidel Castro came to power and established another television network there.
But in 1982, the debt crisis exploded and put the Latin America plan on hold. Mr. Mestre, 44, struck out instead after what has proved to be a most dynamic industry: telecommunications.
He was barely out of the blocks when Salomon asked him to work with the group advising A.T.& T. on the divestiture of its local telephone companies. Mr. Mestre was hardly an expert, but back then the telecommunications business was still rather young, and virtually everyone else was in the same boat. Since then, he has participated in some of the biggest deals on record.
Salomon served as an adviser, for instance, to both sides in the recent, $650 million sale of Hauser Communications Inc. to Southwestern Bell, the first plunge by a Bell company into the cable television business. This summer, Salomon won a piece of the $17.6 billion sale of McCaw Communications to A.T.& T., serving as co-advisers to McCaw's independent directors.
"Six or seven years ago, companies hired bankers because they knew the technology of the deal," Mr. Mestre said. "They get hired today because they come up with a good idea or know their way around a particular industry not because they know about Delaware's takeover statute."
Now a co-head of domestic corporate finance at Salomon, Mr. Mestre shows little inclination to stop knocking heads with the competition. Jeff Williams, head of Morgan Stanley's telecommunications group, is probably his most formidable foe, he said.
"What I like about the telecommunications business is that it is truly global," he said, "and if you like to do deals, they tend to be large."
 
 
Enrique F. Senior
Media
 Enrique F. Senior has spent the last 20 years doing media deals at Allen & Company, the investment bank boutique of choice for the entertainment industry. But the way the industry is evolving, he acknowledged that someday there may be no deals left to do.
"The structure of the business is going to be clearly vertically integrated, global and concentrated," he said.
At the moment, Mr. Senior's firm is actively engaged in a battle that many would love to be waging: a battle between two would-be consolidators, Viacom and QVC, over Paramount. His firm is advising QVC, the hostile bidder.
Long an adviser to Viacom's chairman, Sumner M. Redstone, Allen & Company became available to QVC once Mr. Redstone turned instead to Smith Barney Shearson for advice.
Such scrambling to be part of an entertainment deal would have been almost unheard of back when Mr. Senior, a 50-year-old Cuban emigre, who attended Yale and the Harvard Business School, hopped from White Weld & Company to Allen & Company in the 1970's.
"Nobody was really interested in the movie companies," he said. "There was a feeling the accounting was suspect, that you couldn't trust it. And there was a lack of understanding of how the business worked."
To Mr. Senior, there are two keys to a good media deal: knowing the people and understanding the numbers.
Even as entertainment companies are ending up in fewer -- and bigger -- hands, Mr. Senior said he had few doubts that the worldwide frenzy over owning a piece of Americana would ebb.
"When you think about the demand for American entertainment and American-type things, it surprises you the impact this culture has around the world," he said.
 
 
Frederick Frank
Health Care
 When Frederick Frank started covering the health care industry 35 years ago as a young research analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company, the firm's interest in the area was so tepid that it lumped health care with chemicals.
"I told the head of the research department at the time, this doesn't make sense," recalled Mr. Frank, who volunteered to start following the drug companies.
Mr. Frank left for Lehman Brothers in 1969. And because he knew so much about the growing health-care field, he made a leap many young analysts dream of making: just three years later, he started doing deals -- not just writing about them.
Today, he heads a team of 26 professionals -- one of Wall Street's largest groups devoted exclusively to making deals happen in the health care industry. The group includes his wife, Mary Tanner.
The group has landed more than its share of business. For instance, Lehman advised Bristol-Myers on its merger with Squibb, and earlier this year, it helped Humana Inc. sever its hospital business from its health maintenance organization business.
Given the growing pressure to make the industry more efficient, Mr. Frank said he was confident more deals would follow.
"The industry is going through a sea change on an order of magnitude that has not been experienced in the 35 years I have been in the business," he said.
One might assume that it would take someone younger than Mr. Frank to keep up, and certainly at age 61, Mr. Frank is something of an anomaly in Wall Street's trenches.
But the constant travel, the deals, the contacts seem to be a tonic, not a grind. "I came into this industry vertically, and I'll go out horizontally," Mr. Frank said. "I expect to be continuing to do this for a considerable number of years."

HEADLINE: Business Leaders Voice Skepticism on Health Plan

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WILLIAMSBURG, Va., Oct. 7

 BODY:
The chief executives of some of the nation's largest corporations expressed strong skepticism today about President Clinton's plan to overhaul the nation's health care system.
The executives predicted a 3 percent growth in the economy next year but warned that the cost of the health care plan could undermine such a fairly robust rate. 
 Several executives said they were concerned that the health care plan could result in lower-quality health care without controlling costs effectively, a contention that the Administration quickly denied.
"There's a real, genuine risk here of worsening health care," in terms of both quality and costs," said John W. Snow, the chairman, chief executive and president of CSX Corporation. "I don't pretend to have the answers, but frankly, I'm scared of the answers being proposed now."
The hostility of leaders of large corporations, gathered here for a meeting of the Business Council, a group of the chief executives of the nation's 100 largest companies, could represent a serious setback for President Clinton. The Administration has worked hard to tailor the health care plan to the liking of business people, and in fact it promoted the plan's beneficial effects for businesses.
The complaints from large businesses about their soaring health care costs have become louder in recent years. Administration officials have predicted that large concerns would save money under the plan because it would assume much of the cost of the health care of people who retired before the age of 65 and would put a cap on private health insurance premiums.
 
Dubious About U.S. Role
 But several executives were skeptical about the plan's financing, dubious about its cost-cutting measures and wary about the risks involved in giving the Federal Government a greater role in health care.
D. Wayne Calloway, the chairman and chief executive of PepsiCo Inc., warned that a proposed commission to review health care costs would have a level of flexibility and sympathy for business somewhere between "the wetlands commission and the I.R.S."
John F. Welch Jr., the chairman and chief executive of the General Electric Company, said that anyone who wanted a bigger role for the Government should, "go try to get your license renewed next week and see how it works."
Mr. Welch said his company's sales of complicated medical imaging equipment for hospitals had been hurt by the current debate over health care.
Walter V. Shipley, president and chief operating officer of Chemical Bank said economic forecasts would be more optimistic were it not for Mr. Clinton's health care plan and taxes increases in the budget passed this summer.
On a panel of seven executives from the council's executive committee, only Dennis Weatherstone, the chairman and chief executive of J. P. Morgan and Company, was sanguine about the health care debate that lies ahead. "Until proved otherwise, I'd like to be optimistic," he said.
But even Mr. Weatherstone was neutral on President Clinton's specific proposals.
The executives' milder criticisms of Mr. Clinton's health care plan focused on its possible effect on the Federal budget deficit. "While all of the reforms are important, it is a very big bite to take at one time," said Robert E. Allen, the chairman and chief executive of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. "And we're all rather skeptical about the capacity to pay for it."
Mr. Allen said corporate executives supported the general principles of the Administration's plan. He also said it was good for the nation to confront its health care troubles.
Victor F. Zonana, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said the criticism from business executives was "simply incorrect."
"The President's proposal will be extremely helpful to businesses and will allow them to rein in their health care costs, which have made many companies uncompetitive in global markets," he said. "And the financing of the President's plan is solid."

HEADLINE: Bhutto Wins Plurality and Faces a New Struggle

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Oct.7

 BODY:
After battling for more than two years to regain the job that was taken away from her in 1990 on charges of corruption and incompetence, Benazir Bhutto appeared today to be on the brink of triumph to return as Prime Minister of Pakistan.
Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party captured the most seats in the nation's new 217-member Parliament that was elected on Wednesday, although she fell short of a majority and now faces the task of wooing small parties into joining her in a coalition government. 
 Her party won 86 of the 200 parliamentary seats that were up for election, compared with 72 won by the Pakistan Muslim League of her opponent, former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. But refusing to admit defeat, Mr. Sharif began a frenzied effort to recruit 22 independently elected parliamentarians to thwart Ms. Bhutto's comeback.
"Now the real game begins as to who forms the government," said Ayesha Jalal, a professor of history at Columbia University said in a telephone interview from New York. "I think she'll be able to form a government, but it will be a very weak government. The establishment -- the bureaucracy and the army -- will have a very strong hand."
 
An 'Unhappy Situation'
 That assessment was echoed by Sherry Rehman, managing editor of The Herald and a Bhutto supporter.
"It's a very unhappy situation," Ms. Rehman said. "If Nawaz Sharif or if Benazir had come up with a chance of forming a stable government, they would have needed a majority. Now we will see another unstable government. More power jockeying is what I see. There is no question of addressing the larger issues."
Since Pakistan was founded 46 years ago, political horse-trading has tarred the country's political process in a high-stakes bidding war involving huge cash payments, promises of ministerial posts and other acts of favoritism. Even so, Pakistan's history of coalition governments has been an unhappy one. And it seems certain that rather than returning to political stability, Ms. Bhutto's plurality victory insures more uncertainty for a country with desperate social and economic problems.
Ms. Bhutto herself had little to say today beyond complaining loudly and repeatedly about what she said were election irregularities.
"We are unhappy with the manner in which tampered electoral lists were provided in a majority of constituencies," she said in her home in Larkana, in the southern province of Sind. "Our voters were turned away."
 
Few Registered to Vote
 But teams of observers from 40 countries who watched Wednesday's elections at polling stations across the country reported no serious irregularities. Indeed, the general impression today was that the elections, which were carried out under military supervision, was the freest and fairest election since 1970, although one in which fewer than 40 percent of the country's registered voters cast ballots.
The elections pitted Ms. Bhutto against Mr. Sharif, both of whom made no secret of their intense dislike for each other. For more than two years after her dismissal from office, Ms. Bhutto waged a nonstop campaign against Mr. Sharif, a former industrialist from Lahore. She frequently asserted that Mr. Sharif conspired with Ghulam Ishaq Khan, who was President then, to drive her from office and rig the elections of 1990 that propelled Mr. Sharif into the prime ministership.
The prime ministership had since been single-mindedly pursued by Ms. Bhutto, the daughter of former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, a tyrannical socialist who ruled Pakistan in the early 1970's and who was executed in 1979 after a military coup in 1977. And when elections were called in July, Ms. Bhutto describe them as a victory for her party.
Earlier this year, when Mr. Ishaq Khan dismissed Mr. Sharif from office on similar charges of corruption and incompetence, Ms. Bhutto sided with President Ishaq Khan. When the Supreme Court restored Mr. Sharif to office, senior members of Ms. Bhutto's party let it be known that they would even support a military coup if it drove Mr. Sharif from office.
 
The Glamour of Bhutto
 When the powerful military establishment forced the resignation of both Mr. Sharif and Mr. Ishaq Khan and ordered new elections in July, it was able to end the country's political and constitutional crisis that resulted in part from Mr. Sharif's battles with the President and from Ms. Bhutto's threats to march on the capital with hundreds of thousands of supporters.
The electoral achievement of Ms. Bhutto, a striking, almost glamorous woman in a deeply male-dominated society, appears to be testimony more to her phenomenal campaign personality before a mostly illiterate electorate than to any of her party's policy pronouncements. Indeed, there is little in Ms. Bhutto's campaign literature to distinguish her program from that of Mr. Sharif.
But some foreign experts say they believe that both Ms. Bhutto and Mr. Sharif, if he somehow manages to outwit his opponent in the search for parliamentary allies, will be constrained in their policies by the radical changes that have been introduced in the two-month-old administration of the interim Prime Minister, Moeen Qureshi.
After assuming office in July, Mr. Qureshi moved swiftly to expose political corruption, crack down on drug traffickers who had long been tolerated by the political establishment, jettison expensive and foolhardy government spending and introduce a measure of fiscal probity to government.
 
Farm Tax Is a Target
 Both Ms. Bhutto, 40, and Mr. Sharif, 44, have criticized Mr. Qureshi's policies, and Ms. Bhutto has said that she will repeal an agricultural tax that he imposed on rich landowners like herself.
"Moeen set a standard that is very difficult to withdraw from," said Paula R. Newberg, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who served as an election monitor in Pakistan. "He ran the place with a Cabinet of six people. If she lets the agricultural tax lapse, there are a lot of people in this country who will consider that the People's Party is still a prisoner of feudal interests."
Ms. Newberg continued: "This interim government came in initially to provide a bridge to a new government, but in the process undertook a series of policy initiatives which served to expose the political establishment as very self-interested, and rather uninterested in the plight of their own constituents. At the same time, it was designing a process for free, fair and direct elections to re-elect these same people. It leads one to ask what the prospects are."
Ms. Rehman of The Herald said the coming days were crucial to Ms. Bhutto's goal of forming a government, with Paraliament expected to convene this month and select a prime minister
"Nawaz Sharif seems very ready to go into battle," she said. "He seems to think he can form a government. This is not going to be easy for Benazir."
But despite clear signs of strain among her political advisers, Ms. Bhutto sounded confident this evening before leaving for Lahore. "The people have given their verdict," she said, "and they have given their verdict in favor of the Pakistan People's Party."

HEADLINE: Excerpts From the Debates of the 2 New Jersey Gubernatorial Candidates

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a gubernatorial candidates' debate last night in Trenton between Gov. Jim Florio and Christine Todd Whitman, as recorded by The New York Times.
 
The Economy
Q. Mrs. Whitman, your economic plan calls for a 30 percent income tax cut over three years. Will the cuts be in human services, welfare? Will money for state colleges be on the block? Please tell us specifically what you plan to cut. 
 WHITMAN What we are talking about doing, it's 5 cents on the dollar. I have the ability, as the Governor does, to have a line-item veto, impoundment authority; and I have a willing legislature behind me, the leadership on both sides, who've done it before and are willing to do it again. Just by limiting the rate of growth of state government to 3 percent, instead of the almost double the cost of living increase that we've seen recently, you will save $500 million.
If you just keep the employees of this state so that if two them working in state government, both covered by family plans, instead of each having their own plan they get -- each have one plan, you save between $50 million and $70 million. The cuts are there to be made.
Q. Will you please be specific about where those cuts would come from? We haven't heard any details yet.
WHITMAN Well, Nora, there are two things. One is that I can look when I see things that -- numbers that tell me that $10,000 -- tens of thousands of dollars -- are spent by the Department of Corrections to buy Adidas sneakers for prisoners, those are the kinds of things we can cut. Department of Human Services spent over $200,000 last year for an executive search firm. Those are the little things.
The big things are cutting the rate of growth of state government, holding it in; and then we're going to get in and do a performance audit, use what's been done before -- this Governor's done some of it and I congratulate him on that -- but there are over $500 million in potential cuts and savings that haven't been implemented yet.
There is plenty of waste to do it. Republicans did it, and I expect the Governor to say the world will come to an end. He did that last time and it didn't.
Q. Well, Mr. Florio, if that's what you're going to say, you have ----
FLORIO Well, $1.5 billion worth of Adidas sneakers is a lot of sneakers.
WHITMAN Ten thousand.
FLORIO That's what you have to do --
WHITMAN Tens of thousands.
FLORIO In order to cut the budget in the way that Mrs. Whitman is talking about, this is the plan. Now, it's two sheets. The numbers don't add up one side to the other side. And it really is promising people pie in the sky without telling anybody where the dough is going to come from. I mean, what we're talking about is promising people 30 percent reductions. My understanding is now people in the cities are being promised a 50 percent reduction. The total amount of money that that costs is $1.5 billion.
No one is saying where the money is going to come from, although then now we're going to talk about cutting Adidas sneakers. This really doesn't make a lot of sense.
Q. Governor, Mrs. Whitman seems to have set much of the economic agenda with her pledge to cut taxes by 30 percent. That's what people are talking about. Your economic plans seem to be based on a $1 billion loan program through the Economic Development Agency for businesses and development agencies and for schools, some for businesses, some for development agencies, some for schools. Is this the plan of a visionary or is this the plan of a bureaucrat with a calculator?
FLORIO Well, my plan, as I said, is not sort of a magic wand on two sheets of paper. My plan is sitting on the runway up at Newark Airport -- Kiwi Airlines. Go talk to Bob Iverson, who is the C.E.O., who will tell you that but for the state loan guarantees that program, that whole airline would not have gotten off the ground.
My plan is the Rutgers University stadium that we are building, that Mrs. Whitman opposed. My plan is the Convention Center in Atlantic City that is being built right now, that Mrs. Whitman opposed. My plan is the Performing Arts Center. My plan is keeping the high level of credit rating that we have right now, which gives us the ability to go and invest in sewage treatment plants, to invest in transportation systems, to invest in the Jersey Shore.
Q. We're talking about cutting taxes.
FLORIO The idea -- the idea of cutting taxes is fine, but that's not what's happening here. Cutting taxes with no corresponding reductions -- you've got $1.5 billion in the hole. Tonight we heard the first degree of specificity forever. Adidas sneakers are going to be taken away from inmates, apparently. Well, you know, you've got to go to make up $1.5 billion.
Weathervane politicians really just won't cut it anymore. You can't tell people just what they want to hear by promising them anything.
Q. Ms. Whitman.
WHITMAN Well, I would expect the Governor to be in deep denial over tax cuts, because he's never met a tax hike he didn't like. The point is that every time we have seen -- and you look at the economic history of the State of New Jersey, and you look at the trend line, when you cut taxes you see jobs created.
He talks about the E.D.A. and says they're creating 20,000 jobs. That's wonderful. We lost 10,000 jobs in August alone. We've lost 280,000 jobs in the last three and a half years. We lead the nation in home foreclosure. It's the kind of thing that led to the opportunity I had to talk with someone just the other week who was sitting on his porch outside in the rain, because he couldn't go inside, it was too hot and he couldn't afford an air-conditioner, because he'd lost his job just a week before and they're trying to adopt a child. And he was scared to death for his future. This is what it's all about. It's about the people of the State of New Jersey.
 
Gun Control

 Q. Mrs. Whitman, earlier this year you reportedly told the owners of Gunarama, a Jersey City gun shop, you would consider legislation to legalize certain weapons now banned in the state. What weapons would you legalize and what is your position on the Brady Bill?
WHITMAN I support the Brady Bill and, contrary to what the Governor has been saying in his ads, I oppose assault weapons, and I opposed, and very publicly, the Republicans' attempt to override that. Where I have stood on this bill is, from the beginning, is that those people who acquired things like .22's, the kind of target and practice weapons that the Olympic team uses -- and they would be arrested if they were to land at Newark Airport with their guns from a competition -- those are the kinds of things that I believe people who got them legally should be grandfathered. It's a taking, that's all; it's a recognition of that. But I do not support assault weapons.
But we've got to understand that the problem of crime goes far beyond an assault weapon. There've been over 400,000 crimes committed since the assault ban went into effect, and less than one-tenth of 1 percent of those involved assault weapons. That doesn't mean we want them on the street. We don't want them on the street.
But if we think that alone is going to solve the problem of crime in the State of New Jersey, then we are being foolish. We have got to get beyond that. That's why I have called for three times, and you're in for a third-time violent offender -- that they go with no parole at that time. That we require people to serve 70 percent of their sentence. Right now, they serve an average of 20 to 25 percent of the sentence given them by the court. That we have judges that understand it's their responsibility to enforce the law, not to write the law. Those are the kinds of changes we need to make in order to affect the system.
Q. Governor Florio.
FLORIO She wants to grandfather all of the weapons that are out there. I don't know why anybody has a need WHITMAN Obviate Uzi's and AK-47's, Governor.
FLORIO For Tec-9's or any of those types of weapons. But we've been asking which weapons on the list do you want to put back into circulation. She called it a lousy law. She and the N.R.A. have been out just saying this is not a law that should stand; it should be changed. And the answer is the people of this state really don't believe that there is any need for assault weapons. You can't hunt with them. You know, it's illegal, always was illegal, to hunt with these types of weapons.
And, of course, this is not the answer to crime. But I'll tell you, it is a very, very serious concern to the policemen of this state. The Fraternal Order of Police and the P.B.A. statewide both endorsed me, in large measure because they know who it is that's been working very hard for the police persons on the beat out there now.
Q. I'd like to follow up so that we have a clear picture here. What are the weapons you would ban?
WHITMAN Ninety percent of them on the list. The only weapon I've talked about taking off at all would be a .22. But, quite frankly, that's not the issue. The issue is government taking without understanding that there is -- that there's people that have had them legally. But more importantly is the issue of crime itself. We have heard a great deal of verbiage and rhetoric out of this Governor about how important this is to solving crime. And yet juvenile crime is up. Juvenile homicide is up 42 percent; since 1989 it's gone up. Those are the things we need to get after. We need to stop these problems. Rape is up 6 percent statewide, and among juveniles it's up over 11 percent. Those are the kinds of issues that we've got to get at.
FLORIO When she says that she'll put .22's in -- go talk to the mother of the girl was killed in East Orange, N.J., with a Tec-.22, with a 50-round banana clip, which is a piece of junk. No legitimate sportsman needs one. Or the Marlin 60 with a 17-round tubular clip. All 17 rounds were pumped into five priests and two nuns down in Texas. These are weapons that real people know don't belong in our state.

HEADLINE: House and Senate Agree to Raise Fees for Grazing on Federal Land

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
Breaking a decades-old deadlock over the management of public lands in the West, Democrats in the House and Senate today agreed to raise the fees that ranchers pay to graze cattle and sheep on about 260 million acres of Federal land in 16 western states.
The agreement appeared to represent an important political victory for Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who has staked his tenure on developing a new "land ethic" that puts protecting the environment on equal footing with developing resources. 
 The agreement, reached by a House and Senate conference committee that is considering the Interior Department's appropriations for the fiscal year 1994, gave Mr. Babbitt much of what he had sought on the grazing issue since taking office.
The agreement, which will be voted on next week, calls for raising grazing fees over the next three years to $3.45 from $1.86 for every cow and calf. Mr. Babbitt had originally asked for fees of more than $4.
 
Reflects Babbitt's Agenda
 But the rest of the agreement is almost identical to other measures Mr. Babbitt proposed. One provision would give the Government much more authority to restrict ranchers who are harming the land. Another would give the Government more ability to control and protect water on Federal lands. A third would give the Government control of pumps, tanks, fences and other permanent improvements to Federal lands by ranchers. A fourth would abolish grazing advisory boards, which are dominated by ranchers and exert enormous political influence over the management of public lands.
Democratic lawmakers said the agreement indicated that Mr. Babbitt had gained the upper hand in the political debate over improving the management of public lands. They said that breaking the impasse over grazing meant changes were also likely for mining, timber and other industries dependent on Federal lands.
"Today, Bruce Babbitt became Secretary of the Interior," said Representative Mike Synar, an Oklahoma Democrat who has been fighting for years to raise grazing fees and improve environmental conditions in the West. "If we had lost here, the public would have rightfully doubted our commitment to serious deficit reduction and true honest public land reform."
Republican lawmakers from the West denounced the pact, and aides to several Democratic Senators from Western states said their bosses were uncomfortable with it.
Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, said: "I am deeply, deeply disappointed by this so-called compromise by the Democrats. No Republicans were part of it, and I fear it will result in unnecessary pain and economic suffering for thousands of New Mexico's ranchers and small townspeople."
 
An Issue Delayed
 Last spring, President Clinton dismayed Mr. Babbitt and environmentalists when he bowed to pressure from several western Democratic Senators and dropped from his budget package a host of proposals to end subsidies and raise fees for using public lands. The White House said it would reintroduce the measures, and just days after the budget package was narrowly approved by Congress, Mr. Babbitt announced he would pursue higher grazing fees and other changes in managing western lands.
The House has long sought higher grazing fees, while Western Senators have fought them. Last month, the Senate blocked Mr. Babbitt's proposals, creating a stalemate that was apparently resolved today.
Experts say if the agreement becomes law, it would represent one of the most important changes in Federal land management since grazing fees were introduced in 1906. Some 30,000 families hold permits to graze livestock on Federal lands.
The Sierra Club, which has sought such changes for years, today called the agreement a milestone in protecting the last great open stretches of land in the 48 contiguous states.
But cattlemen said the agreement would give the Government broad new powers to interfere in private family businesses across the West and would diminish the value of ranches and drive thousands of people off the land.
"They are in the process of destroying the lives of thousands of innocent people," said Al Schneberger, the executive director of the New Mexico Cattle Growers' Association in Albuquerque.

HEADLINE: Gingrich Stakes Claim to House Minority Leadership

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
Accompanied by more than 60 Republican lawmakers, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia said today that he had more than enough votes pledged to insure his election as House Republican leader in the next Congress -- assuming he and most of his supporters win re-election next year.
Mr. Gingrich, who as the Republican whip holds the No. 2 position in the House, would replace Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, whose style has been more accommodating to Democratic Congressional leaders. Mr. Michel announced earlier in the week that he would not seek re-election. 
 Mr. Gingrich, a Republican from Georgia, said 106 of 175 Republican members had committed their votes to him. The representatives who turned up on the lawn in front of the Capitol to show their support included conservatives and moderates and members from all regions, but his principal opponent, Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon of Glens Falls, N.Y., did not concede. Mr. Solomon was traveling today and was unavailable for comment.
Unless there is an unexpectedly large turnover of Republicans in the House in 1994, Mr. Gingrich is likely to retain sufficient support to secure the job he claimed today.
 
Has Strong Freshman Support
 The core of Mr. Gingrich's support comes from the 48 Republican freshmen, 40 of whom are committed to him.
Mr. Gingrich promised aggressive leadership and, underscoring his desire to draw a sharp contrast with the Democratic Party, criticized the Administration's policy in Somalia.
He called for open hearings to investigate reports that the Administration had denied a request from an American military officer in Mogadishu for heavy armor, leading to the heavy combat casualties last weekend. "The commander in chief has a responsibility to be militarily competent," Mr. Gingrich said.
Mr. Gingrich describe a philosophical vision of what the Republican Party should stand for in Congress and how it should project itself to the electorate. He shied away from social issues like abortion and school prayer, which divided the party in last year's Presidential campaign, instead concentrating on economic issues.
Speaking on Mr. Gingrich's behalf, Representative Scott L. Klug, who represents a liberal district that includes Madison, Wis., and who supports abortion rights, said, "To those of us who have supported Congressional reform, Newt has been a tireless champion."
Representative John Linder, a conservative freshman from Georgia, praised Mr. Gingrich as "the principal idea man of our party."

HEADLINE: Initial Jobless Claims Dip To Lowest Level in '93

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 7

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits fell by 9,000 last week, to the lowest level in more than nine months, the Government said today.
In other reports, the Commerce Department said the growth of Americans' per capita income accelerated in 1992, exceeding inflation in all but seven states. And the Federal Reserve said consumer borrowing rose $3.63 billion in August amid increases in credit card use and auto loans. 
 The Labor Department said new applications for unemployment insurance totaled 320,000, the lowest since 317,000 laid-off workers filed claims in the week that ended last Dec. 26. It was the second straight decline and the seventh in 10 weeks.
The less-volatile four-week moving average of jobless claims, which analysts prefer to track because it more accurately reflects the labor situation, also fell. The average totaled 328,250, down from 328,750 in the period that ended on Sept. 25.
Analysts said the report suggested continued modest improvements in the labor market. Many are forecasting that more than 150,000 jobs were created in September, while the unemployment rate remained at 6.7 percent for a second straight month.
The Labor Department will release reports Friday on the September employment situation.
 
Per Capita Income Growth
 The report on per capita income showed growth of 4.9 percent nationally last year, up from 2.7 percent in 1991 when the economy was emerging from recession.
 The rate of growth in 1991 had been the slowest since 1961, when incomes increased just 2.5 percent, according to Rudolph E. DePass of the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis.
But income growth last year still suffered from the sluggish recovery. It had risen 6.5 percent in 1989, the year before the recession began.
And the figures showed the lingering effects of the recession in California, which for the first time on record was not included among the 10 states with the highest incomes.
Per capita income is the annual total personal income of residents divided by a state's population on July 1. Personal income is the pretax income received by all persons, minus social insurance payments.
