HEADLINE: Assessing the Weapons Search 

 BODY:
One continuing divide between those who supported the Bush administration's invasion of Iraq and those who opposed it seems to be weapons of mass destruction. Many opponents, while stunned by the swiftness with which the Iraqi government and military crumbled, harp on the failure by American troops to produce any definitive proof so far that Iraq had chemical or biological, let alone nuclear, weapons. Those who supported the war are for the most part muting whatever concern they may feel. President Bush, in an interview with Tom Brokaw on NBC News this week, expressed confidence that the weapons would be found but warned that it might take some time.
 This page agreed with the president's conviction that there were world-threatening weapons in Iraq, if not the manner in which the United States went to war. We still tend to believe they are there. Iraq certainly had biological and chemical weapons, and a program to create nuclear ones, at one point. If everything were indeed destroyed, Saddam Hussein put his nation through years of crippling economic boycotts and brought on the ruin of his regime for no good reason. On the other hand, it no longer seems totally inconceivable that the government was so corrupt and out of touch with reality that it was not even capable of operating rationally when its survival was at stake. 
 With the most obvious storage sites coming up empty, it is now clear that a great deal of hard-to-find information -- and careful analysis -- will be needed before we fully understand what happened. As the search for illicit weapons goes forward, it will be important to distinguish which finds are critical and which are of no enormous consequence.
The most likely discoveries may be chemical-warfare agents, the realm where Iraq was most advanced. Finding mustard gas or nerve agents in artillery shells and missiles or in bulk containers ready to be transferred into weapons would validate the stated reason for the invasion. But if investigators find only what they call precursors -- material that could be turned into chemical weapons -- the results would be more problematic. Some precursors have civilian uses and could be difficult to link to weapons without additional evidence. Finding a laboratory would indicate Iraq's determination to pursue unconventional weapons but not necessarily a ready-to-use weapons ability.
Iraq's biological weapons program was so secretive that its dimensions were not understood until 1995. The biggest discovery here would be evidence that Iraq was working with the smallpox virus, as a few experts have suspected based on circumstantial evidence. Even small quantities of the virus would be a frightening find, the first proof that smallpox exists outside the official repositories in Russia and the United States.
Search teams will also be looking for anthrax, which Iraq produced in large quantities a decade or more ago. United Nations inspectors expressed a "strong presumption" that 10,000 liters of anthrax might still exist. It would be particularly worrisome if Iraq had succeeded in drying and milling anthrax, making a highly volatile material like the kind that was used to terrorize the United States in the fall of 2001. But even 15-year-old stocks of liquid anthrax would be alarming.
Finding leftover botulinum toxin, which would most likely have lost its potency, or ricin, an agent that is sometimes used to assassinate individuals, would not suggest a mass destruction ability, although they would still be viewed as evidence of Iraq's intent to maintain biological weapons.
Equipment and materials needed to make biological warfare agents can also be used for legitimate vaccine and pharmaceutical purposes. It is relatively easy to convert civilian technologies to weapons the minute no one is looking. But most of the world will certainly not accept an argument that Iraq had innocent technologies that it was planning to use later for deadly purposes, unless there is substantial supporting proof.
A decade ago, investigators were shocked to find that Iraq was far closer to making a nuclear bomb than anyone had realized. That program has since been dismantled by international inspectors, who found no evidence that it had been revived in recent visits. Any discovery now that Iraq had obtained either highly enriched uranium or weapons-grade plutonium, putting a bomb within reach in a year or two, would be a real shock. Almost as disturbing would be full-scale enrichment facilities that would allow Iraq make its own fissile materials, leading to a bomb some years down the road. 
Rather than a smoking gun, inspectors may wind up finding a bullet here, a barrel there and a chamber somewhere else. That makes the credibility of the people doing the inspecting even more important. And it makes President Bush's decision not to invite international inspectors to monitor the job seem even more misguided.

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: PEACEKEEPING; 
In Afghanistan, Violence Stalls Renewal Effort

BYLINE:  By CARLOTTA GALL 

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, April 25 

 BODY:
In the middle of the main road between Kabul and Kandahar lie two bombed-out, rusted fuel trucks, destroyed in American strikes in October 2001. That no one -- not the Americans, nor international aid workers, nor Afghans themselves -- has dragged them out of the way shows how little has been done to mend Afghanistan since the 2001 war, despite promises of copious foreign assistance.
 In a very real sense, the war here has not ended -- as shown by an attack today that killed two American soldiers and by a planned visit on Sunday from Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld. Nearly every day, there are killings, explosions, shootings and targeted attacks on foreign aid workers, Afghan officials, and American forces, as well as continuing feuding between warlords in the regions. 
 No clear picture exists of who will provide the security to stop the bloodshed: the government of President Hamid Karzai, which still has no national army or police force; or the international force of 5,000 peacekeepers here in the capital; or the 11,500 Americans, Romanians and other foreign soldiers still in the provinces hunting for the Taliban and Al Qaeda. 
For months now, the American military here has talked of moving into "Phase Four," which would mean winding down combat activities and entering a period of reconstruction. Yet the military is still mounting large-scale combat operations in the pursuit of armed groups of rebels in mountain hideouts, and turning villages upside down in a search for suspects and weapons that is making the foreign presence ever more unpopular with Afghans.
In southern and eastern Afghanistan, the exiled Taliban movement has been resurgent since December. Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a renegade mujahedeen commander and former American ally, has called for a holy war against "occupying forces." 
The attack today, which killed an American soldier near a Special Forces base close to Shkin in eastern Afghanistan, was particularly brazen. About 20 rebels opened fire on a platoon of American and Afghan soldiers in broad daylight, wounding at least six other soldiers before retreating across the border to Pakistan, as many attackers have in recent weeks. A second American soldier later died of wounds from the battle, Reuters reported.
Cross-border violence has risen so much that President Karzai, apparently with the backing of the United States, took the unusual step this week of naming the fugitive Taliban leaders he wants Pakistan to hand over to his government in Kabul. 
His administration appears equally hamstrung, however, when it comes to reducing the power of the warlords, who often put personal interest before national unity, but who have been virtually the only source of security for ordinary Afghans, who have been looking for safety and some form of economic subsistence since Afghanistan began to fall into chaos more than two decades ago, during the Soviet invasion in 1979.
Fixing the Kabul-Kandahar road, one of the main arteries of the country, has been a priority of the Karzai government. It is part of the American-led $180 million plan to repair main roads and provide hundreds of jobs. Yet now, in the second year of reconstruction, there is no sign of any work being done all along this 300 miles of ruts and holes.
American soldiers at their headquarters at Bagram Air Base, near Kabul, share many of the apprehensions of the Afghan public -- despite their public, official optimism on their ability to secure both Afghanistan and Iraq. "I don't feel comfortable watching us start on another war when this remains unfinished," one soldier at Bagram said recently, insisting on anonymity. "It would have been better if we could have moved into Phase Four before they started in Iraq."
After their grueling hikes through the Afghan mountains, American troops often head back to base with little to show for their effort. The international coalition here regularly announces that weapons caches have been seized and destroyed, but there have been few important arrests made, and no pause in attacks on American bases and Afghan government posts and personnel.
A recent two-week operation with 500 Special Forces and airborne infantry troops in the Baghran Valley in the southern province of Helmand failed to net its main prey -- Abdul Waheed, the local chief of Baghran, and another former Taliban commander, Mullah Kabir. Both men got away, and Mr. Waheed later told friends that he had made it to the safety of Quetta in Pakistan, an American official said.
The continuing airborne assaults and rough searches are angering Afghan villagers, especially when fatal errors are made. One of those, an airstrike that was meant for a group of rebels but that hit a house in eastern Afghanistan this month, killed 11 members of a family as they slept. The bombing occurred near Shkin, where today's attack happened and where the first signs of renewed rebel activity emerged last Dec. 21, when an American soldier on patrol was shot dead.
The recent operation in Helmand left one shepherd dead and five people injured, three of them children. A trail of houses was trashed and looted; other families wept to see their male breadwinners detained.
The popularity of the American presence was also not increased by the deaths of two men among a group of Afghans arrested and held for interrogation at Bagram Air Base in December.
Small boys make obscene gestures at American troops as they pass by villages in Khost Province, and villagers complain that the Americans are arresting the wrong people, often because they are misled by the local militias working with them who hunt down personal enemies.
A former mujahedeen commander, Hajji Spin Bacha Zadran, 60, who was held for a month in the Bagram detention center last fall, said he told his captors they were encouraging animosity among Afghans.
"I told them they should not arrest innocent people and they should try to be close to the people and should not make the people angry, because already now the people do not like them because they are arresting innocent people," he said in an interview at his home in the eastern town of Khost.
In a tea house in Khost, where scores of arrests have been made over the past months, residents listened keenly to a conversation about the American presence in Afghanistan.
One speaker praised the Americans because, he said, they have prevented Afghan militias' feuding. But the room fell into an appalled silence when it was suggested that American forces would stay for as long as a decade. "Oh my God!" muttered one man, turning his back on the speaker in disgust.
"There is a widening gap between the Afghan people and the Americans," warned a senior government official on his return from the eastern border regions.
American officials say the military has learned the bitter lessons of working too closely with any one clan or tribe, often ending up being used to further local vendettas. But their critics say they are not moving fast enough to cut ties with troublemakers.
The American commander in Afghanistan, Lt. Gen. Daniel K. McNeill, has stressed the importance of treating villagers with respect and of rebuilding and bringing in aid after combat operations, his top commander in southern Afghanistan, Lt. Col. John Campbell, said in a recent interview. But it does not always work.
"We will not be angry if they help us and do not bother us," said Pai Muhammad, a villager in the Baghran Valley. "Up until now, I have not become angry, but then they have not killed anyone in my family." But the villagers of Lejay were so embittered after Special Forces spent 10 days in their village, conducting searches and making arrests, that they wrote an open letter to the United Nations mission in Afghanistan.
"The Americans searched our province," the letter reads in part. "They did not find Mullah Omar, they did not find Osama bin Laden, and they did not find any Taliban. They arrested old men, drivers, and shopkeepers, and they injured women and children."
These villagers said they did not see any of the aid that United States forces said they would airlift into the region.
The escalating violence has also slowed reconstruction. A series of attacks on nongovernmental agencies culminated in the killing of an expatriate Red Cross worker in Kandahar last month, prompting most agencies to scale back their work in the most needy south and southeastern regions.
"Thousands of people are going to suffer from this," said one aid worker as he prepared to pull his team of four foreign workers out of refugee camps in the south.
Already frustrated last year by the slowness of reconstruction and the failure of aid organizations to reach the more remote areas, the American military decided last fall to use military civil affairs teams to take reconstruction efforts to the turbulent regions.
The idea is to position civil affairs personnel backed up by Special Forces for security -- groups of up to 60 or even 100 people -- in as many as 10 places around Afghanistan. The teams have a total of $12 million for projects they oversee, and they hire local contractors to do the building.
In Kabul, foreign diplomats have welcomed the idea of a larger military presence in the regions, particularly because no country is prepared to expand the 5,000-member international peacekeeping force in the capital out to the border regions.
But the plan was immediately criticized by relief groups. The United Nations gently pointed out that it was responsible for coordinating aid, and the nongovernmental aid agencies expressed alarm about becoming associated with the military, suggesting that the soldiers stick to the bigger projects -- roads, bridges, government buildings -- that aid groups cannot manage.
In the end, some aid officials say, the teams will fail because they are neither one thing nor another.
"They are undermanned, underresourced and are focusing on the wrong areas," said Paul O'Brien of CARE International, the American-based aid group, which has long experience in Afghanistan.
Most aid agencies, and many Afghans around the country, would like foreign troops to disarm the private militias, reduce continuing robbery and extortion, and curb the power of the warlords, Mr. O'Brien said.
But the military teams are concentrating on small-scale projects -- building schools, or even just providing desks and latrines for them -- while the larger issues of disarmament and peacekeeping are left unfinished, he said.
Rafael Robillard, the director of a coordinating body of international aid agencies in Kabul, summed up the frustration of many aid workers. "I was talking to one civil affairs guy, and we were looking at a kindergarten the American military was building, and the soldier turned to me and said, 'Why aren't you guys doing anything about disarmament?' I could not believe it. The military is building kindergartens, and they are asking me, a civilian aid worker, to do disarmament! The world is upside down."

 THE BARBARY PLAGUE
The Black Death in Victorian San Francisco.
By Marilyn Chase.
Illustrated. 276 pp. New York:
Random House. $25.95.
 IN 1906 an earthquake and great fire consumed San Francisco, killing thousands, incinerating the homes of 250,000 and most of the city's public buildings and crippling communications and transportation systems. Less well known are the two outbreaks of plague that immediately preceded and followed that cataclysmic event. The Black Death appeared between 1900 and 1905, and again in 1907-8. The story of how local, state and federal public health officials and the city's citizens responded is dramatic. It has been told and analyzed by medical historians and historians of the West; now Marilyn Chase, a medical reporter for The Wall Street Journal who lives in San Francisco, vividly brings it to a wider audience. The story, 100 years old, has much to teach us about today.
The plague infected 280 people, killing 172 -- small numbers in a city of 350,000. Nonetheless, this first identified outbreak of plague in the continental United States illuminates the major issues of public health work then and now. The story of the epidemic's rise and fall demonstrates in bold strokes that public health effectiveness is dependent not just on scientific knowledge and expertise, not just on bold individuals in the right place at the right time, but equally on the social, political and economic contexts within which the disease rages.
Plague is a horrible disease, horrible to experience and horrible to watch. "The disease attacked with a violent rush of fever and shuddering chills," Chase writes. "A headache seemed to core out the skull. Victims weakened and took to their beds. Penetrating pains raked the back and limbs. Red lumps erupted from the armpits and groin, excruciating to the touch. Hemorrhages would burst beneath the skin, causing black bruises. Senses wandering, the sick would chatter and fidget restlessly, plucking at their bedclothes. Their agitation subsided only as they sank into a coma, ending in death."
The first man to thus suffer and die, in March 1900, was Wong Chut King, a 41-year-old lumber salesman living in San Francisco's Chinatown. The city health department, not waiting for a definitive diagnosis, in the darkness of night quarantined the entire community by "stringing ropes around its dozen square blocks." Instead of isolating the buildings in which Wong had lived and worked, instead of seeking to identify his contacts, instead of hunting the rats they knew carried the disease, the health authorities blamed all the Chinese inhabitants for what befell one. The commercial enterprises run by whites on these blocks were exempt from the blockade.
As the epidemic continued to claim victims, various dramas played out. The Chinese inhabitants protested the diagnosis, because it was racially based and accompanied by blatant discrimination. They won lawsuits that brought down the quarantine barricades. In agreement with them that the killer disease was not plague (but not working in alliance over the racial divide) was the white business community, worried about its commercial enterprises. The state health department and governor, equally concerned that California's reputation as the beacon of a healthy West might suffer, also resisted the diagnosis. Newspapers, with the exception of William Randolph Hearst's Examiner, also refused to admit the presence of plague. This left very little public or financial support for the city health officers and their only allies, the federal quarantine doctors from Angel Island, the immigration station in San Francisco Bay. 
Joseph Kinyoun, the medical officer at Angel Island, and his supervisor, the surgeon general Walter Wyman, in Washington, tried to impose an iron hand of public health control (including the quarantines, which the courts deemed racially discriminatory), forced vaccines (which the courts also struck down), travel restrictions, disinfecting buildings and, finally, demolishing wooden structures -- all directed at Chinatown, even after cases of plague appeared among whites living elsewhere. 
After two public health doctors failed to control the epidemic and became mired in the politics surrounding it, Washington sent a third, Rupert Blue. Blue carried the torch for the federal epidemic fighters from 1901 through 1908. It was during the postearthquake outbreak that he showed public health activity at its strongest. Instead of concentrating on the Chinese and Chinatown (most of the victims by then were white), Blue focused on rats and on environments that encouraged their proliferation. He replaced wooden structures with concrete. He began a major campaign to encourage people to catch rats, offering 10 cents for each. Blue met tirelessly with citizen groups, especially enlisting women's clubs in urban housecleaning, ultimately bringing together the broad coalition that helped conquer the Black Death.
Chase researched the archives and found family papers still in private hands, allowing her to tell the stories of the public health officials with a lot of new, personal detail. She uncovers the Chinese points of view, especially the individual stories of plague victims, not covered as fully in previous studies. This all makes "The Barbary Plague" a pleasure to read, full of people, dramatic situations, individual foibles and collective hard work. I closed the book wishing it had been longer.
Unfortunately, Chase stops short of spelling out the lessons to be learned from this history. She acknowledges that "erosion of the public health system left the country vulnerable." In fact, San Francisco is a model for what might be culled from public health history generally. Plague, like smallpox and other epidemics that have shaken American communities, was not controlled by the actions of single individuals. The private sector, sometimes helpful, sometimes obstructionist, has not historically proved itself up to the task of conquering epidemics. A well-maintained infrastructure, broad public coalition building and community organizing have been essential to successful public health campaigns. Strong government authority certainly helped, but only when administered with an even hand.
Two cautions from the San Francisco experience are most telling. Public health work failed when its campaign against plague racialized the disease and resulted in discriminatory public health activities, and it failed when the business community and the state government put economic and political interests above concern for peoples' lives. If we experience a bioterrorist attack in the 21st century, we would do well to remember that it is not just medical knowledge, government power or a strong economy that will help us survive; rather, knowledge and power must be wielded with justice, in the interests of the many, not of the few.

 101 REYKJAVIK
By Hallgrimur Helgason.
Translated by Brian FitzGibbon.
339 pp. New York:
Scribner. $23.
 Iceland is perhaps best known in America for its geothermal springs, its luminous pop music and that cherished schoolkid paradox: it's greener than Greenland! But the nation also boasts a thousand-year-old legislative assembly, universal literacy and one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world. In other words, according to Hallgrimur Helgason in his novel "101 Reykjavik," first published in 1996 and now appearing in this country in a lucid translation by Brian FitzGibbon, Iceland is a living hell. 
That is if it even exists at all, especially on the maps behind the anchors on international news broadcasts. "Iceland is the kind of country that sometimes is there and sometimes isn't. Depending on the mood of whatever graphic artist happens to be on duty that day," observes Hlynur Bjorn, the layabout narrator of this wonderfully lewd, occasionally brilliant, often frustrating novel.
Hlynur, it should be stated, is usually not on duty. "The state pays me to exist," he declares after collecting his latest unemployment stamp. He's 33 and lives with his mother and her friend Lolla, an A.A. counselor, in the 101 postal zone of Reykjavik. Ostensibly he does freelance computer work in his bedroom, but most of his hours are a blur of e-mail romance, satellite TV and porn. When cabin fever hits, he ventures out to the K-bar to binge on alcohol and Ecstasy and maybe get lucky. His slacker bitterness usually gets the best of him, though, and sightings of his drunken father inhis favorite hangouts, or the growing suspicion that his mother and the luscious Lolla are lovers, don't help. Nor does the possibility his most recent conquest is pregnant.
Our hero, in fact, has some very deep problems with the ladies, manifested in his habit of calculating the amount he would pay to sleep with any woman who crosses his path, or even his mind. An appendix provides the price scale in kronur in case you skimmed the figures in the text, including Mother Teresa (kr 1,700), "Wench behind a counter" (kr 75,000) and the nearly list-topping Anna Nicole Smith (kr 2,900,000). (Oh, how the mighty have depreciated.)
Sadly, readers murky on the finer points of American and British pop culture may stumble over some of the wordplay here. Hlynur's stream-of-consciousness associations, though perhaps a critique of Western hegemony, get tedious, if not downright ridiculous, at times: "Robert De Niro. Rio de Ja Neiro. Things to do in Denver when you're dead. Things to do in Iceland when you're alive." 
Iceland and America both take their lumps in Hlynur's rants. Iceland's food is "utterly tasteless" and Icelandic humor is worse, rivaled only by the lame "jangle of an Icelandic guitar and a whiny beardy voice." The best bits about the Yanks, alas, are unprintable here. The best bits in general are unprintable, and this is unfortunate, because Helgason is capable of breathtaking arias of profound filth. When he's not wallowing in bad puns or being lazy enough to liken someone's apartment to "Dennis Hopper's place in 'Blue Velvet,' " the man can wail like some young Arctic Philip Roth. Riffs include the link between flatulence and the human soul and how Noah, "bored with the missus," might have passed those endless flood nights. 
Hlynur's misadventures with his fellow citizens can be equally ribald. Drunk at a party, murmuring about how he's been "branded by the welfare state," Hlynur barges in on some young people having sex. Permission to watch grudgingly granted, he has several revelations about the human condition before offering the lovers a few pointers on technique and getting booted out of the room. 
Hlynur's protracted spinout also includes a fling with Lolla, trips to Paris and Amsterdam, an attempt at telekinetic abortion and a tender moment with a lamb near a lava field. Plot, of course, is not the point. "101 Reykjavik," which was made into a film with the same title a few years ago, is a desolate howl from an in-between decade and an in-between land. Hlynur and Helgason both seem to want it all to mean something, and maybe someday it will, but for now it's just too damn cold inside.

HEADLINE: New & Noteworthy Paperbacks 

BYLINE:  By Scott Veale

 BODY:
 BY THE LAKE, by John McGahern. (Vintage International, $14.) In his sixth novel in a 40-year career, the Irish writer follows a year in the life of an unnamed village in County Leitrim, a place where hay is cut, lambs are born, fattened and sold at market and where the biggest event of the entire year is the arrival of a telephone pole. The narrative, which revolves around a couple in their 60's who return to the community, is "initially demanding but ultimately rewarding," John Sutherland said here last year. McGahern "ranks with the greatest Irish writers: Joyce, Yeats, Synge, Beckett, Heaney."

TWO GARDENERS: Katharine S. White and Elizabeth Lawrence. A Friendship in Letters, Edited by Emily Herring Wilson. (Beacon, $15.) For nearly 20 years, White, a New Yorker editor who gardened on the coast of Maine, and Lawrence, a newspaper columnist in Charlotte, N.C., exchanged letters that recorded a blossoming friendship while holding forth on topics like the best seed catalogs, their favorite bulbs and above all the ardors of their gardens. This "perfectly edited" book "reveals as much about the character of these two remarkable women as it does about the plants they loved," Verlyn Klinkenborg wrote here in 2002.

THE VARIETIES OF ROMANTIC EXPERIENCE: Stories, by Robert Cohen. (Vintage Contemporaries, $12.) This first collection of short fiction explores romantic experience mainly in a male, heterosexual milieu in academia, upscale suburbs and the Upper West Side, closely associating love and desire with existential confusion. Cohen's style is "amusingly lyrical as well as economical," Ken Kalfus wrote in these pages last year.

CHERRY: A Life of Apsley Cherry-Garrard, by Sara Wheeler. (Modern Library, $14.95.) One of the youngest members of Robert Falcon Scott's disastrous expedition to Antarctica, Cherry-Garrard was forever tormented by his experiences; it took 10 years of agonizing introspection and analysis for him to create his masterpiece of exploration literature, "The Worst Journey in the World." This "beautifully written" biography is "authoritative and moving," Caroline Alexander said here in 2002. "Wheeler's vocabulary to evoke this luminous and cruel continent . . . appears limitless."

THE FUTURE OF THE PAST, by Alexander Stille. (Picador, $15.) These essays examine the global struggle to build a collective memory of the past by preserving monuments and artifacts, a quest complicated by varying cultural ideas about authenticity, and about the role of libraries, computers and literacy itself. Last year our reviewer, William Langewiesche, found this "a smart and engaging work that invites contemplation of an unexpected subject."

RED DUST, by Gillian Slovo. (Norton, $14.95.) Part courtroom drama, part novel of ideas and part literary work about small-town South African life, this novel exposes the weaknesses of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and its polarizing effects on post-apartheid society. The result is a "fast-paced and gripping" tale, Tony Eprile said in the Book Review last year.

EVERYTHING IS ILLUMINATED, by Jonathan Safran Foer. (Perennial/HarperCollins, $13.95.) In this first novel, Alex, a Ukrainian youth infatuated with all things American, recounts in fractured English his assignment to accompany a tourist named Jonathan Safran Foer who is tracking down his family's past in a Ukrainian town. What's more, his account is edited by Jonathan, and contains a boatload of weighty themes. "Not since Anthony Burgess's novel 'A Clockwork Orange' has the English language been simultaneously mauled and energized with such brilliance and such brio," Francine Prose wrote here last year.

STRIP CITY: A Stripper's Farewell Journey Across America, by Lily Burana. (Miramax, $13.) The author, a Jersey girl with impeccable stripping credentials amassed over a six-year career, tells of her last fling before marriage, a "bachelorette odyssey" that took her from Dallas to Anchorage. She proves to be "frank and funny and very good company," Kate Sekules said here in 2001.

ELVIS IN JERUSALEM: Post-Zionism and the Americanization of Israel, by Tom Segev. (Metropolitan/Holt, $12.) The author maintains that Israel's connection to the United States is driving a transformation in the nation's cultural life, weakening social solidarity while boosting the role of the individual. Last year in these pages, Tyler D. Johnson praised the "cleareyed interpretations of Zionism's winding past and volatile present." Scott Veale

In 2001, I was "early retired" from General Motors. It was not my choice, and the financial penalty was high. I left expecting to find another job easily. 
I used all the search techniques in your article. Here are some things I discovered while not finding a job: 
The job finders (Monster.com et al): they're cherry pickers; they fill jobs for the younger, entry-level gang. Support groups: all smiles; no couch to lie on. Networking meetings: everyone's lying; everyone else is to blame; pass the Prozac! The friends: "Great to hear from you. Send me an e-mail message. Gotta go." Advice to job seekers: supply and demand works! Compromise or quit looking.
 I quit looking, but I will return when the economy makes a comeback.

 Near the conclusion of the article, I learned that Tom Pyle and Lou Casagrande were contemplating teaching as a kind of career default. Perhaps with a degree, Jeff Einstein, too, would consider this. "I suppose I can always teach" is a familiar refrain. Teaching is a demanding profession. I wish them well.

 From my vantage point, there's a silver lining in each of these stories. The Gap should recognize its good fortune at having someone like Einstein in its organization and should green-light his Internet proposal. Casagrande appears to have the blessings of a supportive spouse and tightknit family. Pyle sounds like a fantastic potential mentor to young people. Any student, for that matter, would be lucky to have any one of them for teachers.

Kids Versus Dictionaries (and Each Other)

BYLINE:  By SYLVIANE GOLD 

 BODY:
THEY march to the microphone one at a time, some calm, some anxious, their preadolescent afflictions in full view: glasses, braces, speech impediments, facial tics. But the angst in the Oscar-nominated documentary "Spellbound," and, for that matter, the exhilaration, have nothing to do with standard junior-high-school psychodramas. They have to do with cephalalgia and lycanthrope and hellebore. They have to do with surviving into the next round of the 1999 National Spelling Bee in Washington.
 Jeffrey Blitz, the film's director, happened on his first national bee in 1997, watching ESPN. A graduate student at the University of Southern California's film school, he had already directed an award-winning short and was eager to try a nonfiction feature. The bee competitors, wrestling with words until "dinged" by the dreaded bell that signals elimination, mesmerized him. 
 "I realized that there was something about the bee that would allow me to tell the kind of broad American story that I was interested in telling," Mr. Blitz said. "There are times when a nonfiction filmmaker chooses a subject because he or she wants to let that subject speak for itself, and then there are times when a documentary filmmaker wants to shape a subject to tell the kind of story that he or she wants to tell. I think it was a healthy mix of the two for me." 
His film (which shares only its title with the 1945 Alfred Hitchcock classic) opens Wednesday at Film Forum in Manhattan, and it does not actually describe the world of competitive spelling or the history of the bee. The word ding does not turn up. The $10,000 prize, the rules, the "comfort" room to which spellers are escorted after dinging out are barely mentioned. The story Mr. Blitz wanted to tell was about himself: about growing up in New Jersey with an Argentinian mother and with a stuttering problem and finding a way, through high-school debate, to walk the tightrope between difference and belonging. Now 34, he said he felt a kinship with these spellers from all over the country, from an array of racial, ethnic and religious backgrounds, from diverse social strata, asserting both their Americanness and their specialness by mastering the dictionary. And he recognized how much suspense they could engender.
Take Ashley White, one of the 12 spellers Mr. Blitz and his co-producer, Sean Welch, followed from local bees to the nationals. She was the Washington, D.C., champion, and we meet her smiling broadly into the camera outside her public-housing project. "My life is like a movie," she says with a giggle. "I go through trials and tribulations and then I finally overcome."
Can that ebullient child be the Ashley now at the microphone? The smile and giggle are gone. Her nostrils quiver, her eyes water, her chest heaves. She is a study in terror. She's not alone. 
Harry Altman, a deeply, adorably weird kid from Glen Rock, N.J., grimaces, gulps and blinks as he wraps his brain around banns. Neil Kadakia, whose parents are from India, guesses on Darjeeling as his father buries his face in his hands. Angela Arenivar, the daughter of illegal immigrants, querulously repeats "Wheedle?" over and over again as she tries to come up with the right combination of letters. It's not hard to sympathize with a skeptical parent quoted on camera by the mother of another of the film's spellers, Emily Stagg, from New Haven: "I think it's a different form of child abuse."
Mr. Blitz does not agree. When he and Mr. Welch began tracking down participants for "Spellbound," they expected a lot of hard-driving "stage parents."
"Very quickly," he said, "we realized that that sort of parent is actually quite rare. To practice well for the National Spelling Bee takes such an incredible effort. In just about every case, we found that it was the child who was the real driving force."
Nupur Lala's mother recalls in the film that her daughter, the Tampa, Fla., champion, latched onto big words even as a toddler, not knowing or caring what they meant. Ted Brigham, a quiet loner in rural Missouri, spells well because he likes to read. Mr. Blitz and Mr. Welch traveled the country to film such promising spellers, financing the project with increasing numbers of credit cards. To minimize costs, and the intrusion on the families they would be visiting, they acted as their own crew -- Mr. Blitz filming, Mr. Welch recording. "It was incredibly nerve-racking for Jeff and me," said Mr. Welch, 38. "Neither of us had ever operated this equipment before."
That they pulled it off is attested to by a long list of festival prizes and the continuing goodwill of the families featured in the movie. For the fact is, you can't practice spelling alone. The champion speller in Myla Goldberg's 2000 novel "Bee Season" can close her eyes and magically see words. Real spellers spend grueling hours going over lists and learning etymology. But sooner or later they have to test themselves by spelling words they hear. Usually, their partner is a parent. Gale DeGideo looks dolefully at the camera and laments that in working with her daughter, April, she encounters so many words she can't pronounce. On the phone from Ambler, Pa., Ms. DeGideo recalled being so mired in tongue-twisting arcana that she didn't recognize the word "episode," turning it into "eePIZZodee." April figured it out anyway, and they laughed for 20 minutes. 
Sometimes, parents can't help. The first one to show up in "Spellbound" is Ubaldo Arenivar, Angela's father, at work as a ranch hand in Perryton, Tex. Angela's older brother, Jorge, is enlisted to translate for Mr. Arenivar, who, after 20 years in the United States, speaks limited English. When Angela needles her father about it, Jorge says, he replies that the cows he spends his days with don't speak English either. 
On the other end of the economic scale is Dr. Rajesh Kadakia, a physician in San Clemente, Calif. He arrived in the United States at about the same time as Mr. Arenivar, and clearly absorbed the go-getting values of his adopted country. Neil got the spelling bug from his older sister, who competed twice in the national bee. "My parents asked, 'Are you sure you want to go all the way with this?' " he recalled in a telephone interview. When the answer was yes, Dr. Kadakia swung into action, compiling data, buying software, enlisting coaches and, of course, sitting with Neil and reading him thousands upon thousands of words. Darjeeling was not one of them, and, Dr. Kadakia said, the family, strictly vegetarian, drinks neither coffee nor tea.
Chance plays a large role in the spelling bee, and most observers would think it a stroke of luck for an Indian boy to draw Darjeeling. But not Neil. A boy from Texas, of all places, got yenta. Emily Stagg aced one word borrowed from French but dinged on another. Chance also had a lot to do with which of the 12 families who welcomed the filmmakers ended up stars, and which didn't. At different stages, "Spellbound" included as many as 12 children and as few as 6. Mr. Blitz and his editor, Yana Gorskaya, just kept recutting the film, going on instinct, he said, until they felt they had it right. Two of the spellers who were in the six-kid version aren't in the final one. Leaving spellers out was, Mr. Blitz says, the hardest part of making the film. Watching it, you know why.

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 4-27-03: THE ETHICIST; 
Fair Housing

BYLINE:  By Randy Cohen 

 BODY:
While apartment shopping, my girlfriend was offered a place that another couple were also vying for. When she went to sign the lease, the landlord implied that the sexual orientation of the two other people was a factor in his decision. My girlfriend is loath to benefit from bigotry, but it is possible that the apartment was awarded on her merits -- credit rating, references, etc. Is she ethically obliged to turn it down? S.A., Great Barrington, Mass.
 Your girlfriend's sensitivity is admirable, but as you suggest, the landlord's comments were too ambiguous to prove discrimination or to compel her to forsake this apartment. Their encounter demonstrates only that he might be a jerk. Here in New York, with apartments scarce and jerks plentiful, many of us would rent from the devil himself, and some think we have. 
 If your girlfriend believed that the landlord engaged in a continuing pattern of discrimination -- if, for example, he managed many large buildings and displayed a sign in his office saying "No Irish Need Apply (Practicing Discrimination Since 1847)" -- then she would have to refuse the apartment and notify the authorities. It would be dishonorable to participate in such housing bias. 
In her actual situation, she was right to take the apartment. No good would come of her rejecting it. But she should, if possible, alert the rebuffed tenants to the landlord's remarks. And once she has the protection of a signed lease, she can go further and raise the matter with the landlord himself. If he confirms a biased policy, she should inform those would-be renters. It is they who, as the injured parties, can bring legal action and, if they win, get restitution from the landlord, which would not result in your girlfriend being evicted.
 HAPPY ENDING FOLLOW-UP: S.A. reports that the couple in question moved in next door to S.A.'s girlfriend in a building owned and newly renovated by this very landlord. She did, indeed, have the guy wrong. My answer stands to what is now, happily, both a hypothetical question about housing discrimination and a testament to his girlfriend's not rushing to judgment.
Drug companies frequently charge the same amount for different strengths of a medication, such as 1-, 2- and 5-milligram tablets. I sometimes prescribe 20-milligram tablets when patients take 10 milligrams daily. They can easily split the pills in half. No harm is done if the two portions are slightly unequal. (The local V.A. hospital does this with many pills, including Viagra.) The patient and the insurer save money, but the drug company makes less profit. Any thoughts? Lonnie Hanauer, M.D., Millburn, N.J.
Several thoughts. My first is one of satisfaction that the V.A. is helping older vets enjoy a happy sex life. It's the least we as a nation can do to those who served so gallantly (or even lackadaisically) in the Spanish-American War.
My second thought -- more power to you. Your deft economy is akin to buying in bulk, and there's nothing wrong with that. Patients who want the convenience of pills in their precise dosage can choose to pay more for them. Those willing to do the work of pill-splitting receive a discount. Ethics does not require us to buy retail. In fact, pill cutters are sold openly at many drug stores; no skulking necessary.
My third is that the real solution to high-priced medication lies not in individual actions like yours, however ingenious and benign, but in policy changes. So I hope that in addition to the fine thing you are already doing, you and your colleagues are lobbying for legal reforms that would benefit your patients.

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 4-27-03; 
How the West Can Be One

BYLINE:  By Timothy Garton Ash; Timothy Garton Ash is director of the European Studies Center at St. Antony's College at Oxford and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford. He is working on a book about relations between the United States and Europe.

 BODY:
Dear American Friends: We must put the West together again. Our 60-year-old community of Europe and the United States, which we have called in shorthand "the West," has been grotesquely split over Iraq. In recent months, a new Eurasian axis of France, Germany and Russia has squared up against a Euratlantic alliance of the United States, Britain and Spain. Now, after the victory in Iraq, the future of the West will be decided in the Middle East. If we care about the West, we need to work out together what to do about the Middle East.
 For where the threatening Soviet East once united us, the Middle East divides us. Yes, I know we had some spectacular trans-Atlantic rows about how to deal with the Soviet bloc, but ultimately the Red Army always concentrated our minds on the need for Western unity. I recently heard a former British foreign secretary sigh, "If only we had Brezhnev back!" But there is no more Brezhnev to pull Europe and the United States together again. 
 We are now repeating, on a larger scale, the mistake we made in the Balkans for most of the 1990's: Western states that don't have fundamentally different interests in a region nonetheless pursue different policies there. Or can you explain to me how the vital interests of France, Germany or Britain in the Middle East differ from those of the United States? I mean vital interests, not the habitual incidentals of competition for oil, contracts and influence. Remember that several of the Al Qaeda terrorists who struck on Sept. 11 started out in Hamburg. The Arab and Muslim world is where the "war against terrorism" will be won or lost. 
Americans and Europeans have an overwhelming common interest in seeing democracy, peace and prosperity spread through the Middle East -- not least, so that Israel is one day physically connected to the West by a patchwork of Islamic or post-Islamic democracies. This means handing back Iraq as soon as possible to the Iraqis and supporting their federal or confederal democracy. Then, and urgently, it means trying to make progress toward secure, viable states of both Israel and Palestine. One unintended consequence of the war on Iraq is that this can no longer wait. The Palestinian question is now, for the Arab and Muslim world -- and for many Europeans -- the litmus test of whether the Bush administration means what it says about liberating and democratizing the Middle East rather than occupying and colonizing it. 
A genuine project of democratization also involves helping to make Iraq's neighbor Turkey worthy of membership in the European Union -- itself an international community with demanding standards of respect for human and minority rights. In countries like Iran and Saudi Arabia, it means supporting reform, and perhaps ultimately what I have called refolution, that is, the mixture of reform from above and people's power from below that triumphed in Poland and Hungary in 1989. In all these places, we need to listen to the people in the countries concerned, as we did in Central and Eastern Europe during the cold war. Now those Poles, Hungarians and Czechs that we helped to liberate are themselves fully part of the West and ready to join us in doing for and with the oppressed of the Middle East what was once done for and with them.
This should not, by the way, be a division of labor where the United States does the hard war-fighting and Europe picks up the burden of peaceful reconstruction afterwards: "America does the cooking; Europe does the washing up." That is unhealthy for any modern relationship, even if we accept (which I don't) that Americans are from Mars and Europeans are from Venus. Europe needs to do more of the cooking; America, more of the washing up. 
At the moment, Europeans and Americans don't even see the threat the same way. During the cold war, Berlin always felt itself to be more directly threatened than New York; now it's the other way round. I have no doubt that the collapse of the twin towers on Sept. 11, 2001, was the true beginning of the 21st century. The combination of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism, whether by rogue states or rogue groups, is one of the greatest new dangers to all free countries. Americans have woken up -- been woken up -- to this in a way that most Europeans have not. Europe has not yet had its 9/11. There is both hypocrisy and an ostrichlike head-in-the-sand quality about much European discussion, or nondiscussion, of these issues. Tony Blair is the exception who proves the rule. Criticizing America, Europeans sometimes are, as Kipling famously put it, "makin' mock o' uniforms that guard you while you sleep." 
However, it is not simply that Europeans feel less threatened by Islamic extremism; in other ways, we feel more so. There are now at least 10 million Muslim immigrants living in the European Union, not to mention the more than 5 million who have lived elsewhere in Europe for centuries in places like Bosnia, Albania and Kosovo. European fears that this Muslim population could be radicalized by events in the Middle East are neither unfounded nor ignoble. Over the next decade, Europe will probably take in another 10 million Muslims, plus at least another 60 million if the E.U. delivers on its promise to include Turkey, which the United States has been urging us to do. As the native European population ages, we could soon find that 1 in every 10 Europeans is a Muslim. It is our elemental concern that peaceful, law-abiding Muslims should feel at home in Europe, and in the West more broadly. 
Please remember that the democratic politics of Europe have been rocked over the last few years by populist parties that won a large share of the vote essentially on one issue: hostility to immigration. In Europe today that means, especially, Muslim immigration: Moroccans in Spain, Algerians in France, Turks in Germany, Pakistanis in Britain. (I have just bought my newspaper from a Muslim news agent, picked up my cleaning from a Muslim cleaner and collected my prescription from a Muslim pharmacist, all in leafy North Oxford.) 
America is much better than Europe at making immigrants of all creeds and colors feel at home. Obviously, it helps that almost everyone in the U.S. is an immigrant or the descendant of immigrants. America also has a capacious, civic national identity, whereas Europe has a patchwork of exclusive, ethnic national identities. Have you ever met anyone who identified himself or herself as a "Muslim European"? It actually seems easier for religious Muslims to integrate into a religious but pluralist society like the United States than it is for them to integrate into the very secular societies of Europe. So here we can learn from you.
Yet the American-led war on Iraq has not helped to make Muslims, especially Arab Muslims, feel welcome in the West. I don't need to remind you that the U.S. has some six million Muslims of its own, with more to come. Sensitivity to the wider impact of what will be seen as an Anglo-American neocolonial occupation of an Arab land is not cowardice; it is a necessary weapon in the long-term war against terrorism.
Europeans also tend to have a different analysis of the threat, one that pays more attention to the political causes of Islamist terror and, in particular, to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Palestine is the great symbolic cause of the Arab-Muslim world, repeatedly embraced by Osama bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, the whole Arab League and the "Arab street" -- hypocritically, perhaps, but nonetheless effectively. Many Europeans feel that giving the Palestinians a viable state could be a bigger contribution to winning the war against terrorism than deposing Saddam Hussein. In this respect, Tony Blair is very much a European. He has extracted from Washington a commitment to revive the "road map" for the peace process between Israel and Palestine. I was deeply depressed the other day to hear from a well-placed American political insider, a Democrat, that no real progress on the issue can be expected until after the November 2004 presidential elections. The Bush administration now has to prove him wrong. Perhaps if Bush had not started the war against Iraq, Palestine might just have waited that long; but he did, and so it can't.
At this point, I should mention a charge made by some conservative commentators in the United States. This is that European support for a viable Palestinian state reflects hostility to a viable Israeli state, which in turn reflects Europe's ancestral, almost genetic anti-Semitism. Vicious attacks on synagogues and individual Jews in European cities are rolled into one poisonous European ball with reasoned criticism of both the Sharon government and the Bush administration's outspoken support for it. For a European to criticize Sharon is for him or her to be an anti-Semite. "What we are seeing," wrote Charles Krauthammer in The Washington Post last April, "is pent-up anti-Semitism, the release -- with Israel as the trigger -- of a millennium-old urge that powerfully infected and shaped European history." He continued, "What so offends Europeans is the armed Jew, the Jew who refuses to sustain seven suicide bombings in the seven days of Passover and strikes back." It's "those people" again, the Europeans. 
I have no doubt that there is still anti-Semitism in Europe today. Broadly speaking, it's of three kinds. There's the virulent anti-Semitism of some Arabs living in Europe, a minority within that minority; there's the very nasty anti-Semitism of the old and new far right in some European countries; and there's the residual, mainly verbal anti-Semitism of parts of the wider population. Yet there are also many, many Europeans who are pro-Palestinian without being anti-Israeli, let alone anti-Semitic. Some of them take a grimly realistic view of Yasir Arafat and his weak, corrupt Palestinian Authority. 
To tar such reasoned European critics of the policies of Ariel Sharon with blanket charges of anti-Semitism is offensive -- especially to those of us, Jewish or not, for whom the Holocaust remains central to our whole understanding of liberal politics. In particular, many of us understand the whole European project embodied in the European Union as being, at its deepest core, about the post-Holocaust "never again." 
We, for our part, are worried by a tendency among conservative Republicans to celebrate and to exaggerate American power. In particular, they exaggerate the United States' capacity to deploy that power effectively outside existing alliances and international institutions. This hyperpower unilateralism seems to us a real departure from the post-1945 tradition of American foreign policy. It's yielding to the temptation that flows from finding yourself -- absent Brezhnev -- as the sole superpower after the end of the cold war. 
The new American hubris combines an overestimation of the military dimension of power (to the neglect of theother two dimensions, economic and "soft" power) with an overestimation of what the United States can do on its own or in small "coalitions of the willing." I recently asked a senior political figure in Washington how he imagined that the "war against terrorism" would end. "With the elimination of the terrorists," he replied. His answer shocked me. Does he really believe that you can win the war against terrorism by military and police means alone? You can win the war against an established state like Saddam Hussein's Iraq, but you can't win the peace this way. We've been seeing that on the streets of Baghdad since Saddam's fall. As Talleyrand once said, you can do anything with bayonets except sit on them. To emerge ultimately victorious in the broader "war against terrorism," it is the peace we have to win, first in Iraq, then in the wider Middle East.
To win the peace, we have to get the symbolism right. That unforgettable scene when an American soldier draped the Stars and Stripes over the head of the giant statue of Saddam Hussein, then hastily took it off, has fatally marred the "fall of the Berlin Wall" moment at the end of this war. The Pentagon seriously proposed that a former head of the C.I.A. should become information minister in the new occupation administration. (A satirical novelist like Evelyn Waugh would have blanched at such a crude comic device.) It also seems to me that it would be a crass mistake not to try the Saddamite mass murderers under international law. You couldn't find a better way to make ordinary Iraqis reject this as "victors' justice." For heaven's sake, ask the U.N. to establish a special tribunal for Iraq, as it did for Yugoslavia. Then send Saddam's recently captured two half-brothers and Saddam himself in the unlikely event that we catch him alive, to sit in the Hague, up the corridor from Slobodan Milosevic.
Even the United States, now the most powerful country in the history of the world, cannot manage this process on its own. Militarily, yes, but not politically. I'm as ready as the next man to wallow in neo-Churchillian sentiment about our renewed Anglo-American comradeship in arms -- for approximately five minutes. Two Anglo-Saxon powers are not enough; adding Australia just makes it three WASPs in a desert. Ah, you may say, but that's not all: Washington claimed support in the Iraq war from 45 countries. Who needs France when you have stout Micronesia at your side? As for Europe, we are told that the United States can manage just fine with a combination of Blair's Britain, Jose Maria Aznar's Spain, Silvio Berlusconi's Italy and what Donald Rumsfeld calls "new Europe" -- that is, the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe that will shortly be joining the European Union. Now this is a serious point for the future of the West, seriously wrong. 
My old friends in the post-dissident political elites of Central and Eastern Europe today are generally more pro-American than their French or German counterparts. They are grateful to the United States for its support in their struggle for freedom; some are still worried about Russia; they believe in the trans-Atlantic community of values, about which Vaclav Havel has spoken so well. Their publics and some of their political successors are already less sure. As these countries are integrated into the European Union, they will probably identify more with Europe. Above all, though, their message to Washington, on the one side, and to Paris and Berlin on the other, is "Please don't ask us to choose between you!" They are right. Let me say this as emphatically as I can: the West will include France and Germany, or the West will no longer exist.
Believe me, I hold no brief for Gerhard Schroder and Jacques Chirac. Every Western leader has miscalculated over Iraq, including Bush and Blair, but these two behaved especially badly. Schroder has opportunistically stoked the flames of pacifist opinion in Germany in order to remain in power. Chirac has been grandstanding in pursuit of a neo-Gaullist dream of France leading a rassemblement of the non-American world. His commitment to veto a second U.N. Security Council resolution, whatever its terms might be, was outrageous. His crude and arrogant criticism of East European support for the United States was as crass as anything Donald Rumsfeld has said about "old Europe."
Yet the French-bashing in Washington has gone too far. (A French-American friend points out wryly that while the French fries on the menu on Capitol Hill have been renamed Freedom fries, the menu is still called menu.) It's odd that this should need restating, but France is one of the classic lands of Western liberty, or as the French once put it themselves, liberte, egalite and fraternite. France remains the second most important military power in Europe, after Britain. No serious European policy can be made without it. During the disastrous diplomatic prelude to the Iraq war, some Americans may have wished that Churchill had never succeeded in persuading Roosevelt to give France a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council. But Churchill was right: the Europe we want cannot be built without France. So Washington should not indulge in the old imperial pastime of divide et impera, divide and rule. A divided Europe is not in our interest or yours.
A more united Europe and a less arrogant United States should work together with all the peoples of the Middle East to do for them what we did with and for the peoples of Middle Europe during the cold war. This can be our trans-Atlantic project for the next generation. Here's how we put the West together again. 
Shall we talk about it?

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER; 
Agents Who Cut Trips to Fit

BYLINE:  By SUSAN CATTO; SUSAN CATTO contributes to The Times from Toronto.

 BODY:
ON a recent trip to Spain, the Dickson family of Long Beach, Calif., lunched with a local writer in Seville, bicycled through the countryside along a route designed with their fitness levels in mind and enjoyed a private visit to a bull ranch, where bullfighters got in a ring with heifers.
 "We could have gone down and faced the heifers too if we wanted," said Mark Dickson, who traveled with his wife and their three grown children. "That's something you won't get in a tour." Nor was it an experience they planned on their own; the day had been arranged by a custom travel planner at Butterfield & Robinson, the tour company in Toronto. 
 Today, most people can book flights and hotels online, and professional and amateur reviews on travel Web sites take some of the guesswork out of choosing accommodations and restaurants. Yet there is still a place for the travel consultant with intimate knowledge of a region and the phone number of a guide who won't make you visit knickknack shops on your way back to the hotel. 
While group tours must cater to a range of travelers and their (often incompatible) personalities, custom travel -- a trip arranged to your specifications by a travel agent or tour company -- can combine some conveniences of a group tour with the flexibility, personal itinerary and privacy of traveling alone. 
Travel consultants have helped clients experience puppetry in Vietnam, meet beekeepers in France and explore traditional medicines in China. For experienced travelers like Fred Hayes, a lawyer from Chicago, they can take the guesswork out of group tours. "About half the trips I take are custom trips because I like to travel with friends," Mr. Hayes said, adding that he believes that custom planners know the best guides.

Keeping Tabs
A typical custom package includes help in choosing destinations, routes and accommodations, sightseeing recommendations and hand-picked guides, access to private facilities, introductions to local people and restaurant reservations. The best custom travel providers stay in contact with clients during a trip, keeping the itinerary flexible and providing a safety cushion should a voyage take an unexpected turn. 
Myths and Mountains, a company based in Nevada, found Mr. Hayes's luggage when it was missing in Mongolia in July 2001. The safari planner Ker & Downey, a Houston company specializing in Africa and the Middle East, made an instant itinerary change for Robert Mark and his three companions after they arrived in southern Africa last August. 
"We were originally going to stay in Zimbabwe, but the political situation at the time was a little dicey, so we said, 'Let's go across the river to Zambia and stay there just to be on the safe side,"' said Mr. Mark, a retired rental car company executive from Smithtown, N.Y. The travelers even got their deposit back on the Zimbabwe hotel. 
Such personalization doesn't come cheap. Some consultants charge a planning fee up front, while others earn commissions or incorporate their fees into the overall package price. Either way, a custom trip will be more expensive than tours or packages that benefit from economies of scale.
Elizabeth Lollock, of the Chicago-based custom travel company Destination by Design, has planned trips to Panama that come in at less than $200 a day and trips to Italy at more than $1,200 a day. "Typically, people who are looking for cheap, cheap trips are not going to be inclined to spend the time with me," she said. 
Custom companies earn their repeat business on high-end, complex or exotic trips that already require a substantial investment. Going on safari is a good example, said Mark Brady, president of Ker & Downey, "It's not inexpensive," he said. "When you've made the decision to spend that much money, you want to have it your way." 

Questioning the Agent
While many agencies and tour companies advertise itinerary planning, it's unwise to hand over your holiday without first determining the consultant's experience, contacts and references. 
"Travelers should not hesitate to ask question after question," said Valerie Wilson, a Manhattan travel agent specializing in luxury European itineraries. 
Ask consultants how recently they have visited the region and what they liked and disliked, what kind of trips they've arranged and how they choose partners at your destination. The best consultants will have met local operators, tried various services and hotels and gathered a sense of local customs.
"They may have deals or contracts set up with 20 or 30 different suppliers, so you're much more likely to get something that's right for you," said David Feit, chief executive of Travants, a company in New York that matches travelers and agents.
Ask if the planners' involvement ends when you pick up the tickets, or if they provide both local contacts and continued monitoring. It is also a good idea to look at past itineraries and prices, and to ask to be put in touch with at least two people who have planned trips to your region, if only to ensure that every customer doesn't get the same trip. 
Once you have settled on a planner, expect to be questioned in return, often right up to the day of your departure as the planner fine-tunes. The more a consultant knows about your travel experience, preferences, budget and expectations, the more likely you are to end up with the trip of your dreams. Choosing the hotel with the right level of formality, the menu with the desired adventurousness, the ideal balance between lingering and moving on -- this is where a planner can beat the Internet.

A Wave of Renovations in Fairfield's Private Schools

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
MOST of Fairfield County's 26 independent elementary and secondary schools are responding to changing technologies and teaching philosophies by expanding and modernizing, much as the county's public schools have been doing, but for different reasons. 
 A steady increase in enrollments had stretched the public schools to their limit, and in the county's affluent communities, where highly rated public schools enhance the value of residential real estate, expenditures of millions of dollars for additions and new construction have generally been approved. 
 At private schools, "enrollments have been stagnant or at zoning maximums," said Peter Tacy, executive director of the Connecticut Association of Independent Schools. Town zoning regulations restrict the amount of land to be covered by school buildings, keeping construction within existing neighborhood patterns. "Most boards," he said, "have decided to limit enrollments to a certain figure. Research shows that smaller is better -- high outcome for kids is related to school size. The reason expansions are proceeding is because of outdated, cramped space and the need for new facilities like performing arts centers, computer, science and technology labs, not an increase in enrollments." 
As interest rates fell, options for upgrading and new construction became more attractive, and for those private schools that qualify as established institutions with serious assets, bonding from the Connecticut Health and Educational Facilities Authority, known as Chefa, is available at lower rates than traditional lenders offer.
"The low end cutoff for projects applying for Chefa funds is $5 million," said the authority's director, Richard Gray. The quasi-public, self-supporting agency is governed by a private board that excludes projects under that amount. "We steer those schools toward conventional bank financing, which is more cost effective than ours because of our bond council fees, financial adviser fees, underwriters and other fees. Investors from the financial community who underwrite the tax exempt bonds look on this as an extraordinarily secure investment. Chefa has never had a default."
Among the many private schools undergoing or about to begin construction are four that are representative of the trend. A new girls' school is to be built at Fairfield Country Day School, established in 1936 for boys in kindergarten through ninth grade and housed in the 47 rooms of the 1890 Bronson mansion in Fairfield's Greenfield Hills Historic District. Its headmaster, Robert D. Vitalo, is guiding fund-raising for the $15 million free-standing building; $7.5 million has been raised, $5 million is pledged, and "we will use Chefa bonds for the rest," he said.
"We want to be able to take care of all the kids in the family, but we feel that single sex education has great value. We have boys sing, dance and do art, and we will have girls doing math, science and hockey." The boys' school has 270 students, and there will eventually be a maximum of 250 girls. 
FEW suburban private schools were built originally for educational purposes; most were converted from estates whose spacious grounds represent priceless open space to neighboring homeowners. When loss of such open space is imminent, even within zoning regulations, schools face the same neighborhood outcry that developers of housing encounter. 
Last September, neighbors of Fairfield Country Day filed suit in Superior Court in Bridgeport seeking an injunction to prevent the school from proceeding with its plans, claiming that in 1996, after a new lobby, gymnasium and other improvements were made at the boys' school, its officials promised not to increase enrollment or construction. The injunction was not issued.
The town allows 10 percent of the acreage to be covered by buildings and a floor area ratio of 20 percent of the 25-acre property. The boys' school has a footprint of 34,000 square feet and a floor area of 52,000 square feet. The three-story girls' school will have a footprint of 14,000 square feet and a floor area of 50,000 square feet. The architect is the firm of McManus Peterman of Cambridge, Mass. 
Lawyers for both sides agree that the promise was not in writing. Meanwhile, the school will apply for an inland wetlands certificate of conformance in the next few weeks. If the certification is granted, a full application for construction will be submitted to the planning and zoning commission.
Greens Farms Academy in Westport, with a co-ed enrollment of 570, was founded in 1925 as Mrs. Bolton's School for Girls. Since 1960 it has occupied the 42-acre former Vanderbilt estate overlooking Long Island Sound, and in 1970 the school, which covers kindergarten through 12th grade, began admitting boys. The school is gradually reconfiguring its warren of rooms with some of the $35 million capital campaign money to be raised over the next five years. 
The first $15 million phase, for which $11.5 million is in hand, involves the reconstructing the estate's stables and building an addition to them. A completed portion of the conversion has resulted in light-filled lower school classrooms designed by Butler Rogers & Baskett, Norwalk architects. Opened earlier this month, the rooms are set up to allow children to move about freely among various hands-on learning stations.
"We are not now seeking Chefa financing," said Martha Lord, assistant to the headmaster, Peter T. Esty. "We're financing with bank debt but sometime in the future, we will consider rolling it into Chefa bonds." At that time the school will embark on its major project: construction of a performing arts center. Westport allows 25 percent coverage of the land, but that figure includes buildings, driveways, parking lots and setbacks of 50 feet from lot lines.
The Wooster School in Danbury was built in 1926 as a Episcopal school for young men. Today, its 125-acre campus has a co-ed student population of 422, kindergarten through 12th grade, and Episcopalians are no longer the largest group, said John Katz, a trustee in charge of building and land development. 
"We are in site-plan review with the city for a new state-of-the-art 14,500-square-foot middle school," he said. The existing middle school is cramped and will be used for various programs. "We believe there is room for growth," he said. "We see the need for additional classroom space in future, and a new high school, and we would like to enhance dining facilities -- we now have three seatings." 
The school currently has 15 faculty and staff residences, three gymnasiums, a science building, a main building and a chapel. The new middle school will cost about $3.7 million, including the installation of a mile-long sewer line from the campus to an existing pumping station. 
Each year the county's private schools routinely turn away hundreds of applicants because of the finite number of openings, Still, Mr. Katz said, "it's a challenge for private schools to make the case that their education is better than the best public schools, because in so many surrounding areas the public schools are notably good academically. 
"But they aim at a certain type of student. If you are not one of them, you are likely to be left behind. Because admissions are exacting, we can discover the Bill Gates that the public school thinks is a pain in the neck, but the private school will pick up on."
Karen Luneberg put her five children on three private school waiting lists after moving to Greenwich from Florida. "The twins went to public school here for the first year," she said. "It's a lovely school, but a lot of the work was redundant of the work they did in private school in Florida. Private schools pay more attention to children who need help. I had them tutored while they were waiting for admission, so they wouldn't fall behind."
She enrolled them at King & Low-Heywood Thomas School in Stamford, where 650 children in prekindergarten (age 4) through 12th grade pursue an array of subjects and programs on a 42-acre campus. KLHT is a long-term consolidation of several schools beginning with Mrs. Richardson's School for Girls, founded in 1865; Hiram King's Day School for Boys, founded in 1875; Louisa Low and Edith Heywood's School in 1883; and Miss Thomas's School in 1922. In 1962 the King School bought the estate of Richard L. Simon, a founder of Simon & Schuster; in 1969 Low-Heywood School moved next door; in 1975 Low-Heywood and Thomas Schools merged, and in 1988 the King School and Low-Heywood Thomas merged, creating the present campus. 
Plans for a new 24,000-square-foot middle school include a two-story, skylighted media center, performance space, classrooms, offices and science labs, designed by Centerbrook Architects of Ivoryton. A new internal road connecting opposite ends of the campus will improve circulation and reduce traffic on and off Newfield Avenue, and drainage problems caused by storm water runoff into residential areas below the school were resolved last fall.
Stamford's Zoning Board of Appeals approved the plans last September, including a 2,800-square-foot headmaster's house soon to be occupied by the current headmaster, Thomas B. Main. In October a lawsuit was filed in Bridgeport Superior Court by neighbors seeking to stop all construction. No briefs have been filed. The school's lawyer, William Hennessey, said the litigants are trying to resolve their differences in ongoing discussions. Brenden Leydon, who won a lawsuit on behalf of the public against Greenwich's residents-only rule for beach access, represents the neighbors.

A Grand View, and Metro-North Too

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA 

DATELINE: IRVINGTON, N.Y. 

 BODY:
THE view from the Hudson River waterside here is expansive, with the Palisades visible across the broad stretch of water and the scene bracketed by the Tappan Zee and George Washington bridges.
 The developers of Bridge Street Properties are counting on the view and the prospect of modern office space adjacent to a major commuter railroad to lure tenants to a speculative 25,000-square-foot office building they plan to start constructing next month. 
 The building, whose facade will be 70 percent windows to allow occupants to enjoy the views and to admit as much natural light as possible, is the latest undertaking in a development that has transformed a large part of an old factory complex to offices and retail space.
It is also part of an effort by private interests and municipalities along the Hudson, stretching from Yonkers to Troy, to reclaim waterfronts long blocked by obsolete industrial plants that once relied on water transportation to bring in raw materials and ship out finished goods.
The manufacturing operations have mostly ceased or moved elsewhere, leaving decaying buildings, often with contaminated land, between the communities and their waterfront. The current trend is to clear away the problems and use waterfronts as an attraction, said Thomas Wright, executive vice president of the Regional Plan Association. 
"Water and rail transportation is the reason places developed in the first place," he said. "Over the last 10 to 15 years there has been a trend of putting amenities on waterfronts that will tie them into the regional economy."
The nine-acre Bridge Street site, which is west of Metro-North's Hudson River rail line, is the kind of place that could not happen if it were not already in existence. In 1890, according to the developers, a local company called Lord & Burnham acquired the right to fill in the river to create new land for its expanding business, something that would not be permitted today. The factory complex, which produced large greenhouses and boilers to heat them in winter, was built from 1910 and 1913, said Andrew Lyons, one of the co-owners of Bridge Street Properties. In those days the river was a major transportation artery, with riverboats carrying bricks from numerous brickyards in the area and stone from nearby quarries to build apartment buildings and brownstone houses in New York. River traffic has decreased since, although fuel oil and other commodities are still shipped upriver by barge.
Manufacturing at the site ceased in 1985 (Burnham Steel Boilers still operates in Lancaster, Pa.) and by the early 1990's the buildings were being used as a warehouse for a moving and storage company.
After joining his father's moving company in the mid-1980's, William Thompson decided that the complex of buildings could be better used as a waterfront business community. The development of parks to the north and south of the site by the village of Irvington added to its attractiveness.
THE partners first leased and then bought the 200,000-square-feet buildings and began converting them to office space. Large windows were cut into previously featureless brick walls and in some places floors were raised so that office workers would have river views while seated at their desks. But the industrial exterior of the buildings was preserved, as was much of the maple flooring and the cypress columns and ceiling planks. New glass was installed in the sawtooth skylights to bring in additional natural light.
Inside the old factory walls, new heating, air-conditioning and power and telecommunications equipment were installed to meet modern business requirements.
The complex is now home to about 50 businesses employing about 550 people and includes the Eileen Fisher women's clothing design company, the developers say. About a dozen of the tenants relocated from New York City, they add, and close to 100 workers reverse-commute from the city in another example of how good public transportation can promote development.
The rail link also allows companies who left the city to stay in touch with clients who remained behind. Executives can take uncrowded daytime trips into the city, hold meetings and depart before the crush of commuters starts heading home, Mr. Thompson said. 
Mr. Lyons said that "it is a lot different here than in the city, and the access to good transportation gives people the opportunity for a new lifestyle." That new lifestyle includes practices that would be unheard of in Manhattan.
"We like dogs," Mr. Thompson said. "We must have half a dozen people who bring their dogs to work occasionally."
The office complex also is close to the center of Irvington, a town of about 6,000 whose Main Street runs down to the train station. "It's a close-knit kind of place," Mr. Thompson said. "My daughter walks down here to my office once a week or so to do her homework." Mr. Thompson and Mr. Lyons also own a small boat club at the north end of the property.
In addition to the new three-story building, which is expected to be completed by the end of the year, the partners are continuing to renovate parts of the old factory. Combined, the two projects are expected to add 75,000 square feet of office space at the site this year.
One inhibitor to waterfront development, said Mr. Wright of the Regional Plan Association, was what he called "well-intentioned environmental laws" that require unrealistically pristine cleanups and leave uncertain the legal liability of developers and their lenders.
These so-called brownfield issues were not much of a problem at the site, despite its manufacturing history, Mr. Lyons said. Old fuel tanks are a common source of pollution as they rust and leak over time. But here the tanks were above ground and protected in vaults, he said
The design intention for the new building is that it appear to be the offices of the factory complex, Mr. Thompson said. "It needs to look as if it was designed in 1900," he said, "not a century later."
The new building is being designed to green standards, he said, which means maximizing energy efficiency and using recycled materials. Because so much of the facade will be enclosed by glass windows (with old-style sashes that can be opened) the glass chosen is one that admits light but reflects solar heat rays. In addition, the core of the building that contains the utilities has been compacted in the center, so that daylight can reach all the working spaces of the structure. The architect for the project is Walter Sedovic of Irvington.
The developers are exploring recycling some of the cypress planking taken out of the old buildings into wood blocks that could be used as flooring in the new building or in the continuing renovation of the old ones. But they have been forced to order old-looking new brick for the outer walls of the new building. "We tried to use recycled brick, but there was just not enough of it from the renovation operation," Mr. Lyons said.
Mr. Thompson said he expected to sign either a single tenant for the entire new building or tenants for each of the three floors before the building was completed. He said prime candidates were financial industry companies interested in following concerns like Morgan Stanley and New York Life that have recently established operations in Westchester Country.
"The floor sizes, at 8,000 square feet, are well suited to small mutual funds and financial consulting companies," Mr. Thompson said. "We hope it will be attractive to companies whose executives already live in Westchester."

Nassau Links Housing and Economic Growth

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH 

 BODY:
WHEN Raffaela Petrasek was hired as a vice president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation nearly 10 years ago, 42nd Street at Times Square was a seedy, down-at-the-heels place. 
 Last month, when she left to become the director of Nassau County's newly formed Economic Development Corporation, the seediness had largely given way to office towers and new hotels, renovated theaters and glistening new stores and tourist attractions. And as the senior real estate negotiator for the city and state, Ms. Petrasek gets a fair share of the credit for the turnaround from her former boss, Jonathan Fair, an executive vice president of the New York development group. Last month Peter T. Sylver, Nassau's deputy county executive, recruited Ms. Petrasek, a Huntington resident, for the county's own fledgling economic development corporation. Once again her mission will be to spur economic growth by nurturing strategic real estate deals. 
 But this time there is a major difference. The Times Square renaissance was built on adding heavily subsidized commercial buildings, but the county's plan hinges on encouraging the construction of 700 units of affordable housing. . 
Specifically, her job will be to spur economic growth by expanding the stock of affordable housing in Nassau County. It is an idea, several people involved in planning the strategy said, based on no existing economic development models, certainly none implemented on Long Island, but one that addresses one of the biggest roadblocks to economic growth. 
Mr. Sylver said the county hoped to recruit and retain businesses -- and revitalize downtown areas -- by deploying $7 million in federal housing money to create the 700 units. They will be new or renovated, he said, and would be built in commercial and downtown areas, perhaps even in industrial parks. 
The details, Mr. Sylver said, are still being worked out and he could not estimate how many of the units would be owned or with rented, or what sort of buildings would be built or where. 
He did say, however, that about 125 units would be earmarked for low-income residents and that the buildings would be scattered around the county, which was organized into 35 economic zones for this purpose last year by Thomas R. Suozzi, the county executive.
Mr. Sylver said the county was looking at a wide range of building types, including condominiums, town houses, stand-alone single-family structures, multiunit rentals and converted apartment houses with a mix of owner-occupied units sold at market rates and subsidized units rented to low-income tenants.
The county also plans to seek additional financing for the project from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.
"HUD housing is extremely important to our county, because the median income is so high," Mr. Sylver said. "A family of four can make $66,400 and still be eligible. So we're talking about teachers and postal workers."
Complaints about the high cost of housing on Long Island abound, and much of the complaining comes from business leaders. The Long Island Association, the area's largest business group, and the Long Island Regional Planning Board, along with many other groups, say that the cost of housing is one of the biggest deterrents to economic growth on the Island.
But complaining about housing prices has not yet translated into widespread support for government-financed housing initiatives. Lee E. Koppelman, the executive director of the regional planning board, said that most of the support for affordable housing on Long Island was limited to housing for older residents. "And seniors aren't part of the work force," Dr. Koppelman said.
The theory behind Nassau County's strategy is apparently untested. Mr. Sylver said that combining affordable housing and economic growth makes sense, even if this is the first time the two have been explicitly linked. But he added that how to capitalize on the benefits is still being sorted out by an advisory panel that includes Scott Rechler, the chairman of Reckson Associates, the real estate developer in Melville; Frank Castagna, who owns the Americana Shopping Plaza in Manhasset; and Jon Weinstein, the president of Apex Plastic Industries in Hauppauge.
The county might, for example, encourage employers by offering to defer sales tax for companies that agreed to hire workers from subsidized housing, he said.
More likely, the law of supply and demand will determine the outcome. By adding more housing, prices will drop, according to basic supply and demand theory. More workers will be able to live on Long Island, and that will make the region more appealing to employers.
Mr. Sylver challenged Dr. Koppelman's position that housing for the elderly failed to expand housing for the work force. "When retirees leave their houses, working families will be able to buy their homes and move in," Mr. Sylver said. "Plus retirees will be able to stay in the county and not leave."
Irwin Kellner, an economics professor at Hofstra University and the chairman of the county's Council of Economic Advisers, said that as far as he knew, the strategy of tying economic development to the construction of affordable housing was a Nassau County innovation.
"I have no idea if it's been done before, but it seems like a good idea," Dr. Kellner said. "Housing on Long Island in particular has jumped so rapidly in price that many people are priced out of the market. Yet the services those workers provide are needed by the economy."
Situating at least some of the new housing in commercial areas will also support downtown revitalization, one of six economic priorities set out last year by Mr. Suozzi. "For the most part, affordable housing will be in downtown areas, " Dr. Kellner said. "You fix up and build where the land is cheaper. You can't tell developers to put up housing at a loss. This being the case, they're going to put up affordable housing where values are lower. That tends to be in downtown areas."
Dr. Kellner said that this approach was economically justified and that it would also sidestep well-organized neighborhood opposition. "If you were to mandate putting up an apartment house in the middle of a two-acre suburban zone, you would get a negative reaction," he said. "But I don't sense you would if you put it in downtown or in an industrial area."
Neal Lewis, the executive director of the Long Island Neighborhood Network, a community advocacy organization, said he supported plans to tie downtown housing development with economic growth. But he added that in the past government-financed housing projects often failed because of poor planning.
"Years ago, there were so many housing mistakes," Mr. Lewis said. "You'd see a really big apartment house with hundreds of units. That's poor planning, and it overwhelms the community. You want to mix it up, 10 units here, 10 units there." 
Community opposition arises when subsidized housing in concentrated in low- and moderate-income areas, he said. Or as he put it: "I don't think we will see subsidized housing in Old Brookville." 
Dr. Koppelman, the regional planner, said that rental housing, rather than owner-occupied units, ought to be the priority, although he acknowledged that rentals represented a larger political risk. 
And the county's goals ought to be higher, he said, to make a measurable impact. "For the program to be meaningful, we need to be talking about several thousand housing units. And we're not talking about housing for people with entry-level, minimum-wage jobs. We're talking about affordable housing for engineers and scientists out of college."
"These are people earning $70,000 who can't afford to live and work in Nassau County," he said.

HEADLINE: Aviation Museum Hopes to Strut Its Stuff 

BYLINE:  By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
OFFICIALS at the Cradle of Aviation Museum love it when it rains.
Bad weather invariably means more tickets sold as families desperate to get out of the house find their way to the 130,000 square foot museum complex in East Garden City.
That's why Tom Gwynne, the museum's vice president of external affairs, recalls with mock bitterness that last summer, "it didn't rain a single day."
 But last year's drought was only one of the reasons why the museum has drawn just 240,000 visitors since it opened last May, an impressive number for a museum's first year, but well below the 400,000 visitors museum officials hoped to draw. 
 The museum was more than 30 years in the making, its opening continually delayed by fiscal crises and political infighting over the more than $40 million poured into it by Nassau County. So when the museum finally opened its doors last spring, it was still very much a work in progress -- an education director had not yet been hired and one of its key attractions, a simulated space voyage to Mars, had not yet been completed.
But perhaps more important, the $300,000 museum officials hoped to spend on advertising and marketing instead had to be largely diverted to help finish creating some of the museum's exhibits, which range from first attempts at flight in gliders and hot air balloons to World War II fighter planes and lunar test modules used in the United States' race to the moon. Promises from Albany to help market the museum along with other air and space attractions in the state also did not materialize until very recently.
The still-not-quite-finished museum chronicles Long Island's significant place in aviation history with interactive displays, model cockpits that allow children and adults to sit in a pilot's seat, and the island's only IMAX theater. 
Visitors of all ages seem impressed by the museum's scale and scope. "There's a lot more here than I thought there would be," said George Kinkel, a Levittown resident who visited the museum one rainy day last week with relatives from North Carolina and Vermont.
"I think we've basically accomplished most of our goals for the first year," said Edward J. Smits, the chief executive of Museums at Mitchel, the nonprofit agency created to run the museum.
Mr. Smits said the museum would come close to meeting a modified attendance goal of 300,000 for the fiscal year that began last July. He said museum officials had lowered their expectations to 300,000 because of "the events of 2002 and 2003," namely the recession, national security alerts and the war. He also argued that it made sense to not count the museum's first six weeks because "they were still very experimental days and not really typical for operation."
But Jane D'Amico, president of the Civil Service Employees Association, which unsuccessfully sued the county to try to stop the county's contract with Museums at Mitchel and instead have county employees run the museum, said the missed attendance goal is a sign that "sometimes giving something to a private concern is not the answer."
Given all the money the county invested in the museum, she said, operations should have stayed in county hands. "We should have kept it, used creative ways to make it shine and be a big attraction, instead of selling it off and wondering why it's not doing better," she said. "But unfortunately the county locked themselves into it and I think they'll be very sorry down the line." 
The operating agreement with Museums at Mitchel, which was formerly known as Nassau Heritage, originally had the county paying for the museum's utilities and receiving no revenues from admissions fees or concessions. But county legislators haggled with museum officials and finally settled on a 15-year lease where the county pays for some utilities and will receive a half percent of profits from 2005 to 2011, with the take rising to 3 percent after that.
The museum's $4 million budget for this last year is so far balanced, a feat that is "very positive for a museum open less than a year," said Mr. Gwynne, the museum vice president. "Long Islanders have been very receptive," he said, but the lack of any advertising budget has been a hindrance. "We need to get the message out and ideally we'd like to blanket the media and have newspaper and television ads to make sure Cradle of Aviation is a household word."
Next door, the Long Island Children's Museum finished its first year last February with attendance at 263,000. But the Children's Museum is a much smaller operation at only 40,000 square feet and began with a membership of 650 when it moved from an even smaller space in Garden City. The Children's Museum also had virtually no advertising budget, but managed to increase its membership nearly tenfold to more than 6,000. In many ways, though, a children's museum is a known and familiar entity, while an aviation museum is a new concept and a tougher sell.
The IMAX theater and the Mars space voyage are both big draws and as predicted, account for much of the museum's revenues. There are additional charges for the theater and the ride, and between 60 and 70 percent of the museum's visitors opt for at least one of them. 
The IMAX theater now runs two shows: The Magic of Flight and Space Station, but plans are under way for a summer film festival that will include films on thrill rides, extreme sports, helicopters, sharks and Michael Jordan.
Mr. Smits said a more extensive marketing plan also will be in place soon, including discount ticketing for certain times and arrangements with corporations like American Express to run advertisements in their promotional materials. Without an education director until late last year, the museum did not book any school groups for the fall, but expects to have a full reservation schedule with roughly 900 school children every day of the next school year. "
Richard Maloney, who brought his wife, daughter and grandchildren from Wantagh to the museum last week, said they had heard about the museum from a friend and were very impressed with what they saw. 
"I especially liked the people there because they answered all our questions and they were enthused," he said, referring to the volunteer docents, most of whom are retired from Long Island's aerospace industry.
Mr. Maloney's daughter, Tracy Masterson, said she didn't even realize that about half of the museum's galleries are unfinished, with planes essentially sitting in an open airplane hangar as opposed to carefully designed museum backdrops and panoramas.
"I didn't even notice that," she said. "And you know what, I wouldn't even change it."

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Millwood; 
Lush Landscape, and Chappaqua Schools

BYLINE:  By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
AS young parents in 1972, Kay and Kenneth Schonberg were drawn to Millwood by the outstanding reputation of the local school system and the many recreational opportunities in the area for families. Active on the school board and in community organizations, they led a busy life as their son and daughter grew up. Now, while other empty nesters are moving away, the Schonbergs continue to live in the rustic hamlet, which is part of the town of New Castle in northern Westchester.
 "There's still plenty here for just the two of us," Mrs. Schonberg said recently. The couple -- she is a social worker and he is a pediatrician -- continue to enjoy walks along the tree-lined footpath that runs behind their four-bedroom colonial home. They grow vegetables in a garden in their backyard. And they still swim in the small lake at the end of their street, although these days they are teaching their grandchildren, not their children, to float. 
 By contrast, Rory and Melissa Lubin are typical of young couples now buying homes in Millwood. Lawyers in their early 30's, they moved last summer from a studio apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan to a three-bedroom house on a half-acre lot in the hamlet. They chose Millwood for many of the same reasons that Dr. and Mrs. Schonberg were drawn to it 31 years ago. 
Planning to start a family soon, the Lubins wanted to be part of the Chappaqua Central School District. Other reasons for moving to Millwood were the lushness of the local landscape and the area's broad offering of outdoor recreational activities.
"Compared to New York City, living up here is like being in another world," said Mr. Lubin, who works for Wilson, Elser, Moskowitz, Edelman & Dicker in White Plains. "When we look outside our windows now, we see woods instead of just more buildings. It's a sense of being removed from it all, even though we're really not that far away from work and cultural events."
Mr. Lubin commutes by car to his White Plains office, a trip that takes about 15 minutes; Mrs. Lubin's daily drive to the Bronx, where she is a Family Court lawyer, takes about 45 minutes.
Marion S. Sinek, the supervisor of New Castle, said that attracting a diversity of age groups to the town -- like those represented by the Schonbergs and the Lubins -- was a primary goal of her administration. 
In Millwood, 8 percent of the population is 5 or less; 20 percent is 6 to 17; 14 percent is 18 to 34; 54 percent is 35 toand 64; and 4 percent is 65 or older, according to the 1990 latest available United States census. Chappaqua's population follows a similar pattern. Mrs. Sinek wants to change those skewed distributions reflecting the fact that people tend to move elsewhere after 65. 
"One way to get a better balance," Mrs. Sinek said, "is to keep taxes down so that not just young families, but older couples as well, can live here." Toward that end, New Castle held its tax increase this year to less than 5 percent, which she characterized as good during tough economic times. (Residents pay separate town and school district taxes.)
New Castle governs residents living in the hamlets of Millwood and most of Chappaqua, as well as some with mailing addresses in Armonk, Briarcliff, Briarcliff Manor, Mount Kisco, Ossining and Yorktown, according to the town clerk, Linda Peterson, who also collects the taxes.
Millwood, although in some ways quite similar to Chappaqua, tends to have smaller houses on smaller lots and less name recognition than the much larger Chappaqua. Few houses in Millwood come on the market each year. For example, only 21 homes there were sold last year. "No one ever comes into our office asking specifically for Millwood," said David Firnhaber, the manager of Houlihan/Lawrence's office in Chappaqua. "Like the Lubins, what they want is a house in the Chappaqua Central School District."
CHILDREN living in Millwood -- which makes up ZIP code 10546 -- attend Westorchard Elementary School, which serves 573 students in kindergarten through fifth grade.
In 2002, 97 percent of fourth graders at Westorchard scored at competency level or above on the state English language arts exams, with 64 percent of those reaching Level 4, the highest level. On the fourth-grade mathematics test, 96 percent scored at competency level or above last year, with 63 percent at the highest level, said Westorchard's principal, William Huppuch.
All Millwood students also attend Chappaqua's Horace Greeley High School, where last year, 18 students were National Merit Scholar finalists. Of the 260 seniors who graduated in the spring of 2002, 95 percent now attend four-year colleges and 2 percent attend two-year institutions. Average scores for students from Horace Greeley taking SAT exams last year were 604 on the verbal section and 638 on the math section, said Dennis Cuddy, chairman of the high school's counseling department, far above the statewide average scores of 494 on the verbal test and 506 in math.
Per-pupil spending for the district, which now has three elementary schools, one middle school and the high school, is $16,289, said Henne Starace, the district's business administrator. The ratio of teachers to students varies throughout the district, she said, with kindergarten classes never having more than 20 students.
The district's school population has been growing steadily in the last decade, with enrollment currently at 4,055. The number was 2,866 in 1990 and is expected to peak at 4,298 in 2007, said the superintendent of schools, James F. Donovan. Growing school enrollments prompted the construction of a second middle school, the $32.5 million, 160,000-square-foot Seven Bridges Middle School, which will open next fall for 650 students in the fifth through eighth grades.
Dr. Donovan said he was grateful for "the legacy of support for education" in the school district, with residents "highly supportive of school spending." Last year voters approved a $66.05 million school budget; this year's proposed budget is $74.6 million.
The Chappaqua Central School District Public Library has not been so fortunate with its plans to expand. Three years ago, voters rejected a proposed $8.5 million renovation package that would have increased space in the 25,000-square-foot library by 75 percent. "Instead, we added shelving everywhere we could, except between the front door and the circulation desk," said Mark Hasskarl, the library director.
In the past, houses in Millwood were not as expensive as those in Chappaqua, especially since it was the less-developed of the two hamlets, with fewer homes and shops. It is also four miles from the Chappaqua stop on Metro-North's Harlem Line. Today, however, prices are about the same in both hamlets, said Elvira Bruno, who owns the real estate firm of Howe & Sibley in downtown Chappaqua.
In many ways, Millwood has always been the slower sister of Chappaqua. As far back at the 1800's, Millwood took longer to develop as a residential area, according to Al Hutin, president of the New Castle historical society. For years, it was little more than a stagecoach stop between the Bowery in Lower Manhattan and Somers.
When the New York Central Railroad brought its Putnam Division to Millwood, the hamlet finally blossomed as an agricultural market. Before the 1880's, farmers had to take their produce to Ossining or Chappaqua, the latter having rail service on New York Central's Harlem Division since the 1840's, the Historical Society's records show.
Chappaqua became a commuter town about 1900, with Millwood following a decade later, Mr. Hutin said.
In recent years, the disparity between the two hamlets has begun to lessen. Especially in the last 15 to 20 years, residential development in both hamlets has been intense, with all parts of the Chappaqua Central School District attracting well-heeled families and New Castle becoming known in real estate circles as "Scarsdale North," Mrs. Bruno at Howe & Sibley said.
ABOUT one-fourth of Millwood's land belongs to public utilities like Con Ed, the state Department of Transportation and New York City for reservoirs, said Frank Annunziata, a town engineer. "Because of that," Mr. Hutin, the historian, said, "Millwood has more undeveloped land and doesn't appear to be as crowded as some neighboring areas like Mount Kisco, Chappaqua, Pleasantville, Briarcliff or Ossining."
And while Millwood residents treasure those undeveloped open spaces, many in recent years have sought at least a modicum of commercial development, said Sarah Brewster, a past chairwoman of the Millwood Task Force, an appointed advisory body formed by the town in 1983. "There were no sidewalks, just a limited number of stores, and nothing cohesive for shopping," said Mrs. Brewster, who was also chairman of New Castle's planning board. "So we pushed for more development."
Today, the immediate shopping area on Route 100 near Route 133 that once contained just a few stores near an A.&P. has been expanded, with two more small shopping centers added nearby, along with sidewalks and streetlamps.
One of the longtime favorite restaurants in the hamlet is Rocky's Millwood Delicatessen. Owned by Greg Santone for 23 years, the deli is a 24/7 operation serving Rocky's sandwiches and its trademark burgers to customers, many of whom are scientists and mathematicians seeking a break during long nights working at I.B.M. in nearby Yorktown.
Having achieved the level of commercial development recommended by the task force, most residents now focus on preserving the small-town qualities that remain. "What we want is to maintain the feeling of community that was here when people first started moving to the area," Mrs. Sinek said.
"What we don't like is when new people come in and try to change things too much. That doesn't happen too often, but unfortunately there are always those few who move here because they love the way the area looks, and then, for example, they want to cut down trees so they can have a bigger lawn. That's not in the best interests of either of our hamlets."

 CORRECTION:
An article on April 27 about living in Millwood, N.Y., misstated the year in which a local advisory board, the Millwood Task Force, was formed. The board, whose former chairwoman was quoted as saying it had advocated some increased commercial development, dates from 1974, not 1983.

The Greek Revival building was built on the site by David and Rachael Crasto between 1814 and 1817, records show, with 18-inch-thick granite blocks quarried a nearby rock ledge, now under power lines near the railroad track. In the early-to-mid 1800's land auctions were held at the Granite House, and it also served as a polling place for New Castle. The building and 35 acres were sold in 1817 for $3,200 to William Sarles, deeds show, and the area now known as Millwood was called Sarles' Corners. During the 1850's it was the first stagecoach stop between White Plains and Somers and was also on runs from the Bowery to Somers. The Sarles family sold the property to the Merritt family, which also ran it as an inn until the early 1900's, and the name of the area changed to Merritt's Corners. It changed hands and in the 1920's became a speakeasy. It was demolished in 1992. Map of New York highlighting Millwood.

HEADLINE: Big-City Buildings Seek A Small-Town Feeling 

BYLINE:  By NADINE BROZAN 

 BODY:
THOUGH New Yorkers have long had the reputation -- deserved or not -- of savoring their anonymity and protecting their privacy, many of them are seeking community within the four walls of their own buildings. From the transformation of a barren lot into a trellised gathering spot behind a six-story co-op to a 13,000-square-foot fitness and social center in a 53-story rental, from evening concerts to bedtime stories for groups of children, examples of facilities and programs meant to foster neighborly connections in urban settings abound. 
 Take, for example, the St. Tropez at 340 East 64th Street, the first high rise in the state to be built as a condominium. There are more than half a dozen movie theaters within walking distance, to say nothing of VCR's, DVD's and satellite television, but the board recently bought equipment to show movies in the party room. And when Charlie Chaplin's "Gold Rush" was shown, a pianist was brought in to play accompanying ragtime. 
 "We have 300 apartments in this building and want to keep a sense of cohesiveness," said Robert Metz, who is in charge of movies and edits the house's newsletter. 
The St. Tropez, built in 1965, also gets people together through body sculpting classes (five times a week), yoga, brunches and its rooftop swimming pool, which is ringed by lounge chairs. "When you know your neighbor, you're likely to be more respectful of them," said Suzie Schuyler, a board member who oversees both the fitness and welcoming committees.
Indeed, there is growing acknowledgment on the part of shareholders, owners, tenants, boards and developers that city dwellers increasingly want at least part of their social and athletic needs filled within the confines of their own buildings. To one degree or another, many nests are becoming villages. 
"Our attitude is that we are a family unit rather than isolated units," said Guy I. Smiley, a lawyer and president of the board of the Sovereign, a 352-apartment co-op at 425 East 58th Street. "We use the word 'co-op' as a signature of our philosophy. After 9/11, I think everyone was looking for a connection and home, and where you live is a great place to have that."
His definition of family is inclusive. "We have a lot of dogs in the building, and animals are members of our family, too," he said. 
According to Costas Kondylis, who has designed more than 45 residential buildings in Manhattan since 1958, "People like to feel that when they come home they are part of a club. This gives you an identity, a meeting place, a sense of community. For the rent you are paying these days, you expect more than the four walls of the apartment."
Setha Low, a professor of environmental psychology and anthropology at the City University of New York Graduate Center and the author of a new book on gated communities, read a darker reason into the trend. "Being worried about security is changing the nature of urban life," she said. "We are fearful, anxious, insecure and nostalgic for the past, and so we are becoming more insular." 
WHATEVER the underlying motives, allotting generous space for health clubs and leisure-use rooms is now considered mandatory for residential design. 
"These amenities are essential for any major building," said James Davidson, a partner at Schuman Lichtenstein Claman Efron Architects. "At a minimum, you must have a party room and media center where residents and friends can get together for, say, the Super Bowl, and a health center or workout room." Beyond that, his firm is designing basketball courts, putting greens and children's playrooms for inclusion in buildings. 
But offering up-to-the-minute athletic equipment and a busy schedule of social and cultural events represents not only concern for the residents' well-being; it is also smart marketing.
"It's nice to walk into a lobby and be thanked for what you do rather than be accosted for what you don't," said David Pickett, president of the Gotham Organization. His firm has developed four large rental buildings: the New Gotham at 43rd Street between 10th and 11th Avenues, the Key West at 96th Street and Columbus Avenue, the Foundry at 55th Street and 10th Avenue and the Atlas, which opened at Sixth Avenue and 38th Street in July.
"This helps us rent and retain tenants," he said. "If on every apartment I can get an extra $50 or $100, I can engender good will and long-term patronage. And when leases come up and you're negotiating with tenants, the hope is that they like living there and there is something other than economic factors tugging at them."
The Jack Parker Corporation, developer and manager of the Biltmore, a new 53-story rental at 271 West 47th Street, has devoted the entire fifth floor, more than 13,000 square feet, to what Kimberly Cafaro, a vice president and general manager, calls "the fitness element and the social element." 
"We felt we had to go above and beyond what other owners are doing to draw people to the building," Ms. Cafaro said. In addition to the standard assortment of exercise machines, it also has billiard tables, dartboards, a business center, a lounge with a fireplace, a screening room that converts to an aerobics and yoga center and a kitchen that will provide "breakfast on the go" of rolls, muffins or pastry to be handed to health club members (the health club is $400 a year).
In older buildings, whose original blueprints did not take the demand for communal facilities into account, existing facilities have been upgraded or altered. 
A gym was opened in December at the Riviera Towers, a 34-story co-op in West New York, N.J., that overlooks Manhattan 
"It was an offshoot of a lot of requests from residents," said Anthony Errante, secretary of the co-op's board. "We have an outdoor pool where people meet in the summer, but there is not a lot in the winter. 
"We also felt strongly about creating a larger space where we could hold events. We have a small community room where we have open board meetings, but it is not large enough for events." 
When the building was put up in the 1960's, space was set aside below grade for retail stores, but none were built. "So we had a lot of underutilized space," Mr. Errante said. "The decision was made to turn part of that into a community level and now there is a activities committee to organize events like concerts there. We also had a flea market when it opened."
In some places, the laundry room has acquired a new identity.
"We decided to make it a comfortable place to relax," A. J. Mediratta, president of the board at the 100-unit co-op at 35 West 90th Street, said of the room there. "We put patio furniture in it and a number of bookshelves so people can drop off and borrow books. Last year someone put in tables and earlier this year hung pictures.
"We tend to spend so much on things that people never see, like rebuilding parapets and lintels, that it is nice to spend a small amount on things that are visible. I think these little things foster a better atmosphere. You get more out of living here if you have friends, if you have someone to keep an eye on the goldfish when you go traveling." 
Similarly, in 1999 an exercise room was carved out of bicycle and laundry rooms at the two connected buildings that constitute the co-op at 110 and 118 Riverside Drive. 
"We did the whole thing over very simply," said Laurie Winfrey Shnayerson, treasurer of the board, who has a picture editing and research company. "We kept the existing columns, put up mirrors and new lighting and put in a floor of reprocessed tires." 
There was a one-time fee of $3,000 to join with a charge of $25 per month, and the loan to alter the space was repaid in three years. 
"People talk to each other when they're sweating on the treadmills and watching CNN," Ms. Shnayerson said. "You see people there you would never know otherwise and there is the recognition factor when you see someone dressed on the street."
Nearby at 316 West 84th Street, a 141-unit, six-story co-op, an expansion into an unused rear lot has fostered a friendlier ambience among the shareholders. 
"When we co-oped, probably 20 years ago, we had a backyard that was all cracked and no one ever used," said Mort Berkowitz, a board member whose company, Mort & Ray Productions, runs street fairs. "About eight years ago, we repaved and now have a garden, trellises, vines, lounge chairs and tables. There is nothing nicer in the summer than sitting out there with coffee or wine and cheese."
More than a dozen events have been held in the 20-by-100-foot garden in the last year, ranging from bar mitzvah receptions to anniversary celebrations. "It makes everything more civil," Mr. Berkowitz said. "In the past, the only people you knew were the ones on your floor. Now there are communities of interest, and lots of people have become friendly across floors."
A full menu of activities has long been an integral part of life at Stuyvesant Town and Peter Cooper Village, the 110-building community that runs from East 14th to East 23rd Street, "but we are continuing to enhance our programs," said Steve Stadmeyer, the managing director of the complex. 
With a full-time recreation staff of 15, he said, "we are adding four boccie courts; adult volleyball; more computers in the senior lounge; two new playgrounds, one for very small children and one for peewee soccer; and a Starbuck's to provide free coffee on Saturday morning. Two years ago we began having summer concerts on Tuesday evening specifically to bring people together." 
At North Shore Towers and Country Club, a three-building, 1,800-unit co-op on the Queens-Nassau County border in Floral Park, "what you get is a lifestyle, not just an apartment," said Linda Rappaport, the on-site sales specialist for the Charles H. Greenthal brokerage firm. "It has a 460-seat movie theater, a restaurant, catering hall, outdoor hot-dog stand, and clubhouse where breakfast and lunch are available."
Sitting on a 110-acre site and bordered by an 18-hole golf course, North Shore Towers has extensive athletic offerings, some of them commanding separate fees that go from $800 for use of the swimming pools and health club to $3,200 for all activities, including golf. Social events on the calendar last month included bingo, ballroom dancing and lectures on subjects as diverse as Picasso and "Dealing with Aches and Pains." 
More than 300 residents and their relatives attended seders in the restaurant there on the first two nights of Passover earlier this month.
"In most cases, the residents are the ones who develop and implement all these things," said Phyllis Goldstein, a board member who is in charge of the enhancement committee. "That means I do pretty things. 
"This is small-town living," she added, "and when you interact in the club, the movie theater, the coffee shop, over the years, you get to know everybody." 
By contrast, the stately co-op buildings on Park and Fifth Avenues tend to have a bicycle room or perhaps an exercise room but not much more to promote camaraderie between strangers. 
"They wouldn't get into the building if they didn't already know their neighbors or were at least friends of friends," said Kirk Henckels, the director of Stribling Private Brokerage. "These people want service, room service." (The buildings at 960 Fifth Avenue and 1 East 66th Street have chefs on the premises to meet that need.) 
The co-op at 825 Fifth Avenue does have a dining room that is used by many tenants, but Caroline Guthrie, executive vice president of Edward Lee Cave, a high-end Manhattan brokerage, explained: "Generally the apartments are pieds-a-terre, so most of the kitchens are kitchenettes. The dining room is only open Monday through Friday because people are at their country homes on weekends." 
Hollis Court, a complex of 18 two-family garden co-ops in Bayside, Queens, was once a bastion of group activity, but according to Patricia Brown, a retired registered nurse who recently stepped down as president, interest has dropped off dramatically. 
"We had a bowling night, but it wasn't successful," she said. "We used to have a gardening committee, a social room for cards and mah-jongg, a lending library, an annual barbecue. This year people don't seem to be interested in barbecues and they want their gardening done." 
An owner of 19 years, Ms. Brown attributed the change to the fact that "people who lived here for many years made a killing in the real estate market and moved out and the younger people who are moving in are professionals and singles who are totally caught up in their careers; it's hard to get people together because they lead such busy lives." 
The Gotham Organization has tried to address that issue with some of the programs that it gears to the young singles who predominate in several of its buildings.
BASICALLY each of our buildings has its own personality, but several of them tend to have young professional people who go to hip restaurants and frequent nightclubs," said Lindsay Levine, social director for the organization. "So some of these events are great things do do from say 8:30 to 10:30 before they go out.
"People really do connect, though not necessarily romantically. They tend to talk about the building, and one of our worries was that it would become a forum to voice complaints, but that hasn't happened." 
Although Gotham's events are geared to the building in which they are held, they are open to the residents of all 1,300 apartments in the four buildings and range from tapas parties with mariachi bands to sushi tastings, concerts, art exhibits and bedtime stories for young children. 
At the Key West on 96th Street and Columbus Avenue, "we gear a lot of events to kids," Ms. Levine said. "I met a graduate of Juilliard who specializes in children's entertainment and comes for what we call 'bedtime stories.' " On her occasional visits, "She brings bags of tricks, balloons, puppets and storybooks and we put out milk and cookies at bedtime."
A growing number of buildings are keeping their residents informed and connected through regular newsletters.
"Manhattan can be a cold place, and the idea is to build esprit de corps," said Bernard Bushell, an investment banker who is the editor of the newsletter that was introduced in January at the Sovereign, the co-op at 425 East 58th Street. 
The Sovereign Sentinel, which will come out quarterly, is a blend of real estate savvy -- a chart in the first issue tracked the history of sales since 1998 -- and small-town neighborliness like the "Share a Recipe" column. 
The first two issues also had profiles of the doormen and the garage manager, a review of a neighborhood restaurant, and a guide to eating fine chocolate from a resident in the business -- "Taste on an empty stomach. Clear palate with filtered water ... chew seven to 10 times ... allowing secondary flavors such as herbal, fruity or spicy to emerge."
Requests in print included ones for volunteers for a caregivers' club to help the elderly in the building and a children's club, along with referrals for personal trainers and computer consultants, and the name of a social secretary who will introduce new residents around. 
One of the folksier inclusions is news and photographs of pets in the building. (Two black lab puppies have taken up residence in apartment 47B, the spring issue announced.) 
But, as always, there is a distinctly Manhattan twist. "One resident had a public relations consultant call me to get their dog in the paper," Mr. Bushell said.

HEADLINE: Harmony in Hartford: Play On 

BYLINE:  By BRIAN WISE 

 BODY:
LIKE many American orchestras, the Hartford Symphony Orchestra is expected to post a deficit at the end of this season, because this year its endowment has lost much of its value and financing from state arts organizations has dropped off.
 Still, orchestra officials say the overall health of the ensemble is good, with strong ticket sales for core classical and pops concerts; a cordial relationship between management and musicians; and a promising series of programming changes under a new music director, Edward Cumming. 
 "I often say it's both the best and the worst of times," said Charles Owens, the group's executive director. "We're excited by the start of a new era with the arrival of Edward Cumming, but at the same time, we're facing some real hurdles with the drop in our endowment." 
The financial books on the orchestra's 59th season will not be officially closed until late spring. But Mr. Owens said the weakened economy and plummeting portfolios had eroded the endowment to $7.7 million from a high of $10 million in 2000.
Additionally, financing from the Greater Hartford Arts Council and the Connecticut Commission on the Arts has declined slightly. Both of those sources of income are used to supplement ticket sales andcontributions.
The cash crunch forced the orchestra to make several midseason adjustments to bring its expenses under control. The pops concerts, which ran on Friday and Saturday nights, were consolidated into a single Saturday night series.
The orchestra also delayed the hiring for several staff positions, and moved its eight-part education series from the high-rent Bushnell Center for the Performing Arts in Hartford, the orchestra's main home, to more modest surroundings at Central Connecticut State University in New Britain.
The orchestra has also continued to take on some crossover projects that have met with criticism from critics and classical music purists. In 2001, the group accompanied Andrea Bocelli, the blind tenor and pop phenomenon, on a national tour that included stops in arenas and the Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas.
Last February, the orchestra presented the First Symphony of Albert Hurwit, a retired Hartford radiologist without any formal musical training. The work was lambasted in the local news media as amateurish and cliched. 
Mr. Owens said Mr. Hurwit's symphony was chosen, in part, because it made for a likable human-interest story because he composed with the assistance of an elaborate keyboard and computer system.
"Mr. Hurwit is a respected member of the Hartford community," Mr. Owens said. Mr. Hurwit and his wife, Joan, are prominent arts patrons in Hartford.
No programming changes for next year have been announced thus far, and unlike many orchestras suffering from the weak economy, the symphony has not asked its musicians to take a pay cut. Their contract was renewed for three years last July. The players' salaries are 36 percent of the symphony's $5.1million budget. 
Budget figures suggest that the public has responded enthusiastically to the arrival of Mr. Cumming, 44, who was selected in 2001 from more than 280 applicants. He previously held posts at the Pittsburgh Symphony and Florida Orchestra, and studied at Yale University. 
Indeed, the number of subscribers to the symphony has increased 16 percent from last season, and subscription revenue is up by 12 percent. There has been a slight increase in single-ticket sales, and an average concert in the Masterworks series, the group's core classical program, can claim a 65 percent capacity, no small feat at the 2,800-seat Mortensen Hall at the Bushnell.
Connecticut arts administrators say the orchestra's financial problems appear to be largely manageable. Ken Kahn, executive director of the arts council, said the orchestra was reaching out to previously untapped segments of the city with a more diverse programming mix.
"The symphony is taking great pains to create formats that are probably not unique in the world, but whether it's an early evening concert or concerts in parks, they build the presence of the symphony itself throughout the community," he said. 
Specifically, Mr. Kahn pointed to the newly created Rush Hour Classics series in the Belding Theater, which has been playing to more than 90 percent capacity. With its 6:30 p.m. start times, cocktail receptions, and 75-minute, conversation-and-performance format led by Mr. Cumming, the concerts target a young professional demographic. 
Mr. Kahn described the orchestra's Latino Music Festival last October, and the annual summer concert series at Talcott Mountain Music Festival in Simsbury as "wildly successful," adding that "they play to all spectrums of society here which is very good." 
But series like these attract more casual concertgoers than core classical subscribers, and that kind ofaudience is more susceptible to the vagaries of the economy. To remain fiscally strong, the orchestra must lure more people to its main programs in Hartford.
Mr. Owens said the two top-selling concerts this season were performances of Beethoven's seldom-performed Mass in C Major and the North American premiere of Stephen Montague's Piano Concerto, an extravagant work that calls for the pianist to use his fist, arm and elbow on the keyboard. 
For its final subscription concerts of the season, May6 and 7 at the Bushnell, Mr. Cumming will conduct Mahler's Symphony No.5 along with works by Anton Webern and Aaron Jay Kernis.
"It would be very easy to program a Mozart piano concerto in the first half of a program containing Mahler's Fifth," Mr. Cumming said. "But you can do more with that space on the program. 
Although the orchestra plainly does not shy away from adventuresome programs, crowd-pleasing fare is a staple; its second-largest annual series is the pops concerts at the Bushnell.
Mr. Owens acknowledged that the orchestra's main focus is the standard repertory.
"We don't expect to make any drastic changes in our programming next season," he said.

HEADLINE: To Get a Job, Become a Boss: The Lure of Owning a Franchise 

BYLINE:  By SHARON McDONNELL 

 BODY:
Despite 30 years in the retail clothing industry in Manhattan, including 13 at Bloomingdale's, where he rose to vice president for merchandising in the men's department, and 7 at the Custom Shop, Tony Cocheo found his career unraveling.
 In April 2001, his job as sales director at Tradeout.com, an online merchandiser, ended when the company went out of business. He then had the misfortune to be hired shortly before Sept. 11, 2001, as an assistant manager at the Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, store of the Century 21 department store chain. The terrorist attacks shut Century 21's flagship store across the street from the World Trade Center, and Mr. Cocheo was laid off a few weeks later. 
 So Mr. Cocheo, 58, took a different tack: he bought himself a job. In November 2001, he used "several hundred thousand dollars" in savings to become owner of a 7-Eleven convenience-store franchise in Southold on Long Island. "The world has changed; it was time for me to make a change," he said.
Mr. Cocheo is an example of what could be called the accidental entrepreneurs, people who buy a small business or a franchise rather than put themselves at the mercy of an unforgiving job market. The market is especially unforgiving in New York City, which has lost about 223,000 jobs in the last two years and had an unemployment rate of 8.8 percent in February, compared with 4.3 percent in the rest of the state and 5.8 percent nationally.
While born entrepreneurs relish risk, these more-reluctant entrepreneurs choose business ownership because it often seems less daunting than working for somebody else. Many turn to franchises, which can cushion the risk-taking by offering a brand name, established business methods, training, manuals, advertising help, a support network, financial help and bookkeeping.
The International Franchise Association, a Washington-based trade group, estimates that there are 1,500 franchisers in the country with a total of about 320,000 outlets. They range from hotel chains, which require multimillion-dollar investments, and giant fast-food chains like McDonald's and Krispy Kreme, which can cost $500,000 and up, to providers of drug-sniffing dogs, bail bonds, dating services and check cashing. While about 80 percent of franchises require an initial total investment below $250,000, nearly half cost less than $100,000, and some much less.
Experts caution that buying and running a franchise can be tricky. Investors should be aware of the many expenses involved, which usually include a flat franchise fee, payment to the franchiser of a percentage of revenue, as well as costs related to real estate, construction, inventory and advertising. All of which is compounded by the fact that many people opening new franchise outlets are also new to owning a business. One study even suggested the failure rate for franchise outlets is higher than for independent businesses in the same industry.
Susan P. Kezios, president of the American Franchisee Association, which has 7,000 members who own over 30,000 franchise outlets, has few kind words for franchisers, saying many prey on people who have lost their jobs in hard times and often concoct agreements that are loaded against unsuspecting franchisees.
For example, she says, some provisions allow the franchise company to add competing outlets nearby at will, while also including noncompete agreements limiting the franchisee's right to engage in a similar business after the contract ends. Typically, the franchisee must agree to use preferred suppliers and accept conditions for contract renewals that differ radically in terms of money and operations from the original and require arbitration in disputes in the franchise company's home state.
Ms. Kezios scoffs at the notion that buying a franchise is like buying a job. "It's more like renting an apartment, because it's a limited period of time and after the 10-, 15- or 20-year contract ends, the franchise corporation will rewrite it in their favor," she said.
The I.F.A., which represents both franchisers and franchisees, says those accusations are overblown. "Human nature is entitled to make mistakes -- sometimes bad decisions are made by the franchiser or franchisee," said Don DeBolt, president of the I.F.A., which has an ombudsman to resolve disputes.
The organization advises those considering opening a franchise outlet to evaluate the marketplace for high-growth areas, compare several franchise systems in the same industry, read federally mandated disclosure documents carefully and have both a lawyer and accountant trained in franchising review the contract and company. It also recommends contacting former and current franchisees. "If you hear tales of woe, I'd look elsewhere," he said.
Whatever the risks, a lot of job seekers seem to find them worth taking. Net growth in franchising this year is projected to be 4 percent to 5 percent, strong in this economy, but down from about 12 percent in 2000, according to Franchise Recruiters, an executive search firm in Chicago.
Subway International, which has franchised 15,000 fast-food shops in the United States, more than any other company, says it sold 4,300 last year alone, up from 2,500 in 2001. One-third of its 159 shops in New York City opened in the last two years, the company says.
One of Subway's recruits is John Biscaino, who served for 10 years in the Navy and then took a part-time job as a test pilot for the Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation in Stratford, Conn. He had planned to become an airline pilot, but put that ambition aside because of the industry's slump. Last year, he bought a Subway franchise in Park Slope, Brooklyn.
"This was Plan B, which became Plan A," said Mr. Biscaino, 33, who owns the franchise with his half brother, Robert Vidal, 24, a salesman on leave from I.B.M.
The two men put in $35,000 each and obtained a bank loan for the rest of the $150,000 investment. They say business is booming.
Despite the positive reaction from Mr. Biscaino and Mr. Vidal, Subway has fought a relatively large number of legal battles over the years with franchisees and landlords.
Refugees from another troubled industry, information technology, also have been gravitating toward franchising. Susana Ramos, 56, a computer services engineer in New York for the last 18 years, took a buyout from the Hewlett-Packard Company in June and bought a Computer Troubleshooters USA franchise in October for $10,400. She operates the business, which provides technical service to small and home-based businesses in a section of the Upper East Side, from her Queens apartment.
"Since my company was downsizing 15,000 people, I decided, 'Why not?' " Ms. Ramos said.
Apparently, in this economy, a lot of unemployed computer whizzes are in the same boat she was. James Greenfield, regional director for the New York metropolitan area for Computer Troubleshooters, which is based in Decatur, Ga., said his company's franchises in New York City and New Jersey had increased to 15 from 2 in the last two years.
"Almost all our franchisees are laid off from I.T., or anticipating it," Mr. Greenfield said. "They all see the handwriting on the wall."

HEADLINE: ROAD AND RAIL; 
A Train to the Games

BYLINE:  By GEORGE JAMES 

DATELINE: HACKENSACK 

 BODY:
MAYBE someday travelers will take a train to the Meadowlands complex instead of having to crawl along Route 3. But don't get in line to buy a ticket just yet, because there is a problem: money is scarcer than profits at the Continental Airlines Arena. 
 One estimate puts the cost of a rail link at nearly $200 million, at a time when the state is struggling with a $5 billion budget shortfall, New Jersey Transit is using capital funds for operating expenses and the state transportation trust fund is running low. 
 In addition, the state has had to assume the full cost of another once-promising transportation project: the $1 billion light-rail line from Trenton to Camden -- begun in the Whitman administration -- which has come in $400 million over budget and has been roundly criticized as a boondoggle. 
Nonetheless, officials from government, business, the transit agency and the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority insist that after decades of talk about a rail link to the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, momentum appears to be building for construction of one -- despite the state's desperate financial condition.
Two major projects are seen as giving impetus: Xanadu, the $1.3 billion family entertainment center at the Continental Arena site that is expected to begin construction in the summer, and the phased-in fall opening of the $450 million Secaucus transfer station, about five miles away, that will link 11 of the state's 12 rail lines and provide quick access to Manhattan for riders from northern and southern New Jersey.
"I'm encouraged by the dialogue taking place among all the politicians and business leaders, and I think there is consensus building in terms of what to look at in terms of a plan," said George Zoffinger, president of the sports authority. 
George D. Warrington, executive director of New Jersy Transit, told state legislators and business leaders at an Assembly committee hearing two weeks ago that his agency was looking into building a railroad spur, two to three miles long, that would link the Pascack Valley and Bergen County commuter lines to the sports complex. 
He also said the new link could be extended to serve a separate project consisting of four golf courses, hotels, office buildings and housing units being built on landfill farther south of the sports complex. He expects to have a detailed plan within six months.
Asked about the reason for his optimism given the state's dire economic outlook, he cited several factors.
"The Secaucus transfer hub is a reality, a natural anchor in the Meadowlands which collects in one point in very close proximity to the sports complex markets from all over New Jersey as well as Manhattan," Mr. Warrington said. "No.2, you have a development project that is much more extensive and attractive in terms of demand than just a sporting facility."
The details of how a rail passenger would get to the sports complex have to be worked out, said Jack Kanarek, senior director of project development at New Jersey Transit, but he said those traveling from Hoboken or Secaucus would probably be able to take the Bergen County line to the sports complex without having to transfer. Those coming from the north, he said, might also be able to ride directly to the site, or transfer for the ride on the spur, or ride several miles south to the Secaucus transfer and then take the Bergen County line north to the complex.
"Those are all the options on the table," Mr. Kanarek said. "It's too early to say what will work and what won't." 
Extending the light-rail system being built in Hudson and Bergen Counties into the area -- once considered a possibility -- now seems less practical. One estimate put the cost at $500 million. 
Some critics contend that a mass transit plan should have been a condition all along, most notably during negotiations with prospective developers of the Continental Arena site. The winning team of the Mills Corporation of Arlington, Va., and the Mack-Cali Realty Corporation of Cranford was chosen in February. 
Before being selected as the developers, they offered $65 million for infrastructure improvements, though most of that is marked for road projects around the complex, including improvements to Route 120. 
Assemblywoman Rose Marie Heck, a Republican from Hasbrouck Heights, complained recently: "The mass transportation piece should have been done prior to anyone being chosen as a developer. And no development should begin unless or until we have the mass transportation piece beginning simultaneously." 
Despite Ms. Heck's qualms, Mr. Zoffinger said construction on Xanadu -- which is expected to open in three years and be completed by 2009 -- will not be delayed by a lack of funds for mass transit. Mills officials did not respond to questions.
The way Ms. Heck and many others see it, Mills-Mack-Cali -- who will reap considerable financial rewards from Xanadu -- should pay for the rail link, but the team has already promised an upfront payment of $160 million that would eliminate the arena's longterm debt and is not seen as likely to give more. 
Martin Robins, director of the Voorhees Transportation Policy Institute of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers, said that although the plan for the rail spur seemed like a good one, the financial picture was "very cloudy." 
But Representative Steve Rothman, a Hackensack Democrat who is a member of the House Appropriations Committee and a new member of its transportation subcommittee, said the rail link would qualify for federal funds, which would in turn encourage financing from other sources.
"This is an extraordinary piece of property," he said. "In order to maximize the value and potential benefits of this redeveloped Meadowlands property, rail is going to have to be incorporated into the project."
Earlier this year, Governor McGreevey said the state was $5 billion in the hole for its transportation improvement projects. He created a panel headed by Transportation Commissioner Jack Lettiere to set priorities and find sources of funds.
"What has to come out of this process is something of a rationale for how these projects are going to be put in rank and a financing scheme to accomplish them," Mr. Robins said. "And it may be we can't do all of the things we want to do."
Nonetheless, Dennis F. Marco, chairman of the Meadowlands Regional Chamber of Commerce and a member of the advisory committee that studied redevelopment plans for the arena site, said he was confident that a united front of government officials and business leaders would get the rail link built.
"You know how the planets line up every 700 years?" he said. "Well, this is our 700-year shot."

HEADLINE: FIVE QUESTIONS for ROBERT A. KAPP; 
Tracking the Impact of SARS on Business With China

BYLINE:  By RICK GLADSTONE 

 BODY:
 THOUSANDS of American business people have canceled travel to Asia, particularly to China, because of the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. But broader economic shock waves from the disease have barely begun to resonate in the United States, which is China's second-largest trading partner, behind Japan, and one of China's biggest sources of foreign investment. 
 Robert A. Kapp, president of the U.S.-China Business Council in Washington, the principal organization of American corporations that do business in China, spoke on Wednesday about short-term and potential long-term effects of SARS.
 RICK GLADSTONE

Q. Have any large business deals between American companies and China been delayed or derailed because of SARS?

A. We are not aware of any large transactions which have fallen through over this. But the fact that nobody's traveling, sooner or later, has got to have an impact. The longer this goes on, the more likely the final consummations are going to be delayed. We don't expect a flood of deals while this situation remains.

Q. Which industries that do business in China have been hurt most? Which have been relatively insulated?

A. Obviously, airlines are at the top of the list. We're not seeing the autos, the chemicals and so forth being crippled by this. Most American industrial production has not been affected. At the level of administrative staff and expatriates, we will have to watch in the weeks to come to see whether the impulse to get some of them out increases.
As levels of social anxiety rise, so does the possibility, at least, that the normal work styles of expatriate managers and expatriate planners and high-end office people could be affected. That could make some difference. We haven't seen it yet.

Q. Aside from disruptions to exhibitions, conferences, travel and so on, are you seeing more subtle damage in business and economic relations between the United States and China?

A. The obvious, right-in-your-face problems are the problems of holding a trade show. The Canton trade fair was hurt; the auto show in Shanghai was called off a week early. I was involved in a Chinese-sponsored conference in Beijing and, regrettably, the final decision to postpone came only yesterday. Beyond that, when we get into subtle damage, as distinct and isolated as the travel and hospitality industries are, the impact spreads outward from those sectors. Rooms don't get used, detergents don't get bought, uniforms don't get cleaned: there's an inevitable spinoff. It has a depressing effect on economic activity. We'll see more of that. You can't keep flying empty aircraft. The people who work on those planes won't have jobs anymore.
If the trajectory of this disease goes on in the same manner for a prolonged period and the industrial production workplace is affected, that will be a new and difficult challenge for China, and for some customers who rely on Chinese industrial production for things they need to sell elsewhere. That we don't see yet, though it's not impossible. The biggest thing here is that none of us know the duration or virulence of SARS, and a lot hangs on that.

Q. Assuming that the spread of SARS can be halted soon, how long will it take for the economic and business effects to dissipate?

A. My feeling is that at least for China, the economic effects would recede rather quickly. Obviously, if an airline goes out of business or a hotel goes into bankruptcy, the effects aren't cured immediately. But the broad fundamentals for why China has become an important place for business -- those fundamentals haven't changed at this time, and I don't think they're likely to. By the time these kinds of fundamentals changed because of SARS, SARS would likely have spread globally and many other equations would be up in the air.

Q. Where would you put SARS in a ranking of the most significant problems confronting American-Chinese business relations in recent years?

A. I think it has the potential to be quite high if this goes on for an extended period. Crises in China-U.S. business haven't swept across all businesses before. The biggest crisis was in 1989, during the Tiananmen crackdown, when vast numbers of companies said, "Let's get out of here." But today that seems like something from another era. It almost doesn't apply in this ranking. Even the bombing of China's Belgrade embassy in 1999, or the EP3 spy-plane crisis on Hainan Island in 2001, didn't cause a crisis in business. A long run of this disease, with a lot of social disruption, could cause a more serious business emergency.

HEADLINE: ON THE JOB; 
Goodbye Power Lunch. Hello Brown Bag.

BYLINE:  By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
"When the going gets tough, the tough get going." That bit of pep talk has been attributed to both Joseph P. Kennedy and Knute Rockne. Regardless of which of these successful men said it first, there is little doubt that hard times lead to hard decisions, and right now more than a few people have been figuring out ways to trim their personal budgets.
 "The world I live in is all about being hip and keeping up with the trends," writes Cornelia Frame of Los Angeles, who works in Hollywood as an account executive in an entertainment marketing department. 
 "Since my job is freelance, and they aren't ready to hire me because of recent financial cutbacks, I have to be really cost-conscious," she writes. 
"But looking great is really important here," says Ms. Frame, who is originally from the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
So how has she addressed the problem?
"I have been coloring my own hair, bringing lunch and borrowing clothes from friends when I get the urge to go shopping," she says. "I learned to give myself a manicure every week, cut out the maid at home" and converted American Express Membership Rewards points into credit at Saks Fifth Avenue so she could go on a shopping spree. "I may even change cellphone plans to get a deal," she added, "and cut out HBO at home.
"It's better to read anyway, right?"
Rising prices at the fuel pump have led Larry Sternbane of Tempe, Ariz., to ponder not only cost-cutting travel but also the impact of gasoline prices on urban development, mass transportation and the location of housing and workplace.
"When the price of gas goes up, some of us don't feel it," Mr. Sternbane writes. "It is possible, even in cities without great mass transit systems, to choose one's home and workplace so that transportation by car is but an option."
Mr. Sternbane goes on to say: "My roommate, Adam Huang, is a graduate student in computer science at Arizona State University; I am a part-time student in Chinese there and a supervisor in the flight kitchen at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. We choose to live in between the two.
"Adam bikes to school most days, or takes the free neighborhood circulator bus directly to campus when the weather is inclement. I take the bus to work most days; once a week I drive in, so that I can go food shopping on the way home. On days when I have school, I bike to school. Then the bike and I hop a bus to get to work. A tank of gas lasts me two months.
"Let the price rise to $5 a gallon. Those who choose to live far from work, school or shopping will feel this burden most. Put the revenue toward increasing mass transit options. There should be a severe economic disincentive to urban sprawl. This approach should do it." 
P. Andrew Payton of Augusta, Ga., used to be a machinist in a factory in South Bend, Ind., that manufactured parts for John Deere.
He writes: "Now that I have to work part time in retail as a supermarket grocery clerk, I save money by walking to work (three blocks away), brown-bag my lunch, don't buy anything from the deli and hand-wash any parts of my uniform that I can. I hang it to dry instead of using the Laundromat every day.
"It comes out just as fresh and clean anyway."
For Jim Anderson, cost-cutting begins at home in Los Angeles, which also happens to be where he works as a manufacturer's representative in factory automation equipment and lives with his wife, Lynn. He compiled a list of cost-cutting measures after poring over expenses for clothing, entertainment, meals and household and business expenses. The list includes steps like these:
* Raising deductibles on auto and health insurance.
* Brown-bagging lunches when possible.
* Washing their own cars (twice monthly).
* Washing and ironing shirts (to avoid dry-cleaning expenses).
* Doing more of their own gardening (reducing the gardener's bill) and cutting down on watering.
* Using public transportation to downtown areas to save on parking costs.
* Washing and brushing the dog instead of sending her to be groomed.
* Reducing maximum driving speed to less than 60 miles an hour, to save gasoline.
* Dining out only once a week (and sharing portions).
* Doing more work by phone when possible, instead of visiting clients personally.
* Going to discounted matinee movies; buying rush tickets to plays for just $10.
Mr. Anderson adds, "Since I run my business from home and shipping costs are part of it, I have begun asking my customers to pick up shipping costs when possible."

HEADLINE: WEDDINGS/CELEBRATIONS; 
Megan Holl, Jose Rosado Jr.

 BODY:
Megan Rose Holl, the daughter of M. Diane Holl and George R. Holl of East Greenwich, R.I., was married yesterday to Jose Antonio Rosado Jr., the son of Maria I. Rivera of Cumming, Ga., and Mr. Rosado of Camuy, P.R. The Rev. Loring S. Ensign, a minister of the United Church of Christ, officiated at the Inn at Harbour Town in Hilton Head Island, S.C. 
 The bride, 26, is the product manager, in New York, for the jewelry line of Joan Rivers Worldwide Enterprises. She graduated from the University of South Carolina. Her father is the chief executive of Crystaline North America in Cranston, R.I., a sterling silver division of the Pranda Jewelry Public Company, a Bangkok jewelry concern. 
 The bridegroom, 33, works in New York as an associate in the media and telecommunications restructuring group of TD Securities, a unit of the Toronto Dominion Bank. He graduated from Mississippi State University and received a master's degree in economics from Murray State University in Murray, Ky. He also has an M.B.A. from Emory University. 
His mother retired as the regional director for registration and licensing, in Arecibo, P.R., for the Puerto Rico Department of Transportation and Public Works. His father, also retired, was the assistant branch manager in Isabela, P.R., for Banco Popular.
To the couple's family and friends, it is not surprising that football played a pivotal role in their introduction. 
"It's serious," said Mr. Rosado of their enthusiasm for the game.
They met in August 2001 through an organization informally known as the S.E.C. Club. It is for New York residents who graduated from schools in the Southeastern Conference and is mostly a way for alumni to mingle, network and root for their beloved teams.
"I met 70 percent of my friends in New York through it," Ms. Holl explained.
At the time of their first meeting -- a barbecue at the house of a club member from the University of Alabama -- Ms. Holl was representing the University of South Carolina and Mr. Rosado was representing Mississippi State. 
They began dating a few months later, after they saw each other again at a bar where both had gone with friends to watch the Tennessee-Alabama game.
Pigskin had more to do with the couple's decision to marry in the spring than did sunny days and the ready availability of Carolina jessamine. 
"We cannot get married in the fall," Mr. Rosado said. "We would have to deal with way too many football games going on."

HEADLINE: PULSE: WHAT I'M WEARING NOW; 
The Boxer

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER TUNG 

 BODY:
Don't tell the guys he trains with in the South Bronx, but John Rosado, a professional boxer, has a weakness for Prada. 
 "I like clothes that are clean and classic, but hip," said Mr. 
Rosado, a former Golden Gloves champion (he won the title in 1993). 
 Mr. Rosado developed his shopping eye in the mid-90's when he was working as a personal trainer for clients like John Bartlett and Cynthia Rowley, who also introduced him to the thrill of the sample sale. 
These days Mr. Rosado, 33, is a middleweight fighter and an owner of Cheetah, a Flatiron nightclub. Most of the time, he wears urban-couture sweatsuits by Sean John and Roc-A-Wear. But for meetings he turns to timeless combinations; the one here starts with a black three-button Dolce & Gabbana suit and a white Gucci shirt, and finishes with a crimson Gianfranco Ferre tie depicting two boxers, and Prada shoes. 
This summer, he will switch to a tan poplin Brooks Brothers suit. "I wear uniforms," said Mr. Rosado, who is as economical with his words as with his jabs.
"Otherwise getting dressed takes too much time and thought," he added, warming to the subject. "It's important that a man looks good, but it's got to be simple." JENNIFER TUNG

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH/Ronald E. Canakaris; 
ABN Amro Montag & Caldwell Growth Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
DONALD E. CANAKARIS, manager of the $2.6 billion ABN Amro Montag & Caldwell Growth fund, projects annual earnings growth for big American companies averaging about 5 percent over the next five years.
 "Over all, corporate profit expectations are on the down side," Mr. Canakaris said from his office in Atlanta. "Companies lack pricing power, and the transition to conservative accounting, which eventually will be better for the economy, will reduce earnings expectations until then." 
 As a result, he has loaded up on consumer-staples stocks, which account for 21 percent of the fund's assets, versus 9 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. The fund is also more heavily invested than the index in health care stocks, at 25 percent of assets versus 15 percent.
"Investors often view these types of companies as defensive," he said. "We think that they will be seen as more offensive in the period ahead." 
Many of the companies are multinational, he added, and should be helped by a weakening dollar, which makes domestic goods more affordable overseas. "For the first time in seven years, currency won't be a head wind," he said.
The fund has lost money in the bear market, but not as much as most of its peers. It was down 12.4 percent, annualized, for the three years through Thursday, placing among the top 11 percent of all funds that buy large growth stocks, which lost 19.2 percent, annualized, during that time, according to Morningstar Inc. The S.& P. 500 lost 12.7 percent a year, on average, in that period.
The fund lost 16.2 percent in the 12 months through Thursday, versus losses of 17.8 percent for its group and 15.1 percent for the index.
Mr. Canakaris, 58, is president and chief investment officer of Montag & Caldwell, the fund's subadviser for ABN Amro of the Netherlands, which owns ABN Amro Asset Management in Chicago. Montag & Caldwell manages about $26 billion, mostly for institutions, and Mr. Canakaris also runs its $1.4 billion Enterprise Growth fund.
To pick the 30 to 40 stocks in the fund, Mr. Canakaris looks for what he calls "high-quality growth companies with businesses or franchises that have met the test of time." He starts by screening a large basket of American companies with market capitalizations of $5 billion or more, looking for annual earnings growth of at least 10 percent, on average, over the last 5 to 10 years. He also looks for strong financial qualities, like profit consistency and low debt.
His valuation analysis focuses on what he believes is the present value of a company's projected 10-year earnings. "Earnings growth drives stock prices over time," he said, "because companies pay out the money in dividends or reinvest it in their businesses." Ideally, he wants to buy shares at discounts of 20 to 30 percent of what he thinks they are worth.
Next, he looks for above-average projected earnings growth over the next 6 to 12 months. He regards such growth as a catalyst for rising stock prices.
Mr. Canakaris prefers what he calls "financially disciplined" management that uses conservative accounting and sets realistic objectives. He considers selling shares when they start to trade at 20 percent more than their intrinsic value or after a company reports disappointing quarterly earnings.
In August, Mr. Canakaris began buying shares of Gannett, the media company based in McLean, Va. The fund has paid $75.07, on average, for the entire position; the shares closed Friday at $74.67, compared with an intrinsic value that he estimates at $96. Gannett generates consistent, predictable earnings growth, Mr. Canakaris said, and should benefit as the economy recovers and advertising revenues increase. Aggressive cost controls have given the company good operating leverage, he said, adding, "Next year should be a barnburner because of the presidential election and the Olympics."
He calls another of the fund's holdings, Coca-Cola, "a wonderful business with enduring demand for its product." He has held shares since the start of the fund in November 1994 and has added to the position over the last 12 months, paying $53.69, on average, adjusted for stock splits, for the entire position. The stock closed Friday at $39.42, compared with an estimated intrinsic value of $55.
Despite the company's strong profitability, its shares trade relatively cheaply, he said, because of Wall Street's worries about changes in top management. Yet the senior management group is "an effective team and executing well," Mr. Canakaris said, and the company's new-product activity is picking up.
THE fund also holds shares of Procter & Gamble, which has reported six consecutive quarters of increasing earnings because of its management's focus on its "big brands, big markets and big customers," Mr. Canakaris said. Cost-cutting measures should increase profitability, he added, but the stock is still a bargain because some growth investors have been replacing such stocks with more aggressive ones, like those of technology companies.
The fund began buying shares in September 2000 and has added to the stake in the last year, paying $72.71, on average, for the whole position. The shares finished last week at $89.14; he estimates their intrinsic value at $112.

HEADLINE: In Defense of a Judge 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Another Unworthy Judicial Nominee" (editorial, some editions, April 24):
 Your editorial opposing the confirmation of Judge Carolyn Kuhl -- who served as my deputy from 1985 to 1986, when I was solicitor general -- omits any mention of the support Judge Kuhl has received from more than 100 fellow judges, bar leaders in California, plaintiff's lawyers and civil rights lawyers. 
This is surely the best evidence of how she would perform as a federal judge. 
 You characterize Judge Kuhl as "outside the ideological mainstream" because, among other things, she joined my brief calling Roe v. Wade an unwarranted extension of constitutional doctrine. That was also the view then of mainstream liberal scholars like Archibald Cox, John Ely and Paul Freund. 
You also state that Judge Kuhl wrote a brief "backing the defendant in a sexual harassment case." On the contrary, she signed my brief in the Vinson case urging the Supreme Court for the first time to hold that sexual harassment was indeed a violation of the Civil Rights Act's guarantee of equal economic opportunity. We did go on to write that as applied to the particular facts in that case, the employer might not be liable under that important general principle. 
It is ironic that the Senate Democrats have been willing to confirm several men as conservative as Judge Kuhl but now threaten to make a goal-line stand against two women and a Hispanic.

A Lot of People Love This Dirty City

BYLINE:  By JESSE McKINLEY 

 BODY:
THREE weeks ago at a club half a block from the smoke-free environs of City Hall, Jesse Hartman, an Eddie Izzard look-alike and the frontman of the downtown band Laptop, was wailing through the group's new single, "Ratso Rizzo." 
 "Every hangout I had, had become a boutique, and every local bar turned to one with a theme," Mr. Hartman sang. "But thanks to a deep recession, there's no more gentrification. You're back, Ratso Rizzo. I'm glad you're back." 
 The crowd, made up of employed and semiemployed 20- and 30-somethings, went wild. That may well be because the song, which pays homage to the pathetic indigent played by Dustin Hoffman in the 1969 movie "Midnight Cowboy," illustrates the silent glee felt by a certain clique of New Yorkers who are happy that, despite all the attempts to burnish the city into a shiny tourist attraction, some of its traditional grime and grit seem to be returning. 
"I'm happy the stock market tanked," said John Penley, an East Village photographer and proud neighborhood rabble-rouser on issues from squatters' rights to police brutality. "In the old days, every fourth person you saw walking down Avenue A was a flamboyant drag queen. Now maybe they'll come back." 
It's an attitude -- calling it a movement would be a stretch -- that combines equal parts yuppie-go-home schadenfreude and a new middle-class sedition, a sense of rebellion that may best be typified by the surprisingly widespread defiance of the recent smoking ban. 
In fact, if behavior in a variety of Lower Manhattan bars over the last month is indicative, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg may have unwittingly unleashed the long-dormant bad boy and bad girl in thousands of otherwise law-abiding citizens, creating a new petit criminal class that smokes furtively in bathrooms, the backs of bars and under tables. 
Elsewhere, the kind of misbehavior that two past City Hall administrations tried so hard to snuff out has proven surprisingly tenacious. For all the Disneysification of Times Square, the home turf to the original Mr. Rizzo, there are still nearly a dozen pornography shops along Eighth Avenue between Penn Station and 45th Street, offering all manner of nude and crude paraphernalia. The Department of Homeless Services says its outreach programs report about the same homeless population as in past years, but in the warm weather, unkempt transient people may appear more noticeable because they spend more time on the streets.
The sour economy has of course put a dent in the city's luster. More than 175,000 jobs have been lost in the last two years, many in the financial services industry that not only provided the city's most ostentatious displays of wealth, but also paid for much of the street-level cleanup via business improvement districts. 
Then there is a trend toward naughty fun, from new swingers clubs to "the new burlesque," showcases where strippers laud their wares in updated vaudeville routines. And -- eeek! -- people are even dancing in bars. 
All of which might cause night sweats for civic leaders, but which makes people like Alex MacFarlane, a native New Yorker, think that the real city -- the one that countless Lou Reed-inspired transplants moved here to experience -- may just be coming back. 
"The city lost a certain amount of soul when people who came here to be artists or grew up here could no longer afford to live here," said Mr. MacFarlane, 25, who works at a nonprofit organization. "We don't want to see the city become unsafe again. But if thousands of stockbrokers decided they wanted to leave the city tomorrow, I wouldn't exactly be upset about it." 
Many of the changes are more symbolic than substantive, just as much of this new contrarian posturing is just that, a certain sentimental yearning for the bohemian days of yore. Crime is actually down in the city by 9 percent this year, despite some headline-grabbing attacks. And while the specter of decreased city services is frightening and real, as of now, garbage is still being collected, the streets are still being swept, and neighborhoods are still being patrolled by police. 
And indeed, Mr. MacFarlane and others like him don't want a wholesale return to the good-bad old days of the late 1970's or the late 1980's, the most recent periods of seedy decline. Nobody wants to get mugged, after all, and everybody wants to have a job (or at least a recession-proof trust fund). And while some decorative trash on the streets during the winter might be O.K., once the sun starts to hit the Heftys, nobody wants to be downwind. 
Even Mr. Penley, who remembers, with a certain fond glow, the 1988 Tompkins Square Park riots over attempts to remove the homeless, says that one of the main reasons he is glad the city is on the rocks is that his rent might go down. 
"Personally I hope the real estate market goes back to when I first moved into the neighborhood," he said. "There were two drug spots on my block and so my landlord gave me two months' free rent." 
Andrew Heiberger, the chairman and president of Citi Habitats, a large real estate broker, said that any perceived falloff in quality of life had yet to affect sales of apartments, but that buyers are nervous about proposed cuts in the police force and sanitation department. He added that rents around the city are down some 10 to 20 percent because of the soft economy, a development welcomed by many city residents who had been pushed to the fringes. 
"People come from the outer boroughs or Jersey where they've been banished to because of higher rents," Mr. Heiberger said. "For them, the declines are an opportunity, not a problem."
Chafing at efforts to clean up the city is not new. The historian Luc Sante, in his 1991 book "Low Life," cited a 1915 article by a self-described aesthete, James Gibbons Huneker, who railed against "the cleanliness, the wide streets, the playgrounds, the big boulevards, the absence of indigence that have spoiled the interesting part of New York City." 
As with other nascent insurgencies, the new pro-grime crowd isn't completely -- or at all -- cohesive. Many champions of picturesque decline are based in neighborhoods like the East Village where old-time oddballs were displaced by higher rents and new million-dollar condos in recent years. 
Artists seem especially pleased by the concept of a dingier city. Take the Antagonist Movement, a collection of several dozen artists whose rebellious posturing includes a logo depicting an upraised finger (but whose members probably have never missed a meal). The group is based out of the bar Niagara on East Seventh Street and Avenue A, which is itself a contradiction: popular with both the Prada bag crowd and the retro rock band the Strokes, whose frontman, Julian Casablancas, sports a well-maintained black mop top that is imitated throughout the neighborhood. 
The movement, as it were, has a manifesto. Its members condone petty theft: "If you have to steal your supplies, the process is just as important as the product," as one member put it. 
Christopher Yerington, 24, is an Antagonist and an owner of Black and White, a bar on East 10th Street. "I find the downturn to be a totally welcome change," Mr. Yerington said. "I think dismal surroundings nurture good art."
"If we all wanted to live in a suburban place full of nice people," he said, "we'd have stayed in Jersey."
That said, many who appreciate a certain roughness to the city predict it cannot last. Some bar owners are worried that the city will roll back last call for alcohol from 4 a.m. to 2 a.m., especially now that rowdy smokers are congregating on sidewalks and disturbing neighbors. 
And while smoking in bars may be tolerated for the moment, the city's Health Department has vowed to start issuing citations to bar owners after a 30-day warning period expires this week. 
So for the time being, malcontents like Mr. Hartman, the "Ratso Rizzo" singer, say they are going to enjoy the seediness. "There is this strange and pleasant resurfacing of the old underground dwellers," he said. "You see them smoking on the sidewalk. You see them jabbering to themselves nonsensically. It's spring, the characters are blooming again and I couldn't be happier."

HEADLINE: Ford at 100: Social Change, Innovations and a Few Stumbles 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES McEWEN 

 BODY:
HENRY FORD changed the world. His Model T put the automobile within reach of the working class. The assembly line and the $5-a-day wage, two other Ford innovations, made the T affordable. 
 "There were other people who could have done what he did, putting America and the world on wheels," said Beverly Rae Kimes, an automotive historian in New York. "Ransom Olds was there first, but there was not another man who was so single-minded, so blindered" as Ford was. 
 On June 16, 1903, Henry Ford and 11 investors formed the Ford Motor Company. On June 12, a gala five-day centennial celebration will begin in Dearborn, Mich., with entertainment and displays of historic cars and trucks made by Ford and its subsidiaries.
The company has much to celebrate. Consider a few of its notable products of the last 100 years: the Model T, of course, and its successor, the stylish and dependable Model A. The flathead V-8, which brought power to the proletariat; the Lincoln-Zephyr, a streamlined design that combined body and frame; the first Mercury, a step up from low-priced Fords; and the stylish prewar Lincoln Continental, an American classic.
Then there were the breakthrough postwar designs that rescued the financially ailing company: the first F-Series pickup truck of 1948 and the clean, futuristic 1949 Ford. In the 50's, Ford created American icons like the two-seat Thunderbirds of 1955-57, the 1957-59 Skyliners with disappearing metal tops and the elegant 1956-57 Continental Mark II. In the next decade, the compact Falcon was a retort to Volkswagen, and the free-spirited Mustang captivated baby boomers, creating a whole new category, the pony car.
The 70's were not kind to Ford or its Detroit rivals, but in the 80's Ford managed another financial turnaround, thanks in part to its influential, popular Taurus.
There were duds, too, like the 1958 Edsel and the Pinto subcompact of the 1970's, which tended to catch fire in rear-end crashes. More recently there was the Explorer, whose Firestone tires came apart.
Despite his vision, Henry Ford had a dark side. He was virulently anti-Semitic and so antiunion that he condoned a goon squad to intimidate labor organizers. He could be bullheaded, allowing the Model T to soldier on well past its prime and insisting on mechanical brakes long after rivals adopted superior hydraulic systems.
While Ford has settled into semipermanent status as the world's No. 2 automaker, it has careered several times from giddy prosperity to the brink of collapse -- including a disastrous turn in the late 1990's that brought a staggering loss of $5.5 billion for 2001. Even as it celebrates its centennial, the company -- now under the leadership of William Clay Ford Jr., the founder's great-grandson -- is struggling to correct its course.
Still, Ford's 100th anniversary clearly merits a celebratory look back. Here are some of the reasons.

GRAPHIC: Photos: HORSELESS -- Model T touring car from 1923.; THE TS SUCCESSOR -- 1929 Model A cabriolet.; KING OF CUSTOMS -- 1934 Ford V-8, the foundation of countless hot rods.; CLASSIC -- 1940 Lincoln Continental.; STREAMLINED -- The 1936 Lincoln-Zephyr.; FIRST MERCURY -- 1939 sedan-coupe.; REALWOOD -- 1949 Ford station wagon.; FIRST OF THE FS -- The F-Series of trucks began in 1948. This Mercury version was sold in Canada.; NEWPOSTWAR DESIGN -- 1949 Ford business coupe. PURE 50'S -- First Thunderbird was a two-seat 55 model.; SPRAWLING -- Fords River Rouge complex covers 1,100 acres in Dearborn, Mich. Iron ore went in one end and cars rolled out the other.; NOW YOU SEE IT . . . 1957 Skyliner had a metal top.; FLAWED GENIUS -- Henry Ford introduced his flathead V-8 in 1932. Ford was a man of grand visions and strong biases. (Illustrations from the brochure collection of Steve Hayes)(pg. 1); AND NOW YOU DON'T -- At the push of a button, the top of the 57 Skyliner retracted.; CHROMEMOBILE -- 57 Mercury Turnpike Cruiser.; FORDS FLOP -- The 1958 Edsel.; FIRST COMPACT -- 1960 Ford Falcon.; FIRST PONY CAR -- The 1964 Mustang was introduced at the New York Worlds Fair.; ILL-FATED -- 1971 Pinto, prone to fires, was not Fords finest effort.; SIMPLY ELEGANT -- After some hideously overstyled Lincolns, the 61 Continental was simply tasteful and restrained.; GROUNDED -- T-Birds lost distinction as they became versions of common Fords, like this 80.; REBORN -- After 45 years, the T-Bird returned to its roots as a two-seater with porthole windows.; TAURUS -- A radically smooth design that went against the boxy 1980s mainstream, the 86 Taurus (and its Mercury counterpart, the Sable) was a huge success at a time when Ford sorely needed one.; REFLECTED GLORY -- Ford GT concept, destined for limited production, resembles the GT40 racecars that dominated Le Mans in the 60s.; MUSTANG RIDES AGAIN -- The Mustang GT concept, on display at auto shows this year, is a preview of the next-generation car that goes on sale in 2004.; REVIVAL -- The Continental reappeared in 1956 as the $10,000 Mark II.

HEADLINE: Can a Smile Bridge The Divide? 

BYLINE:  By CATHY HORYN 

 BODY:
SUSAN FALES-HILL'S life is as deceptively glamorous as Ms. Fales-Hill herself is beautiful. Married to a banker, she lives on Park Avenue, gives generously of her time to several worthy causes and has a portrait of a proper Boston ancestor on her wall to prove that she could, if asked, be a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution.
 But as Ms. Fales-Hill can attest, life is seldom what it appears, especially American life, with its shadows and prejudices and drawn blinds. She is the daughter of the late black actress Josephine Premice, who believed in primping even for the supermarket, and Timothy Fales, a white banker's son who wasn't about to follow his family's Anglo-Saxon traditions, least of all its opinions about marriage to an ebony-skinned Broadway entertainer. 
 That was in 1958. Miss Premice, already a star in Europe, where she was known as La Bombe, was appearing in the musical "Jamaica," with Lena Horne and Ossie Davis. And she gave Mr. Fales no time when he turned up swooning at her dressing room. "I'm a bachelor girl," she declared to a newspaper reporter. But after a martini here and there, she relented, and they were married, by the Rev. Adam Clayton Powell Jr. It took five years for the ice to thaw between Timothy and his father, DeCoursey Fales Sr. (of the Fales Library at New York University), who had the double discomfort of seeing his family's name mixed up in headlines like "Negro Singer Married to Socialite Ship Exec."
Ms. Fales-Hill has made her family the subject of a new memoir, "Always Wear Joy" (HarperCollins). And as in life, the dauntless Miss Premice is the star. As Ms. Fales-Hill told guests at a book party last week at Sardi's, her memoir is about "the glory of growing up as her daughter." Yet the story she tells is hardly "Auntie Mame," or even "Imitation of Life." In its candor and craziness, it is closer to "Haywire," Brooke Hayward's 1977 memoir. Show business people keep popping up in the Faleses' Upper West Side living room, but there are cracks in the marriage. Timothy turns out to be not only an emotionally distant father -- stuck in his books -- but also a cheating husband.
And there is this unexpected surprise: by highlighting her parents' racially mixed social life, especially against the liberal idealism of the 1960's and 70's, and by scrutinizing her own feelings about being what she calls a demi-WASP, Ms. Fales-Hill raises questions about how integrated New York society is today. Thirty years after her parents dragged her to parties at the home of Harry Belafonte to hear about the plight of Native Americans and after she proudly pointed out her mother's decorating skills to Jackie Onassis, you have to wonder if the current partygivers are so conscientious about the mix. "While I find there's openness and people are very lovely, white and black, New York is somewhat segregated," Ms. Fales-Hill, 40, said one morning recently in the apartment she shares with her husband, Aaron Hill, and their newborn daughter.
"And a lot of the separation is by choice," she said. "There's a very strong black society group, with some high-powered businesspeople who come from families to be reckoned with. But one could also argue whether there's been a huge outreach on the part of white society toward blacks. No, not really. I think, frankly, people also don't know where to begin."
You don't have to look far to see what she means. At some of the most chic society parties, especially by the younger set -- for the Frick Collection, the Museum of the City of New York or the New York Botanical Garden -- a black face is nearly as rare as it was at the Birmingham Country Club in the 50's. And some black philanthropic events -- like the Associated Black Charities gala and the annual awards dinner for the Support Network, which provides aid for minority scholarships -- are little more likely to attract white patrons.
"I cannot tell you how depressing it is to go to a cocktail party or a business event and see nothing but white faces," said Pamela Fiori, editor in chief of Town & Country. Ms. Fiori's magazine, more than most, has made an effort to include blacks and other minorities not only in its party and wedding pages, but also in feature articles, according to black society figures like Gayle Atkins, a board member of the Studio Museum in Harlem.
Ms. Fiori said that magazine editors and predominantly white charities shouldn't assume that interested members of the black elite will come to them. "You have to make it happen," she said. "If people feel they're not wanted, they're not going to bang down the door."
As Ms. Fales-Hill suggests, many blacks have chosen to stick with and support their own society events after years of being denied access to white clubs and institutions. In addition, many successful blacks do not attach importance to entering "the so-called gilded WASP circle," said the society bandleader Bobby Short, who, like Miss Premice, crossed color barriers on individual merit. They have established themselves by more potent means, through business and entertainment.
Another factor is money. For blacks and whites alike, it takes a lot of it to play the social game at its liveliest in New York, to cover the $1,000 gala tickets as well as the clothes that help land a person in the magazines and society columns. And at the moment in this economy, said Blaine Trump, who enlisted Ms. Fales-Hill as a co-chairwoman of the American Ballet Theater gala on May 5, competing causes, black or white, are vying for the same wallets.
"They'd welcome anyone," Ms. Trump said.
Because of her own biracial history, and the friendships she formed growing up -- first at the Lycee Francais and later at Harvard -- Ms. Fales-Hill brings, clearly, a broad perspective to the scene. "She's loose in her skin, and people respond to that," said a friend, Kristina Stewart, the executive editor of Harper's Bazaar. People who have known her longer, like the actress Diahann Carroll, also say they recognize the qualities she inherited from her parents, among them humor and grace. You don't sense she has an agenda or an ax to grind -- no more than her mother did in 1977 when, after playing Irene in the hit musical "Bubbling Brown Sugar," she found the offers of stage roles tapering off.
"I was living the same disappointments and joys that Josephine was living," recalled Ms. Carroll, who appeared with Miss Premice in the 1954 play "House of Flowers," based on the Truman Capote short story. "The fight to remain sane and committed to your gifts and not feel diminished by a lack of recognition -- that was every black actor and actress's struggle. We didn't have to explain it to each other."
In her apartment, Ms. Fales-Hill put on one of her mother's records, and Josephine Premice's husky voice floated over the room and the oil portrait of her Boston ancestor Samuel Fales. Miss Premice made four albums, including "Josephine in Paris," on the Verve label. In Paris in the 50's, she met everyone who was anyone -- including Cecil Beaton and the couturiers Hubert de Givenchy and Jacques Fath, who, with yards of creamy taffeta, helped transform the sparrow singer into La Bombe.
After she married Mr. Fales and they spent a six-year hiatus in Rome, where Ms. Fales-Hill and her brother, Enrico, were born, they returned to New York, where Miss Premice continued to act and they created a salon in their living room.
"My parents were part of an artistic world that was less consumed with, 'Where does everybody fit?' " Ms. Fales-Hill said. "People were more passionate then. They drank, they smoked, got smashed. Now we're very rational and analytical about things."
Ms. Fales-Hill's ability to reach across divides isn't limited to her various causes, which include the Studio Museum in Harlem and the East Side House Settlement, or her appearances in the party pages of Vogue and W, or even her efforts on behalf of the Fales Library, where she serves as host of an annual dinner. As her friend Ms. Atkins said, "Susan feels a responsibility toward her past, not only on her mother's side but on her father's." More profoundly, Ms. Fales-Hill writes with understanding of her father, who left her mother in the mid-1980's, and on the list of those to whom she dedicates her book is the woman he lives with in Paris.
All this makes Ms. Fales-Hill sound like a goody-two-shoes, which might be better (or not) than being the Only One. "Why is she the only stylish black woman you see" in the magazines? asked a New York publicist who is herself black.
Ms. Fales-Hill said she doesn't think she is the only black society figure who is photographed for fashion and style magazines, mentioning the art consultant Kim Heirston and Kathryn Chenault, the wife of the chief executive of American Express, among others. But she conceded that there are not enough integrated society events.
For years, said Audrey Smaltz, a black producer of fashion shows for big-name designers, white society has consciously or unconsciously pursued a pattern of tokenism in its partygiving. "They allow one black man in at a time, and he's always gay," she said with a laugh, and some accuracy.
Yet, Ms. Trump and Ms. Atkins say, the ice floe is breaking up more and more, and they cite the mix at galas for the Studio Museum in Harlem and Jazz at Lincoln Center, which will have a concert and dinner with Morgan Freeman as host on June 2. "I think as more people have multiracial, multicultural experiences from a younger age," Ms. Atkins said, "inclusion will happen naturally."
People on all sides -- black and white, old guard and new -- see Ms. Fales-Hill as a natural catalyst to move society beyond tokenism. But Ms. Fales-Hill, a former sitcom writer ("The Cosby Show," "A Different World"), may not be ready for such a role, or even interested in it. She said she wants to devote time to her husband and daughter, joking the other night at Sardi's that her daughter's birth has "brought me unimaginable joy and an unimaginable bust line."
By the way, she met her husband on a blind date. Mr. Hill, who seems to favor the William F. Buckley Jr. example of disappearing into the social background behind a highly visible wife, is black himself; he was brought up in New Hampshire, where his father taught drama at Dartmouth.
"Yes, I asked the question, Do I marry a black person or a white person?" Ms. Fales-Hill said. "And ultimately the conclusion that I came to was I just want somebody who understands me. Understanding doesn't come in an ethnic package."

CORRECTION-DATE: May 11, 2003

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on April 27 about the socialite Susan Fales-Hill, whose memoir of her biracial family casts light on race relations in New York, referred incorrectly to the entertainer Bobby Short, who commented on the attitudes of some successful blacks toward white society circles. He is a pianist and cabaret singer, not a society bandleader.

Have BusinessService Stocks Fallen Too Far?

BYLINE:  By J. ALEX TARQUINIO 

 BODY:
SHARES of business services companies have suffered worse declines during the last year than many of the companies they serve. But some have fallen so far, analysts say, that they may start to look attractive as pieces of the economy pick up.
 From credit card processors to technology consultants, these companies, over all, have had a stock-price decline of nearly 28 percent in the last 52 weeks, as measured by the Dow Jones Industrial Services Index. That compares with a decline of 16.5 percent in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. 
 Layoffs throughout the economy have meant fewer paychecks to process and fewer credit card transactions to clear, while the decline in high-technology spending has dampened demand for technology advisers. 
But the fact that some of these stocks are now selling in the bargain basement suggests to some analysts that they may be poised to benefit from an economic rebound.
The business services group "tends to grow better than G.D.P. growth," said Thatcher Thompson, a business services analyst at CIBC World Markets in New York.
CIBC tracks revenue for 600 business services companies, 340 of them publicly traded; the rest are either private or units of larger companies. Revenue for the 600 businesses grew 11 percent in 2000, when the growth in gross domestic product was 3.8 percent. In 2001, revenue grew 7 percent, compared with 0.3 percent growth in G.D.P.
The data is not yet available for last year, but "my hunch is that revenue growth slowed somewhat in 2002," Mr. Thompson said. It is tough to say how these stocks usually respond to a weak economy, he said, because the industry is so young. Fewer than a third of the 100 largest business services stocks traded publicly as recently as eight years ago. And only four have market capitalizations greater than $10 billion: First Data, Paychex, Automatic Data Processing and Accenture.
Broadly speaking, the industry's fortunes hinge on a healthy economy. But the companies are not all sensitive to the same economic influences. Some of them are hurt by rising unemployment and falling interest rates, while others worry more about skittish consumers. Anemic corporate spending on technology may even benefit some companies while proving devastating to others.
The payroll processors -- a business dominated by Paychex and Automatic Data Processing, better known as A.D.P. -- may feel the pinch of rising unemployment, but falling interest rates hurt their profits more. 
Although more than two million jobs have been lost over the last three years, the size of the United States labor force has declined only about 1.5 percent, said James Morrow, portfolio manager of the Fidelity Select Business Services/Outsourcing Portfolio. "I don't mean to be insensitive to all the people who lost their jobs, but that's a small percentage," he said.
He compared that with the decline in the yield on the two-year Treasury note, which since July 2000 has fallen to about 1.6 percent from 6.3 percent. That's a huge blow to payroll processors, Mr. Morrow said, because they earn money from the "float," the interest income that accrues before employees cash their checks.
A change in interest rates can have a significant effect on a company's bottom line because the float is pure profit. The company does not need to buy another computer or hire another accountant to earn it.
The business of Paychex, based in Rochester, is devoted to payroll processing. Interest income amounted to 6.5 percent of revenue and 23 percent of profit in 2002, according to Todd Lukasik, an equity analyst at Morningstar Inc. In 1996, when interest rates were much higher, the float generated nearly half the net income, Mr. Lukasik said.
The story is a little different at A.D.P., in Roseland, N.J., where payroll processing accounts for about 60 percent of revenue. Roughly a quarter of its revenue is from executing trades for the brokerage industry -- a line of work that has suffered as trading volumes have declined -- and 5 percent is from processing insurance claims. The other 10 percent is from data processing for car dealerships, which exposes the company to the slow-growth auto market, Mr. Lukasik said.
A.D.P. will be challenged to offset an increase of $200 million to $350 million in spending that includes product development expected in its next fiscal year, ending in June 2004, according to Prudential Securities. "We believe weak new sales growth and a dismal brokerage environment could make this increasingly difficult," Bryan C. Keane, a stock analyst at Prudential Securities, wrote in a research report on April 17.
One of the best-established segments of the business services industry is the processing of credit card and debit card transactions. Interest rates are also important for this group, but consumer confidence, rather than jobs data, is the best indicator of future revenue, Mr. Lukasik said. 
First Data, in Greenwood Village, Colo., is one of the largest processors of credit card and debit card transactions for American retailers; the company also owns Western Union. First Data recently announced plans to acquire Concord EFS, in Memphis, for roughly $7 billion in an all-stock deal, pending shareholder and regulatory approval. The combined company would process roughly half the Visa and MasterCard transactions for United States retailers, Mr. Lukasik said. 
CONCORD'S shares have fallen 58 percent the last 52 weeks, while shares of First Data are off barely 5 percent. Many Concord investors are concerned about uncertainty over major bank contracts that are up for renewal in 2004, Mr. Lukasik said. Concord has a large share of the other side of the debit card business, processing transactions for banks.
Another segment of business services, technology consulting, depends almost entirely on a rebound in corporate capital expenditures, which do not necessarily move in lock step with indicators like jobs and consumer spending, said Mr. Morrow of Fidelity.
Accenture, based in Bermuda, advises businesses that need to integrate new technology into existing systems. Spending on new technology is not likely to pick up any time soon, so this business will probably remain stagnant, said Michael Trigg, a stock analyst at Morningstar. He is projecting a revenue decline of about 1 percent for the company's fiscal year, ending in August.
But Accenture has wisely expanded into outsourcing, which is less profitable than technology consulting but is providing needed revenue, Mr. Trigg said. About a third of revenue now comes from providing human resources and financial services for other companies.
That has put a dent in operating profit margins, which ranged as high as 18 percent to 20 percent in the late 1990's and 2000, he said. The operating profit margin was 12 percent in the fiscal year ended August 2002.
Accenture was a unit of Arthur Andersen , but it split from Andersen in August 2000 two years before Andersen failed in the Enron scandal. Although there is some legal risk from shareholders of Enron, which Anderson audited before both companies imploded, Mr. Trigg characterized that risk as small.
The weak technology spending that hurts advisers like Accenture could benefit many companies that process credit card transactions and print paychecks, Mr. Morrow said.
The stagnant technology market "tends to accelerate the trend toward cheaper processing power," he said. So even if the economy continues to waver and revenues decline for processors of paychecks and credit cards, he said, their profit margins might suffer less, or not at all, if costs decline faster.
But stronger consumer confidence, more jobs and higher interest rates should perk up business services stocks, analysts say. An easing of tension in Iraq, they say, could bolster consumer confidence, and they note that interest rates do not have much further to fall.
As for jobs, Mr. Thompson said he was keeping an eye on revenue at temporary-help agencies like Manpower and Robert Half International, which are giving mixed signals right now. But "these are the best leading indicators" because companies tend to hire temporary staff first, he said, while unemployment data, which tracks permanent employment, tends to lag behind an economic recovery.

Publicists, Once Again In the Cross Hairs

BYLINE:  By ADAM STERNBERGH 

 BODY:
IN the 1998 film "Sliding Doors," Gwyneth Paltrow's character leads two alternate lives. In one, she's a frumpy pushover with mousy hair and a cheating boyfriend. In the other, she wears fabulous outfits, sports a platinum hairdo and is pursued by a charming Scotsman. In one, she toils at a greasy spoon. In the other, she whips up a fabulous party to open a friend's chic restaurant. In one, she's a waitress. In the other, she's a publicist. 
 Now compare this portrayal of the publicist's life to the one now playing in theaters. In "People I Know," Al Pacino stars as Eli Wurman, a harried and haggard career flack. His existence is not one of sly banter and glamorous clothes. Rather, Wurman is a professional bootlicker, a sad and regretful man whose own potential (he graduated from Harvard Law) has been frittered away on a life spent cleaning up the messes left by other, more important people. He's like Willy Loman with a pill addiction and a Rolodex. 
 Wurman is better off, however, than Stu Shepard, the publicist played by Colin Farrell who is at the center of "Phone Booth," another recent film. Shepard is a small-time press agent who finds himself pinned down in a phone booth by a vengeful sniper. 
What are Shepard's crimes? Well, he plays two magazines off each other to win a cover story for a C-list client. He tells another client that he has booked a party in what he claims is the hottest restaurant in Manhattan but which is not, in fact, the hottest restaurant in Manhattan. For this, he is targeted for assassination.
How did publicists become Hollywood's villains of choice -- tragic characters at best, and sleazy liars at worst? (In "Phone Booth," the sniper's other targets are a pornographer and a corrupt corporate executive.) To be sure, pop culture has often taken a dim view of the publicist's trade, from Paul Shaffer's pathetic flunkie in "This Is Spinal Tap," in which he literally bends over and begs his clients to kick his behind, to that of the 1957 gold standard of flack-bashing, "Sweet Smell of Success." In that film, Tony Curtis plays Sidney Falco as an amoral snake who slithers through the canyons of Manhattan, running errands for Burt Lancaster's imperious gossip columnist, J. J. Hunsecker. 
But if anything, the prospects for celebrity publicists should now be on the rise; after all, Hunsecker and Falco have all but reversed roles. Today's "image managers" wield unprecedented power, while it is the gossip-gobbling journalists who scramble for scraps. Hollywood publicists like Pat Kingsley of PMK/HBH, the industry's most influential firm, don't have to curry favor with journalists. Instead, they guard their star clients like bouncers at the entrance to the world's most exclusive nightclub. 
For a brief moment not long ago, pop culture celebrated this new breed of publicist, heralding them as the very model of urbane glamour. In addition to "Sliding Doors," television shows such as "Absolutely Fabulous" and "Sex and the City" portrayed public relations executives as vain but endearing glamour girls who whirled through a city's nightlife one air-kiss at a time. 
Now it is the publicity industry that could use, well, a good publicist. On screen, press agents are ducking bullets when they're not dodging petulant clients. Meanwhile, the trade's most visible real-life practitioners have been Lizzie Grubman, who backed her car into a crowd in 2001, and Muhammad Said al-Sahhaf, who was Iraq's minister of information, who amused the world with his delusional dispatches on the imminent defeat of the coalition forces.
"The culture now depends so heavily on spin, puffery and the exultation of personalities," said Jon Robin Baitz, the screenwriter of "People I Know." "These guys are the disseminators, dealing in a strange currency. They don't just promote a star. They're ecclesiastical figures for the whole infotainment culture."
Not surprisingly, publicists don't see themselves in the same terms. "I don't know why people have a negative connotation about us," said Heidi Schaeffer, an account executive at PMK/HBH. "We serve a purpose, and we're not bad people."
Publicists can be forgiven for wondering why the mood has suddenly turned ugly. In "Phone Booth," for example, Shepard tearfully renounces his profession, screaming, "I lie to the media, who sell my lies to more and more people!" When he spots his eager intern in the crowd, he pleads: "Don't be a publicist! You're too good for it!"
Publicists are doing what they've done since the days of Sidney Falco: managing information to protect their clients. The difference now is that everyone's paying close attention to their work.
"There's a very high premium placed by the public on the idea of 'knowing,' " said Neal Gabler, the author of a Walter Winchell biography. "We want to know how everything operates and we don't want to feel like we're being fooled. There's always been a disparaging attitude toward publicists; they've been seen as shills, hucksters or ballyhoo artists. But this large universe of people who once worked behind the scenes are now in front of the scenes."
At first, this attention made publicists into new-style stars. In the 1990's, hype outpaced worthiness: every ingenue was a superstar, every mannequin a supermodel, every I.P.O. the next Amazon. As architects of the buzz glut, publicists were naturally fascinating. They seemed like the ultimate string-pullers, generating notice for others while winning it for themselves. 
The fascination with them reached a peak with a 1998 New York magazine cover story, in which a clique of publicists in their mid-20's, including Lara Shriftman, Liz Cohen and Ms. Grubman were dubbed the "Power Girls." Sure, they came across as a tad repellent, but those connections! Those parties! Those shoes! The article portrayed them as somewhere between Bridget Jones and Samantha Jones, the vampy public relations queen on "Sex and the City."'
The new century brought an economic hangover, however, and, consequently, a ballyhoo backlash. Who better to blame than the ballyhoo artists? "The feeling is that publicists have gone too far," said Michelangelo Signorile, a cultural critic who started his career planting gossip items for a public relations firm, Michael Hall Associates. "Now publicists are seen as dangerous, as a threat. But they're not really doing anything more than what they're hired to do."
Yet, like Pacino's character in "People I Know," the public has become disenchanted with the publicist's wizardry. Having clamored for a peek behind the curtain, it is now recoiling at the sight of that exposed machinery. And publicists have been caught red-handed with their hands on the levers. So we have a film like "Phone Booth," in which we're shooting the messenger, literally. 
Most publicists say they never wanted the attention. They would be happy to quietly return to their business. "I don't think everybody needs to know how things happen," Ms. Schaeffer said. "Let there be a little magic left. Why do we have to explain how everything gets from A to Z?" When asked if she would like to see more positive portrayals of publicists in pop culture, she said, "I don't want to see any portrayals."
Publicists, the "power girls" notwithstanding, have never been fans of scrutiny. They prefer to work just outside the spotlight. This is because they've always understood what the rest of us temporarily forgot: that their business is inherently unglamorous and, yes, occasionally ugly. It just looked pretty for a moment.

Shares of Corporate Nice Guys Can Finish First

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
STUPEFYING, is it not, how selfish behavior in the executive suite continues even as managers claim to care deeply about corporate governance issues? The ham-handed attempt by Donald J. Carty, the just-defenestrated chief of the AMR Corporation, to hide special executive pay perks while he cut workers' pay is only the latest indication that some powerful people still think the do-as-I-say, not-as-I-do approach is acceptable.
 It is puzzling that these people cannot or will not see that doing right by shareholders, employees and customers is good business. Part of the problem may be that the payoff from tending to corporate governance issues is nowhere near as immediate as the payback from self-serving moves. 
 But there is proof that the stocks of companies run more selflessly perform better than those of companies run by me-firsters. Academic studies have shown this in the past. And a new study by GovernanceMetrics International, an independent corporate governance ratings agency in New York, also confirms a correlation between corporate performance and an attention to governance.
Gavin Anderson, chief executive of GovernanceMetrics, said his firm studied one-, three- and five-year returns of companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and found that stocks of companies at the top of the firm's ranking outperformed the index in a meaningful way. Those ranked lowest significantly underperformed the index.
In the S.& P. 500, the average decline of a stock for the three years ended March 20, 2003, was 2.3 percent. (The index itself fell much further because it is weighted by capitalization, and large companies that declined significantly had a bigger impact.) But the five companies earning the firm's highest score rose 23.1 percent on average. The top 15 companies averaged total returns of 3.4 percent.
Top-ranked companies also outperformed their peers in measures like return on assets, return on investment and return on capital, he said.
Stocks of the 50 companies with the lowest scores fell 28.2 percent in the last year, on average, and 11.1 percent in the last three years.
GovernanceMetrics opened shop in April 2000; its clients are institutional investors with more than $2 trillion in assets. "One of the reasons we started this is in 2000 is we were looking at the dot-coms and everybody was pointing out the outrageous valuations," Mr. Anderson said. "But in addition, there was no outside independent voice looking out for the interest of shareholders."
To identify good governance citizens, Mr. Anderson's firm takes roughly 600 measures. These include a company's labor practices, environmental activities, workplace safety approach and litigation history. The firm also looks for anti-investor practices, like instituting poison pill provisions to prevent takeovers and keep management entrenched. And it checks for independence among a company's board members, watches for clues that a company is trying to manage its earnings too aggressively and assigns demerits for those that have restated past earnings. Extraordinary charges to earnings that represent 5 percent or more of a company's revenue also hurt a score.
GovernanceMetrics is tough to please. As of March, the firm had identified only five companies with a rating of 10. They are Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company; Johnson Controls, the maker of automotive systems; MBIA Inc., a guarantor of financial products; Sunoco, the oil refiner; and the SLM Corporation, which provides college financing.
It has taken far too long, but investors are finally getting the ammunition they need to judge companies by their actions, not just their words.

HEADLINE: For Wal-Mart, New Orleans Is Hardly the Big Easy 

BYLINE:  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS 

 BODY:
WHEN a local developer announced triumphantly that a new Wal-Mart would rise here on a sandy patch of earth along the Mississippi, it was presented as a good thing, a bit of progress that would bring in much-needed tax dollars and jobs and transformation where the rundown St. Thomas public-housing project once stood.
 But along the way, someone overestimated the willingness of other New Orleanians to accept the advance of Wal-Mart across their turf. And one result has been a foul gumbo of accusations against everyone from the developer, once considered an urban hero, to the federal government, which made the grant that set off the fireworks in the first place. Themes of jealousy and betrayal have sounded over financing that gives the developer and Wal-Mart Stores -- which wants to put up a 200,000-square-foot store plus a parking lot -- unusual benefits. Lawsuits have been filed to block construction on behalf of the environment, the fabric of the city and the rights of the former residents of St. Thomas. 
 The back-and-forth, which began two summers ago, has been so intense and, in many ways, so particular to this place -- the stage version could be called "A Streetcar Named No Thanks" -- that the store is now more than a year behind schedule. 
The struggle here is taking place as many of the country's big retailers, companies like Costco Wholesale and Home Depot as well as Wal-Mart, are reaching beyond their usual locations for growth. After saturating rural areas and edging into the suburbs, they are experimenting with ways to fit large stores into vacant inner-city acreage. It's not an illogical strategy, but as Wal-Mart is finding, the going can be rough.
"Nobody on the side against Wal-Mart is against jobs or against housing or against retail," said Neil Alexander, a photographer who has been a vocal opponent of the store. "What a lot of us are against is poor planning or no planning, and selling the city short to the largest corporation in the world."
Finding dozens of acres of empty land inside any city can be difficult. In New Orleans, close to half the land for the proposed Wal-Mart originally belonged to the housing authority, which received a federal Housing and Urban Development grant through a program known as HOPE VI to replace the aging St. Thomas complex. Its 1,500 apartments, built in the 1930's and 1940's and bulldozed in 2000, once held nearly 2,000 people, most of them African-American and poor.
THE site, near the city's landmark Garden District and a recently revived section of Magazine Street, covers 64 acres, nearly all of which is empty for now.
The original plan was to build a new development in which apartments would be split evenly between the poor and the middle class. The residents of the St. Thomas apartments were moved out and helped to find new housing; many of them expected to move back, their advocates say. Now, a HUD spokeswoman says, there will be 182 public-housing apartments, an additional 272 apartments considered "affordable" and 784 more that would be sold or rented at market rates -- making the original residents of St. Thomas a minor element in the project.
"They have been treated like a crop on the plantation," said Camille J. Strachan, a tireless opponent of the plan, whose law office is two blocks from the edge of the St. Thomas site and whose house is decorated with a large banner that reads: "No Sprawl-Mart."
Wal-Mart became involved at the invitation of the developer, Maurice Pres Kabacoff, whose company, Historic Restoration Inc., is based in New Orleans and has won awards from preservation groups.
He made the store the linchpin of his plan, and to make it work, the St. Thomas project now includes an assortment of public financing arrangements, like $20 million in bonds backed by sales tax collected from Wal-Mart for construction of upscale apartments. The arrangement is known as tax increment financing, or TIF, and New Orleans never had it until this project, said Sidney J. Barthelemy, a former mayor who is now a vice president at Mr. Kabacoff's company.
An additional $28 million in tax-free bonds will be issued by the state Industrial Development Board to cover the costs of building the Wal-Mart, enabling the retailer to borrow money and essentially repay itself, said Trey Langus, another vice president. Finally, a similar bond issue, worth up to $29 million, will finance additional construction of apartments on the site, Ms. Strachan said.
Such largess leaves other business owners in the city irate. "There are huge concessions being made to Wal-Mart, the richest company in the world, that are not being made to other businesses," said Barry Schlaile, who operates a lighting store not far from the site and has tallied the number of stores in the area -- 45 out of 67 -- that he thinks may lose sales to the Wal-Mart.
Michael M. F. Liu, the assistant secretary for public and Indian housing at HUD, said HOPE VI grants -- the acronym stands for Housing Opportunities for People Everywhere -- were intended to combine commercial and residential development. The idea is to bring residents of various incomes together, instead of segregating the poor.
"The commercial aspect is always a key part of the financing," he said. "It is very much a part of the norm."
The grant for the St. Thomas rebuilding was $25 million, but "you needed $30 million before you could build a single house," Mr. Kabacoff said, citing demolition and other expenses. He sought large retailers for the site, approaching Lowe's, Home Depot and Target before he got to Wal-Mart. When its executives said they would do it, "as long as you let us put our grocery store and our regular store there," he said, "I got down on my knees and kissed" the ground on which they stood.
The Wal-Mart does have some local support. The mayor, C. Ray Nagin, has refused to block the plan, and Bart Stapert, a lawyer who represented the St. Thomas tenants during negotiations with the developer, said his clients backed the Wal-Mart as a last resort. "We struck a deal that there would be 240 units on the site and 100 off site," he said. "In exchange for what we thought was a guarantee, we agreed to support the Wal-Mart. Some residents personally supported it because of the jobs. Others said, 'These are not the greatest jobs in the world.' " The guarantee evaporated, he said, while the Wal-Mart plan remains.
At Wal-Mart, the urge to conquer the New Orleans interior represents a revision of the strategy -- a kind of commerce oblige -- that has made the 41-year-old discount chain the dominant force in retail. "The company started in rural areas and the reason was that people in those areas did not have access to goods that other people did," said Daphne Moore, a community-affairs liaison for the company, which calculates that the St. Thomas store will do $100 million in sales a year, based on current sales at other Wal-Marts nearby. "It's also true in these urban areas. The individuals who choose to live in the core of the city don't have the same access to goods and services that their counterparts in the suburbs and small towns have. It's an interesting shift."
Design changes have been made to accommodate local concerns. Instead of the usual blue and gray exterior, the store will use a brick-colored material, Mr. Langus said. The parking lot, for 850 cars, will be shaded by trees; one street has been widened, although some people in the area say they remain concerned about traffic buildup.
Among them is Don Everard, a soft-spoken former St. Thomas resident who is the director of Hope House, a nonprofit social services agency in the neighborhood. He moved out of St. Thomas several years ago, into a small house nearby. He expects that more traffic will roll past his front porch because of the Wal-Mart, but he says other people in the area are excited about shopping there. "Most people are viewing the Wal-Mart as inevitable," he said. "My biggest gripe about the whole deal is the use of the $20 million TIF to pay for market-rate housing when the city has such deep trouble finding money for low-income housing. As a political decision, that is sounfair."
Some opponents criticize HUD as failing to oversee the development. The Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center, an advocacy group, filed a complaint this month with HUD that accuses the agency of mishandling the relocation of the St. Thomas residents. The agency is reviewing the complaint.
"IN the beginning, the residents had representation," said Stacy Seicshnaydre, the center's general counsel. "But as time went on, their voices became more and more drowned out." She said she was concerned about the small number of former St. Thomas residents who would be able to move back, citing the lower-than-expected number of apartments as well as criteria that prospective tenants must meet -- like incomes within certain levels.
Mr. Liu, the HUD official, said the HOPE VI program, which began in 1992, was left out of the current federal budget. The agency will assess the program in response to complaints, including the ones echoing from New Orleans. "We are sensitive to those who have raised questions about the number of replacement units," he said, adding that current projects had higher requirements. "This program was only authorized for 10 years, and we think it's a reasonable time to look at all these issues."
Mrs. Moore of Wal-Mart said the company had not built stores as part of any other HOPE VI development. "We're not really involved in HOPE VI except to the extent that the tax revenue from our store will help fund that project," she said. "We are not the social engineers on this one. We're simply a means to an end."
But the company has opened stores in other cities, including Baltimore and Philadelphia. A plan to open a store in Dallas was rejected not long ago by the City Council.
Mr. Langus, who oversees the project for Historic Restoration and is Mr. Kabacoff's son-in-law, called the HOPE VI program "atrocious," adding: "I have no interest in doing another one."
In the initial HOPE VI plan for St. Thomas, small-scale stores would be built to employ neighborhood residents. Like the initial goals for the apartment mix, those stores are no longer part of the plan. "Pretty much everything has been flipped over," said Mr. Everard at the Hope House social services agency. "You almost expect developers to behave in a way that lets them make as much money as they can. But you also expect there will be people who will be watchful for the other side."
Merchants in and around the site are quivering at the prospect of having to battle Wal-Mart. Mrs. Moore, however, says the customers are not the same, and Mr. Kabacoff contends that people who travel to the Wal-Mart will also shop at smaller stores nearby. 
The biggest losers are likely to be grocery stores. Already, a carefully negotiated plan -- mediated by Mr. Kabacoff -- to build an Albertson's supermarket in another historic neighborhood fell apart after the Wal-Mart plan became known.
Controversies have arisen in other parts of the country over the perception of favors granted to large retailers. The Institute for Justice, a nonprofit group in Washington, has defended business owners whose property was seized by local governments through what is known as the power of eminent domain, and then turned over for large chain stores. "It is an all-too-common tactic," said Dana Berliner, a senior lawyer for the institute, adding that the practice has escalated in recent years.
At Costco, a shareholder called on the company this year to avoid building on such land. But James D. Sinegal, the chief executive of Costco, said, "In many instances, when we look for land, these are the only places we can find it in these communities." 
To Mr. Kabacoff, the future -- not to mention the present -- is obvious. "You've got to pay attention to the real world," he said. "Americans have decided they want discount shopping in volume, and that's the real world."
Others say that the vitality of New Orleans depends on its various charms, and that large-scale retail isn't one of them. "I can't imagine someone coming to New Orleans and having to see a Wal-Mart right there," said Val Dansereau, the president of the Preservation Resource Center, a nonprofit group that has led the charge against the store. "New Orleans is known for its old buildings and its quaintness."
AFTER simmering so long, the situation in New Orleans has begun to attract attention outside the city. John P. Relman, a Washington lawyer who specializes in civil-rights issues, says he has been trying to get detailed information about the size of the apartments that will be available for low-income housing. He said he might sue on behalf of the former St. Thomas residents if the developer did not provide him with that information, adding that he was worried that families with children might be shut out of the new complex..
"It's this, far more than any historic or development concerns, that is likely to shut this down," Mr. Relman said. "It is basically race rearing its ugly head again in a Southern city."
Others see racial discrimination elsewhere. Mr. Barthelemy, the former mayor, said he thought complaints about the Wal-Mart were merely a subterfuge for derailing the whole development. "There are some in the area who don't want affordable housing," he said, "because it means minorities coming back into the area, and a lot of minorities do shop at Wal-Mart."
William E. Borah, a lawyer active in preservation issues, said his concern was what he called the broken promise to the people of the development. "It is a disgrace," he said. "It's supposed to be about public housing. But now it's about for-profit housing, and they are throwing in a Wal-Mart. It's a scandal of national proportions."
Mr. Kabacoff says he and his Wal-Mart aren't going anywhere. "We never quit," he declared. "That's what the preservationists didn't realize."
"This is going to work," he added. "And it's going to be a wonderful model for the country."

HEADLINE: The World; 
Building Democracy Is Not a Science

BYLINE:  By TOM ZELLER 

 BODY:
WE ask a lot of history. We believe that if we study it closely enough, we can avoid repeating it. We also believe that its lessons are comprehensible enough to give us analogies to fit any unfolding tragedy or triumph. So as Iraq presumably gets a fresh start under Jay Garner, the retired lieutenant general appointed by the Bush administration to oversee postwar reconstruction, analysts of every kind wonder if there can ever be anything new under the desert sun.
 As General Garner began his tour of the country last week, unrest simmered. More Arabs were expelled from their homes by returning Kurds, who had themselves been expelled by Saddam Hussein. Small skirmishes and standoffs unfolded in various places, many Shiites continued calls for American forces to leave, and at least one Iraqi appointed himself mayor of Baghdad. 
 Yet the United States remained optimistic about the chances for for a successful (and relatively swift) democratic transition. "I have a good feeling about this," General Garner said on Wednesday. "I'm sort of a glass-half-full guy, not a glass-half-empty guy."
The two most frequently cited historical object lessons in support of this confidence have been postwar Germany and Japan. 
"There was a time when many said that the cultures of Japan and Germany were incapable of sustaining democratic values," President Bush said in February. "Well, they were wrong. Some say the same of Iraq today. They are mistaken."
But even if one accepts those countries as apt comparisons (and there are plenty who do not), it is difficult to find other examples. Germany and Japan are among only four success stories highlighted in an otherwise rather gloomy study compiled in January by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a nonpartisan research group, which found that in most instances where the United States used its military to help oust a government, democracy rarely followed.
Typically, this is attributed to conditions on the ground before American forces ever arrive. A strong national identity, previous experience with constitutional government and a reasonably experienced bureaucracy are good predictors of success. But Iraq, the study suggests, is unpromising, given its ethnic and religious divisions and its lack of an administrative structure.
"I think we're going to have big trouble ahead," said Minxin Pei, an author of the paper and a senior associate at the endowment specializing in democracy. "Germany and Japan were developed, modern societies, but developing countries like Iraq have so many internal characteristics that aren't conducive to that kind of change. High levels of inequality, a distribution of power that favors entrenched elites, a weak national identity -- the odds are against you even in the first 10 years."
Other success stories -- Panama after the ouster of Manuel Noriega's government in 1989 and Grenada after the American invasion in 1983 -- were far less complex. Ethnic rivalries were few, and something akin to a constitutional system was being restored rather than invented.
Multinational or United Nations-backed efforts, like that which toppled the Taliban in Afghanistan, also tend to fare better than those in which the United States goes it alone. But even in Afghanistan, the jury is still out. The government of Hamid Karzai really only controls Kabul and its environs, and newly active elements of the Taliban, apparently able to reorganize in the borderlands of Pakistan, have mounted fresh attacks, perhaps with the help of officials who are supposed to be loyal to Mr. Karzai.
To some analysts, that is evidence that success or failure at democracy may well depend less on the particulars of the country and more on the commitment of the liberators.
"The tragedy is that we haven't been very grown up in our relationships along these lines," said Joseph Montville, director of the preventive diplomacy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. "We can get ourselves together enough to bomb somebody -- that's not a problem. But after we've bombed, everything usually becomes kind of a mess. The military doesn't want to play policeman, and the administration doesn't want to get involved in nation-building."
That has been true in Haiti, for example, after various American interventions. And in the Dominican Republic, real change came only long after American forces left. 
So far in Iraq, the indication is that the investment -- of time, of money, of skill -- will be more substantial. Basic services are slowly being restored, oil is beginning to flow again and security is expanding, even as discontent seems to brew. 
"We have just liberated Iraq," General Garner said last week amid Shiite protests and some calls for an Islamic state. "People are demonstrating. That's the first part of freedom. The right to disagree. Things are getting better, no matter what people are saying."
If history provides precious few examples to bear out such optimism, it may well be important to keep looking forward instead.
"I like the sounds we're hearing out of Garner," Mr. Montville said. "There are plenty of pessimists around, and this is a place where a self-fulfilling negative prophecy can really work."

(Agence France-Presse) Chart: "Regime Change by the Numbers"The Polity IV Project, based at the University of Maryland, has tracked the relative autocracy or democracy of dozens of states since the 1970's. An analysis by the Carnegie Endowment used the data to study those countries where the United States intervened to support or force a change of government over the last 100 years. Key to the chartsThe 15 examples below all involved the use of American ground forces to support or bring about a change in a country's leadership, with subsequent U.S. involvement in the resulting government.

Fever line indicates level of democracy over the period 1900-2000 where data is available). A score of eight or above is considered democratic. A negative 10 is full autocracy. Multilateral Interventions Interim government: LocalHaiti1994-96 -- U.N. efforts to negotiate a return of the overthrown (and freely elected) president fail. U.S.-led "Operation Uphold Democracy" restores the government, but a subsequent administration begins rule by decree.

Interim government: U.S. ControlledJapan1945-52 -- After Japans WWII surrender to the Allies, the country is placed under temporary U.S. military control. A new constitution is written, the emperor is relegated to symbolic status, and democracy blooms. Unilateral American Interventions Interim government: LocalPanama1989 -- U.S. launches Operation Just Cause to oust (and arrest) a drugrunning military dictator and restore the elected president. Hints of corruption did not derail subsequent free elections and economic growth. Grenada1983 -- A 1979 coup ends with a 1983 coup, prompting the U.S. to launch an invasion and return power to the governor-general until 1984. Free parliamentary elections have followed. (Not included in Polity 2000 analysis.) Cambodia1970-73 -- The U.S. supports overthrow of monarchy by anti-Communist military general, but power is soon lost to murderousKhmer Rouge. Fitful attempts at democratic order have come more recently, but peace is fragile. South Vietnam1964-73 -- Following what some believe is a U.S.- sanctioned coup, a series of short-lived military regimes come and go, as do U.S. troops in a failed war against the Communist North, which has ruled the country since 1975. Dominican Rep.1965-66 -- A revolution installs a provisional president, but military forces begin bombing runs in response. The U.S. intervenes and installs a provisional president, but democratic stability takes another 30 years. Dominican Rep.1916-24 -- A coup leads the U.S. to intervene and establish a military government and restore order, but a subsequent guerrilla war eventually drives a U.S. withdrawal and a 31-year dictatorship followed. Cuba1917-22 -- Skirmishes after fraudulent elections prompt the U.S. at the time involved in World War I to send troops and restore order. A stable if less-than democratic order lasts for more than three decades before crumbling. Haiti1915-34 -- The assassination of the Haitian president in 1915 prompts the U.S., now administering the Panama Canal, to stabilize the country (as well as the shipping routes). A revamped constitution doesn't hold for long. Nicaragua1909-27 -- The U.S. provides support to forces rebelling against the sitting president, and intervenes militarily to prevent further instability. For most of the next 20 years, U.S. troops remain and unsuccessfully battle guerrillas. Cuba1906-09 -- Acting with the authority granted under a previous occupation, the U.S. intervenes to restore order after a 1906 rebellion. A U.S.- administered provisional government runs Cuba until 1909. Panama1903-36 -- The U.S. supports Panamas revolutionaries in its struggle for independence from Colombia, which was not forthcoming with a canal treaty. The U.S intervened in Panamanian affairs until 1936, when it agrees to keep its troops inside the Canal Zone.

 Token Resistance

Q. I know that the M.T.A. is planning to phase out the subway token by early May, but what about the Roosevelt Island tram, which uses tokens and is not equipped to handle MetroCards?

A. While tokens will be no longer accepted in the subways on May 4, they will still be rolling along on Roosevelt Island.
 The state agency in charge of Roosevelt Island, and by extension the tramway, the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation, has no plans to stop using tokens. Like a subway or bus ride, a tram ride will go up in price to $2 from $1.50 on May 4.
 Turnstiles for the tram, which can be boarded at 59th Street and Second Avenue in Manhattan, accept only New York subway tokens. Rather than reconfigure the turnstiles, the Operating Corporation recently bought 7,000 of the doughnut-shaped tokens from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Combined with tokens already in circulation, they should be enough to keep tram passengers moving through the turnstiles for the foreseeable future, even if tokens are taken out of circulation by souvenir hunters.
 Oddly, a token will be worth $2 in the tram station but only $1.50 on city buses, where they can be used until the end of the year if the rider adds 50 cents. 
 Built by the New York State Urban Development Corporation, the tram was opened in May 1976 as a temporary means of getting Roosevelt Islanders to Manhattan and back. Even though the island got a subway station in 1989, the tram has remained popular and well known outside the city. In "Kongfrontation," a popular ride that closed last year at Universal Studios theme park in Florida, the tram was attacked daily by the big gorilla himself. The tram also played a prominent role in last summer's blockbuster movie "Spider-Man."

Bayside's Boxer

Q. I commute from the Long Island Rail Road station in Bayside, Queens, into Manhattan and noticed that sculptured into support beams are images of a train and what appears to be a boxer's arm. The train I can understand, but the boxer?

A. The curious-looking engraving, which appears as an amputated limb wearing a boxing glove raised in victory, was added during a 1999 renovation to the station and is a tribute to the world champion boxer, and Bayside resident, James J. (Gentleman Jim) Corbett.
 Corbett was born in San Francisco in 1866 and has been called the father of modern boxing because of his use of jabs, hooks, and footwork instead of the brute strength many of his contemporaries relied on. He won the world heavyweight title from John L. Sullivan in 1892, despite Sullivan's 32-pound advantage, with a knockout in the 21st round. He was the first man to win the title wearing gloves, as required under the Marquis of Queensbury Rules. Corbett lost his title in 1897 to Bob Fitzsimmons.
 In 1902, Corbett bought a house at the corner of Bayside Boulevard and 221st Street with his wife, Jessie. He retired from boxing a year later and went on to writing, lecturing and vaudeville, and even took a stab at the new medium of motion pictures.
 By the time Corbett died in 1933, he had become a fixture in Bayside. Bayside Boulevard was renamed Corbett Road, and in 1971 the Bayside Historical Society marked Corbett's home with a plaque.

Water Vu, Ideal for Cpl

Q. I read that two Central Park swans died last week. I'm wondering how swans came to be in the park and where they go in the winter?

A. The two swans (cause of death yet to be determined) came to the Lake in Central Park of their own volition and settled there sometime in the early 90's.
 Winters here are usually temperate enough that the swans hunker down and ride them out. Swans mate for life and the Parks Department fully expects a new pair of swans to snap up the desirable lake home, among the few neighborhood residents not to pay a finder's fee. ED BOLAND Jr.

HEADLINE: Everyone Knows This Is Somewhere 

BYLINE:  By GLYN MAXWELL; Glyn Maxwell is a poet and playwright from Hertfordshire, England. He is also poetry editor of The New Republic. His most recent collection is "The Nerve" (Houghton Mifflin).

 BODY:
SINCE I came to live in New York in September, I've been trying to remember what my future was like. When I was 9 or 10 in my quiet English suburb, I had a little slide show of mental images that represented what was to come. As with any boy of that age, there were glimpses of a racetrack, a winner's rostrum, heroic orations or, later, bright lights and record-album covers; but all these faded in time.
 It didn't matter what I ended up good at -- there had to be something -- what mattered was where I'd be when it happened. 
 There was one constant backdrop. I didn't appear in this image as a sports hero or film star or writer or any kind of functioning grown-up, but as my child self, seated calmly by a tall window against a vista of countless high buildings brightly lighted at night. 
 It was a glimpse of loftiness and space and strangeness, distant from the familiar so it couldn't be London, that dreary glow 20 miles south, but it was also an image of welcome, of warmth. The vision was without anxiety. I belonged where I was. I seem to be here now, with my child self right beside me.
 There are thousands of reasons to be here now, in New York. Mine are not economic, political, social oreven professional. I can write here -- silence isn't hard for poets to find -- but that's not the reason. Some-thing about this city, some blue-print or template, seems to have existed in my mind for as long as pretty much anything. 
 If life begins with dreams and ends with memories, perhaps there comes a point in the middle where the two impulses are somehow balanced and neutralized, where the past is a manageable parade, and the future has been fed enough of our daylight to be sated for a while. One is confronted, faced, nailed, by the urgency of the present. These are the moments when we are doing what we dreamed of, or what we know we'll remember always, yet they are moments with no time for looking forward or back. 
 Coming from the place I do, in the time it takes, with the language I speak, at the middle age I am, New York simply feels like the present: glittering, breathtaking, with its back to the past, its horizons heaped too high to see far. Something very young in me -- or do I mean old? -- always wanted to spend the present with people from everywhere, at a great meeting place in the center of the world.
 But it's beyond childish; it's a deeper layer than that. The only comparison that springs to mind is with an earlier visitor, King Kong, who, in his terrible panic, for a still, bewitching second of film, believes the cityscape is the rocky peaks of his island home. It reminds him of simplicity; it reminds him of safety; he sets off for the summit. And of course that sad, flickering denouement was the first glimpse of this metropolis that millions of 20th-century children had on my own little native island. New York City reminds this primate, too, of something far away, something lost and found, some improbable yet necessary next step. 
 Wonder is a privilege of any new arrival, but perhaps an Englishman's view has special resonance. We are the old country, the reason for flight, the bygone: our journey to America is a journey in time and space and the English language. 
 We've been the controlling parent, the rejected patriarch, we've been proud and ashamed, the forgotten ancestor -- we, not the Scots or Irish, but the English, are perhaps as invisible as foreigners get. And as the land stretches out dizzyingly westward, our own language drifts from us, its quaintnesses all ours now, and New York, the gate through which the European mind passes to contemplate America, is a day away, a constant tomorrow, a handhold on the future. When we English move here and speak to those we miss, they are five hours ahead; we have five more hours to sunset, and they might just be the five hours when we make our mark on the earth
 Drawing maps of imaginary cities was a persistent habit of my childhood. I didn't realize I was sketching the future. Each place had a strongly defined sense of the compass: my inhabitants could never mistake east for west. Each city was within reach of the sea and not so far from the wilderness. There were zones of threat and zones of comfort. There was often a scary wood in the middle, because a scary wood was called for and it needed to be handy.
 Streets were straight and logically numbered, so I could remember where I'd put things. Where the streets curved and had curious names was the place to go at night, south, to the labyrinth, where you weren't to be found, to the regions where the plot advanced, where the face was glimpsed or the secret told. By morning you'd be back on the grid, telling your east from west, gazing for miles in sunlight down the endless avenues. And each new city was bigger than the last, packed more densely, built higher, crayoned in more fiercely, as if the wax itself could lift from the page's horizon, be a landscape in a third dimension.
 Perhaps what draws me to New York is that, alone among the great cities, it looks created, not over politely differing centuries by emperors or kings or presidents or committees, but somehow all at once on a rainy afternoon. And not so much created as made up, by a child open-mouthed and drooling with concentration, numbering the streets to save time for later, carefully using a ruler for the avenues, marking a big green oblong in the center, dotting it with lollipop trees and calling it Central Park. Calling the middle of town Midtown; the river to the east East River; and the island to the east, the one that disappears off the page, Long Island.
 And then, when it all looks too neat and systematic, fetching an eraser and swiping a fat diagonal white path down the island starting to color the place in with names that tell stories: Hell's Kitchen, the Battery, the meatpacking district. Names that recall other worlds: Little Italy, Chinatown. Making childish compounds full of secret meaning: SoHo, NoLIta, TriBeCa, Dumbo.
 The more I know about New York, the more its form really does seem a blossoming of childlike dreams and fantasies: the Flatiron Building, Coney Island, Brooklyn Bridge, the Chrysler Building, the Great White Way, the Empire State Building, still lit up nightly as a little boy would have it, always in color. All those inanely grinning picnickers poised on iron girders, kids given superpowers for one day only. At Thanksgiving, the town is roped off to make way for gigantic toys, as if it is these that have to be thanked all dreams. But then nightmares come too, jealous, puerile, sickened by the breadth and dignity of humanity prospering.
 When the new map is colored and completed and named, what is left to its maker to do but to lower himself gently into its streets, and people the place with stories? And to walk the blocks of New York is to experience a warm anonymity. I've lived in the kingdom of the smirk and the chuckle, I've passed through the town of the sneer and the village of the snarl -- we all have -- but I'm at home now, in the city of the shrug. It's not the shrug of not caring, but the shrug of having cared, the shrug of acceptance that so many have come, so many have suffered, so much has happened. The Maker, the real one, would be greeted with a shrug here -- He probably is, every day, somewhere near Port Authority -- yet, speaking as a child who made up cities and wanted to live in them, I suspect that would be absolutely fine by Him.

What's the Cost of Freedom? What About Slavery?

BYLINE:  By ERIKA KINETZ 

 BODY:
New Yorkers wear their freedom proudly. And somewhere beneath the myth of self-determination that drives this city is the memory that New York was a free state, not a slave state. Cotton doesn't grow very well here, after all, and the city was home to noted antislavery figures like Sojourner Truth and Henry Ward Beecher. But in fact, freedom came hard and late to New York's African-Americans. 
 Emancipation, which began in the North right after the American Revolution, didn't make it to New York until 1827, as agreed 10 years before by the governor and Legislature. Money, it turns out, runs deeper than liberalism. 
"Slavery was enormously profitable," said Ira Berlin, a professor of history at the University of Maryland and an expert in slavery. "People don't want to give away their property." In the middle of the 18th century, he said, slaves constituted half the city's labor force. 
 Now the City Council, which typically wields its power over the urban minutiae of newspaper boxes and litter removal, has taken a precipitous leap into this messy history. Last November, 13 council members introduced a bill that would require companies doing business with the city to "search their past and reveal whether they have engaged in or profited from slavery." And in January 2002, Councilman Charles Barron introduced a resolution calling for the creation of a city-financed commission to research the history of slavery in New York and recommend reparations payments. 
 "You have to repair a historical wrong," Mr. Barron said. "Compensation is due."
 While the moves coincide with a percolating national interest in the issue of slavery reparations, they are a hard sell in the current economic climate. Neither has won broad support in the Council. 
 "Even in flush times, there are always more demands for city resources than are available," said Doug Turetsky, a spokesman for the Independent Budget Office.
 Moreover, some minority business people say the proposals are misguided. 
 "I think the city and the mayor in particular should put in place a legitimate and forceful minority business contracting program," said John F. Robinson, the president of the National Minority Business Council. "That will benefit the people who are here now, not the ones who were here before." 
 Currently, 30 percent of New York City businesses are classified as minority- or women-owned, butthey win only a fraction of the city's $9 billion annual procurement budget.
 The Bloomberg administration has taken some small steps to change that, like holding networking events and streamlining the certification process for minority and women-owned businesses. ERIKA KINETZ

HEADLINE: URBAN TACTICS; 
Where Late the Sweet Rackets Twanged

BYLINE:  By TARA BAHRAMPOUR 

 BODY:
IN the history of New York, certain businesses have behaved like the tide, rising when conditions are right, receding when the city outgrows them. Horse stables, which once flourished in Manhattan, are now reduced to a handful. Vaudeville theaters died away after the movies moved in. Now, indoor tennis faces a similar fate.
 Two clubs in Long Island City, Queens, may close soon, and at least three indoor tennis facilities in Manhattan and one in Queens have recently closed, including the 10 Wall Street Racquet Club, which shut its doors last year because the piers it rested on were deteriorating and because the city wanted to make way for the planned downtown branch of the Guggenheim Museum. (The museum plan was later canceled.) 
 Sadly for tennis lovers, indoor tennis has a perverse habit of flourishing when the city's fortunes are down, and floundering when the city does well. In the 1970's and early 1980's, when New York was in a slump, indoor tennis courts proliferated, peaking at around 150 across the city, said Skip Hartman, who runs three tennis clubs in the city and has been in the business for 33 years. But in the past decade, as property values have boomed, the idea of using prime real estate to swat a ball around has come to seem fiscally unwise if not outright decadent. And so, in a city that plays host to one of the top international competitions, the United States Open, the number of indoor courts has dwindled to around half of what it was in the 1970's.
 Even in good times, tennis could never be called a big moneymaker. Although clubs charge members up to $3,000 a year plus per-session fees that can add up to much more than that, the revenue at even a large club is nothing compared with what residential or office towers can bring in. 
 "It's really a low-yielding business, and it takes a lot of land," Mr. Hartman said.
 He added that this was not the first time indoor tennis had fallen victim to real estate concerns. "All over the city, there have been courts that have gradually given way to more lucrative uses of the land," he said, noting that since the first commercial court in the city opened in 1911, most indoor tennis facilities have sprung up as temporary taxpayer businesses, earning enough to pay real estate taxes and lasting only until property owners decided to build. 
 In January, Con Edison paid a little over $30 million for Crosstown Tennis's site and adjacent properties at West 31st Street near Fifth Avenue, where it plans to build an electrical substation. And a receptionist at the 19-court East River Tennis Club, a Long Island City Club that attracts many Manhattan players, said earlier this month that it would close at the end of April. A spokesman for the club declined to confirm that last week, and said the club had no comment.
 So where are players to go? 
 Even on the city's fringes, where property is cheaper, not many plots are large enough to build new tennis courts. And while there are still plenty of outdoor courts, many owned by the Parks Department and less likely to be influenced by financial vicissitudes, not all players will brave New York's chilly winters and sweltering summers to play under the open sky. 
 Displaced Manhattanites can still find indoor court space in other boroughs, but they are not always in top shape. At the Parkview Tennis Center in Ditmas Park and the Oceanview Tennis Club in Bensonhurst, indoor facilities in Brooklyn leased by the Parks Department to a private concessionaire, players complain that the courts are neglected, unheated in the winter and littered with debris. They are trying to persuade the city to hire a different concessionaire.
 But other courts outside Manhattan are popular with players. The West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, Queens, the former site of the United States Open, has four types of courts and attracts serious players from around the world.
 So does Tennisport, a Long Island City club that may soon close. The 550-member club has 16 red-clay indoor courts and 13 Har-Tru outdoor courts, with sweeping views of Manhattan and the East River. It has been there 30 years and it owns the land, but it is considered part of Queens West, a 72-acre waterfront project whose plans for residential and commercial buildings include the spot where the tennis club stands. Invoking the right of eminent domain, the state has told the club it must leave the site by July 31. 
 Andrea Botur, vice president of Tennisport and daughter of its founder, hopes the city's fiscal crisis will allow the club to put off its eviction date by at least a year. Even if it closed this year, she said, the state would probably wait until better economic times to develop the land. "There's no reason to take us prematurely," she said.
 David N. Dinkins, a former New York mayor and an avid tennis player who during his time in office pushed for the new Arthur Ashe Stadium in Flushing Meadows, now the site of the United States Open, said he wants to see more outdoor courts replace the indoor ones that are closing. 
 "It's my hope," he said, "because I think that tennis is so good for the general population. It gives youngsters an option besides illegal behavior. I think with some ingenuity, schoolyards and for that matter parking lots -- any place that's flat, I see tennis courts."
 But Chuck Lewis, who has played at Tennisport since it opened, said he had no desire to play on outdoor courts. Instead, he has joined other Tennisport players in writing letters to the Empire State Development Corporation, begging for more time. 
 Mr. Lewis reeled off the names of famous people he had either played with or seen play there, including Robert Redford ("I introduced Bobby to Tennisport"), Liam Neeson ("He's not good enough" for Mr. Lewis to play with) and Sean Connery ("His legs were like tree trunks").
 But famous players aside, Mr. Lewis said, the closing would threaten ordinary longtime friendships. 
 "There are guys that you see every Saturday and Sunday," he said. "There's a lot of camaraderie there, and chances are we would not see them anymore."

Identity Theft, Potential and Real

BYLINE:  Compiled by Jan M. Rosen 

 BODY:
Americans are increasingly worried about identity theft, a survey conducted this month for Star Systems, a unit of Concord EFS Inc., has found.
 Star, which operates an electronic payments network, reported that 51 percent of the respondents said they were concerned about identity theft -- a higher number than were worried about corporate fraud and unemployment, at 47 percent each. 
In the survey, 5.6 percent said they had been victims of identity theft, which is defined as a wholesale takeover of another person's identity, including name, date of birth, Social Security number and personal financial information like bank account numbers, for fraudulent financial gain. 
 Despite debates about privacy, the survey found that almost three-fourths of the respondents were willing to provide a government-issued photo identification card for certain financial transactions, and that 92 percent wanted new federal laws to address security concerns.
One way for identity thieves to get information is by posing as job recruiters, especially online. Frank Abagnale Jr., who wrote "Catch Me if You Can," about his former life as a con man, and is now a spokesman for PrivacyGuard, advised job seekers not to give out information unrelated to work, like marital status or eye color, over the phone or online.
He also told job seekers not to disclose Social Security numbers until they had a face-to-face meeting with a prospective employer or were sure they were dealing with a reputable company. Do not provide credit card or bank account numbers, he added: "After all, you are not negotiating to buy their company."

HEADLINE: New York's Hale and Hearty Tribe 

BYLINE:  By MICHELLE O'DONNELL 

 BODY:
ORANGE alerts. Dire city budget cuts. An economy in the tank. 
 Anyone who handles the daily stress of New York must have been surprised to hear the latest news. 
 The city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene reported last week that since 1991, the life expectancy of residents has increased by more than five years, to a historically high average of 77.6 years. That level surpasses the national average by six months. (Women in New York live an average of 80.2 years, men 74.5.) 
Such news, in a city whose homicide rate once inspired "N.Y.P.D. Blue" and "Law and Order," can be oddly disconcerting to those who take civic pride from weathering urban hardship.
All segments of the population showed gains. African-American men, for example, now live an average of nine years longer than they did in 1990 (largely because of decreases in the city's homicide rate and H.I.V.-related deaths), although they are still likely to die about six years younger than white men.
The study also found that the city's infant mortality rate continued to decline in 2001, with 6.1 deaths per 1,000 live births, down from 6.7 deaths in 2000 and 11.4 in 1991.
What accounts for this good news? 
Certainly, more police officers on the street and advances in AIDS treatment help. 
But New Yorkers, being New Yorkers, also put their own spin on it. New York life is challenging, but eventually provides its reward in the twilight years, said Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University. 
He listed a trifecta of New York characteristics that contribute to a long life expectancy: density (you're surrounded by neighbors, and medical research proves that people with friends live longer), an elaborate system of public and private health care (your doctor is probably just down the block) and extensive mass transit (you're safer in a subway than in a car).
All in all, more bragging rights for a city that brags all the time.

HEADLINE: California Recall Effort Clouds Davis's Future 

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY 

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, April 25 

 BODY:
What if?
 That is the question on many minds here as statewide opinion polls show Gov. Gray Davis's popularity at an all-time low, and as a fledgling effort to recall him from office enters a pivotal stage. 
 Mr. Davis was re-elected just five months ago, but many voters seem to have little loyalty to him. Though a recent poll showed that most people would not go so far as to sign the petitions now circulating to put his recall on the ballot, nearly half said they would vote to remove him in a recall election. 
That has raised all sorts of speculation about Mr. Davis's future, and forced Democrats to strategize about how they would keep a Republican out of the Statehouse in the event -- considered improbable but not impossible -- of a recall election.
"Once it gets on the ballot, it is a purely ingenious piece of mischief," said Bruce Cain, a professor of political science at the University of California at Berkeley. "And it could happen anywhere. If it were to succeed here, I think it would be widely copied. It is one of those innovations that the rest of the country could come to regret."
Much of the conjecture about Mr. Davis stems from the fact that under state law, the names of his potential successors would also appear on a recall ballot. If voters chose to oust him, they would select the new governor at the same time from a field that could be wide open, since state law allows anyone from a recognized political party who pays a filing fee and collects 65 signatures to place his or her name on a recall ballot.
Mr. Davis is one of many governors across the country who are watching their popularity decline -- in large part, pollsters say, because voters blame them for the sour economy and large service cuts. 
A recent poll by the Field Research Corporation found that Mr. Davis's 24 percent approval rating -- the lowest for any California governor in the 55 years Field has been conducting these surveys -- was directly linked to the state's economic woes, which include a $35 billion budget deficit over two years. Other governors with falling poll numbers include Gary Locke of Washington, James E. McGreevey of New Jersey and George E. Pataki of New York.
"In good times, governors get more credit than they deserve; in bad times, the reverse is true," Mr. Davis said in an interview this week. "It is not fun. The numbers decline, but it is part of the process during difficult economic times."
The recall effort is led by a small group of antitax crusaders and conservative Republicans, including a former adviser to Bill Simon, Mr. Davis's Republican opponent last November. But its appeal is potentially broader. 
Peter Camejo, the Green Party nominee for governor in November, said he or some other representative of a "broad progressive coalition" would probably enter the fray, if only to keep a right-wing Republican from getting the job. The California Green Party is to decide next month whether it will officially support the recall effort.
"I don't think Governor Davis is missing what is happening here," Mr. Camejo said. "Once the recall is on the ballot, he will see how fast his support in the Democratic Party disappears."
Though the Green Party is small, its support of Governor Davis's recall would carry symbolic significance by broadening his opposition to include the left. Patrick H. Caddell, a pollster for President Jimmy Carter and a self-described liberal populist, said he was also weighing whether to support the recall, which he said had both Democrats and Republicans running scared.
"It is not only Gray Davis opposing it, but the Republican political establishment is against it, because they understand the danger it represents," Mr. Caddell said. "If Gray Davis can go, anybody can go."
Officially, no Democrat has come forward as a possible replacement candidate, in part because the recall drive has yet to gain the kind of momentum that would pose a serious challenge to the governor. In California's 31 previous gubernatorial recall attempts since 1936, including one against Mr. Davis four years ago by anti-immigration groups, none qualified for a vote.
As of this week, proponents had gathered about 60,000 of the nearly 900,000 signatures needed by September to get the measure on the ballot, said Ted Costa, an antitax advocate who is one of the recall effort's leaders. Mr. Costa said his campaign had managed to raise just $200,000 toward the estimated $1 million to $2 million needed to hire professional signature gatherers and conduct a statewide direct-mail campaign.
So far, the recall effort has been largely centered on drumming up support on the Internet and conservative talk radio shows, efforts Mr. Costa said were not enough.
But the movement got a boost this week when Representative Darrell Issa, a Republican from Southern California, expressed his support for removing Mr. Davis and offered himself as a replacement candidate.
Mr. Issa, who ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in 1998, said in an interview that he would not bankroll the recall forces, but would devote time and energy to getting others to support them. Mr. Costa described Mr. Issa's involvement as a potential breakthrough.
"There are others out there always talking about helping," Mr. Costa said. "Now that he has jumped, I think everybody should jump." Mr. Costa said he was now setting his sights on attracting the interest of the actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican who finished second among six possible Davis replacements in the recent Field poll.
Most Democrats were publicly dismissive of Mr. Issa's role and of the recall effort's chances of success. But behind the scenes, some were said to be quietly jockeying for advantage should the recall effort pick up steam. Party officials acknowledged that there was some "worst-case" planning under way.
"Of course there is, but I am not at liberty to talk about it," said Art Torres, chairman of the state Democratic Party. "All my efforts are getting the petitions not signed."
Most conjecture has focused on three of the state's most notable Democratic office holders: Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, Attorney General Bill Lockyer and Treasurer Phil Angelides. All have said they oppose the recall, but their movements are being carefully scrutinized inside and outside the party.
Last week, when Mr. Lockyer left his wedding reception to announce the results of the DNA tests on the body of Laci Peterson, the missing woman from Modesto, some Democrats speculated that he was trying to grab the spotlight with the recall in mind.
"It is funny how history is written in hindsight," said Nathan Barankin, Mr. Lockyer's communications director. "He is not doing anything different today than he was doing four years ago: trying to do his job really well."
In the interview, Mr. Davis said he would not speculate on whether some Democrats might be interested in his job. But he criticized the recall drive as a waste of money and an effort by his opponents to "take endless bites at the apple." He pledged to fight it vigorously if necessary. "If the recall gets serious, we'll get serious," he said.
Others in the Davis camp have been sending more direct signals to fellow Democrats, suggesting that any collusion in the recall drive would be tantamount to political treason. "Let's assume the recall qualifies; whoever takes his place is going to be dead politically," said Gary South, a longtime political adviser to Mr. Davis. "That person is going to be seen as an illegitimate usurper who staged a coup d'etat."
Mr. Davis has another, perhaps greater advantage working for him: his job is regarded as political poison by many people in both major parties, given the $35 billion deficit and the choices ahead.
"You have to ask yourself, 'Do you really want to take the helm of the ship at this point?' " said Deborah M. Pacyna, communications director for Mr. Bustamante.

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: RECONSTRUCTION; 
American Contractors Prepare to Begin the Rebuilding of Iraq

BYLINE:  By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
Two specialized vessels essential for the repair and expansion of the only deep-water port in Iraq are expected to start work tomorrow, the first visible evidence of the Bechtel Group's work as the lead contractor for government-financed reconstruction there.
 Reopening the port, at Umm Qasr, and the channel which links it with the Persian Gulf at the southern tip of Iraq, was the top priority set in the reconstruction contract, which could reach $680 million, awarded to Bechtel on April 17 by the United States Agency for International Development. 
 A survey ship, which uses electronic sensors to map underwater terrain, and a barge-mounted dredging machine were both in the region last week and sent cruising toward Iraq, said Michael G. Kidder, a spokesman for Bechtel in San Francisco.
The survey ship arrived at the port Friday evening, but rough weather delayed the barge's arrival. It is still expected to arrive by Monday, Mr. Kidder said. Once divers remove mines and other dangerous obstacles, the survey ship will begin analyzing the channel bed to guide the dredging work, he explained. 
Formerly a big shipping site for Iraq, the port has fallen into disrepair during the long period of trade sanctions that followed the Persian Gulf war of 1991. In better days, as many as 3,000 Iraqis worked at the port, which now employs barely 150. But besides its potential role in southern Iraq's economy, the port is also a critical entryway for food and reconstruction supplies that can only be economically and efficiently delivered by ship. 
The restoration of electric power, especially in shell-battered Baghdad, is another top priority for Bechtel. A small fact-finding team was at work in the capital city last week to identify immediate needs and find necessary materials. Already, a number of emergency power generators, each capable of providing temporary service to a midsize office building or a small neighborhood, have been obtained in the region and are en route to Baghdad, Mr. Kidder said.
So far, the work Bechtel is undertaking has required only its own resources, which now include a team of about two-dozen senior Bechtel engineers who are waiting in Kuwait City for safety training and military permission to proceed to Baghdad and other parts of Iraq.
But Mr. Kidder said that the company, which won the capital construction contract through a controversial invitation-only bidding process limited to American companies, has received "literally thousands of calls and e-mails worldwide" from companies interested in working as subcontractors in Iraq. He urged any company interested in the Iraqi work to register on the company's Web site, bechtel.com.
Bechtel also plans informational meetings for potential subcontractors. One of the first will be this week in London, where business and political leaders have been sharply critical of the United States decision to limit the bidding to American companies. The Bush administration has said the limitation was required by the need for speed and security clearances, but the exclusion drew fire from other members of the alliance in the war in Iraq.
Ellen Yount, the public affairs director for the Agency for International Development, said that Bechtel had not been specifically instructed by the agency to try to recruit subcontractors in London or in other allied countries.
"They did that on their own," Ms. Yount said. "But Bechtel is not unfamiliar with the political terrain in which they are dealing, and they were well aware of the questions that were raised."
At least one other big Southern California contractor is demonstrating the same political awareness. On Thursday, the Fluor Corporation, based in Aliso Viejo, Calif., announced that it had formed a joint venture with Amec P.L.C., a large engineering and construction company in Britain, to seek future contracts from the Army Corps of Engineers to rebuild Iraq's oil industry.
The joint venture, which is 51-percent owned by Fluor, will be bidding against some other well-connected rivals -- including Halliburton, where Vice President Dick Cheney was chief executive from 1995 until 2000. Fluor and Amec already have joint ventures in South Korea, the Philippines, Angola and Canada.
As Bechtel moves gradually into the physical rebuilding of Iraq, the aid agency is preparing to seek bidders for two additional contracts that will be important to the country's economic recovery.
The first is a contract to restore Iraq's economic governance, including its central bank, finance ministry and money distribution procedures. The agency hopes to be ready to invite bids this week, Ms. Yount said.
"It is a huge contract, but there are still discussions under way about whether it should be one contract or several," she said.
The second contract, for monitoring reconstruction work, may also be put to bid as two separate proposals, one to monitor the physical construction and the other to monitor nonconstruction work like educational reform and public health services.
There are indications that the aid agency may assign the first task to another government bureau, most likely the Army Corps of Engineers.
In any case, the official responsible for monitoring the aid agency's activities in Iraq, its inspector general, Everett L. Mosley, is planning to open an office in Baghdad with an eight-member team that would include auditors and investigators.
In an interview on Friday, Mr. Mosley said the office, which would be his seventh abroad, is required by the sheer heft of the agency's role in Iraq. "By the time it's all in place, this will one of the largest operations we have," Mr. Mosley said.
Mr. Mosley emphasized that his task is limited to monitoring the agency's own work in Iraq, not that of its major contractors like Bechtel. Other construction integrity specialists have questioned why the aid agency has not already designated an independent monitoring firm to ensure that the huge amount of work being planned in Iraq is done without fraud, waste or abuse.
That was the approach that New York City and the Federal Emergency Management Agency took in the clean-up work at ground zero in Manhattan after the attacks on the World Trade Center. The difficulties in Iraq, where the additional risks of terrorist infiltration and money laundering confront contractors in the region, make the prompt engagement of an experienced monitor even more important, said Thomas D. Thacher 2nd, whose company served as an anticorruption monitor at ground zero for FEMA and the city.

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: DIPLOMACY; 
Divided but Worried, Iraq's Neighbors Confer

BYLINE:  By SUSAN SACHS 

DATELINE: CAIRO, April 25 

 BODY:
With varying degrees of dread, Iraq's neighbors are coming to grips with a new Middle East that is dominated as never before by the United States.
 The leaders of these nations found themselves sidelined as mere observers during the war. So they have scrambled in the past two weeks to contain, as well as to accommodate, the expanded American military and political presence on their doorsteps. 
 Arab officials and their counterparts in Turkey and Iran, in a series of consultations and meetings, have sought to keep American attention focused on Iraq and to reassert their own roles in regional affairs. 
To that end, they rallied recently to exert intense pressure on Syria to moderate its policies. That helped defuse the tensions caused by the Bush administration's accusations that Syria was harboring fugitives from the deposed Iraqi government.
At the same time, Egypt emphasized its own importance as a regional go-between when it intervened this week to resolve a conflict between Palestinian leaders that could have derailed efforts to restart peace negotiations with Israel.
But Iraq's neighbors also find themselves even more divided than before in confronting American supremacy in the region and more at odds with their own populations. 
During the war, for example, many Arab governments effectively encouraged rampant public hostility to the United States by staying silent as their newspapers and television stations confidently reported that American forces deliberately killed Iraqi civilians and looted museums.
"They have pushed themselves into a blind alley," said a Cairo-based diplomat from one of the regional powers. "They've created a huge public that is very hostile to the United States and believes that America is promoting core values that are in conflict with their own."
The war also exposed the deep rift between the rich Persian Gulf nations, which were already hosts to the American military, and the rest of the Arab world.
It upset the traditional alliance between the United States and Turkey, where the five-month-old government proved unable to get political backing for helping the American war effort. At the same time, the position of Israel, the pivot of much of the region's politics, has been strengthened by the elimination of Saddam Hussein's government and the installation of an American interim administration in Iraq.
"It's a totally new game, and it's difficult to foresee all its dimensions," said Muhammad Sid Ahmed, a veteran political commentator in Egypt. He predicted that traditional American allies might find themselves usurped as regional players, especially as mediators in the Arab-Israeli conflict, because the United States will be preoccupied with Iraq.
"America has obtained enormous power by succeeding so easily in Iraq," Mr. Sid Ahmed said. But other countries might make it difficult for the United States' friends in the region, like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, because "a newcomer has come to occupy that privileged place."
The larger countries in the region are still feeling their way as they try to decode American intentions. Faced with angry publics that oppose even a short-term American occupation of Iraq, they have tried to present themselves as a loyal opposition, ready to work with the United States but not to submit to it.
A meeting of Iraq's neighbors this month in Saudi Arabia produced a consensus position that called for a speedy withdrawal of American and British forces from Iraq and a central role for the United Nations in rebuilding Iraq's economic and political life. 
But even that position has started to wilt as Iraq's neighbors begin to worry publicly that untamed ethnic and religious conflicts in Iraq could overrun its borders. 
In the view of many diplomats and officials, the region's leaders are torn between their desire to see the United States go and their fear that Iraq may be too volatile to be left to its own devices any time soon.
That ambivalence has begun to appear in Arab news reports after weeks of condemnation of any American administration of Iraq. 
"Should they decide to leave the Middle East, the Americans would simply lick their wounds, learn new lessons, change their views on many issues and get on with life, as they have done before in other theaters," said Wael Mirza, a political analyst writing today in the Saudi daily newspaper Al Watan. 
"The people who will have to pick up the pieces," he warned, "are the Arabs and Muslims whose region will be racked by conflicts, civil wars and ethnic strife."
Many countries are especially concerned about the shape of a post-Hussein Iraqi leadership that may develop if American attention flags.
While the Bush administration talks of bringing democracy and representative government to Iraq, for example, many of its moderate allies in the region fear that real democracy would bring well-organized Islamic militant groups like the Muslim Brotherhood to power. 
The Brotherhood constitutes the main political opposition to the Jordanian and Egyptian governments, which have tried to suppress it over the years. Even in Turkey, where the five-month-old Islamist government has ties to the group, the powerful army would be likely to regard with hostility any Iraqi government based on religious affiliation. 
There is evidence that the Muslim Brotherhood is already active in Baghdad, where it played a role in organizing a huge anti-American demonstration this month, and the group's supporters in Cairo are already predicting that it will play a major role in Iraqi politics.
"The Muslim Brothers were in Iraq before the American invasion," said Montasser al-Zayat, a Cairo lawyer with close ties to the organization. "Now they are spreading. People fear the influence of the United States and will see the Brothers as their savior."
Turkey has also made it clear that it would not tolerate another effort by Iraqi Kurds to assert political control over the northern cities of Kirkuk and Mosul, as the two main Kurdish groups tried to do in the last days of the war before American forces established control.
Income from the oil wells in those cities could encourage thoughts of independence, not only among Iraq's long-suffering Kurds but also among restive Turkish Kurds living along the border. Syria, with a fast-growing Kurdish population of its own, would also fear any arrangement that would make an autonomous Kurdish region economically viable. 
Governments in the gulf region also worry about the political potential of Shiite Muslims, who constitute the majority of Iraq's population but have historically been denied any power by the largely urban Sunni minority.
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Oman have substantial numbers of Shiites who have started to claim broader political rights and might be energized by a new Shiite political role in Iraq. The war also created provocative opportunities for Iran, historically mistrusted by the Arab states, to expand its influence through support of some Iraqi Shiites.
The new situation in the region has also raised expectations of change among Arabs outside Iraq. 
"For sure you'll find some political and economic reform in the Arab world," said Ibrahim Nafie, the editor of the influential Egyptian newspaper Al Ahram. "In the end, that's the message that the region should learn from what happened in Iraq."

HEADLINE: The Pataki Enigma: Great Leader? Master Politician?; 
The Governor Controls His Agenda And Avoids Thorny Positions

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 26 

 BODY:
It is a matter of debate among elected officials and political scientists whether Gov. George E. Pataki is a great leader or merely a great politician. Ultimately it is a question historians will answer. But what is the difference, anyway? 
 Over the last week, with his approval rating dropping and editorial writers of various stripes questioning his abilities, Mr. Pataki worked hard to project the image of a strong leader, threatening to veto any income tax increase the Legislature might enact and announcing an ambitious schedule for rebuilding Lower Manhattan. 
 No one doubts the governor's political skills. Though a Republican, he has pulled off the rare political feat of being elected three times in a Democratic state. He came into office as a little known conservative in 1994, promising tax cuts, tougher criminal penalties and welfare reform. Last year, he won a third term as a friend of labor while trumpeting his support for increased spending on schools and medical care. 
He did this without benefit of any of the characteristics often found in successful politicians, includingclassic good looks, a wealthy family or an abundance of charisma. Neither is Mr. Pataki an inspirational speaker, in stark contrast to his predecessor, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, whose oratory could move listeners to laughter or tears. Nor does he possess the powerful personal charm of former Gov. Hugh L. Carey, nor the pedigree and panache of Nelson A. Rockefeller.
In short, Mr. Pataki's critics say, he lacks star quality. Yet in his own low-key, dogged and stubborn way he has been an effective governor. Mr. Pataki can rightly claim credit for cutting taxes and government regulation. He has abolished parole for violent felons, overhauled welfare, bought thousands of acres of parkland and persuaded several large companies to either stay in New York or locate new plants here. He has also signed a gay rights bill, a hate-crimes law and tough gun-control legislation.
Although they acknowledge this record of achievement, Mr. Pataki's political opponents still question whether he has what it takes to be one of the great governors of New York, like his idol, Theodore Roosevelt. 
Some legislators complain he is too disengaged from the day-to-day business of governing and lawmaking. For example, he often walks away from budget talks if he thinks they are going nowhere. Others assert that he is highhanded and imperious in his approach to governing, sometimes acting as if the Legislature was nothing but an annoyance. "He fades in and out of intensity in bringing things about," says the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat who has battled with Mr. Pataki for years. "Many times he refuses to recognize that there are separate players -- the Legislature and the governor's office -- that each of them have their own constitutional role and in many instances the governor's office is not supreme."
Mr. Pataki would not be interviewed for this article, but friends and aides said he was often misunderstood. He defines leadership as getting results rather than taking credit or gaining fame, they said. "He thinks a leader is someone who is effective," an ex-aide said. "Style is less important than results."
The governor also viscerally dislikes personal attacks and the public battles that many politicians thrive on. He hates reporters' attempts to set an agenda by forcing him to respond to a comment by another politician or to a critical report about his administration before he has had time to formulate his views. 
Thus, he limits his exposure to reporters, giving few news conferences and preferring brief interviews after ceremonial events. "He's not going to let someone else drive his policies or decisions," the former aide said. "He will not be pushed to take premature decisions."
Because of that, at times Mr. Pataki comes off as evasive, and neither he nor his administration has developed a cult of personality as did his hero Teddy Roosevelt, champion of the "bully pulpit," whom the newspapers often made larger than life. 
"The principle characteristic of his leadership is a disengagement," Robert Wesser, a professor emeritus of history at the State University of New York in Albany, said of Mr. Pataki. "He seems to shy away from the public. He does not like reporters. He doesn't like to be questioned."
Mr. Pataki's determination to control the agenda helps explain why he seldom strays from a scripted message and often avoids taking a public position on a thorny issue until he can no longer avoid it. He chooses battles carefully, generally staking out one or two goals yearly. 
"He's very focused," said Gerald Benjamin, a professor of political science at the State University of New York in New Paltz. "He decides on his priorities and he stays on message and that works for him."
This year, Mr. Pataki's refrain has been his opposition to "job-killing taxes," by which he means the personal income tax and business taxes, even if means drastically cutting aid to schools and hospitals. 
Some critics say the governor is trying to establish his conservative credentials so he can be a possible running mate for President Bush next year. Mr. Pataki denies this.
The governor argues that an income tax increase would hurt the economy, but friends and aides say he also thinks that one of his greatest achievements is cutting the state's income tax rate and therefore is also protecting his legacy. So he has stuck to his guns on the issue for months even as polls show his approval rating dropping and strong public support for a state tax increase.
The unions that supported him last year have run attack ads against him, arguing that a temporary tax on the wealthy would be better than gutting education and health care programs. Even the Republicans who control the Senate have broken with him. 
"You make tough decisions, because you are proud to be a leader, and I am," the governor said in a rare display of ego this week. "And I don't know how many times I've said over the course of the last eight years, 'The polls go up, the polls go down,' they do. And that in no way affects my view as to what is right for the state or the type of leadership this state needs."
Mr. Pataki reserves this gritty, never-give-an-inch attitude for only a few major issues, however. On other issues, he is quite willing to modify his views -- and modulate their expression -- for political expediency. 
For months, he took pains not to take a public position on whether the Indian Point nuclear power plant should be closed, though the idea has been popular in Westchester County since 9/11. Only recently did he reveal to a reporter that he opposed shutting it down because, he said, it would be decommissioned someday anyway and in the meantime the fuel rods and spent fuel would remain where they were. "We can't just throw a switch and say Indian Point is going to be safe," he said.
Similarly, he played down the scope of the state's fiscal problems until he won re-election last November. In January, he revealed that the state faced an $11.5 billion gap, and suggested deep cuts that would hurt the very union members who had helped him win a third term -- teachers and health care workers.
Mr. Pataki insists he sees no hypocrisy in this turn of events, explaining that he must cut spending to preserve low tax rates, which will spur the economy, which, in turn, will fill the state coffers and let him restore the programs. But some observers contend that the way he avoided talking about the looming crisis during the election is evidence that while obviously a brilliant politician Mr. Pataki may lack something as a leader.
The size of the deficit would have been smaller this year had he begun slowing spending last year, budget experts said. "He was very effective in the last campaign in evading the major issues and as a result no one had any idea what he would do in a third term," Professor Wesser said.
The governor's response to the crisis has left some political scientists baffled as well. In the mid-1970's, Governor Carey saved the city from bankruptcy by bringing together union leaders, business leaders and politicians to formulate a plan for bailing out New York. It was a very public campaign.
"What Carey did sospectacularly was to engage the entire labor and business community on behalf of the city," said Peter Slocum, an author of "From Rocky to Pataki," a history of the four governors. "Carey's very much in Macy's front window."
Mr. Pataki has responded to the current crisis, which differs from the one in the 1970's because this time the state is also hurting financially, with far less public action and debate than Mr. Carey used. So far, he has made no concrete proposals about how the state will help the city, except to say he will not support a commuter tax. On the state level, he has proposed borrowing $4 billion, raising fees by $1.4 billion and cutting a further $4 billion in spending. 
He has given a series of speeches in which he laid out the case for not raising taxes, but polls suggest they did not move public opinion much. And he has been losing the debate inside the Legislature, as Senate Republicans have decided it is better to raise state taxes than to be blamed for an increase in local school taxes. 
One reason is Mr. Pataki's uncompromising style in dealing with lawmakers and their leaders, which has not won him many allies. He did not approve a pay raise for lawmakers, for instance, unless they agreed to a new law that withheld their paychecks every day that a budget was late, engendering ill will. "I get the clear sense he dislikes the Legislature -- he almost disdains it," said Jeffrey Stonecash, a political consultant and political science professor at Syracuse University. "I don't think he's done a very good job of hiding that."
With a somewhat unhappy Legislature, it remains to be seen if Mr. Pataki's cautious and close-to-the-vest leadership will prevail this year, as he tries to steer the state and city through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. 
His handling of the crisis may end up being the answer to whether Mr. Pataki is simply a good politician or truly a great leader. It may also end up being his public legacy.

HEADLINE: Jobless and Hopeless, Many Quit the Labor Force 

BYLINE:  By MONICA DAVEY with DAVID LEONHARDT 

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH, April 26 

 BODY:
Worn down by job searches that have stretched on for months, demoralized by disappointing offers or outright rejections, some unemployed people have simply stopped the search. 
 As the nation enters a third year of difficult economic times, these unemployed -- from factory workers to investment bankers -- have dropped out of the labor force and entered the invisible ranks of people not counted in the unemployment rate. 
 Some are going back to school or getting new job training. Others have chosen to stay home with young children or aging parents and to rely on their spouse's salary, at least for now. Still others are plainly waiting: living on their government benefits and hoping that the economy will get better in a while. 
After working 25 years in the heat of the factory line at a steel plant here, Bill Jacobs accepted his layoff calmly last year. He thought he could find some other job working with his hands, or go back to the line once business picked up.
But eight months passed, and nothing came. Not long ago, he signed up for nursing school.
"There aren't any jobs, just not any," Mr. Jacobs said. "I had been waiting it out. I thought there was a strong possibility that I'd get recalled to the plant, or I'd get something else, anything that paid at least $10 an hour. But it turns out there is nothing. It's a dead-end street."
Mr. Jacobs, who is 50 and raising four children on his own, said he had "absolutely never" planned to change careers. But he heard about the possibility of a government grant to pay for his schooling and decided he would prefer to spend the next two years tucked safely inside a classroom rather than continue to fight for a job in an economy he describes as "heading nowhere."
Over the last two years, the portion of Americans in the labor force -- those who are either working or actively looking for work -- has fallen 0.9 percentage points to 66.2 percent, the largest drop in almost 40 years. 
More than 74.5 million adults were considered outside of the labor force last month, up more than 4 million since March 2001, the Department of Labor says. They are people who fall outside the government's definitions of either employed or unemployed: they do not hold jobs, but they also have not gone out seeking work within the past month.
This group includes retirees and parents who have been home taking care of their children for years, but the surge of dropouts suggests that the jobless rate -- which was 5.8 percent last month, roughly where it has been for the past year -- offers an artificially sanguine picture of the labor market, many economists say.
"People use the unemployment rate as some kind of gauge of the health of the economy," said Robert H. Topel, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago. But because of the number of people now outside of the labor force, he said, "the unemployment rate does not give you the same kind of information it did in the 1970's or 1960's." 
Job counselors say the trigger for the exodus is easy to see. Among those people whom the government considered unemployed, the average length of time out of work has been rising over the past two years, to 18 weeks last month from about 13 weeks two years ago.
In Pittsburgh, members of one support group for unemployed people have been jobless for so long that the group recently started holding separate conversations during their regular Monday night sessions just for those who have been out of work more than six months. More than 20 people usually show up.
"This is what we see today -- job searches that can take 6 to 12 months," said Charlie Beck, who has directed the support group, Priority Two, for the past 20 years. "By six months, people really start to doubt themselves, and they start to doubt they're ever going to find anything. They start to doubt everything."
Uncertainty crept slowly into Mike Guido's outlook. But after the third "really good opportunity" slipped away, "it started to dawn on me," Mr. Guido said. "It just wasn't happening. It wasn't going to." 
By then, nine months had passed since he lost his job as an engineer developing products for a Pittsburgh company that makes industrial and safety equipment. He had held the job for nearly 20 years and made an annual salary close to $50,000.
Mr. Guido asked around about academic jobs but was told his undergraduate and master's degrees would not be enough for an engineering post. At one point, a university professor told him he probably needed a doctorate. 
"That was kind of a pivotal moment for me," Mr. Guido said. "Right then, I started thinking, well, wait, what if I got a Ph.D?"
So last fall, Mr. Guido, 48, moved his books into a study desk off the long corridors of the University of Pittsburgh's engineering building and began learning again how to pull all-nighters for classes like Advanced Elasticity. 
Mr. Guido worries about money. He has a 10-year-old daughter, a mortgage in the suburbs, a shrinking retirement account and newly opened student loans for what is likely to take him three years.
"This is definitely not easy financially," he said. "The economy has sideswiped me."
Still, Mr. Guido said he was pleased to be back in school, learning about things he cares about, and relieved to be on campus, far away from the struggle to find a job. There are others like him on campus: a soon-to-be furloughed US Airways pilot in the law school, a laid-off former sales manager seeking his M.B.A. 
"It's funny," Mr. Guido said, "how the moves you make because you think you have no choice can turn out to be good."
Most people dropping out of the labor force are men, the Labor Department says, and the number of black men not looking for work has risen particularly sharply. Teenagers who were drawn into the labor force in large numbers in the late 1990's have also left it recently at a rapid pace. But frustration with the economy has cut across almost every demographic group. For the first time since the 1960's, the proportion of women in the labor force has declined over an extended period. In March, 60.6 percent of women 20 and older were in the labor force, down from 61 percent in March 2001. 
Amy Richards, 30, was one of the big beneficiaries of the 1990's economy, making $150,000 a year in San Francisco working for MatchLogic, an Internet advertising company. When the company went bankrupt a year and a half ago, however, Ms. Richards was left with a pile of worthless stock options and no job. 
She moved to Boulder, Colo., where expenses are lower, and she has been living off her savings. "I decided to take a break, kind of get a breather," she said.
But the job market in Boulder is even worse than in San Francisco, Ms. Richards said. In fact, the Boulder metropolitan area is one of a few dozen where the surge in people considered to be labor-force dropouts helped decrease the unemployment rate last year even as jobs were disappearing, says Economy.com, a research firm in West Chester, Pa. 
Others include Binghamton, N.Y.; Bloomington, Ind.; Florence, Ala.; Spokane, Wash; and Wilmington, Del.
Ms. Richards and a few friends from her old company are trying to start a business selling software to companies that charge for access to their Web sites. They are looking for their first investor and first customers. "I don't know if there's another point in my life to pursue a dream and possibly come up empty-handed," she said. "We may not get our company funded. It's a horrible capital market. I may have to end up doing something else."
Other people are still dangling, ever so precariously, on the edge of the labor market. They are still filing job applications, but they acknowledge that their searches have slowed over the months, and even years. Many have begun to talk about giving up on the traditional job path. The question is where they will go. 
Some talk of starting up businesses. Others say they may have to settle for anything soon, even a low-wage, part-time job anywhere.
Back here, in Pittsburgh, Janis M. Leftridge has spent her career first as social worker, then as a human resources manager, handling other peoples' problems. She is 56, and a whiz at designing business cards, writing resumes and leading discussions in her networking group about how to get a job. But her last job with the Bayer Corporation, where she made $76,000 a year, ended in 2001. 
And in the two years since, she has emptied her savings. Last week, she was cheerily sorting out how she would pay the May rent.
"I'll figure something out, it'll happen," Ms. Leftridge said. "But it's funny how, when you're younger, you don't think you'll find yourself in a position like this. I didn't think I'd ever be here."
These days, she is spending less time sending out resumes. Instead, she said, she has begun to research a new option: working from her home, selling items like health supplements, dishwashing liquid and coffee beans through a direct marketing company. The company has also told her she can make money by recruiting other sellers, she said. She carries the company's glossy brochures with her. And she is trying some of the supplements herself.
"I've been trying to find a conventional job for two years," Ms. Leftridge said. "Finally, I'm thinking about doing a home-based business. I don't see it as giving up. I see it as expanding my search. I ought to be able to make some money this way, and start building back my savings, in a situation where I'm not hostage to any company's budget, to any budget."

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: RUMSFELD; 
Defense Chief Begins a Visit To Review Mideast Stability

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT with THOM SHANKER 

DATELINE: SHANNON, Ireland, April 26 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld today began a trip that officials said was intended to take him to Afghanistan, Iraq and other Persian Gulf countries to review America's military and postwar reconstruction commitments.
 In Kabul, the Afghan capital, he was expected to meet with the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, and with Lt. Gen. Daniel K. McNeill, the commander of American forces in Afghanistan. They were to discuss the shift from combat operations to the maintenance of stability. 
 His itinerary became uncertain, however, when his party was forced by plane trouble to stop over in Ireland tonight.
Mr. Rumsfeld's planned trip to Afghanistan would come as Taliban and Qaeda fighters continue to initiate cross-border raids from their hideouts in Pakistan. Foreign aid workers have been the targets of near daily attacks. On Friday, two American soldiers were killed and four others wounded in a brazen daytime clash along the eastern border.
Speaking to reporters today, Mr. Rumsfeld said he would meet military and civilian officials in Iraq as well as Afghanistan about the prospects for stabilization.
Meanwhile, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz said today that he expected a sizable turnout of Iraqi leaders at a second round of talks on Monday about the future of Iraq. He said he anticipated "scores more" than the 75 Iraqis who joined the first session organized by the United States in Nasiriya earlier this month. After Monday's session, in Baghdad, many of the participants are expected to fan out across Iraq to discuss issues of building a new government and to seek regional leaders to join the effort.
For the first time, six well-known Iraqi opposition leaders have been invited to attend the planning sessions convened by Jay Garner, the retired lieutenant general who is serving as Iraq's administrator.
These officials, who led groups opposed to the Saddam Hussein government within Iraq and abroad, were not invited to Nasiriya for fear of giving the impression that the United States was anointing a new leadership.
Pentagon officials said that among those invited to the Monday session were Massoud Barzani, the Kurdish Democratic Party leader; Jalal Talabani, of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan; Ahmad Chalabi, head of the Iraqi National Congress; Muhammad Bakr al-Hakim of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq; Ayad Alawi, head of the Iraqi National Accord; and Adnan Pachachi, a former Iraqi foreign minister.
It remained unknown who would attend, and members of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, a Shiite group based in Iran, have warned they would boycott.
Mr. Wolfowitz said the themes expected to be covered include economic reforms, electoral laws, private property rights and the freedoms of speech, assembly and religion.
In a telephone interview today, Mr. Wolfowitz said the United States was interested in moving "as rapidly as possible" to send a message that a new Iraqi government would soon be in operation. He said accelerating these actions would also prevent an "unhealthy dependence" on the foreign presence within Iraq.
Even so, Mr. Wolfowitz said, the process of building a new Iraqi government would be "deliberate enough to establish as broad a base as we can."
He predicted at least "one or two more national-level meetings" like Monday's session to further discussions on creating an interim authority leading to a new government.
Mr. Rumsfeld, in a brief interview aboard his jet before the landing at Shannon, said that American interrogators had begun questioning Tariq Aziz, Mr. Hussein's deputy prime minister, perhaps the best-known leader of the ousted Iraqi government to have been captured. But Mr. Rumsfeld said it was too soon to tell whether Mr. Aziz would cooperate with the American forces.
Speaking of security in Afghanistan, Mr. Rumsfeld said that the shift from full-fledged combat to establishing stability had been under way for months. In secure parts of the country, several hundred military civil affairs experts have built schools and dug wells, he said. International aid workers are also in the country but many say that threats to security inside Afghanistan prevent them from reaching many needy communities.
At the same time, Mr. Rumsfeld said, more than 11,000 allied forces, including about 8,000 American troops, continue to conduct sweeps and other operations to search for pockets of remaining militants, particularly along the Afghan-Pakistani border. Another 5,500 international peacekeepers are policing Kabul.
"There is still a lot of hard work to do," Mr. Rumsfeld said. "People are being shot at, some killed or wounded."

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: THE HUNT; 
U.S. PLANS TO ADD TO TEAMS IN HUNT FOR IRAQI WEAPONS

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26 

 BODY:
The Bush administration, concerned about the failure to find unconventional weapons in Iraq, is moving to triple the size of the team searching for scientists and for incriminating lethal materials. Some officials are even saying that they are losing hope of finding actual weapons.
 Administration officials, some speaking publicly and some on condition of anonymity, insist that they remain entirely confident that evidence of illegal chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs -- as opposed to the weapons themselves -- will accumulate in coming weeks and months, though perhaps slowly. 
 But to step up the pace, a military official said, about 1,000 military and scientific personnel will be added in coming weeks to the team trying to interview Iraqis who may have knowledge of Iraqi weapons programs and looking for evidence. Only 500 are doing this job now, with perhaps 150 actually searching and the rest providing backup and support. 
"A fairly robust organization is going over there," said a military official. "It will also look for evidence of war crimes, terrorism connections, missing P.O.W.'s -- anything it can find that will help get to the weapons of mass destruction."
Some officials say they think the United States should react more positively to the demand by France that United Nations inspectors certify that Iraq is free of unconventional weapons before economic penalties against the country are permanently lifted. Many United Nations members favor a return to Iraq by Hans Blix as an inspection leader as soon as the country is secure. Others say that a couple of hundred more experts, with or without Mr. Blix, cannot hurt and could actually help.
But theirs is a decidedly minority view. Even the State Department, which advocated trying to find the weapons using United Nations inspectors last fall, has no tolerance for asking those inspectors to return.
"Forget it," one official said. "On principle, we don't want the United Nations running around Iraq."
One official, discussing the American plans, said that despite some polls indicating that Americans do not care very much whether the weapons are found, White House officials are pressing the United States Central Command to step up the search for them because of worldwide skepticism that the main American rationale for the war was not proving to be true. "There's just a lot of pressure coming from the White House on this," an administration official said. "But Centcom is pushing back because they have other things to do -- like securing the country and guarding its antiquities."
Administration officials and experts say that evidence of Iraq's illegal weapons programs will most likely consist of items like empty shells for chemical or biological weapons, labs that could be used to make arms and so-called precursor chemicals that could be converted to weapons use but could also be used for fertilizers, pesticides and the like.
"People are realizing that Saddam Hussein may not have stored the weapons themselves, in part because when you put chemical or biological agents into weapons, they deteriorate very rapidly," an administration official said. He and others said that if the weapons themselves -- the "smoking gun" that has eluded the United States since United Nations inspectors went into Iraq last fall -- should not turn up, American experts may be forced to base their case for the existence of weapons programs on fragmentary evidence that could be interpreted in different ways.
"The evidence that we do find will be convincing to most experts, but not necessarily to those predisposed to doubt what we say," said an American official.
Another official said: "It may be that the Iraqis poured toxins into the ground, or scoured out their shells, or never filled their shells. There may be weapons, and there may not be."
"But it will be clear," the official continued, referring to weapons of mass destruction by their initials, "that they were pursuing W.M.D. actively."
The increasing possibility of a somewhat ambiguous result on weapons programs has led to a debate in the administration over what to do now that President Bush has decided that there will be no role for the United Nations inspectors in finding or destroying illegal weapons.
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, like some in the administration, has argued that a United Nations team of some sort may be necessary to ratify a conclusion that weapons programs existed. The point, some officials say, would be to convince skeptics that weapons programs were indeed there. "The big concern is credibility," a military official said. "When we say we have found something, are the media sources in the Middle East and other parts of the world going to believe it?"
While it appears that Mr. Blix's team will not be allowed to return soon, some State Department officials say that some kind of United Nations team might be acceptable eventually to help verify incriminating evidence or to destroy it.
"If there were a role for the United Nations on weapons, it would be different from the one they had before," said an administration official. "It's too early to say what their role would be. It's too early to say that there will be no role."
France has threatened to withhold its vote on lifting the permanent sanctions against Iraq until there is some agreement on the role for the United Nations in weapons inspections and destruction. French officials say this is faithful to the United Nations resolutions that were based on a finding that Iraq, in defiance of the world community, had such weapons. "How can we just walk away from what the sanctions were all about?" a French official asked. 
Americans say there is no room for negotiating with the French on lifting sanctions if the issue is United Nations weapons inspectors. They accuse France of having a hidden agenda: ensuring contracts for French companies in an Iraqi reconstruction program paid for with revenues from Iraqi oil exports.
One problem is that American officials who now say they may not find actual weapons have changed their arguments somewhat. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell told the United Nations that the United States had evidence of actual weapons, not just weapons programs.
Indeed, he suggested that some of those weapons were ordered sent into the field before the war. Now there is some doubt about that because some experts say that if there had been intelligence on their deployment, there should have been intelligence to help Americans find them.
"There are still holes in what Iraq reported it had," said Raymond Zilinskas, director of the chemical and biological weapons nonproliferation program at the Monterey Institute of International Studies in California. "The Iraqis always said they destroyed the materials we know they had, but they never offered proof."
But like some experts, Mr. Zilinskas said he doubted that the Iraqis had actually started up weapons programs after a first round of inspections ended in 1998. That does not mean that elements of weapons programs cannot be found now in Iraq, he said, only that the weapons themselves may not be there.
"The British and now the Americans have been changing their tune," said Mr. Zilinskas, who was a weapons inspector in Iraq in the mid-1990's. "Before, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction ready to go. The British said they were on the shelf and could have been deployed within 45 minutes."
But in the face of doubts like those expressed by Mr. Zilinskas, an administration official said: "Remember the quagmire that we were supposed to be in during the war? Don't start saying we're in a quagmire on the weapons. We'll find them."

HEADLINE: THE SARS EPIDEMIC: THE PATH; 
From China's Provinces, a Crafty Germ Breaks Out

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: SHUNDE, China 

 BODY:
An hour south of Guangzhou, the Dongyuan animal market presents endless opportunities for an emerging germ. In hundreds of cramped stalls that stink of blood and guts, wholesale food vendors tend to veritable zoos that will grace Guangdong Province's tables: snakes, chickens, cats, turtles, badgers, frogs. And, in summer, sometimes rats, too.
 They are all stacked in cages one on top of another -- which in turn serve as seats, card tables and dining quarters for the poor migrants who work there. On a recent morning, near stall 17, there were beheaded snakes, disemboweled frogs and feathers flying as a half-alive headless bird was plunked into a basket. 
 If you were a corona virus, like the one that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, known as SARS, it would be easy to move from animals to humans in the kitchens and food stalls of Guangdong, a province notorious for exotic cuisine prepared with freshly killed beasts. 
Indeed, preliminary studies of early SARS victims here in Guangdong have found that an unusually high percentage were in the catering profession -- a tantalizing clue, perhaps, to how a germ that genetically most resembles chicken and rodent viruses has gained the ability to infect thousands of humans.
One of the earliest cases, last December, was a seller of snakes and birds here who died at Shunde's First People's Hospital of severe pneumonia. His wife and a several members of the hospital staff contracted it as well, setting off an outbreak that now sounds eerily familiar. 
"Oh yes, I heard that a guy here died of that pneumonia," said Li Songyu, a 40-year-old wearing a neat tan blouse, as she filleted live frogs and dumped them into a basket. "But it is very safe and sanitary now."
Around the same time in December, Huang Xinchu, a chef, was admitted to the Heyuan People's Hospital, 100 miles to the north, ultimately infecting eight doctors there. On Jan. 2, another desperately ill chef was hospitalized in the city of Zhongshan, south of Shunde, setting off an outbreak. 
But if such early outbreaks present scientific hints about the origin of SARS, they also provide painful political lessons in how a disease that has spread worldwide could have been prevented. 
In early January, alarmed health departments in Shunde, Heyuan and Zhongshan all reported the strange pneumonia clusters to Guangdong provincial authorities, who concluded that they were facing a highly infectious pneumonia caused by a previously unknown agent. 
It is unclear whether that conclusion was passed on by provincial officials to the Ministry of Health in Beijing, or ever reported to international health agencies that might have conducted an early investigation into the problem. Instead, it would be another two and a half months before the strange pneumonia had a name, coined only after an Italian doctor working in Hanoi, Vietnam, alerted the World Health Organization about a similar new pneumonia he was seeing there. 
And it would be three and a half months before China's leaders would admit that their country had an epidemic of SARS. From January through the middle of March, doctors in Asia and Canada were encountering patients carrying a virulent and highly contagious germ, unaware that they were facing potentially lethal infection.
During that period, hundreds of health workers fell ill. During that period, well-meaning doctors were placing SARS patients in ordinary wards -- as they would patients with normal pneumonia -- and those patients were passing the infection on to hundreds of others.

Origins in Food Trade
Scientists have always considered the teeming farms of southern China, where animals and people crowd together as ideal breeding grounds for new human viruses, which can jump between species under such conditions. So it was no surprise in March when the World Health Organization said it believed that SARS originated in Guangdong. 
But when a World Health Organization delegation went to look at data on the earliest SARS cases, they found few farmers among the victims. Instead what jumped out was an odd preponderance of food handlers and chefs -- about 5 percent of the first 900 patients, as opposed to less than 1 percent among patients with normal pneumonia. 
So far, studies are in their early stages and have yielded few specific conclusions. Even if food handlers turn out to be the conduits through which SARS passed from animals to humans, all evidence points to human-to-human transmission now. 
Still, for much of December and January, several small cities around Guangzhou were fighting -- and often winning -- localized battles with the strange pneumonia that would later be named SARS. 
In December, the 32-year-old chef from Heyuan was admitted to the Heyuan People's Hospital, having fallen sick with pneumonia on his job near the boom town of Shenzhen. His family had him transferred to Guangzhou when his condition deteriorated despite medication. But when eight doctors and nurses fell ill with a similar untreatable pneumonia in Heyuan just a few days later, hospital officials became alarmed. 
On Jan. 1, they told the local health department of the cluster of cases. "On Jan. 2, we reported a new infectious disease to the provincial health bureau," said Dr. Ouyang Songhua, deputy chief of the Heyuan Public Health Department. "They immediately sent out an expert team to investigate it, deciding it was a pneumonia of previously unknown cause." 
Word of the disease spread among local doctors so that when another chef with pneumonia arrived at Zhongshan Hospital on Jan. 2, short of breath and feverish, doctors isolated him in intensive care. 
But not soon enough: 13 medical staff members were infected, who in turn infected 15 others in Zhongshan as well. Outbreaks in Shunde, Heyuan and Zhongshan peaked in January, and by February the virus was poised to move on.
By early February, sick and frightened patients from small cities like these were traveling to more advanced hospitals in the provincial capital of Guangzhou -- and that is when the surge of cases really began. 
From Feb. 2 through Feb. 4, a very sick man from Zhongshan made the rounds of emergency rooms in Guangzhou as treatment failed to improve his condition, leaving dozens of health workers infected. At the time, emergency room staff members understood little about the new pneumonia that had been cropping up around the province. At first, they did not isolate the man and were wearing no protective gear. 
Unfortunately, the man was what is now known as a "super-spreader" -- one of a small group of SARS patients who is highly infectious. Dozens of doctors and nurses fell sick at the Zhongshan No. 2 Hospital, where he was finally admitted. 
"He was very sick, but who knew there was something so terrible going around?" said a nurse named Mo at the Zhongshan No. 2 Hospital, recalling the long, frightening quarantine that followed in February, when nurses and doctors spent long weeks living in their units waiting to see if they will start to cough. In China and in much of Asia, more than 30 percent of SARS victims have been hospital workers.

Hong Kong as a Gateway
On Feb. 21, Dr. Liu Jianlun, a 64-year-old lung specialist from the Zhongshan hospital, attended his nephew's wedding in Hong Kong, even though he was running a fever. With what is now known about the disease, health care providers like Dr. Liu with such extensive exposure to SARS would be quarantined and forbidden to travel. But no such guidelines existed then. 
At the Metropole Hotel, where he stayed, he passed SARS on to a number of other guests, including two Canadians, an American businessman en route to Hanoi, a Hong Kong man, and three young women from Singapore. SARS, until then confined to the Chinese mainland, was unleashed on the world.
At the Kwang Wah Hospital in Hong Kong, where Dr. Liu went when his breathing became labored, he advised shocked doctors and nurses of the mystery pneumonia that was ravaging his hometown, insisting that they isolate him behind double panes of glass and don protective gear before his exam. The doctor died several days later; no one at the hospital was infected.
But the grisly story was not shared with other doctors in Hong Kong or the rest of the world. And, with the new corona virus silently breeding in their bodies, the nine guests at the three-star Metropole Hotel dispersed on airplanes like bees carrying a deadly pollen, seeding SARS locally and to far corners of the world. 
The woman from Toronto, Kwan Sui-chu, died in a Toronto hospital on March 5, but not before infecting her son and at least five health workers. Canada now has identified at least 140 SARS cases, 15 fatal.
Johnny Chen, the American businessman, fell ill at a hospital in Hanoi in late February, where he ultimately infected 20 health workers, including Dr. Carlo Urbani, an Italian medical researcher who alerted the W.H.O. about a new type of pneumonia and who also eventually died of the disease. The Hong Kong man was admitted to a general ward at the Prince of Wales Hospital, setting off a huge outbreak. 
The three Singapore women fell ill after going home in late February and were admitted to three hospitals from March 1 to March 3. While two of the women infected no one else, the third, Esther Mok, another super-spreader, set off a chain of infection based at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital, from which over 90 people fell ill, accounting for more than half Singapore's cases. Ms. Mok has recovered, but many members of her family became ill, including her mother and father, who both died. 
On March 14, the World Health Organization formally issued its worldwide alert about the new disease, which it called SARS.

A Focus on Prevention
Since then, countries visited by this new plague have taken increasingly severe steps in order to control further spread of a disease that has eluded many conventional infection barriers. Because the disease remains difficult to treat and has a death rate of 5 to 10 percent, by far the most effective way to deal with it is to stop its spread.
"On an individual level it is relatively low risk, but the proportion of people who have a severe course appears to be quite high," said Rob Breiman, a respiratory expert who has worked for the World Health Organization on the outbreak. "Until we know more about this disease, protecting against exposure is extremely important."
In Canada, for example, even healthy travelers arriving from affected areas are advised to go into a 10-day voluntary quarantine, where they are advised to stay at home, take their temperature frequently and sleep in a separate room from other family members. Ontario alone now has 7,000 people under various types of quarantine. 
But some people have resented the restrictions for what most often proves to be nothing more than a fever from a common cold. On Easter Sunday, one health care worker who had been exposed refused to stay at home, attending church services and a funeral in Toronto. Health officials are now considering a court order to keep him isolated. 
Companies and governments in the West are drastically curtailing travel to SARS-affected regions. Some are also are requiring employees to stay at home for 14 days after visiting SARS-infected areas.
"I'm not too worried about the disease," said Jane Cowells, a resident of New Zealand, as she arrived this week, unmasked, at Beijing Capital Airport. "But the whole thing is a headache, since when I go home I can't go back to work for 10 days." 
In Vietnam, where the epidemic is now under control, officials said they were considering sealing off the entire 800-mile border with China to prevent sick tourists from reintroducing the germ. 
In many Asian countries, airports have come to resemble bioterrorism labs, as nurses in protective gear assess arriving passengers for signs of disease. No place is more vigilant than Singapore.

Singapore's Drastic Steps
"Welcome to Singapore! Are you feeling well today?" chimes a chorus of nurses, their faces covered by masks, their eyes by goggles, their bodies by yellow hospital gowns. Passengers coming from other countries with SARS are guided to pass through a high-tech thermal scanner that picks up temperatures over 100. Masked soldiers are there to escort away those with fever. 
Those who pass muster are given a card warning that they might have been exposed to a deadly disease. Those who are feverish are whisked, without apology, into a 10-day quarantine, and Singapore means business. Video cameras will be installed in the home by a security firm, to make sure patients do not stray. Those few who do are tagged with an electronic wristband that records their movements. 
But even in a small country, placing thousands on quarantine has been a strain. Last Monday, after a case of SARS was discovered in a vendor at Singapore's largest vegetable market, the Ministry of Health ordered all 2,400 food sellers to report for quarantine, up from a total of 467 quarantined before. Since 80 percent of the country's vegetables pass through the Pasir Panjang Market, restaurants were bracing for a shortage of greens. 
"We do what we have to," said Dr. Balaji Sadasivan, a neurosurgeon who is Singapore's minister of state for health. "I don't think we've seen anything like this before and it is a global problem. For now this is a battle that is being fought with the thermometer and quarantine." 
Because of elaborate contact tracing, the Singapore outbreak is by far the best defined in the world. All but 4 of the 188 victims were infected in the hospital or by a family member at home. The four exceptions are a child who got the disease from a classmate with an infected parent, a flight attendant who served an infected doctor from Singapore on a flight in Europe, a cab driver and a vegetable salesman. 
Dr. Sadasivan is unapologetic as he describes the draconian measures his department has adopted to halt the spread of the germ.
When the three young women from the fateful Hong Kong hotel brought SARS to three different hospitals in Singapore in early March, Singapore doctors were unaware of the odd pneumonia that was hospitalizing dozens of patients each day in Guangdong and so admitted them to ordinary wards. If the Chinese had publicized their severe pneumonia in Guangdong, or if the Hong Kong doctors had more aggressively reported the information about Dr. Liu, their response almost certainly would have been different. 
Two of the women did not pass on the germ, but one infected more than 20 people, both patients and hospital workers. One of the nurses she infected also proved to be a super-spreader, passing SARS to 26 others. One of the 26 was a patient in the cardiac intensive care unit whose SARS was not recognized because of many other medical problems. 
Within a month, 90 people at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital had the disease. The Health Ministry dug up an old law that allowed them to impose mandatory quarantines, with fines of 5,000 Singapore dollars for those who disobey. They also essentially closed the 1,000-bed hospital to other patients -- hoping to contain the virus within its walls. 
But it escaped all the same. Some patients who had been at Tan Tock Seng in March contracted the disease and later went to other hospitals when they developed coughs -- setting off secondary outbreaks. One went to Singapore General for an endoscopy and was screened for SARS, but did not run the telltale fever because he was on steroids that suppress the body's response. Ninety people at the hospital were infected.
After this resurgence, the Health Department instituted a policy that every patient at every hospital be considered a potential SARS patient. Nurses are always masked when seeing patients, who are allowed only one visitor a day. Confirmed SARS patients are allowed no visitors at all, though they can talk to friends and family on their cellphones. Nurses may not work on more than one unit and patients may not transfer from hospital to hospital. 
"We used to have a health care system organized for efficiency," said Dr. Sadasivan. "But now our hospitals are organized for SARS prevention." 
Outside of the hospitals, the ministry closed all schools for two weeks to halt potential transmission of the virus. All cab drivers now take their temperatures twice a day. Temperature checks and health questionnaires are standard for those entering buildings. 
At Tan Tock Seng Hospital last Monday, an ambulance arrived carrying a vegetable seller who came under the market quarantine. Although he felt well, the man said he had a fever, and so the driver told him he might have to remain in the hospital. Approaching a cordoned-off screening area, he was resigned, saying, "I don't think I could have the disease, but I know I have to do it."

China's Slow Response
But Singapore's aggressive, open confrontation with a viral enemy is a lesson that some other countries have been slow to learn, especially China, the world's most populous country, where SARS emerged almost half a year ago. 
Although doctors in Guangzhou were well aware of the problem as early as January, information about an epidemic was suppressed for months, and only started dribbling out at the beginning of April, under intense international pressure. 
Only in the last week have numbers begun to emerge elsewhere in China, and the task is still not complete. In Beijing, they already paint an alarming portrait of an epidemic that is likely to dwarf that in either Guangdong or Hong Kong. 
At a news conference on April 10, He Xiong, the deputy director of the Beijing Centers for Disease Control, was still delivering a calm message, endorsing numbers that the government released at the time: that in Beijing there were only 27 SARS cases, so people should not worry. 
"Of course they can travel, we think it's very safe," he said, referring to an approaching national vacation when tens of millions of Chinese would normally be expected to travel. 
But that misinformation only fueled the spread of SARS, as people -- with fevers and coughs -- continued to go to school and work, passing the disease on to others. As the number of cases increased well into the hundreds, the illusion proved hard to maintain in a city with a world-class gossip network that spread rumors of overflowing SARS wards. 
By last weekend, everyone was skeptical, as a smattering of schools and hospitals mysteriously closed. One People's Armed Police hospital in Beijing was closed after five patients were infected. The Zhongguancun No. 1 Primary School closed when a relative of a student got SARS. The Beijing University Institute of Economics put several dozen people on quarantine after a secretary's mother got pneumonia. 
More than a dozen of Beijing's universities had reported suspected cases. At the Economics and Finance University alone, more than a dozen students and faculty members were listed as suspected SARS cases, resulting in the suspension of classes from April 17. 
That day, the main gate of the Northern Construction University was a panic scene, as masked students made arrangements to flee to their hometowns in the wake of suspected SARS cases on campus. "I want to get out of here as soon as possible," said one alarmed student, making calls on her cellphone to borrow money for the trip home. 
Then, last Sunday, the Chinese government fired both the health minister and the mayor of Beijing, and started releasing alarming data that confirmed these fears. As of Friday, there were close to 900 confirmed cases in Beijing, a number that is certain to strain the resources of city hospitals and will make SARS far difficult to control.
But can the lessons of prevention learned in a tiny, authoritarian country like Singapore be applied elsewhere, particularly in a vast, chaotic place like China, with far more cases and a highly mobile population? 
In Singapore, with its aggressive system of identifying and isolating SARS patients, no health care worker has been infected for over three weeks. But in Hong Kong, 2 to 10 doctors and nurses are falling ill each day, in part, health officials there say, because doctors are still not identifying them as SARS victims early enough and are admitting them to ordinary wards.
"There is so much we don't know about this virus -- how long it will be with us? Will it mutate and become more easily transmitted?" Dr. Breiman said. "But it is a little frightening that something which started in one location could spread so quickly around the world."

HEADLINE: Suffolk Rethinks Its Parks' Finances 

BYLINE:  By John Rather 

 BODY:
IN a fundamental policy shift that could sharply increase public financing for Suffolk's parks, a committee created by the County Legislature last year is expected to recommend the creation of a countrywide park district or park authority.
 A park district, the more likely alternative, would make parks a separate or special district on county tax bills, similar to the county police district that now covers Suffolk's five western towns. Municipal park districts are fairly common in the United States but a novelty on Long Island, where there are a handful of such entities, including one in Great Neck.
 The district's budget would have to be approved by the County Legislature, but the taxes to pay for it would appear as a separate line on tax bills sent to property owners. 
 Backers say that public pressure might well insulate a countywide district from budget reductions mandated by the County Legislature. And it could, they say, encourage private giving by park supporters, who could be assured that their donations would go to the parks, and not into the county's general fund.
 An authority, a less likely alternative, would be empowered to adopt budgets and raise taxes without legislative approval and would have greater autonomy.
 Underlying the part district proposal is a belief that county residents who have repeatedly supported land purchases will also support increased spending for parks and parkland management if they are able to see on their tax bills that their tax money actually goes for those purposes.
 For more than a quarter of a century, Suffolk has embraced one initiative after another to buy open space and watershed lands before they vanished into development, paying for it all by raising sales taxes and selling bonds.
 But as county holdings have quadrupled to more than 46,000 acres, seven times larger than Nassau County's parkland and among the largest blocks of county parkland in the East, the parks budget has failed to keep pace, county officials and others say.
 The county's Department of Parks, Recreation and Conservation, which has a budget of about $13.8 million this year, has instead grown smaller, the victim of chronic cutbacks and, more recently, early retirement. Its current staff of about 200 employees is roughly half what it was when land-buying programs began 25 years ago.
 In a sign of how frayed the park system has become, two parks, Sears Bellows in Hampton Bays and the Lake Ronkonkoma county park, have been closed temporarily but will reopen. A long-term closing and a series of other cutbacks were only narrowly averted earlier this month.
 To help make ends meet in the next fiscal year, the county will raise fees for services at some parks. County legislators may also vote as early as this week on a plan that would open parklands to telecommunications equipment including cell towers.
 Money from higher fees and telecommunications leases would go into the county's general fund.
 The countywide park district or park authority could make such measures unnecessary, supporters say. Peter A. Scully, the deputy county executive for administration and the chairman of the County Legislature's parks committee, said an average property owner now pays about $7.20 a year for parks. If that amount were increased to $15 to $20 a year, paid to a park district, he said, dramatic improvements would be possible.
 "At the range you can solve all your problems," he said.
 Mr. Scully, a former Suffolk parks commissioner, said improvements would include more more park services and more staff members; a streamlined fee collection system, possibly using cards similar to credit cards or MetroCards; and even fee reductions to attract more park users.
 In addition, the parks department would be able to increase protection of parklands that have been torn up by motorbikes, all-terrain vehicles and other illegal uses, Mr. Scully and others said.
 Mr. Scully said the committee would submit a report on its findings to the County Legislature and to Robert J. Gaffney, the county executive, next month.
 The report will suggest that the county's board of park trustees could preside over the park district and propose its annual budgets. The trustees are an unpaid advisory group made up of one representative from each of Suffolk's 10 towns, on at-large member who serves as chairman, one member appointed by the county executive and one appointed by the County Legislature's presiding officer.
 John Turner, a member of the committee chaired by Mr. Scully and a Nature Conservancy official on Long Island, said a park district or authority could provide urgently needed ecological management of parklands like the pine barrens, which sit atop a vast supply of underground water.
 "While the county's record for acquiring open space is second to none, the commitment to managing and interpreting those open spaces has been less forthcoming," he said.
 A park district, he added, would "create a new, independent and insulated source of funding for the parks department."
 A sponsor of the bill that created the committee, Ginny Fields, Democrat of Oakdale, said the parks department was treated like "the stepchild of the county" and needed increased support."
 Paul Sabatino, the counsel to the County Legislature, said he questioned whether a park district or authority would increase that support.
 "That's just a gimmick - it doesn't do what they say it will do," he said. "If you go down that road, you lose accountability and control, and you end up with balkanized government."
 In Nassau County, the leader of a park users' group applauded the notion of a Suffolk park district. "We think it's terrific," said Bruce Piel, the chairman of the Park Advocacy and Recreation Council of Nassau. "Once again Suffolk is on the cutting edge."
 Mr. Piel said the council, which represents 138 park user and advocacy groups, planned to formally propose a Nassau County park district and would discuss it with Thomas R. Suozzi, the county executive.
 In March, Mr. Suozzi announced a plan for private operators to run some existing park services and proposed new moneymaking park projects to increase revenues by as much as $10 million by the end of 2005.
 Mr. Piel's group opposes the plan. Mr. Piel said a park district could restore Nassau parks and while keeping them in county hands. He said an elected but unpaid board would govern the district. "We want to put the parks out of the political arena," he said.
 Donald Armstrong of Huntington, the president of the Suffolk Committee for Camping, said his group would favor a park district in Suffolk. The group, which he said had about 6,000 members, represents owners of recreational vehicles who use county park campgrounds.
 Mr. Armstrong said park closings like those that nearly occurred this season would have resulted in losses to local economics because of "the money that campers spend."
 The board of the Nassau-Suffolk Horsemen's Association also supports park districts. Cyla Allison of Northport, a past president and a current board member, said the group represented 2,000 horse riders on Long Island.
 "I would be so willing to chip in another 10 bucks a year if I knew the money were going to parks," said Dr. Allison, who is also a member of the Legislature's committee that will propose a park district or authority in Suffolk.
 Richard Amper, the executive director of the Long Island Pine Barrens Society in Riverhead, said the large Suffolk parkland holdings was proof of public support for land and watershed programs. "The stewardship component is a good problem to have," he said. "If we didn't have the land, we wouldn't have the problem."
 But he said opening parks to cellular towers would be poor steward-ship. "This is visual clutter of the worst sort," he said. "When people need to escape from suburban sprawl they go to the parks for their natural beauty and aesthetics, not to see cell towers."
 Ms. Fields, a sponsor of the bill that would allow cell towers on parkland, said the towers could be placed to assure they were unobtrusive. She said putting cellular equipment in specially designed flagpoles was one possible approach.
 Paul Rabinovitch, the executive director of the Long Island chapter of the Nature Conservancy, said the group "absolutely supports" a park district and believed it would improve parkland management. "The investment we have made to make sure our investment is well managed is minuscule," he said.
 But he added that he did not oppose cell towers. "Probably people would be turned off by them, but it's not our issue," he said. "We are not in the aesthetics business. We are in the business of saving habitat."

HEADLINE: FOR YOUNG VIEWERS; 
A Land of Cotton, Not Soon Forgotten

BYLINE:  By Tom Conroy 

 BODY:
John Grisham made his reputation with thrillers like "The Firm" and "The Pelican Brief," in which wet-behind-the-ears lawyers-in-training confront an elaborate web of wealth and corruption. But his 2001 best seller, "A Painted House," was a departure from the world of white-collar crime. In an open letter to his fans, Mr. Grisham said that "A Painted House" contains "not a single lawyer, dead or alive." 
 And if its hero, Luke Chandler, a 7-year-old Arkansas farm boy, is wet behind the ears, that's usually because his mother just told him to wash up before supper. 
 Mr. Grisham's book, which is based on his own and his parents' memories and some family legends, has been transformed into a made-for-TV movie, also titled "A Painted House," that has its premiere tonight at 9 on CBS. Although the story is set in the South during the fall of 1952, the ethnic clashes Luke sees are not between blacks and whites but between the "hill people" and the migrant Mexicans who have come to harvest cotton on the 80 acres rented by Luke's father (played by Robert Sean Leonard) and grandfather (Scott Glenn). In the process, Luke (Logan Lerman), who is 10 in the movie, learns about class distinctions (painting your house is a sign of relative affluence); moral compromises (should Luke tell the sheriff what he knows about a homicide?); and the economic forces driving small farmers off their land and into the factories of the North. He also sees some things a child shouldn't, including two bloody fights involving the hill people's oldest boy.
 The fight scenes are too harsh for very young viewers, but the story is right for those old enough to start asking questions about honesty, race, class and a way of life that has all but disappeared.
 "Films are a mirror to reality. You can't avoid death, violence, blood," said Alfonso Arau, the film's director. "We tried to limit certain things. Remember, it's a Hallmark film." 
 "A Painted House" is, in fact, the 216th film in the "Hallmark Hall of Fame" series. And, appropriately for its Missouri-based sponsor, its star is the land as much as it is the people who live off it. Mr. Arau, best known for gorgeously shot rural-set films like "A Walk in the Clouds" and "Like Water for Chocolate," said he hadn't prettified the farmers' life. "It was pretty already," he said. "It's a hard life, and at the same time, it's a wonderful environment. The elements of a hard life come from outside the family, either from the big corporations or from the weather."
 Mr. Grisham, who was born three years after the book and film take place, actually lived on a cotton farm until the age of 7 and, according to Mr. Arau, strove to ensure that the movie was true to his vision. "The production was very communicative with him," said Mr. Arau. "He gave us notes of things he remembered."
 But in the end, the re-creation of that vision rested on the shoulders of the 11-year-old who would portray Mr. Grisham's fictional self. Logan Lerman, speaking from his home in Los Angeles after Little League practice, recalled that Mr. Grisham visited the set and said, "That kid really reminds me of me when I was younger." A nice compliment for the young actor, although Mr. Lerman seems to have been more impressed by his own first visit to the set. Upon arriving in Clarkedale, Ark., he was surprised to see how some people lived only half a century ago. "There was this really small house, in the middle of nowhere," he said, "with no other houses, just acres and acres of land. The lifestyle is really different from mine. When you have to go to the bathroom, you have to go outside." Tom Conroy

HEADLINE: The Empire Slinks Back 

BYLINE:  By Niall Ferguson; Niall Ferguson is Herzog professor of financial history at the Stern School of Business, New York University, and a senior research fellow of Jesus College, Oxford. He is the author of "Empire: The Rise and Demise of the British World Order and the Lessons for Global Power."

 BODY:
Wheresoever the Roman conquers, he inhabits. -- Seneca

Iraq has fallen. Saddam's statues are face down in the dust. His evil tyranny is at an end.
 So -- can we, like, go home now? 
 You didn't have to wait long for a perfect symbol of the fundamental weakness at the heart of the new American imperialism -- sorry, humanitarianism. I'm talking about its chronically short time frame. I wasn't counting, but the Stars and Stripes must have been up there on the head of that statue of Saddam for less than a minute. You have to wonder what his commanding officer said to the marine responsible, Cpl. Edward Chin, when he saw Old Glory up there. "Son, get that thing down on the double, or we'll have every TV station from here to Bangladesh denouncing us as Yankee imperialists!"
An echo of Corporal Chin's imperial impulse can be heard in the last letter Cpl. Kemaphoom Chanawongse sent home before he and his Marine unit entered Iraq. Chanawongse joked that his camp in Kuwait was like something out of "M*A*S*H" -- except that it would need to be called "M*A*H*T*S*F": "marines are here to stay forever."
But the question raised by Corporal Chanawongse's poignant final joke -- he was killed a week later, when his amphibious assault vehicle was blown up in Nasiriya -- is, Are the marines in Iraq "to stay forever"? No doubt it is true, as President Bush said, that the America will "honor forever" Corporal Chanawongse and the more than 120 other service personnel so far killed in the conflict. Honored forever, yes. But there forever? In many ways the biggest mystery about the American occupation of Iraq is its probable duration. Recent statements by members of the Bush administration bespeak a time frame a lot closer to ephemeral than eternal. As the president himself told the Iraqi people in a television broadcast shortly after the fall of Baghdad: "The government of Iraq and the future of your country will soon belong to you. . . . We will respect your great religious traditions, whose principles of equality and compassion are essential to Iraq's future. We will help you build a peaceful and representative government that protects the rights of all citizens. And then our military forces will leave."
What the president didn't make entirely clear was whether the departing troops would be accompanied by the retired Lt. Gen. Jay Garner and his "Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance," newspeak for what would once have been called Omgus -- the Office of Military Government (United States). Nor was he very specific about when exactly he expected to see the handover of power to the "peaceful and representative government" of Iraqis.
But we know the kind of time frame the president has in mind. In a prewar speech to the American Enterprise Institute, Bush declared, "We will remain in Iraq as long as necessary and not a day more." It is striking that the unit of measure he used was days. Speaking less than a week before the fall of Baghdad, Paul Wolfowitz, the deputy secretary of defense, suggested that Garner would be running Iraq for at least six months. Other administration spokesmen have mentioned two years as the maximum transition period. When Garner himself was asked how long he expected to be in charge, he talked about just three months.
If -- as more and more commentators claim -- America has embarked on a new age of empire, it may turn out to be the most evanescent empire in all history. Other empire builders have fantasized about ruling subject peoples for a thousand years. This is shaping up to be history's first thousand-day empire. Make that a thousand hours.
Let me come clean. I am a fully paid-up member of the neoimperialist gang. Twelve years ago -- when it was not at all fashionable to say so -- I was already arguing that it would be "desirable for the United States to depose" tyrants like Saddam Hussein. "Capitalism and democracy," I wrote, "are not naturally occurring, but require strong institutional foundations of law and order. The proper role of an imperial America is to establish these institutions where they are lacking, if necessary . . . by military force." Today this argument is in danger of becoming commonplace, at least among the set who read The National Interest, the latest issue of which is practically an American Empire Special Edition. Elsewhere, writers as diverse as Max Boot, Andrew Bacevich and Thomas Donnelly have drawn explicit (and in Boot's case, approving) comparisons between the pax Britannica of Queen Victoria's reign and the pax Americana they envisage in the reign of George II. Boot has gone so far as to say that the United States should provide places like Afghanistan and other troubled countries with "the sort of enlightened foreign administration once provided by self-confident Englishmen in jodhpurs and pith helmets."
I agree. The British Empire has had a pretty lousy press from a generation of "postcolonial" historians anachronistically affronted by its racism. But the reality is that the British were significantly more successful at establishing market economies, the rule of law and the transition to representative government than the majority of postcolonial governments have been. The policy "mix" favored by Victorian imperialists reads like something just published by the International Monetary Fund, if not the World Bank: free trade, balanced budgets, sound money, the common law, incorrupt administration and investment in infrastructure financed by international loans. These are precisely the things Iraq needs right now. If the scary-sounding "American empire" can deliver them, then I am all for it. The catch is whether or not America has the one crucial character trait without which the whole imperial project is doomed: stamina. The more time I spend here in the United States, the more doubtful I become about this.
The United States unquestionably has the raw economic power to build an empire -- more, indeed, than the United Kingdom ever had at its disposal. In 1913, for example, Britain's share of total world output was 8 percent, while the equivalent figure for the United States in 1998 was 22 percent. There's "soft" power too -- the endlessly innovative consumer culture that Joseph Nye argues is an essential component of American power -- but at its core, as we have seen in Afghanistan and now in Iraq, American power is far from soft. It can be very, very hard. The trouble is that it is ephemeral. It is not so much Power Lite as Flash Power -- here today, with a spectacular bang, but gone tomorrow.
Besides the presidential time frame -- which is limited by the four-year election cycle -- the most obvious symptom of its short-windedness is the difficulty the American empire finds in recruiting the right sort of people to run it. America's educational institutions excel at producing young men and women who are both academically and professionally very well trained. It's just that the young elites have no desire whatsoever to spend their lives running a screwed-up, sun-scorched sandpit like Iraq. America's brightest and best aspire not to govern Mesopotamia, but to manage MTV; not to rule Hejaz, but to run a hedge fund; not to be a C.B.E., or Commander of the British Empire, but to be a C.E.O. And that, of course, is one reason so many of the Americans currently in Iraq are first-generation immigrants to the United States -- men like Cpl. Kemaphoom Chanawongse.
America's British allies have been here before. Having defeated the previous Ottoman rulers in the First World War, Britain ran Iraq as a "mandate" between 1920 and 1932. For the sake of form, the British installed one of their Arab clients, the Hashemite prince Faisal, as king. But there was no doubt who was really running the place. Nor did the British make any bones about why they were there. When two Standard Oil geologists entered Iraq on a prospecting mission, the British civil commissioner handed them over to the chief of police of Baghdad; in 1927 the British takeover paid a handsome dividend when oil was struck at Baba Gurgur, in the northern part of Iraq. Although they formally relinquished power to the ruling dynasty in 1932, the British remained informally in control of Iraq throughout the 1930's. Indeed, they only really lost theirgrip on Baghdad with the assassination of their clients Faisal II and his prime minister, Nuri es-Said, in the revolution of 1958. 
The crucial point is this: when the British went into Iraq, they stuck around. To be precise, there were British government representatives, military and civilian, in Baghdad uninterruptedly for almost exactly 40 years. 
And that brings up a simple question: Who in today's United States would like to be based in Baghdad as long as the British were -- which would be from now until 2043?
"Don't even go there!" is one of those catch phrases you hear every day in New York. Somehow it sums up exactly what is flawed about the whole post-9/11 crypto-imperial project. Despite their vast wealth and devastating weaponry, Americans have no interest in the one crucial activity without which a true empire cannot enduringly be established. They won't actually go there. 
a british counterexample. Gertrude Bell was the first woman to graduate from Oxford with a First Class degree. She learned to speak Arabic during an archaeological visit to Jerusalem in 1899 and, like T.E. Lawrence, became involved in British military intelligence. In 1920, she was appointed Oriental Secretary to the British High Commission in Baghdad. She died there in 1926, having scarcely visited England in the interim. "I don't care to be in London much," she wrote. "I like Baghdad, and I like Iraq. It's the real East, and it is stirring; things are happening here, and the romance of it all touches me and absorbs me." 
Dotted all over the British Empire were thousands of "Orientalists" like Gertrude Bell -- simultaneously enamored of the exotic "Other" and yet dominant over it. Her account of Faisal I's coronation in 1921 perfectly illustrates their mode of operation: "Then Saiyid Husain stood up and read Sir Percy's proclamation in which he announced that Faisal had been elected king by 96 percent of the people in Mesopotamia, long live the King! with that we stood up and saluted him, the national flag was broken on the flagstaff by his side and the band played 'God Save the King' -- they have no national anthem yet."
The British regarded long-term occupation as an inherent part of their self-appointed "civilizing mission." This did not mean forever. The assumption was that British rule would end once a country had been sufficiently "civilized" -- read: anglicized -- to ensure the continued rule of law and operation of free markets (not to mention the playing of cricket). But that clearly meant decades, not days; when the British intervened in a country like Iraq, they simply didn't have an exit strategy. The only issue was whether to rule directly -- installing a British governor -- or indirectly, with a British "secretary" offering "advice" to a local puppet like Faisal.
In other words, the British did go there. Between 1900 and 1914, 2.6 million Britons left the United Kingdom for imperial destinations (by 1957 the total had reached nearly 6 million). Admittedly, most of them preferred to migrate to the temperate regions of a select few colonies -- Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa -- that soon became semiautonomous "dominions." Nevertheless, a significant number went to the much less hospitable climes of Asia and Africa. At the end of the 1930's, for example, the official Colonial Service in Africa was staffed by more than 7,500 expat Brits. The substantial expatriate communities they established were crucial to the operation of the British Empire. They provided the indispensable "men on the spot" who learned the local languages, perhaps adopted some local customs -- though not usually to the fatal extent of "going native" -- and acted as the intermediaries between a remote imperial authority and the indigenous elites upon whose willing collaboration the empire depended.
Expat life was not all tiffin and gin. As Rudyard Kipling saw it, governing India was a hard slog: "Year by year England sends out fresh drafts for the first fighting-line, which is officially called the Indian Civil Service. These die, or kill themselves by overwork, or are worried to death or broken in health and hope." Yet this was a service that could confidently expect to attract the very brightest and best products of the elite British universities. Of 927 recruits to the Colonial Service between 1927 and 1929, nearly half had been to Oxford or Cambridge. The proportion in the Indian Civil Service was even higher.
Why were so many products of Britain's top universities willing to spend their entire working lives so far from the land of their birth, running infernally hot, disease-ridden countries? Why, to pick a typical example, did one Evan Machonochie, an Oxford graduate who passed the grueling Indian Civil Service exam, set off for Bengal in 1887 and spend the next 40 years in India? One clue lies in his Celtic surname. The Scots were heavily overrepresented not just in the colonies of white settlement, but also in the commercial and professional elites of cities like Calcutta and Hong Kong and Cape Town. The Irish too played a disproportionate role in enforcing British rule, supplying a huge proportion of the officers and men of the British army. Not for nothing is Kipling's representative Indian Army N.C.O. named Mulvaney. For young men growing up on the rainy, barren and poorer fringes of the United Kingdom, the empire offered opportunities.
Yet economics alone cannot explain what motivated Machonochie or Bell. The imperial impulse arose from a complex of emotions: racial superiority, yes, but also evangelical zeal; profit, perhaps, but also a sincere belief that spreading "commerce, Christianity and civilization" was not just in Britain's interest but in the interests of her colonial subjects too.
The contrast with today's "wannabe" imperialists in the United States -- call them "nation-builders" if you prefer euphemism -- could scarcely be more stark. Five points stand out.
First, not only do the overwhelming majority of Americans have no desire to leave the United States; millions of non-Americans are also eager to join them here. Unlike the United Kingdom a century ago, the United States is an importer of people, with a net immigration rate of 3.5 per 1,000 and a total foreign-born population of 32.5 million (more than 1 in 10 residents of the United States).
Second, when Americans do opt to reside abroad, they tend to stick to the developed world. As of 1999, there were an estimated 3.8 million Americans living abroad. That sounds like a lot. But it is a little more than a tenth the number of the foreign-born population in the United States. And of these expat Americans, almost three-quarters were living in the two other Nafta countries (more than one million in Mexico, 687,700 in Canada) or in Europe (just over a million). Of the 294,000 living in the Middle East, nearly two-thirds were in Israel. A mere 37,500 were in Africa.
Third, whereas British imperial forces were mostly based abroad, most of the American military is normally stationed at home. Even the B-2 Stealth bombers that pounded Serbia into quitting Kosovo in 1999 were flying out of Knob Noster, Mo. And it's worth remembering that 40 percent of American overseas military personnel are located in Western Europe, no fewer than 71,000 of them in Germany. Thus, whereas the British delighted in building barracks in hostile territories precisely in order to subjugate them, Americans today locate a quarter of their overseas troops in what is arguably the world's most pacifist country.
Fourth, when Americans do live abroad they generally don't stay long and don't integrate much, preferring to inhabit Mini Me versions of America, ranging from military bases to five-star "international" (read: American) hotels. When I visited Lakenheath air base last year, one minute I was in the middle of rural Cambridgeshire, flat and ineffably English, the next minute, as I passed through the main gate, everything -- right down to the absurdly large soft-drink dispensers -- was unmistakably American.
The fifth and final contrast with the British experience is perhaps the most telling. It is the fact that the products of America's elite educational institutions are the people least likely to head overseas, other than on flying visits and holidays. The Americans who serve the longest tours of duty are the volunteer soldiers, a substantial proportion of whom are African-Americans (12.9 per cent of the population, 25.4 per cent of the Army Reserve). It's just possible that African-Americans will turn out to be the Celts of the American empire, driven overseas by the comparatively poor opportunities at home. Indeed, if the occupation of Iraq is to be run by the military, then it can hardly fail to create career opportunities for the growing number of African-American officers in the Army. The military's most effective press spokesman during the war, Brig. Gen. Vincent K. Brooks, exemplifies the type.
The British, however, were always wary about giving the military too much power in their imperial administration. Their parliamentarians had read enough Roman history to want to keep generals subordinate to civilian governors. The "brass hats" were there to inflict the Victorian equivalent of "shock and awe" whenever the "natives" grew restive. Otherwise, colonial government was a matter for Oxbridge-educated, frock-coated mandarins. 
Now, ask yourself in light of this: how many members of Harvard's or Yale's class of 2003 are seriously considering a career in the postwar administration of Iraq? The number is unlikely to be very high. In 1998/99 there were 47,689 undergraduate course registrations at Yale, of which just 335 (less than 1 percent) were for courses in Near Eastern languages and civilizations. There was just one, lone undergraduate senior majoring in the subject (compared with 17 doing film studies). If Samuel Huntington is right and we are witnessing a "clash of civilizations," America's brightest students show remarkably little interest in the civilization of the other side.
After graduation, too, the members of America's academic elite generally subscribe to the "Wizard of Oz" principle: "There's no place like home." According to a 1998 survey, there were 134,798 registered Yale alumni. Of these, little more than 5 percent lived outside the United States. A mere handful -- roughly 70 -- lived in Arab countries. 
Sure, the bolder products of the Kennedy School may be eager for "tours of duty" in postwar Baghdad. And a few of the star Harvard economists may want to do for Iraq what a couple of their professors did for post-Soviet Russia back in the early 90's. But what that means is flying back and forth, writing a bunch of papers on "transition economics," pocketing some fat consultancy fees and then heading for home.
As far as America's Ivy League nation-builders are concerned, you can set up an independent central bank, reform the tax code, liberalize prices and privatize the major utilities -- and be home in time for the first reunion.
it can of course be argued that Americans' tendency to pay flying visits to their putative imperium -- rather than settling there -- is
just a function of technology. Back in the 1870's, by which time the British had largely completed their global network of railways and steamships, it still took a minimum of 80 days to go around the world, as Jules Verne celebrated in the story of Phileas Fogg. Today it can be done in a day.
The problem is that with the undoubted advantages of modern technology comes the disadvantage of disconnection. For example, Secretary of State Colin Powell was criticized earlier this year for conducting his foreign policy by telephone. It was noted that Powell had traveled abroad twice in 2003 already, but one trip was to Davos, Switzerland (Jan. 25-26), and the other was to the Far East (Feb. 21-25). We can only guess at how much more Secretary Powell might have achieved if he had paid a visit to Paris -- or Ankara -- last month. And it is not just the big guns who seem happiest close to the Beltway. Recall, too, how after 9/11 the C.I.A. had to scour American colleges to find anyone capable of speaking fluent Pashto. It turned out that most C.I.A. officers preferred life in Virginia to what the British once called the North-West Frontier. (Have you seen the state of the restrooms up the Khyber Pass?)
One of this month's most disturbing pieces of news was that Garner's team at the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance would include people from the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development "who have worked in a similar capacity in the former Yugoslavia, in Haiti and in Somalia." Considering the pitifully short duration of American interventions in those countries, their dismal failure in two of three cases and the vast differences between Iraq and all three, this is scarcely encouraging. Even more surreal was the disclosure that the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance has been hiring British Gurkhas to provide security around their Kuwait base. A nice imperial touch, granted, but a bunch of Gurkhas are hardly going to blend in discreetly in downtown Baghdad.
What, then, about the much-vaunted role of nongovernmental organizations? Might they provide the men and women on the ground who are so conspicuously hard to find in government service?
It is true that a substantial number of Americans are currently working overseas for NGO's. An American friend of mine recently startled his friends -- not to mention his wife -- by quitting his artist's studio and his teaching job in London, where he has spent much of the last 20 years, to take a position with a French-run aid agency in one of the most dysfunctional of Central Africa's wretched republics. Perhaps he will find the new life he seeks there. But most Americans who do this kind of thing start younger and spend little more than a year overseas. For many it is not much more than a politically correct "gap year" before starting at graduate school. 
Nor should we pin too much hope on the aid agencies that, like the missionaries of old, can be as much an irritant as a help to those trying to run a country like Iraq. It is one of the unspoken truths of the new imperialism that around every international crisis swarms a cloud of aid workers, whose efforts are seldom entirely complementary. If Garner's team successfully imposes law and order in Iraq, economic life will swiftly pick up and much aid will be superfluous. If it fails to impose order, aid workers will get themselves killed -- as they frequently do in lawless Chechnya.
The dilemma is perhaps insoluble. Americans yearn for the quiet life at home. But since 9/11 they have felt impelled to grapple with rogue regimes in the hope that their overthrow will do something to reduce the threat of future terrorist attacks. The trouble is that if they do not undertake these interventions with conviction and commitment, they are unlikely to achieve their stated goals. Anyone who thinks Iraq can become a stable democracy in a matter of months -- whether 3, 6 or 24 -- is simply fantasizing.
Where, then, is the new imperial elite to come from? Not, I hope, exclusively from the reserve army of unemployed generals with good Pentagon connections. The work needs to begin, and swiftly, to encourage American students at the country's leading universities to think more seriously about careers overseas -- and by overseas I do not mean in London. Are there, for example, enough good scholarships to attract undergraduates and graduates to study Arabic? How many young men and women currently graduate with a functioning grasp of Chinese? That, after all, is the language of this country's nearest imperial rival, and the power President Bush urgently needs to woo if he is to deal effectively with North Korea.
After Kipling, John Buchan was perhaps the most readable writer produced by British imperialism. In his 1916 thriller "Greenmantle," he memorably personifies imperial Britain in the person of Sandy Arbuthnot -- an Orientalist so talented that he can pass for a Moroccan in Mecca or a Pathan in Peshawar. Arbuthnot's antithesis is the dyspeptic American millionaire John Scantlebury Blenkiron: "a big fellow with a fat, sallow, clean-shaven face" and "a pair of full sleepy eyes, like a ruminating ox." These eyes have seen "nothing gorier than a presidential election," he tells Buchan's hero, Richard Hannay. The symbolism is a little crude, but it has something to it. 
Well, now the Blenkirons have seen something gorier than an election. But will it whet their appetites for an empire in the British mode? Only, I think, if Americans radically rethink their attitude to the world beyond their borders. Until there are more Americans not just willing but eager to shoulder the "nation-builder's burden," adventures like the current occupation of Iraq will lack a vital ingredient. For the lesson of Britain's imperial experience is clear: you simply cannot have an empire without imperialists -- out there, on the spot -- to run it. 
Could Blenkiron somehow transform into Arbuthnot? Perhaps. After all, in the years after the Second World War, the generation that had just missed the fighting left Harvard and Yale with something like Buchan's zeal for global rule. Many of them joined the Central Intelligence Agency and devoted their lives to fighting Communism in far-flung lands from Cuba to Cambodia. Yet -- as Graham Greene foresaw in "The Quiet American" -- their efforts at what the British would have called "indirect rule" were constrained by the need to shore up the local potentates more or less covertly. (The low quality of the locals backed by the United States didn't help, either.) Today, the same fiction that underpinned American strategy in Vietnam -- that the United States was not trying to resurrect French colonial rule in Indochina -- is peddled in Washington to rationalize what is going on in Iraq. Sure, it may look like the resurrection of British colonial rule in Iraq, but honestly, all we want to do is give the Iraqi people democracy and then go home.
So long as the American empire dare not speak its own name -- so long as it continues this tradition of organized hypocrisy -- today's ambitious young men and women will take one look at the prospects for postwar Iraq and say with one voice, "Don't even go there."
Americans need to go there. If the best and brightest insist on staying home, today's unspoken imperial project may end -- unspeakably -- tomorrow. 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 18, 2003

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on April 27 about the United States' unlikely role as an empire builder and the dim prospects for long-term American occupation of Iraq misstated the year that the author of the article, Niall Ferguson, first wrote that it would be "desirable for the United States to depose" tyrants like Saddam Hussein. It was 2001, not 1991.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Both Sides May Be Wrong About The Budget

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
LISTENING to senators and representatives argue about the budget this month, one might have thought that the future of the United States economy was hanging in the balance.
 After reminding his colleagues that he had taught economics in high school for 16 years, J. Dennis Hastert, the speaker of the House, asserted that the budget, including most of the large tax cuts that President Bush had proposed, "lays down the blueprint for the future of the country." 
 "The people who elect us," Mr. Hastert declared, "want us to stimulate this economy," create jobs and lift stock prices. 
Senator Don Nickles, the Oklahoma Republican who is chairman of the Budget Committee, declared: "The economy has not been growing. Frankly, we will never balance the budget if the economy is not growing. This budget allows and provides for a growth package."
But no sooner had Mr. Nickles sat down than Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the top Democrat on the committee, took the floor, calling the budget "radical, reckless, dangerous and extreme."
"The best economists in America tell us that this budget proposal hurts long-term economic growth and threatens our economic security," Mr. Conrad said.
So which side is right? The budget plan adopted by lawmakers would allow deep tax cuts, at least $350 billion and up to $550 billion over 10 years, mostly for the well off. It would place no reins on spending for automatic benefits like Social Security and Medicare, which account for two-thirds of federal outlays. But it would strictly limit other domestic programs, from national parks to education, which are less than 15 percent of the total. 
Would that lead to an economic boom, as the Republicans have held, or cripple the economy, as the Democrats have argued?
The answer, which could never have been gleaned by listening to the Congressional debate, is probably neither. In a report last month that went largely unnoticed with all the war news, the Congressional Budget Office, which provides Congress with impartial, expert economic counsel, concluded that President Bush's tax and spending plan "would provide a relatively small impetus in an economy the size of the United States's."
The report was supervised by Douglas J. Holtz-Eakin, the new director of the budget office, who was chief economist for President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers. Mr. Holtz-Eakin was selected by Republican leaders because of his adherence to the doctrines of supply-side economics.
THE budget was indeed important, but not because of its effect on the economy. All the talk about the wisdom of tax cuts and the dangers of deficits was a smoke screen masking the fundamental philosophical divide that has separated Democrats and Republicans since the New Deal.
Republican politicians, by and large, want to shrink the role of the government outside the military. They have never much cared for Social Security and Medicare, the crown jewels of Democratic lawmaking. They dislike most aid to education, environmental regulations and labor laws. They want to cut taxes not so much to buoy the economy as to take money away from the government. Budget deficits, in the Republican view, are better than surpluses. If there is extra money, they believe, the government will waste it.
Democratic politicians generally want to expand the government other than the military. They want universal medical insurance and more generous Medicare benefits. They want more environmental protection and stricter regulation of business. They are comfortable with high income taxes because the poor and the middle class bear little of the burden. And most worry about budget deficits, not because of their economic effect but because deficits prevent the government from offering more services. If the deficits expected over the next decade grew out of a new national health insurance program, say, instead of income-tax cuts, few Democrats would complain.
People outside of politics see room for compromise -- perhaps a one-year tax cut limited to the middle class, rather than the 10-year plan skewed to the wealthy. Or a prescription drug plan under Medicare that is more generous than what the Republicans envision but less sweeping than the Democrats' version. Or permission for some new oil and gas exploration in Alaska in exchange for tougher auto mileage standards.
But senators and representatives tend to be rooted at the edges of the ideological spectrum. That leaves little space for compromise. It leads them to talk past one another, just as they did in the budget debate.

A Deft (Some Say Heavy) Hand in the Kitchen

BYLINE:  By KATE MURPHY 

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
WITH its No. 1 market presence, wide variety of products, unsentimental business tactics and folksy founder, the Sysco Corporation could easily be mistaken for the Wal-Mart of the food-service distribution business.
 And with its chief competitor, U.S. Foodservice, dealing with an accounting scandal, Sysco has attractive prospects despite a weakening economy. The chief threat to Sysco is the possibility that Wal-Mart itself, through its McLane Foodservice unit, will seek a larger slice of the market. 
 "Sysco is one of the great uninterrupted growth stories in American business," said Robert S. Goldin, an executive vice president at Technomic Inc., a consulting and research firm in Chicago that has worked for most big companies in the food industry, including Sysco.
Sales at Sysco have climbed from $115 million in 1969 -- when John F. Baugh created the company by merging his business, Zero Foods, with eight regional food service distributors -- to $15.3 billion in 1998, when he retired. In 2002, revenue was $23.3 billion, up 7.1 percent from the previous year, while profits climbed 13.8 percent, to $679.8 million. 
Last year, Sysco posted an impressive 30 percent return on equity and more than a 20 percent return on invested capital. Earnings per share have increased an average of nearly 19 percent over the last five years, and dividend growth has been at least 10 percent during the same period.
Investors have treated Sysco as a growth stock. Since the market peaked three years ago, Sysco shares have risen more than 45 percent, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has fallen 41 percent.
In addition, Sysco has never taken a write-down. Its performance is in stark contrast to that of its nearest rival, U.S. Foodservice, a division of the Dutch conglomerate Royal Ahold. In February, problems at U.S. Foodservice led Ahold to reveal that it had overstated earnings by at least $500 million. Mitchell J. Speiser, a senior equity analyst at Lehman Brothers, said the scandal had already prompted some U.S. Foodservice customers to shift to Sysco.
Even with these new customers, Sysco, the market leader, has only 13 percent of the $173 billion American food service market, Mr. Speiser said. "There's a lot of room for growth," he said, especially because most types of operators that buy from Sysco -- restaurants, hospitals, schools and corporate cafeterias -- do not use just one distributor.
But some chefs said they were put off by the thought of a deeper relationship with Sysco. "I'm against putting all my eggs in one basket, especially if that basket belongs to Sysco," said Monica Pope, chef and owner of Boulevard Bistrot, a restaurant in Houston. Whether or not they own an establishment, chefs are usually the ones who deal with distributors.
Ms. Pope said some Sysco representatives came to her restaurant during lunch unannounced three years ago and handed her a certified letter demanding immediate payment of a bill that was 120 days overdue. "I was sitting at a table with my father and everyone was watching," she said. "You don't have to do that."
Other chefs and restaurateurs have complained that Sysco pressures them to continually increase their orders, threatening to drop them if they don't.
Jim Sullivan, a restaurant consultant in Appleton, Wis., said that even after taking into account that chefs are a "Freudian smorgasbord" of personalities, "there is a widely held belief that Sysco is this 500-pound gorilla that bullies operators."
Richard J. Schnieders, Sysco's chief executive, said the company runs a profitability analysis on each of its 400,000 customers. If they do not make the cut, "we either ask for a bigger order, reduce service by sending trucks out less often or help find them another distributor," he said. There are an estimated 2,850 broad-line or "soup to soap" distributors and 25,000 specialty distributors in the United States, though none approaches the size and reach of Sysco.
Chefs also complain that Sysco offers rock-bottom pricing on crucial "center of the plate" foods like chicken or steak, only to make it up by charging high prices on other products like broom handles and cocktail napkins. Sysco sells more than 300,000 products, from haricots verts to hairnets.
Independent restaurant operators, known as street accounts, are most vulnerable to such tactics. They make up 80 percent of the market and offer the highest margins to distributors because chains and larger institutions like schools and hospitals "have people to study the books and negotiate volume deals," said Timothy Banning, a chef in Ventura, Calif. Mr. Banning runs a Web site and message board for professional chefs called Madchefs.com.
Mr. Schnieders said that Sysco's pricing was negotiated by sales associates and operators, taking into consideration the quantities used by a restaurant. "We have to make it work for the customer and for us. The operator is in it to make money, and so are we," he said. "We are not the cheapest out there, but we think we deliver the greatest value."
While Sysco's sales and collection strategies may antagonize some chefs, they do help the company settle accounts quickly and increase revenue. Although people are eating out less these days, Sysco sales aren't likely to diminish much, analysts say.
"Restaurants usually cut staff before they cut back on ordering food and supplies," said Arlene Spiegel, a food and beverage consultant in New York. But "if things get really bad," she added, "they might order less expensive items."
SYSCO is further insulated from recession because its customers include hospitals, schools and universities, which are less likely to reduce the number of meals they serve because of economic conditions. Restaurants account for 63 percent of sales, the company said, while hospitals and nursing homes account for 10 percent, schools and colleges 6 percent, and hotels and motels another 6 percent. The rest is from stores and other businesses.
Mr. Schnieders's aggressive style is consistent with the approach of the company's founder. Mr. Baugh first sold shares in Sysco -- originally the Systems and Services Company -- in 1970.
That sale occurred the same year that Wal-Mart's founder, Sam Walton, took his company public. And, like Mr. Walton, Mr. Baugh embraced computers and telecommunications technology to track inventory and cash flow, and expanded rapidly across the country -- though he preferred buying regional competitors to opening new outlets.
Through it all, Mr. Baugh evoked the no-nonsense folksiness of Mr. Walton by driving hard bargains and rhapsodizing about his "precious little wife," Eula Mae.
Now 87, Mr. Baugh still has an office at Sysco's sprawling headquarters here, and he goes there every day, he said, "to enhance the humility" of current executives. Though he said he tries to stay out of their way, "one of those cats is always coming in here to discuss something," he said.
Some humility might be in order, considering the praise analysts heap on the company and its managers. "Short of kryptonite, there's not much that can touch this company," said Andrew Wolf of BB&T Capital.
Even the less bullish, like Stephen Chick of J. P. Morgan, who last month downgraded Sysco's stock to neutral, fearing fallout from the scandal at U.S. Foodservice, said, "Don't get me wrong: Sysco's still a great company."
Analysts, however, said their view would change if Wal-Mart made a serious play.
"It's not beyond the realm of possibility," Mr. Wolf said. Wal-Mart is testing the waters through its McLane subsidiary, a distributor to convenience stores and movie theaters. McLane bought the fast-food chain supplier AmeriServe in 2000. Renamed McLane Foodservice Inc., its customers include KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.
Wal-Mart declined to comment on its plans for McLane, but some people in the industry predict that Wal-Mart will want to expand its operations beyond low-margin fast-food restaurants. The question is, which corporate behemoth will chefs choose? 
"Don't look for me to sign on with either one of them," Ms. Pope said.

HEADLINE: Fuzzy Math on Iraq 

 BODY:
There has been a lot of talk in Washington about refashioning Iraq into a prosperous, tolerant democracy that can serve as a model for the Middle East. Unfortunately, there hasn't been much plain speaking about how much that is going to cost. That's because the honest answer isn't something American taxpayers want to hear. The hard numbers just don't support the White House's rosy claim that once this year's American aid package of $2.5 billion is paid out, Iraq's oil sales will pay all the bills. 
 Oil will certainly be part of the equation. So should debt relief and aid from other countries, if Washington ever acknowledges that remaking Iraq has to be an international project with full United Nations involvement. But even with this help, a substantial share of the rebuilding costs, at least over the next two to three years, will have to come from the United States Treasury. 
 Making a liberated Iraq an example for the region requires making its economy whole again. Independent analysts say it could cost up to $10 billion a year for the next three years to restore Iraq's public services, agriculture, infrastructure and living standards to the levels of the late 1980's. That was before Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and the resulting sanctions reduced one of the Arab world's most developed economies to its present, hardscrabble state.
The latest war disrupted food, water and electricity supplies and damaged roads, airfields and communications networks. But it does not seem to have inflicted much long-term physical damage. The $2.5 billion Washington has budgeted this year for relief and reconstruction should be able to restore conditions in Iraq to the level of late last year. That immediate prewar level, however, was appalling. In the late 1980's, per capita income in Iraq was around $3,000. Last year it was $700 or less. Over the same period, infant mortality soared and education levels plummeted. Unemployment became the norm, with most Iraqis surviving on rationed food.
For the past few years, Iraq has been allowed to export as much oil as it could produce, with most of the revenue going to buy the food rations, medicines and consumer goods that Iraqis live on day to day. Not much is left for rebuilding Iraq's degraded economy, infrastructure and social services. Over time, Iraq may be able to increase its oil production significantly. But this will take at least several years and billions of dollars in new oil field investments -- and higher output may well translate into lower prices per barrel. Instead of supporting other sectors of the economy, oil may well compete with them for outside credit and investment.
It may be possible to reduce the share of oil revenue going to pay victims of Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. But the issue of Iraq's inherited obligations isn't likely to be resolved quickly or painlessly. Valid claims still owed to victims of that war are likely to total more than $80 billion. 
Iraq also owes some $60 billion to $100 billion in accumulated debt to foreign companies and governments, on which it has made no significant payments for years. Some write-down of these obligations seems inevitable. But with much of the money owed to private corporations and individuals, no quick or easy solution is likely. Even if payments are stretched out, they will consume a substantial chunk of Iraq's oil income for years.
Iraq is fortunate to sit atop the world's second-largest oil reserves. Without Saddam Hussein, this bounty should be able to provide its people with the decent life they deserve. Getting there, however, will take a lot more American financial help than the administration has so far acknowledged.

Does Pain Make States Stronger?

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
AS she was sworn in a few months ago, Gov. Janet Napolitano, Democrat of Arizona, engaged in a bit of mournful hyperbole when she said she was about to govern a state that was nearly bankrupt. But many in George W. Bush's Washington would not be at all chagrined to see a state or two enter the poorhouse.
 "I hope a state goes bankrupt," said Grover Norquist, a prominent conservative strategist who works closely with the White House. "I hope a state has real troubles getting its act together, so that the other 49 states can say, 'Let's not do that.' We need a state to be a bad example, so that the others will start to make the serious decisions they need to get out of this mess." 
 Administration officials are not quite so outspoken, but a few said privately last week that the fiscal crisis now facing almost every state -- the worst in at least 50 years -- will play a useful role in shrinking state government. Just as many conservatives now embrace federal deficits and tax cuts to keep the federal government in check, they also see the crisis of the states as an opportunity to spread Ronald Reagan's vision of smaller government among 50 state capitals.
"States, just like the federal government, waste billions on mismanaged and unnecessary programs," said a recent report by the conservative Heritage Foundation, in arguing against a federal bailout of the states. "Deficits provide states with a golden opportunity to examine their budgets and reduce wasteful and ineffective spending, which will help them keep taxes low and aid the economic recovery."
The red ink now flowing through the states is in large part the result of profligate spending and tax cutting during the 1990's, when capital gains and income taxes overflowed their banks. Those Clinton years now seem like a brief hiatus in a testy relationship between the states and Washington that began during the administrations of Ronald Reagan and the elder George Bush.
It was then that Washington's spigot of cash first began to close. One 1992 study showed that the two presidents cut aid to states by $231 billion over their 12 years. Most of that money was never restored by Bill Clinton, and now that the economy is feeble again, the current Bush administration is determined to make sure the states do not again see Washington as Uncle Sugar, as one Republican congressman recently put it.
The president made it clear last week that states will have to find their way out of their problems without much federal aid, as he pursues federal tax cuts that he said will stimulate economic growth. 
"Listen, I'm sorry that states are in deficit, obviously," Mr. Bush said, in a transcript released by the National Journal. "Some states are raising taxes, some states are cutting expenditures. They are all meeting their deficits in different ways, but nevertheless, it is incumbent on the federal government to think in terms of how to enhance revenues."
The problem -- which could become a political problem for Mr. Bush -- is that many states believe they have reached the point where they cannot shrink any further. Even a few Republican governors have had to raise or extend taxes to balance their budgets, in addition to making spending cuts, and more states are preparing to do the same. The National Conference of State Legislatures issued a report on Thursday saying essentially that the budget cutting of the last two years has not worked for most states, and now the big cuts are coming in programs that residents most value, like those financing education.
Many state officials say it is painful and even infuriating for them to be forced to raise taxes while Washington, which is not required to balance its budget, debates how many billions to cut federal taxes.
"It's extraordinarily frustrating, because we're being forced to take contradictory actions to the federal government," said Angela Monson, a Democratic state senator from Oklahoma who is president of the national conference. "And on top of that, they're imposing mandates on us without picking up the tab."
Many state officials say that every federal tax cut winds up hurting them, because most state tax codes are linked in some way to federal rates for income, estate and capital gains taxes. But Democrats have made little headway in blaming Mr. Bush for the states' problems.
John M. Spratt of South Carolina, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee, calculated that the first round of Bush tax cuts in 2001 lowered the states' revenue by a total of $75 billion, and predicted the coming round would make things even worse.
"State and municipal governments are coming to us for money at a rate I've not seen in 20 years in Congress," Mr. Spratt said. And he said of the Bush administration: "They're just indifferent to the problem they're causing." 
States also accuse Washington of forcing them to enact expensive programs, like Mr. Bush's No Child Left Behind education act, without providing the money to pay for them. Mitchell E. Daniels, the White House budget director, often cites a $22 billion increase in state aid from this fiscal year to the next, but state officials say that 80 percent of that amount is simply rising Medicaid costs. Mr. Bush signed a bill to pay for the war in Iraq a few days ago that included $2.2 billion in aid to states and cities for homeland security, but the state legislatures conference is urging members to demand an additional $40 billion in temporary assistance.
That seems highly unlikely under this administration and its allies in Congress, who now appear destined to approve at least a $350 billion tax cut. And the administration is getting some support from a few Republican governors.
"If you just pour money into the states, it increases their spending," said Gov. John G. Rowland, Republican of Connecticut. "In the end, only tax cuts will provide the economic stimulation to grow our revenue bases."
But just a few weeks ago, Governor Rowland signed into a law a half-point increase in his state's personal income tax.

HEADLINE: Leaders of Congress Pledge Tax Cut, but How Big? 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 26 

 BODY:
At each other's throats two weeks ago when they broke for the spring recess, Republican leaders in the Senate and the House are promising to join forces next week to enact a tax cut before Memorial Day.
 "We both agreed we've got to work together, and we've got to move forward," Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri, the House Republican whip, said this week after a telephone conversation with Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the Senate majority leader. 
 Despite the leaders' soothing words, it will be hard to cool the tempers that flared over an unusual budget deal before the recess, a deal that led to the most serious rift between the Senate and the House since Republicans first won control of both houses in the 1994 elections.
The prevailing view in the Capitol is that a tax cut will become law, but even insiders say they have trouble imagining how it can be accomplished. And no one will say with confidence whether the cuts will total $550 billion over 10 years, as President Bush and the House want, or $350 billion, which senators say is the most they can live with, or some figure in between. 
Kevin A. Hassett, a Republican economist at the American Enterprise Institute, said he had spoken at length with top Congressional staff members and top officials at the Treasury Department but could not predict the outcome.
"Usually at this point in a legislative fight you have a pretty good idea of what's going to happen," Mr. Hassett said. "This time people have absolutely no idea."
House leaders, for instance, are determined to approve, in whole or in large part, President Bush's proposal to eliminate income taxes on most stock dividends. Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Finance Committee, said the Senate could not pass that.
The tax bill is the most significant legislation lawmakers will deal with as they head toward summer, but it is not the only important bill.
Besides the normal array of spending bills, senators will be working on an energy plan they can take into negotiations with the House. The House will soon take up the bill banning the procedure referred to as partial-birth abortion. Other issues include prescription drug coverage under Medicare, proposals to limit liability in lawsuits and, in the Senate, the confirmation of judges.
The timing of the tax legislation is expected to work like this: Senator Grassley and Representative Bill Thomas of California, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, plan to spend next week in intense talks with their committee members and party leaders about what the tax bill should include.
Showing how differently the two chambers work, Mr. Thomas will talk only with fellow Republicans. In the House, the majority party treats the minority as merely a nuisance.
Mr. Grassley, on the other hand, will work closely with Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the top Democrat on his committee, to write a bill that most if not all Republicans and three or four of the 10 Democrats on their committee will support.
"Unless it is sponsored jointly by Baucus and me, a bill can't get through the Senate," Mr. Grassley said.
In the first full week in May, Mr. Thomas and Mr. Grassley will take their bills before their committees for votes. Mr. Thomas declined to be interviewed this week. But a close ally, Representative Jim McCrery, Republican of Louisiana, said the Thomas bill would closely track President Bush's proposals and emphasize eliminating the dividend tax..
The main elements of the Grassley-Baucus bill in the Senate are expected to be the parts of the president's plan that would put on the books this year the lower tax rates, benefits for married couples and credit for children that were enacted two years ago but not scheduled to go into effect until later in the decade. 
In the second full week in May, the tax bills are expected to be debated under expedited procedures and passed by the House and the Senate. In the House, no amendments will be in order. In the Senate, only 20 hours of debate will be allowed.
The crunch will come the week before Memorial Day, when negotiators meet in the conference committee to reconcile the House's $550 billion tax cut bill and the Senate's $350 billion bill. This is where the White House will weigh in. "The president's involvement will have a great deal to say about how that conference turns out," Mr. Blunt, the House Republican whip, said.
In the two-week Congressional recess, at least two dozen cabinet and subcabinet officials spoke around the country for the president's tax cuts.
The speeches followed a pattern. The officials almost invariably equated patriotism and tax cuts. "We cannot afford to fail the American people, especially our troops overseas," Treasury Secretary John W. Snow told the Chamber of Commerce in Orlando, Fla.
President Bush has pitched the program himself. In a speech on April 15, he declared that "our victory in Iraq is certain, but it is not complete," referring to his tax plan.
Republicans in the House and even some in the Senate held out hope that Congress would approve the $550 billion, 10-year plan the president said was the minimum necessary. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said that a $350 billion bill was worse than no tax cut at all and that he would not vote for it.
But Mr. Grassley said he had given his word that no measure cutting taxes by more than $350 billion would come before the Senate. That promise led to the rift between Senate and House leaders.
On April 10, the leaders reached an agreement on a budget plan that would allow the Senate to consider a tax cut as large as $550 billion after a Senate-House conference. But the next day, it became apparent to Senate Republican leaders that the Senate would defeat this agreement.
The only way Mr. Frist, the Republican leader, could find to get the budget measure approved was to have Mr. Grassley, whose reputation as a straight talker is unassailable, make his promise in a speech on the floor of the Senate.
But House leaders were angered that Mr. Frist had essentially voided the deal they had struck the previous day. J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, the speaker of the House, called Mr. Grassley "irrelevant," and Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority leader, predicted "serious long-term implications" for relations between the House and the Senate.
But if their anger has not abated, the leaders have softened their tone. 
The basic problem, said Mr. Grassley, who was in the House for six years before he was elected to the Senate in 1980, is that members of the House do not understand how the Senate works.
"I didn't understand the Senate when I was in the House," he declared. "There's a Grand Canyon in between the House and the Senate."

Re "States, Facing Budget Shortfalls, Cut the Major and the Mundane" (front page, April 21):
 As America continues to boast its economic dominance to the world, teachers around the nation are mopping the cafeteria floors on their breaks to keep their jobs. 
Poor state government budgeting is spreading over our country like a blistering cold front. 
 National security appears to be the political focus, yet a town's police department is considering a deal to allow companies to advertise on patrol cars in exchange for cheap vehicle leases.
As the world's only superpower, America appears to be following in the footsteps of its predecessors by overinvesting in foreign affairs. The education system is affected most by the cutbacks, when it should be used as an investment that will help our country flourish.

HEADLINE: The Luster of Glass Joins Art's Mainstream; 
Works Once Dismissed as Crafts Enjoy a New Level of Respect

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: TACOMA, Wash. 

 BODY:
When the Museum of Glass opened in a striking cone-shaped building here last summer, many people in Tacoma took it as a symbol of this city's rebirth. Long considered a gritty and drab stepsister to sophisticated Seattle, 30 miles to the north, Tacoma is becoming chic, with boutiques and cafes lining waterfront blocks that were ugly and crime-ridden just a few years ago.
 The opening of this museum also reflects a growing recognition that glassmaking and other pursuits traditionally dismissed as crafts have reached a level of artistic quality. An exhibition now at the Museum of Glass reflects the rising ambitions of many glassmakers, ceramic artists, woodworkers, metalsmiths, fabric creators and others who work in fields once considered by critics and curators as mere artisanry. This show focuses on the work of the Swedish-born Bertil Vallien, who uses sand, embedded masks and figurines, and other techniques in his glass sculptures. 
 Although this museum is formally known as the Museum of Glass: International Center for Contemporary Art, it does not use terms like glass artist or glass art. "That tends to be a way to marginalize the work, the same thing that happens when you say black artists or female artists," said the museum's director, Josi Callan. "We consider ourselves a contemporary art museum with a focus on glass but an interest in the broader artistic context. There's no question we're breaking new ground, and we sense a great public interest in what we're doing.
"Over the last 10 years," she added, "glass has really been coming into its own as a fine-arts medium. We're where photography was 20 years ago. More museums are adding glass works to their permanent collections. It's part of this broadening view of what constitutes fine art."
One reason that glass has made the jump from being perceived as craft to being perceived as art is the work of Dale Chihuly, who critics say pushed the boundaries of glassworking and, in his sculpture, blurred the line between decorative and fine art. Mr. Chihuly, who was born in Tacoma, has work in hundreds of public and private collections around the world, displayed everywhere from museums to restaurants and casinos.
The Museum of Glass was originally envisioned as a place where Mr. Chihuly could show his own work, but now the museum features rotating shows, although two permanent installations by Mr. Chihuly decorate a bridge that leads to the entrance.
"Boundaries between artists and craftsmen have melded considerably since the 1960's, when I began exhibiting," Mr. Chihuly said. "Now people use the materials that suit the ideas they want to express."
The line separating art from craft has always been subjectively drawn. Sometimes the difference was said to be in intent, art created solely for its own sake while crafted objects were meant to be useful. At other times the medium has been considered the key difference. Oil painting, for example, was automatically considered an artist's medium, and works in fabric, wood or clay consigned to lesser talents. 
In recent years, however, glassmakers seem to have succeeded in changing the public's perception of what they do. Those working in other mediums view the glassmakers' success with a mixture of admiration and envy.
"The glass people are definitely ahead of us," said James A. Wallace, director of the National Ornamental Metal Museum in Memphis, which exhibits works ranging from jewelry to monumental sculpture. "They did it right. They never sold cheap, and they very consciously nurtured the image of being artists rather than craftspeople."
But Mr. Wallace said that the rising quality of metalwork, woodwork and ceramics had led many art lovers and critics to shift their perceptions. "Since the beginning of art history, crafts have been considered minor arts, the bastard child left out on the street corner," he said. "Just in the last few years I've seen that stereotype really start to change. We're moving into the artistic mainstream."
Recent exhibitions at the metal museum reflect this move. One show featured strikingly original jars, vases and incense burners by Harlan W. Butt, whose work is collected by mainstream museums like the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.
Some curators consider the word craft a negative term and seek to avoid it. Last year the American Craft Museum in New York changed its name to the Museum of Arts and Design.
David Revere McFadden, that museum's chief curator, explained: "We did a lot of consultation and work with focus groups, and when we asked them what craft means, they came up with reactions like handiwork, busy work, rural, nonprofessional, folk art, humble, brown and scratchy, macrame plant hangers. There's been such an eroding of the traditional borders between various fields that we decided it was a mistake to keep using that word."
"Since we announced the change," he said, "we've had a tremendous positive response from artists. They tell us that they've always considered themselves artists."
Not every museum that features craft-based art, however, is running from the word. The Mint Museum of Craft and Design in Charlotte, N.C., continues to embrace it. "There is a misperception of what the word craft really means," said Mark Richard Leach, who until recently was the museum's director. "Many people link it to handicrafts and think of hooked rugs or paint-by-number projects. We've failed to brand the word properly.
"Our goal is to train and sensitize the unfamiliar eye to distinguish the fine line that delineates where intent, skill, experience and outcome conspire to transcend hobby," Mr. Leach said. "This is where craft assumes a different order of meaning and begins to exemplify a fundamental human impulse to manipulate materials into objects of utility, beauty or contemplation.
"I hope," he added, "that a newly educated and admiring public will demand use of the word craft as a measure of respect for that impulse."

The "honeytoken," an innocuous tag in a file, can signal an intrusion in a company's database.

BYLINE:  By Nicholas Thompson 

 BODY:
FOR a computer security professional, Lance Spitzner has an unusual goal: He wants ill-intentioned hackers to steal more Social Security numbers and medical records.
 Mr. Spitzner, a former Army officer, spends his days working at Sun Microsystems and his evenings running the volunteer Honeynet Project, a group of security professionals working to track hackers. Until recently, the four-year-old nonprofit effort focused on building and monitoring honeypots -- computer systems designed to be easily penetrated so that Honeynet volunteers can covertly scrutinize hackers'tricks when they break into the systems. 
 Now Mr. Spitzner, 32, is focusing his efforts on a different type of defense based on the insertion of "honeytokens" into real databases and systems.
Honeytokens are pieces of seemingly enticing information that have no useful value. Embedded in ways so that no innocent person should accidentally stumble upon them, honeytokens trigger alarms when viewed, grabbed or downloaded. For example, a bank could insert a fake credit card number into its files and then set up a program called a "sniffer" on the network that would send out an alarm if anyone touched that particular number.
The term "honeytokens" was coined on Feb. 21 by a programmer named Augusto Paes de Barros who used it in an e-mail message to a list of security professionals. But the idea is not new.
It dates back in computing at least to 1986, when Clifford Stoll, a programmer at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, buried fake records for an organization called the Strategic Defense Initiative Network deep in his server. When intruders started downloading the records, and then someone sent a letter to Mr. Stoll about the phony organization, he and federal investigators traced the intruders to East German and Soviet intelligence agencies.
Today, the use of honeytokens is not uncommon. For example, ForeScout Technologies, based in San Mateo, Calif., has built a commercial software program that tracks incidents of surreptitious reconnaissance, like port scans -- the computer equivalent of someone turning your doorknob to see if it is unlocked. The program will announce a false message of vulnerability to the scanner in the form of a honeytoken. It then breaks the connection if the hacker follows up with an attack.
Honeytokens, like their cousins the honeypots, are based on the notion that if you build it, they will come. Mr. Spitzner became intrigued by the idea of honeypots after putting a new computer online at home and watching it get attacked within 15 minutes by an automatic program scanning the Internet for vulnerable prey.
Many computer criminals break into systems simply for the fun and challenge. Others are looking to take over vulnerable systems in order to use them as safe houses for setting off further, more serious, attacks. Others want to mine credit card addresses or steal corporate secrets. According to a 2002 report by the Computer Security Institute, 90 percent of the 500 corporations, government agencies, financial institutions, medical institutions and universities surveyed detected security breaches during the previous year.
Honeytokens could also be useful for national security purposes. Michael Vatis, director of the Institute for Security Technology Studies at Dartmouth University, said that the Defense Department could use them to snare people seeking unauthorized information on weapons systems. For example, a honeytoken could be designed so that if it were downloaded and then taken to a different system, it would be able to contact its original server each time it was accessed. One way to do this would be to include code in the honeytoken that would automatically try to fetch a tiny image or some other file based on the home server, making the honeytoken "phone home" whenever it is opened.
Honeytokens also can be used to track attacks from within a company by people who have passwords to enter the system legitimately. Pete Herzog, managing director of the Institute for Security and Open Methodologies, says that he has used honeytokens to detect when employees illicitly download forbidden material. For example, he has entered corporate memos with particular typos into private databases and then monitored company networks to see where those typos show up. Tracing these honeytokens, he says, often leads to caches of illegal materials stored on the network.
No one believes that honeytokens can stop all cybercrime. But they could offer an upgrade in protection.
Honeytokens offer another advantage: They help reduce the number of false positives in other cyberdefense systems. Like car alarms, intrusion detection systems can go off so frequently because of accidental trespassing that many security administrators ignore the warnings. Honeytokens, if designed correctly, should trigger alarms only if there is a malicious attack.
Hackers, however, are not impressed. Adrian Lamo, who gained notoriety last year when he claimed to have broken into the systems of a number of companies, including Yahoo, says he is not worried. "It's a form of old-school security," he says. "It will work on the people who have been to the old schools."
Mr. Lamo says that he only goes after information that he knows other people frequently seek access to and that he runs credit checks to ensure that information he uncovers, like Social Security numbers, are real. Mr. Spitzner contends that it should not matter whether a hacker bothers to run a credit check because the alarm should ring any time the decoy record is accessed.
Hackers can also evade honeytokens by compressing and password-protecting the information they steal, thereby changing or hiding the data, like fake Social Security numbers or typos, in memos that the sniffers are searching for. And "phone home" honeytokens designed to trace users could be thwarted if opened only on computers disconnected from the Internet.
Some experts are also worried about the possibility that using honeytokens could violate the federal Wiretap Act, which places limits on intercepting and monitoring electronic communications. Richard Salgado, senior counsel for the Justice Department's computer crime and intellectual property unit, has said that very little law governs this new area and that security technicians should consult first their lawyers.
Mr. Spitzner said that he was less worried about the law than about smart hackers. Honeytokens cannot solve all problems, he said. "But they can make a very simple and powerful tool in a security arsenal."

Iraqis Anxiously Await Decisions About the Operation and Control of the Oil Industry

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, April 27 

 BODY:
The brain center of Iraqi oil exports, a sprawling state organization that controlled the shipments from the Persian Gulf to the Turkish port of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean Sea, is dark and quiet.
 Wind gusts through gaping glassless windows of the second-floor shipping room of the agency, the State Oil Marketing Organization, known by its acronym, SOMO. Just last month hundreds of workers had bustled around here. 
 But after American troops landed in Baghdad, looters used rolling office chairs like wheelbarrows to roll away computers and furniture. All the records, going back to 1971, have been burned. 
"No one tried to stop it," said Abdul Jalil Hammadi, who was in charge of crude oil sales at SOMO. Since the looting, "Americans have not contacted us; the ministry has not contacted us."
About two miles away, though, the Oil Ministry, nine stories of glass and sand-colored concrete, stands as if new. It was virtually the only government building to emerge from the war unscathed and was heavily guarded by American troops. That fact evokes a hollow laugh among Iraqis, who suspect that America was only after oil when it invaded.
The two buildings offer a clue to the future shape of this country's vast but rudderless oil industry. The once-powerful SOMO was the backbone of the oil export system. For decades it served as the point of contact for oil traders, as well as for the United Nations, which oversaw trading under the terms of economic sanctions it imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. But now SOMO appears to be obsolete. 
The Bush administration contends that the United Nations sales mechanism is no longer needed, as Saddam Hussein no longer runs the country. 
The new heart of the oil industry is the ministry, where, heavily guarded by American troops, a small coterie of Iraqi technocrats awaits a council of Americans handpicked by the Bush administration and Iraqi exiles, that is to arrive this week. 
The decisions that are made affecting Iraq's oil industry over the next months will be important because they will determine who will get control of Iraq's rich oil fields. 
"People are waiting to see what new policy is coming," said Kahtan al-Anbaki, former director of a giant oil refinery in northern Iraq and now ad-hoc coordinator of the ministry. As for who will be making the policy, he added, "I would not like to comment on this."
It is unclear exactly what role the council will have. The administration is believed to have offered posts to Philip J. Carroll, the former chief executive of the Shell Oil Company, the American unit of Royal Dutch/Shell, as well as to several Iraqis in exile. 
Mr. Anbaki said he had not been officially briefed on the composition of the new team. He said a deputy minister, a former leader of a technical college in Baghdad, Mazan Muhammad Ali-Juma, had also joined the team. 
There is no open hostility to the prospect of an American-led council, but resentment of exiles -- who lived safely away from the repression of Mr. Hussein's government -- runs deep among ordinary Iraqis. Mr. Anbaki was vague about whether foreign companies are needed to revive Iraq's oil industry. Concerns linger about how much local people will control.
Oil industry experts praise the rank and file of Iraq's oil industry as very capable, highly experienced technocrats and specialists. Many in top management were schooled abroad in Russia and Britain. Traders and international department directors speak English.
Even so, Iraq has been encumbered by the economic sanctions for a decade. Few have the experience of having dealt in the aggressively free-market world of oil, which even governments with monopolies, like Saudi Arabia, have learned to navigate.
At SOMO, a sprawling compound with housing rimmed by palms, Mr. Hammadi was furious about the destruction. He had worked there since 1971. He and a group of about 12 other managers walked aimlessly through the burned, paper-strewn rooms. One of them said he had not been able to pay for emergency medical care for his child. 
In the ministry, virtually all deputy oil ministers are still in their jobs, said Mr. Anbaki, though the oil minister is wanted by American and British forces. Work is getting back to normal. Today about 300 people showed up for work, up from about 10 just a week ago.
Communication with the oil fields in the north and south of the country is still extremely difficult. The ministry was hoping to have satellite telephones to use for that purpose, but as of today, it still had none. Officials send messages to the fields by messengers, who travel by car. It takes up to nine hours to reach the southern fields this way. 
For now, small amounts of oil are flowing to power stations in the south and in Baghdad. Mr. Anbaki refused to estimate when exports might resume, but he did say that the oil production and transportation infrastructure, like pipelines, had not been badly damaged.
As for the Americans, "people are welcome to come and coordinate the works, as long as it's effective," he said.

HEADLINE: Homicides and Other Crimes Are on the Rise in California 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, April 27 

 BODY:
California's homicide rate increased nearly 11 percent last year, and other major crimes were also on the rise, the state attorney general said today.
 The state's largest cities and counties reported 1,842 killings in 2002, 179 more than in 2001, according to preliminary figures. 
 "We must never forget the pain that each of these killings causes for families and communities," the attorney general, Bill Lockyer, said in announcing the numbers. 
Murder rates had dropped in many major cities in the 1990's, a change attributed partly to the strong economy, a waning of the violent crack cocaine trade and longer prison sentences. In California, the homicide rate decreased by 30 percent from 1996 to 2001.
But in the last few years, major crimes started to increase as the state's economy dipped. After its largest one-year drop of 14.9 percent in 1999, California's major crime rate increased by 1 percent in 2000 and 3.7 percent in 2001. In 2002, the number of reported major crimes increased 3.8 percent. Murder, rape, robbery, burglary and vehicle theft figures rose, while aggravated assaults dropped 2.3 percent.
The figures released today were for 78 areas with populations of 100,000 or more, which account for about 65 percent of the state's crime. The numbers were not adjusted for increases in population.
The crime rate improved in a few California cities. San Diego had 47 reported homicides, a decrease of 6 percent. But Oakland had 108 killings, a 28.6 percent jump. San Francisco's figure was unchanged at 62 homicides. In Los Angeles, crime was up 1.8 percent and there were 653 homicides, an increase of 11.1 percent. The rest of Los Angeles County saw a 25 percent increase to 135 homicides.
While nowhere near the totals of the 1980's and early 1990's, Los Angeles' homicide total was far higher than New York's. New York reported 580 homicides in 2002, its lowest figure in 39 years.
Many recent killings in Los Angeles have been linked to gang violence.
"Every day our kids are going to school, stepping over dead bodies," said LaWanda Hawkins, 47, whose nonprofit group, Justice for Murdered Children, seeks to reduce the number of killings.
Ms. Hawkins said there was a "culture of violence" in some poor areas of the city, in part because overworked police officers had not solved killings.

HEADLINE: Ill Will Grows Over San Diego Stadium 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, April 24 

 BODY:
It was bad enough to some baseball fans that Petco, the pet-supply retailer, recently bought the naming rights to the new Padres ballpark here, but that was only one milestone for a stadium that has been unable to shake controversy.
 When the stadium was approved by voters in 1998, it was to be a masterpiece, with a view of the city skyline and a grassy area just beyond center field -- "the park at the park" -- where fans could sit and watch baseball games free, albeit from a distance. To keep those sight lines intact, development around the park would be discreetly low, with tasteful retail shops at ground level. 
 But a recent proposal by the Padres to develop the area around the ballpark has ensured that the project will continue to be controversial. Included in it are three high-rise towers that, critics say, would wall off the stadium from the skyline and would drastically shrink the center field park. 
"That created a real firestorm within the community," said Peter Hall, president of the Centre City Development Corporation, a nonprofit corporation that represents the city's interests in the project. "You can see from a lot of the editorials that it has turned into a bit of a political battle between the friends of the Padres and the public."
On Wednesday, Mayor Dick Murphy and the City Council ordered the development corporation to negotiate with the Padres and the ballpark's developer, JMI Realty, to come up with a plan that includes a larger outfield park and a smaller commercial development.
"We must keep faith with the voters of the city of San Diego," Mayor Murphy said in a statement. When the ballpark was approved nearly five years ago, he said, voters "believed that the downtown ballpark redevelopment project would include a sizable park beyond the outfield wall with views of the game."
The Padres and JMI Realty -- a company owned by the Padres' owner, John J. Moores -- released their own statement in response. "We are aligned with the city in our mutual desire to make the park at the park a great destination for all San Diegans," the statement read. "Petco Park is still on schedule to open for the 2004 season and we are hopeful this situation can be quickly resolved so the park at the park can open as soon as possible."
The ballpark's troubles have been compounded by the city's recent relationship with its other professional sports team, the National Football League's Chargers, said Daniel Rodriguez, dean of the law school at the University of San Diego, who has closely followed the stadium issue. The Chargers negotiated a deal guaranteeing that the city would pay for unsold seats at home games at their stadium, to the consternation of voters, Mr. Rodriguez said.
"You've got that as background," he said. As a result, the Padres project "falls into the category of, 'Here we go getting ripped off again.' "
The ruling by the council and Mayor Murphy was seen as a victory by Lynne Heidel, a lawyer at Sullivan, Wertz, McDade & Wallace whose clients include landowners in the city's East Village neighborhood whose property was taken by the city to make way for development around the ballpark.
"This direction is exactly what we had been hoping for: a larger park and shorter buildings that are more in keeping with what the voters thought they were voting on," Ms. Heidel said. If her clients could have retained ownership of their properties, she said, then they could have developed it on their own.
Tom Carter, a developer who served on the committees that reviewed early plans for the ballpark project, said that the Padres' proposal would have amounted to a bait and switch on voters.
"We showed the voters what we were going to do here," Mr. Carter said. "This is really about truth in advertising."
The ballpark did not start out as a particularly controversial project. About 60 percent of voters approved it in 1998. Then the lawsuits began, 19 in all, according to Mr. Hall. Some opponents charged that the project was a corporate giveaway subsidized by taxpayers, favoring the Padres organization and developers. The development corporation won every case, Mr. Hall said, but doing so delayed construction for two years.
Proponents of a larger development around the park say that tax revenues from such properties would help pay off the nearly $300 million in bonds issued to finance the stadium. And the larger the development, they say, the more money it will generate.
In their recent proposal, the Padres sought close to 900,000 square feet of commercial and residential space in the development, while the development corporation had proposed a development of less than 800,000 square feet, Mr. Hall said.
"The council is saying, 'We don't like either one of these,' " he said. It is likely that the final number will be about 600,000 square feet, he said.
The development of the ballpark has been shadowed by publicity surrounding recent business dealings by Mr. Moores, the owner of the Padres. He resigned earlier this year as chairman of Peregrine Systems, a San Diego software firm that filed for bankruptcy after restating nearly three years' worth of financial results.
From 1997 to 2001, a period that includes the restatements, Mr. Moores sold more than half a billion dollars in Peregrine stock. He has since been named in several shareholder lawsuits.
San Diegans seem to approve of the ballpark itself, though its name has been the subject of much commentary, most of it negative. Mr. Rodriguez, of the University of San Diego, said he believes that the city will prevail in the fight over the development surrounding it.
"The city now has a great amount of bargaining leverage over the developers," he said, because so much money and time have been invested in the nearly completed ballpark. "There's a tremendous amount of investment-backed expectation."

 State officials and health policy experts say the cuts will increase the number of uninsured, threaten recent progress in covering children and impose severe strains on hospitals, doctors and nursing homes. 
 But those officials, confronting a third straight year of fiscal crisis, say they have no choice but to rein in Medicaid, the fast-growing program that provides health insurance for 50 million people.
Many state officials are pleading for federal help as they face an array of painful trade-offs, often pitting the needs of impoverished elderly people for prescription drugs and long-term care against those of low-income families seeking basic health coverage. 
The issue is already roiling state legislatures. Almost every state has made or is planning cuts in benefits, eligibility or payments to health care providers, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. 
The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research and advocacy group, estimated last month that as many as 1.7 million Americans could lose coverage altogether under proposals advanced by governors or adopted by state legislative committees this year.
Many more who keep their coverage may see it curtailed. Several large states, including California, Florida and Ohio, are considering proposals to eliminate dental and vision coverage for adults. Mississippi and Oklahoma have reduced the number of prescriptions they will pay for. Other states, among them Kentucky and Massachusetts, are moving to tighten eligibility or admissions criteria for long-term care services.
In response to the turmoil in the states, moderate Republicans on Capitol Hill have joined Democrats in seeking legislation that would provide additional federal aid for Medicaid, which is financed by the federal government and the states.
"You can't have cuts of the magnitude the states are undertaking without it ultimately harming health care for some of the most vulnerable low-income citizens in this country," said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, a chief sponsor of the legislation. Another sponsor, Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia, said, "You don't go down without a fight on this thing."
The Bush administration has opposed such legislation. Administration officials and many House Republicans say Medicaid, created in 1965 as a pillar of the Johnson administration's Great Society agenda, is unsustainable in its current form. Despite recent efforts to slow its growth, the cost of Medicaid has increased 25 percent in two years and more than 50 percent since 1997, and enrollment is rising at the fastest pace in a decade.
Rather than simply pouring more money into the program, administration officials say they want to revamp it by giving states expanded power to run it.
Short-term financing relief "does not solve the fundamental problem," said Bill Pierce, a spokesman for Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy G. Thompson. "That's why the secretary put forward the proposal he did. It changes the funding mechanism and gives them greater opportunity to craft benefits that are more flexible benefits."
Critics say the administration proposal is an effort to limit federal responsibility for the program by converting part of it into a block grant.
As Congress returns for a volatile debate over tax cuts and budget priorities, many lawmakers and health care advocates say the strains on Medicaid will loom large. The program, which now costs more than $250 billion a year in federal and state money, is the fundamental health safety net for low-income and disabled Americans.
Medicaid insures one-fifth of all children in the United States and helps pay for two-thirds of all nursing home residents, many of them from middle-class families whose assets have been depleted by nursing home costs, which average more than $50,000 a year.
But Medicaid has ripple effects that touch many more Americans. "Medicaid is, in many ways, a foundation for the health care system," said Dr. Herbert Pardes, president of New York-Presbyterian Hospital. "To cut Medicaid is to hit the entire health care system."
States are now engaged in a sort of triage. 
Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, said that in his state, where legislators face the prospect of cutting Medicaid's projected budget by one-third, "they're saying: 'What can you do to help? Because if you don't, we'll have to cut the two most vulnerable areas, education and health care.' "
Signaling the political fight to come in Congress as President Bush pushes for a tax cut of $550 billion over 10 years, Mr. Breaux, an influential member of the Senate Finance Committee, said, "The problems we're facing now make you wonder why we're contemplating a tax cut of this size."
Even a state like Massachusetts, which has prided itself on expanding health coverage, recently dropped 36,000 long-term unemployed people from the basic health insurance rolls. State officials say Massachusetts may eliminate a prescription drug program that covers 80,000 elderly unless the federal government provides some help, and is considering a variety of other cuts and restrictions.
"None of these decisions has been easy or fun," said Douglas S. Brown, acting commissioner of the Massachusetts Division of Medical Assistance. "We're trying to spread the pain as broadly as we can, and preserve the core as much as we can, until better times come."
In Texas, Mr. Bush's home state, the House of Representatives has passed a bill that would set stricter eligibility criteria for Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. As a result, state officials said, 240,000 children and 17,000 pregnant women would lose coverage.
Other proposed cuts have touched off passionate debate in Texas. People with H.I.V. said at meetings of the state Board of Health this year that limits on lifesaving prescription drugs would amount to "mass murder" or a "death sentence." The Texas health commissioner, Dr. Eduardo Sanchez, echoed those concerns, saying "people would die" if the state cut treatments for AIDS and other chronic illnesses.
Christopher J. Durovich, president of Children's Medical Center in Dallas, said: "The cuts mean that more kids will seek primary care in our emergency room, which is already overburdened. We would try to offset those cuts and the burden of uncompensated care by seeking higher reimbursement from commercial insurers."
Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, a Republican opposed to new taxes, said state officials should not be swayed by "horror stories" or "doomsday scenarios." Gene Acuna, a spokesman for the governor, said Mr. Perry was confident that "the neediest in the state will have their needs addressed" in the budget process.
Tennessee has removed 208,000 people, including 55,000 children, from its expanded Medicaid program, known as TennCare, in the last six months.
In Connecticut, a state law passed this year eliminates Medicaid benefits for 23,000 adults and 7,000 children. Oklahoma eliminated its "medically needy" program, which provided Medicaid coverage for 8,300 people with catastrophic medical expenses.
Indiana expects that 36,000 children will lose coverage under new rules requiring them to re-establish their eligibility every few months. Colorado recently adopted a law terminating Medicaid benefits for about 3,500 legal immigrants who have not become citizens.
Officials in other states say they are committed to preserving gains made in providing health insurance to children. But that means the states have to look elsewhere for savings.
"We didn't propose to drop dental and vision coverage for adults because we think they're not important health services," said Barbara Coulter Edwards, Medicaid director for Gov. Bob Taft of Ohio, a Republican. "They're critically important. But to preserve the coverage for kids, we had to do it."
State officials say many of the easier cuts were made last year, when they reduced payments to health care providers and tried to protect beneficiaries.
But the cuts to doctors and other providers carry consequences, too. "I love my Medicaid patients," Dr. Charles P. Anderson, a family doctor in San Marcos, Tex., said. "I've been taking care of some of them for almost 20 years. But if these cuts take effect, we would systematically and gradually reduce the number of our Medicaid patients."
State officials worry that doctors and dentists will become less willing to treat Medicaid patients if payments are frozen or reduced.
Melanie Bella, Indiana's Medicaid director, said: "The State Legislature wants us to cut reimbursement, but we run the risk of driving providers out of the program. We have not given physicians a rate increase since 1994."
Georgia reduced Medicaid payments to nursing homes in February. Fred A. Watson, president of the Georgia Nursing Home Association, said the cuts reduced the average daily payment for a nursing home resident to $92.50 from $98.50.
"Some nursing homes have dropped liability insurance, reduced staff training and cut back the number of employees," Mr. Watson said.
Caught between soaring medical costs and declining revenues, states say they face their most severe fiscal problems in decades. Some of those problems result from the recent economic downturn. Some result from policy choices made in the boom days of the late 1990's, when states expanded Medicaid and other health programs to cover working families with modest incomes.
"Medicaid enrollment is growing now at its fastest pace since 1992," said Vernon K. Smith, a former Michigan Medicaid director who tracks Medicaid trends across the country. "Most of the enrollment growth is among families and children, but most of the cost growth is among the elderly and the disabled, who account for 70 percent of Medicaid costs. 
"That is the challenge for policy makers now," Mr. Smith said. "Any cut in Medicaid is likely to have a disproportionate impact on the elderly and disabled."

 BODY:
Two media categories reported different results for ads in February.
 Business-to-business print ads continued to fall in February, said the Business Information Network, extending a downturn that began in November 2000. 
The fall was 5.6 percent from February 2002. Year to date, the drop was also 5.6 percent compared with the period a year ago. 
 Ad pages fell in 9 of 12 categories in February. The biggest decline came in horticulture and farming, down 45.2 percent. Of the categories with gains, the largest was drugs and toiletries, up 8 percent. The Business Information Network is a venture of American Business Media and the CMR unit of Taylor Nelson Sofres.
For radio, however, ad revenue continued to grow in February, the Radio Advertising Bureau in New York reported, extending a rise that began in March 2002.
Combined local and national ad sales rose 7 percent in February, the bureau said, compared with figures for the month a year earlier. The February increase came after a 6 percent increase in January.

KOREAS SPAR OVER NUCLEAR ARMS

BYLINE:  AP 

 BODY:
South Korea demanded that North Korea abandon any atomic weapons development, but negotiators from the North stonewalled the nuclear discussion, calling it a matter between North Korea and the United States. The chief North Korean delegate, Kim Ryong Song, refused to confirm a claim made during talks last week with American and Chinese officials in Beijing that North Korea was making nuclear weapons, and instead sought to steer the talks in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, toward inter-Korean economic projects, South Korean officials said. 
 Possession of nuclear weapons would be a "serious violation" of a 1992 inter-Korean agreement to keep the peninsula nuclear free, South Korea's unification minister, Jeong Se Hyun, told North Korea, according to a South Korean government spokesman, Shin Eun Sang. 
 Mr. Jeong is leading a five-member South Korean delegation to Pyongyang in the first high-level talks between the Koreas since President Roh Moo Hyun took office in February. Foreign journalists were not allowed to cover the event.

Re "Bush's Aides Plan Late Sprint in '04" (news article, April 22): 
 Since the worst terrorist attack in American history, which took the life of my brother, occurred in New York on Sept. 11, it seems appropriate that President Bush will be making his re-election bid from that city at that time in 2004. 
 Perhaps the millions of unemployed Americans, veterans whose benefits have been threatened, families of dead civilians in Afghanistan and Iraq, working people who lost their pensions to corporate fraud, and 41 million Americans without health insurance can come to town and join him in celebrating the other achievements of his first term.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; 
Mahler's Complexity In Gehry's Space

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY TOMMASINI 

DATELINE: ANNANDALE-ON-HUDSON, N.Y., April 25 

 BODY:
The prolonged ovation that greeted Leon Botstein here tonight when he took the podium to conduct the American Symphony Orchestra in the gala inaugural concert of the Richard B. Fisher Center for the Performing Arts at Bard College was as much an expression of gratitude as a gesture of welcome. Mr. Botstein, the president of Bard since 1975, had worked tenaciously for years to get the college's board and a roster of donors behind his bold vision. Without him this gleaming $62 million Frank Gehry-designed complex would never have been built.
 It must be said, though, that while Mr. Botstein has been an exemplar of adventurous concert programming and a forceful musical educator, he remains a frustratingly uneven conductor. The sole work on the program was Mahler's immense and immensely difficult Symphony No. 3. Mr. Botstein conveyed the overall shape and sweep of this cosmic 90-minute masterpiece and drew some lush sonorities and exciting flourishes from the orchestra. But too often the performance was murky and tentative. 
 Still, the new Sosnoff Theater, as the 900-seat adaptable auditorium is called, is an inviting and intimate place to hear music. The simple decor is handsome, with smooth concrete walls, wood-paneled balconies and a soft-hued wooden proscenium (retractable to accommodate the staging of opera and theater works). On first hearing, it's hard to assess fully the work of the acoustician, Yasuhisa Toyota, since you can't hear the Mahler Third, with its enormous complement of musicians and choristers, in a modest-size hall like this one without feeling in the middle of it. Not surprisingly, the brass and percussion instruments tended to dominate. But it was encouraging that even in climactic moments the overall sound was never blaring, for which Mr. Botstein deserves some credit. There were two tryout performances of the Mahler on Wednesday and Thursday nights, and the conductor and his players have already learned that they don't need to force.
Besides being a hands-on advocate for the value of the performing arts to higher education, Mr. Botstein has clearly fostered a campus climate that encourages dissent. A ragtag band of some two dozen students protested noisily in front of the center as patrons sipped drinks just inside the lobby. There were chants accusing Mr. Botstein of coziness with corporate donors and banners that read, "Drop Tuition, Not Foil," a reference to the center's molded-aluminum roofing panel. One of the protesters was a naked young woman. I can't say what message her nudity was intended to convey, but she certainly made an impression on the watching crowd.
In a speech to the audience after the performance, Mr. Botstein asserted that this new center would allow this college of 1,400 students to expand its already considerable arts offerings. But he fully intends, he said, to make the complex a regional resource, a place for visiting artists to perform, most notably of course the American Symphony Orchestra.
Mr. Botstein is in his 10th season as the American Symphony's music director. During his tenure he has made the orchestra a mainstay of the Bard Music Festival, an innovative offering of concerts, recitals and panels that each summer focuses in depth on a particular composer. It was because the festival, which Mr. Botstein also directs, lacked a suitable space for orchestral programs (they were performed in a makeshift outdoor tent) that he conceived the idea of building this center in the first place. 
A freelance ensemble founded 40 years ago by Leopold Stokowski, the American Symphony Orchestra was struggling when Mr. Botstein took charge. Through his championing of neglected late 19th- and early-20th-century works, he has made its programs newsworthy and kept the institution afloat. Important as this is, though, the playing of the orchestra under Mr. Botstein can be exasperatingly inconsistent. 
This performance's shortcomings were most evident during the 30-minute first movement. In a preliminary written scenario for the work, Mahler described the brassy proclamation that opens this symphony as Pan awakening on a midsummer's noon. The exuberance is cut short when the music turns grim: primordial growls, a halting funeral march and ominous twitterings follow. The challenge with such mystical and amorphous music is to maintain a sense of continuity and subdued tension. Whole stretches of this performance were sonorous but inert, though the playing gained incisiveness as the movement drove toward its blazing conclusion. 
Mr. Botstein brought an amiable lilt to the second movement, a deceptively childlike Menuetto. But in the mercurial third movement the textures again grew indistinct, and the ensemble was shaky. A sudden turn of events would occur, and you sensed Mr. Botstein jumping on board as the players took off, rather than setting the course. 
The dusky-toned mezzo-soprano Nancy Maultsby was the poignant soloist in the soulful fourth movement, a setting of a Nietzsche text about the depth of woe within the world. And the women of the Concert Chorale of New York brought calm confidence to their spirited singing in the fifth movement, an angelic poem of praise, with gleeful ding-dong refrains provided by the Brooklyn Youth Chorus, positioned in the upper balcony.
But it's hard to resist comparing the performance the orchestra gave on this night to the performance I imagine its roster of strong players is capable of. Last year I heard Michael Tilson Thomas conduct a rather scrappy though intensely involving account of this work with the San Francisco Symphony in its home hall. The bloopers didn't matter, for here were players emboldened by a conductor they could count on, even as he pushed them to take chances, to make every moment matter. Mr. Botstein's performance lacked that kind of extra dimension.
Yet he did embolden Bard College to build a splendid performing arts center at a time when institutions everywhere are retrenching in the face of economic uncertainties. That achievement becomes a major component of his artistic legacy.

HEADLINE: Apple Is Said To Be Entering E-Music Fray With Pay Service 

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 25 

 BODY:
Apple Computer plans on Monday to introduce a digital music service, according to industry analysts. It is a move that thrusts the company into the middle of a contentious and technologically challenging area of digital commerce.
 Apple itself has provided few details of its new service, but people in the music industry and analysts said users would be charged 99 cents to download individual songs drawn from the catalogs of the big record labels. They said that once users download the music, they would be able to listen to it on their computers or transfer it to a portable music player. 
 The music industry was given a new impetus to develop its own channels for online music last week when a federal judge in Los Angeles ruled that two file-sharing services, Grokster and StreamCast Networks, were not guilty of copyright infringement. In the face of the availability of so much free music online, the industry has yet to offer an alternative service that consumers seem willing to pay for.
Unless Apple unveils something radically unexpected, its service will not represent a marked difference from some of the Internet services already in existence. The announcement, however, will bring a big-name company into the mix, presenting a potentially significant change in what has been a tense relationship between consumer electronics makers and the music industry.
Computer and electronics companies see digital music as a way to drive sales of their hardware, and they have pushed hard to expand its availability. But the recording industry has battled technology companies on Capitol Hill, asserting that new digital products make music easy to copy and share over the Internet.
Music executives were unhappy when in 2001 Steven P. Jobs, Apple's chief executive, kicked off the "Rip, mix, burn" ad slogan, which encouraged people to transfer music from compact discs onto computers and create their own custom CD's.
Now, though, they seem comfortable with Apple's new strategy. Hilary B. Rosen, the chief executive of the Recording Industry Association of America, said she believed Apple had struck an industry-friendly balance. Apple's music service "has compatibility with a hardware product that is elegant and easy to use," said Ms. Rosen, who said she planned to attend Apple's news conference. "The Apple system has the potential to do for music sales what the Walkman did for the cassette," she added.
That prospect would certainly be welcomed by Apple, which is trying to solve its marketing problems. The company's share of the personal computer market has steadily eroded about 3 percent. But it still has a loyal following, little if any debt, and around $4.5 billion in cash. Moving into the digital music business may be a smart way to expand beyond hardware, some industry analysts say.
The company's fortunes "are tied so closely to Apple hardware, and if that hardware continues to slide, they're done," said Rob Enderle, a personal technology analyst with Forrester Research. "This is a hedge," he said. "They want some products they can sell into a broad market."
Indeed, the company is expected to announce the next generation of its iPod portable music player on Friday, said Brett J. Miller, an industry analyst with A. G. Edwards & Sons, an investment firm.
Apple's foray into a digital music service comes at a time when combining music and the Internet has been a struggle. The concerns of the music industry have not diminished despite the demise of Napster, the free online sharing service used by more than 50 million people to download songs over the Internet. It shut down in 2001 after being sued by the music industry for abetting copyright infringement.
But since then, a new generation of free music services, most notably KaZaA, have arisen and are now used by tens of millions of people to share music files over the Internet. The music industry has also sued to shut down KaZaA.
In addition to free file-sharing services, paid music services have emerged that charge users to listen to songs over the Internet through streaming and to download the songs to computers. These include Pressplay and MusicNet, both of which have financial backing from the record labels, and several independent services that license music from the record labels.
The offerings vary, but a typical service might charge $9 a month for unlimited streaming and downloading to a computer, but does not allow users to burn the songs onto a CD or transfer them to a portable device. Some services also charge monthly subscribers an additional 99 cents for each song that they want to burn.
While offerings vary among the existing services, what is clear is that their popularity, while growing, remains meager compared to the popularity of the free music downloads. Lee Black, a digital media analyst for Jupiter Communications, estimates that the paid music services have a total of no more than 350,000 subscribers.
Even so, competition is increasing in this market. RealNetworks, which owns a portion of MusicNet, announced last week its plans to spend $36 million in cash and stock to acquire Listen.com, which offers an online music service called Rhapsody.
Technology and music industry analysts said they expected that Apple's service would allow users of Macintosh computers to download songs into iTunes software. Users then would be able to listen to songs on the computers, and also download them to iPods. It is unclear whether the service would be available to users of Windows-based machines.
But Philip Leigh, a digital media analyst with Raymond James & Associates, an investment banking firm in St. Petersburg, Fla., said the presence of Apple in the market could give a lift to digital music services beyond the confines of Apple's limited user base. The reason, he said, is that if Apple starts advertising the sale of music, "they'll be advertising to the whole world."
"It will raise the consciousness of the public that there are legitimate alternatives to KaZaA," Mr. Leigh said. He added that Apple's experiment would also allow the music industry to see how a piecemeal 99-cent offering -- without connection to a monthly subscription -- works in the relatively small universe of Macintosh users.
And he said the move could mean a long-term shift for Apple. "This signals a transformation of Apple into a digital media company," Mr. Leigh said. "Within 10 years, we'll look back and say this is when it mutated."
But Mr. Miller of A. G. Edwards said the company remained on solid footing as a hardware company. He said Apple, like others in the industry, was suffering from the weak economy.
While a music service could increase demand for Apple hardware, Mr. Miller noted that it was impossible to know the overall effect on the bottom line until Apple divulges specifics about the service and what royalties it must pay to record labels.

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: WASHINGTON MEMO; 
For Muslims, a Mixture Of White House Signals

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27 

 BODY:
When President Bush travels to Dearborn, Mich., on Monday to speak to Iraqi exiles and other Arab-Americans, he will trail behind him considerable uncertainty about his administration's intentions toward Islam.
 Since the 2001 terrorist attacks, Mr. Bush has consistently said that Islam is a religion of peace and warned against anti-Muslim prejudice. Yet he also recently nominated to a government institute a scholar, Daniel Pipes, who has enraged many American Muslims by suggesting that mosques are breeding grounds for militants and that Muslims in government and military positions should be given special attention as security risks. 
 Mr. Bush reached out to Muslims in the 2000 presidential campaign, viewing them as a potentially significant voting bloc that tends to be conservative on social issues. But he has also embraced evangelical Christian leaders who have cast Islam as evil and has adopted much of the foreign policy agenda of neoconservative thinkers who view Islamic fundamentalism as perhaps the gravest threat to national security.
Some political analysts and scholars said the inconsistent signals coming from the White House reflected a tension between two factors. On one side, they said, is Mr. Bush's instinct that his party should stand for tolerance and inclusion, for both moral and electoral reasons. On the other, they said, is the political reality that he cannot afford to alienate -- and may not want to alienate -- Christian conservatives, who make up much of his base of support, or the neoconservative foreign policy hawks whose influence on his administration has been profound.
"President Bush has clearly tried to make a distinction between Islam the religion and the actions of Muslim extremists," said John L. Esposito, a professor of religion and international affairs at Georgetown University. "But there's a dissonance between what the president says and what his domestic and international policies have been."
Mr. Esposito said that while "the president most probably might feel uncomfortable with some of the statements that have been made" about Islam by leaders of the Christian right and neoconservatives, "this is his constituency."
Mr. Bush's aides said there was no struggle in his mind about how to approach Islam.
Mr. Bush has consistently "set a tone for the country and the party" by emphasizing his respect for Islam and urging other political figures to speak out against anti-Muslim prejudice, said Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman. "This is something near to his heart," Mr. Fleischer said. "As a man of faith, he has a profound respect for other people's faiths. He says it in public. He says it in private."
Those Republicans who disagree with the president "are a few lonely souls, out on the wings, singing out of tune," he said.
Mr. Bush disagrees with Mr. Pipes about whether Islam is a peaceful religion, Mr. Fleischer said, adding that Mr. Pipes's nomination to the United States Institute of Peace, a government-sponsored foreign policy research center, was justified by his research on the Soviet Union and other foreign policy issues.
Mr. Bush's views on Islam will only be more scrutinized in coming months. He is confronting anti-Americanism from some Shiite groups in Iraq, complicating his efforts to create a stable democracy there that does not become another Iran. He is about to plunge back into peacemaking between Israel and Palestine, the issue that has long defined the political debate over American relations with the Arab world. At home, his administration's requirement for immigrants to register with the government has focused new attention, especially among Arabs and Muslims, on civil liberties and racial profiling.
The White House's record defies easy categorization. Muslim groups give Mr. Bush credit for routinely referring to mosques along with churches and synagogues when he talks about places of worship, an acknowledgment that they say matters to them. At the same time, the administration has drawn fire in the past year or two for other word choices that have offended Muslims, including Mr. Bush's use of the word "crusade" at one point to describe the fight against terrorism and the Pentagon's initial selection of Infinite Justice as a name for its operation in Afghanistan.
Despite protests from Muslim groups, the Defense Department invited the Rev. Franklin Graham, who called Islam a "very wicked and evil" religion after the Sept. 11 attacks, to hold a Good Friday service at the Pentagon this month.
"One day you get a signal from the administration that Islam is a religion of peace and of tolerance to the Muslim community," said Omar Ahmad, chairman of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, an advocacy group. "More of the time you get the other signal -- the silence of the administration over comments made by evangelical Christians."
The most prominent Republican advocate for reaching out to Muslims on political grounds has been Grover G. Norquist, thepresident of Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative advocacy group.
Mr. Norquist helped found an organization in Washington called the Islamic Institute to promote the idea that Muslims are natural conservatives on social and economic issues.
Mr. Norquist helped convince the Bush campaign to make a play for Muslim voters in 2000, and there is some evidence the effort was successful, especially in Florida, where every vote turned out to be crucial. Mr. Norquist helped arrange for representatives of some Muslim groups to visit the White House, a practice that subsequently exposed him to intense criticism from other conservatives. They said Mr. Norquist was, perhaps unwittingly, promoting the views of radical, violent Muslim groups.
In one example of how the differing viewpoints about Islam have split Republicans, Mr. Norquist is now embroiled in a feud with Frank J. Gaffney Jr., who was a Pentagon official under President Ronald Reagan and is now among the most prominent neoconservative critics of Islamic extremism.
Saying that Mr. Norquist had helped win access to the White House for Muslim groups and individuals who are sympathetic to or supportive of terrorist organizations, Mr. Gaffney said Mr. Norquist's actions were a threat to Mr. Bush's presidency, the conservative movement and national security.
Mr. Norquist said that some conservatives were failing to heed the political lessons of past instances when Republicans have appeared hostile to fast-growing ethnic and religious groups, including the support by Pete Wilson, when he was governor of California, for a 1994 ballot proposition that would have limited access by illegal immigrants to government services. Mr. Wilson's stance is seen by many analysts as having set back efforts by Republicans to win over Hispanic voters.
"There are some individuals who speak to and threaten the American Muslim community in the same way that Pete Wilson was viewed as abusive to the Hispanic community, and Pete Wilson did a great deal of damage," Mr. Norquist said. "That said, Bush is the leader of the Republican Party, and he dwarfs these pipsqueaks. So they are an irritant and not a threat."

HEADLINE: Two Democratic Contenders Clash on Universal Health Coverage 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 27 

 BODY:
In a sign of emerging divisions among Democratic presidential contenders, Senator Bob Graham today criticized Representative Richard A. Gephardt's call for universal health care coverage, saying Democrats should not repeat President Bill Clinton's failed attempt to push through a huge revamping of the health care system.
 Mr. Graham, of Florida, who is planning to announce his presidential candidacy formally next week, also rejected a call by Mr. Gephardt, of Missouri, to discard Mr. Bush's tax cut in order to finance health care. Mr. Graham, coming closer to some of the other major presidential candidates -- including Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts and John Edwards of North Carolina -- said he would leave the tax cuts that were already in place and freeze those not yet in effect. Speaking on the ABC News program "This Week with George Stephanopoulos," Mr. Graham said he favored rescinding some, but not all, of the tax cuts in Mr. Bush's overall plan. 
 House and Senate leaders, returning this week from a two-week recess, will try to work together to pass the Bush tax cut before Memorial Day. But they will have to decide whether the package will total $550 billion over 10 years, as Mr. Bush and the House want, or $350 billion, as the Senate said it wanted just before the recess.
Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said today that he might support a cut of more than $350 billion, if more income or spending cuts could be found. Speaking on "Fox News Sunday," Senator Grassley said that closing tax loopholes, including some offshore corporate tax shelters, would free about $50 billion more for the tax cut. 
Mr. Graham's remarks suggested some of the contours the Democratic presidential contest is taking now that the war in Iraq is coming to an end -- in particular, differences on Mr. Bush's tax cut and on health care -- as nine candidates prepare for the first Democratic debate, next Saturday in South Carolina.
"The problem I have with Congressman Gephardt's proposal is, we tried that before," Mr. Graham said of the health care proposal in an extended interview on "This Week," the first he has given devoted to his presidential campaign. "That is what President Clinton and Mrs. Clinton tried to do in 1993 and 1994. And what we found was that the health care system in the United States is so complex, and there's so many groups that have a vested interest in the status quo, that it just fell apart."
Mr. Graham sided with a less ambitious approach to health care offered by Democrats in the years after the collapse of Mr. Clinton's proposal: an incremental expansion, rather than the kind of sweeping, universal plan pushed by Mr. Gephardt. Mr. Graham said he would move first to expand health coverage to children, then to the elderly and next to the working poor.
"That will get us well over two-thirds of the way to universal," he said.
Mr. Gephardt has proposed requiring all businesses to offer health care coverage to their employees and to offset their expenses by doubling the federal health care subsidy. One of Mr. Gephardt's senior aides, Steve Elmendorf, disputed Mr. Graham's criticism today.
"There's no comparison between the Clinton plan and this plan," Mr. Elmendorf said. "If you can't get comprehensive done, incremental is good, but what we're arguing is you ought to try to do it."
Asked about the 2000 election, Mr. Graham -- who is to announce his candidacy next Tuesday in Florida -- said that because of problems with counting votes in Florida, he did not believe Mr. Bush had won the White House "fair and square." 
"I think there were so many errors made in my state, and maybe elsewhere, that could have shifted just one state from his column to Al Gore's column, and Al Gore would have won," Mr. Graham said.
He also said that as president he would not pledge to appoint only justices who support abortion rights to the Supreme Court. And he said he supported giving the president the right to take military action, if necessary, against the terrorist organizations Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad and Hamas, which he has called "the A team of international terrorists." 
As for Mr. Bush's latest tax proposal, Senator Graham called its premise -- that what the economy needs is more investment -- "fundamentally wrong." 
"What this country needs," he said, "is more money in the pockets of those Americans who are more likely to spend it."
He said he would like to see a "significant holiday" from a portion of Social Security and Medicare payroll taxes for the next two years.
Senator Grassley, however, said he believed that given the anxiety about the economy, "the people have demanded a very mammoth tax reduction." 
He said he held out hope that President Bush might be able to convince Senators George V. Voinovich of Ohio and Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, the Republicans who insisted on reducing the tax package to $350 billion, that a larger cut is necessary.
But Senator Voinovich, asked on the NBC News program "Meet the Press" whether he would stick to his guns and not a cent more, replied: "You've got it. And anybody that knows George Voinovich knows that when I say something, I mean it."

HEADLINE: 'Little Bitty,' More's the Pity 

 BODY:
The Republicans controlling Congress return this week to anguish over how much more of a tax cut the nation's wealthiest citizens have coming. The leaders and President Bush would be wise to focus instead on the needs of the growing army of unemployed Americans. A total of 2.6 million private sector jobs have been lost across the past two years -- a record for any modern presidency. Mr. Bush should be jawboning on behalf of benefits for the jobless as heartily as he now tours the land for still more relief for the affluent. 
 In lobbying for "at least" $550 billion more in tax reductions, Mr. Bush is deriding the few resistant Senate Republicans for holding out for no more than what he terms a "little bitty" package of $350 billion in cuts over the decade. This sounds like a debate over whether to let the rich eat cake or brioche. But $350 billion is the only option in play for opponents. Meanwhile, the president firmly angles to cram in his beloved dividend tax cut. 
 Congressional leaders hope to settle the tax issue by Memorial Day and move on to health care and appropriation debates. Talking about budgetary losers is deemed impolitic while people are still debating how many hundred billions to forgo via the tax cuts. But it's already clear that domestic programs are facing a $168 billion cut across 10 years in such vital areas as education, homeland security, veterans' care and transportation. House Republicans have already tried to sidestep culpability by installing a legislative gimmick to automatically authorize deficit borrowing. Instead of standing up and voting as they were elected to do, lawmakers will have the $900 billion bill added on to the current $6.4 trillion debt ceiling, neat as an after-dinner drink on the people's credit card.
Some lawmakers, at least, try to remind us of creative might-have-beens. Representative Richard Gephardt, a Democrat obviously, even egregiously running for the presidency, has dared to suggest another go at the issue of universal health care. If nothing else, we can salute his sense of irony in proposing to pay for this much needed but costly social program by flatly rolling back the Bush tax cuts. Remember those days? When governments did more than cut taxes and shrink government?

HEADLINE: BOOKS ON HEALTH; 
Disabled But Able

BYLINE:  By John Langone 

 BODY:
"A Matter of Dignity: Changing the Lives of the Disabled," by Andrew Potok. Bantam Books, $24.95.
 Some 50 million Americans have serious disabilities, and while the lives of many have improved considerably, 70 percent of them are unemployed. 
A vast majority can work and want to, writes the author of this look into the world of the disabled, but the presumption that they will be a burden and the "disincentive of losing health insurance" often prevent them from doing so. 
 Mr. Potok, a writer and painter who is blind, makes an impassioned plea for empowering the disabled through new tools and laws, and for attitudinal changes that discard the notion that employing the disabled is "a charitable deed." Although society expects and rewards an individual's lifelong productivity, he writes, "The right to a job is not seen as one of society's obligations."
In making his case for a transformation, the author chronicles a number of individuals, disabled and "intact," who are "helping to create access, who elicit change via care," people with an "unflamboyant, unshakable conviction that what they are doing is an essential human obligation." He introduces his readers to civil rights activists, to innovators who provide computer accessibility for the blind with talking computer programs, specialists in orthotics and prosthetics who create artificial body parts and trainers of guide dogs for the blind.
Mr. Potok concludes that even though those in the "medical engineering business" sometimes feel that anything is possible, waiting for cures for blindness or spinal cord injuries instills false hope, "a very cruel expectation." Such an expectation, he writes, "loses sight of the pressing need for civil rights and ongoing care."

HEADLINE: Tastes of India in U.S. Wrappers 

BYLINE:  By SARITHA RAI

DATELINE: BOMBAY 

 BODY:
In Lokhandwala, a prosperous Bombay suburb, Ashok Narayanan and his wife, Rathi, like to step out in the evening for a "slice of America." 
 Their first stop is the brightly lighted McDonald's, where their two children -- Karan, 9, and Kavya, 7 -- jostle with other youngsters at the counters as uniformed employees serve up burgers and fries from an open kitchen. 
 Then, with their sated kids in tow, Ashok, a commodity broker, and Rathi, a feng-shui practitioner, walk around the corner to a Subway outlet and order salads and footlong sandwiches for themselves.
American fast food chains are all but reinventing themselves for India, hoping to escape being tarred as unhealthy and uncool, as they have been elsewhere. Fast food is growing rapidly in and around India's major cities, and the two best-known American chains here, McDonald's and Subway, are bidding to dominate the Indian market by tailoring their menus to local tastes. Their offerings here, liberally flavored with Indian spices, bear little resemblance to the American originals, and their networks are poised for rapid expansion in India despite the war in Iraq and the slump in the global economy. 
The battle is particularly interesting in and around Bombay, India's financial capital and its largest fast food market, where competing outlets are often a few feet apart.
Here McDonald's, the world's biggest purveyor of beef, does not sell its iconic Big Mac or any other beef hamburger. Subway's roster of made-to-order sandwiches here features subs like the Paneer Tikka (spicy cottage cheese), the Seekh Kebab (lamb) and the Chicken Tikka (spiced chicken).
Like American fast food in the 1950's, the Indian industry is fragmented, with a few sizable national chains, hundreds of small regional players and thousands of mom-and-pop operations. The part of the industry that is measurable by market research consultants -- the big players -- is growing by 40 percent a year and is expected to reach $1.27 billion in sales by 2005, according to KSA Technopak, the Indian unit of Kurt Salmon Associates, an American retail consulting firm. 
The arithmetic is cheering for the fast food companies. "With the number of working households growing, and income levels increasing, a fast food revolution is around the corner," said Manpreet Gulri, the owner of the first Indian Subway franchise, in New Delhi. All Subway outlets in the country are owned by franchisees.
McDonald's was one of the first foreign chains into the country, opening a store in 1996 in the Victoria Terminus, an immense 1880's railway terminal in Bombay. At first, the store had lines up to a mile long, with hundreds of people elbowing each other to order a burger and fries. Additional outlets did well, too. But the crowds evaporated two years later when right-wing Hindu groups attacked one McDonald's store over accusations that, while there was no beef in its burgers, beef tallow had been used in cooking. McDonald's responded with signs outside all its Indian outlets saying "No beef or beef products sold here," but the public relations injury has taken a while to heal.
McDonald's has made itself extra-sensitive in the Indian market since then, and the results are beginning to show. Its mayonnaise is made without eggs. All stores maintain two separate burger-cooking lines, one vegetarian and one not. Workers in the vegetarian section wear green aprons, and workers from the nonvegetarian section are forbidden to cross over without showering first.
McDonald's has created a whole new vegetarian repertory for India: Pizza McPuff; McAloo Tikki (a spiced-potato burger); Paneer Salsa McWrap; and even a Crispy Chinese burger, capitalizing on the great popularity of Chinese food in India.
Some of the new recipes developed in McDonald's Indian kitchens are even being used abroad. "We are exporting our Indian product lines like McWrap and McPuff to Europe and the United States," said Amit Jatia, chief executive of one of McDonald's two joint ventures here. Mr. Jatia, whose company owns and operated outlets in western India, including Bombay, is himself a committed vegetarian, as are many Indian Hindus, though their religion does not forbid consumption of all meats.
McDonald's, based in Oak Brook, Ill., is planning to expand rapidly in Bombay and other Indian cities, adding 32 stores in 2003 to its existing 48. While that is not much by the company's global standards -- it has more than 31,000 restaurants around the world -- India is one of its most promising new markets. 
Subway, which recently replaced McDonald's as the chain with the most outlets in the United States, came to India only in 2001, but it is already challenging McDonald's for dominance. The company, based in Wilton, Conn., expects India to be its largest and fastest-growing market outside North America.
"For Subway, the sky is the limit in India," said Mr. Gulri, the New Delhi franchisee, who is a graduate of the London School of Economics.
The company has six outlets open in Delhi and two in Bombay, including the Lokhandwala store favored by the Narayanans, and franchise agreements for 23 more; it hopes for 200 stores in India by 2007.
One important difference between the American and Indian fast food markets is demographic. Even though the chains' prices here are much lower than in developed countries, American fast food, or for that matter almost any restaurant meal, is a luxury that only an affluent minority of India's one billion people can afford. 
"In Jakarta, the frequency of eating out is three or four times a month, compared with Bombay, where it is once a month," said Mr. Jatia, who earned a master's degree in business in the United States.
Even so, the American fast food chains have managed to open a difficult marketing door. Western food companies have often been stymied by Indians' preference for spicy fare; Kellogg's, for example, has struggled to make corn flakes appeal to middle-class Indians who were brought up eating parathas (Indian bread with spicy filling) or masala dosas (crepes with spicy accompaniments) for breakfast. But Pizza Hut, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Domino's Pizza have followed McDonald's and Subway here, and are working to standardize quality and spice up their menus to suit Indian tastes.
Both McDonald's and Subway are betting that at least at the top of the disposable-income pyramid, India is moving their way. "The tastes of the urban, upwardly mobile Indian is evolving," said Sapna Nayak, food analyst at Rabobank India, "and more Indians are looking to eat out and experiment."
With affluent families turning to a meal out as an alternative to in-home socializing, Ms. Nayak said that even a small niche in such a big country can be very attractive. "The potential Indian customer base for a McDonald's or a Subway is larger than the size of entire developed countries," she said.
Because the target market here includes many of India's most sophisticated consumers, the healthy-eating marketing war that Subway and McDonald's have waged in the West has appeared here, too. Subway says it is winning the argument: "The gap between us and our competitors in the Western informal eating-out segment is vast," said Rajan Nanda, who owns the Subway store in Lokhandwala.
For its part, McDonald's says that Indians are voting for the Golden Arches with their feet. More than two million people are served in its 16 outlets in Bombay every month, the company says. "Most new shopping malls clamor to have us," Mr. Jatia said.
Much of McDonald's effort has been devoted to building a local supply chain to support its stores here, including measures to keep produce fresh given India's tropical heat and sometimes-iffy electric power supply. Some 95 percent of its ingredients are now bought locally. With new stores to come in high-traffic locations like train stations and highway rest areas, McDonald's hopes its Indian operations will reach breakeven in 2004.
"There is excitement and optimism in the Indian fast food market," said Dipankar Halder, associate director of KSA Technopak. "Indians' adoption rate to new products and services, whether cellphones or burgers, is phenomenal." 
That is an attractive feature in a market that may have as many as 100 million potential fast-food customers, according to some studies. "As the saying goes, if you are not manufacturing in China or selling in India, you are as good as finished," Mr. Halder said.
The evidence is everywhere in cities like Bombay, where fashionable young adults throng the malls, and the fast food outlets offer a bit of variety, luxury and fun for adventurous Indians like the Narayanans.

HEADLINE: Spending by Consumers Rose As Incomes Gained in March 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28 

 BODY:
Americans spent more in March for the second consecutive month, the government reported today, returning to stores after February snowstorms and taking advantage of promotions to buy new vehicles.
 Household spending gained 0.4 percent last month, to $7.526 trillion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, after rising a revised 0.1 percent in February. Incomes rose 0.4 percent, to $9,158 trillion, after a revised 0.2 percent increase in February. 
 Consumers kept spending even as their confidence slipped to a nine-year low in the run-up to the war in Iraq and as companies delayed investments and cut jobs. Household consumption accounts for 70 percent of gross domestic product.
"The consumer is going to have to support the economy for a while longer until the business sector makes its adjustments," said Tim McGee, chief economist at U.S. Trust in New York. "Productivity growth is causing incomes to grow, and that is supporting spending."
Wages and salaries jumped 0.5 percent, to $5.126 trillion, helping the increase in incomes.
In addition, consumers generated money to support spending by taking advantage of the lowest mortgage rates on record to refinance their home loans and take out cash.
The gain in spending was led by the first increase in three months in purchases of durable goods, items made to last at least three years, which rose 1.6 percent in March after falling 1.5 percent in February. Purchases of nondurable goods dropped 0.2 percent after declining 0.7 percent.
Spending on services, which make up half the report, decreased 0.1 percent, the first decline in sevenmonths, after being unchanged in February.
The personal consumption expenditures index, a measure of inflation watched by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, rose 0.3 percent, suggesting inflation remains under control.
While personal spending grew at a 1.4 percent rate in the first quarter, the government reported Friday, business spending fell at a 4.2 percent pace, the ninth decline in the last 10 quarters.
Auto sales, buoyed by price promotions, helped lift spending last month. Automakers spent $3,268 a vehicle on incentives in March, up 1.4 percent from February, according to CNW Marketing Research.
In today's report, the personal savings rate fell to 3.6 percent from 3.7 percent in February. The indicator weighs current income from wages, salaries, businesses and government payments against spending. It does not account for borrowed money, income from investments, or withdrawals from prior savings.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL: ON THE GROUND -- Buenos Aires; 
Where Glamour and Chaos Merge

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL T. LUONGO

 BODY:
Buenos Aires has long been considered a city that does not know where it is. It consciously rebuilt itself at the turn of the last century in the image of Paris. Walking along the Avenida de Mayo, lined with Belle Epoque buildings, you would think you were in France. Adding to the confusion are young fashion plates who seem to have spacewarped from Milan.
 But under the glamour is the chaos. William Palau moved from London to become an accounts manager for the British-Argentine technology company Rower International. "The taxis drive like crazy here," he said. "Where there are three painted lines, in London there are three cars. Here, there are seven." 
 Business has also been chaotic since the December 2001 devaluation of the peso. Once equal to the dollar, the peso is a third of its former value, hurting profits but aiding exports like grain, beef and leather. Buenos Aires is also a regional insurance and financial services center.
Despite recession, international tensions and fears of severe acute respiratory syndrome, the city is in the midst of a tourism boom that fills restaurants, cafes and tango halls with gawking foreigners.

AIRPORT
American Airlines and United Airlines serve EZEIZA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT from their American hubs, and Aerolineas Argentinas from Miami and New York. The airport is a $10 to $15 half-hour taxi ride from town. The departure area was recently renovated, but service can be slow and a bit surly; the arrivals section remains tatty but customs officials are both efficient and friendly.

HOTELS
The English-style CLARIDGE HOTEL (011-54-11-4314-7700, $100 to $350) is appropriately close to the City, the Buenos Aires financial district named after London's. Convenient touches include cellphones in guest rooms. "When our repeat clients found out we were renovating, many called requesting that we not touch anything in here," said Oscar Gomez, the sales manager, and he assures them that features like the wood-paneled lobby bar remain unchanged. (Those calling Buenos Aires from the United States must first dial 011-54-11; numbers in the city have eight digits.)
Javier Firpo, assistant legal counsel at BankBoston's Buenos Aires office, recommends the FOUR SEASONS (4321-1200, $300 to $3,500) because "it puts you into one of the most beautiful parts of the city." It also has a separate mansion with seven suites and five meeting rooms that goes for $8,500 a night.
Gilded neoclassical elegance abounds at the ALVEAR PALACE (4808-2100, $200 to $3,000), with wireless Internet connections and other modern amenities. It has a kosher kitchen, and it will set up appointments or arrange shopping trips in advance, saving time once you arrive.
Mr. Palau likes the HILTON in Puerto Madero (4891-0000, $190 to $2,600), which has the city's largest conference center, because, he said, "you're in the city but not really a part of it." He added, "There's also a separate naval police force, so it's very safe."

RESTAURANTS
The revitalized Puerto Madero is where locals like to eat. Mr. Palau often entertains at LA BISTECA (4514-4999, $20 for lunch for two with wine and tip) for the menu's variety and the hostesses' warm welcome. An all-you-can-eat buffet, it is quiet for intimate conversations. Nearby is CABANA LAS LILAS (4313-1336, $60 for dinner for two with wine and tip), which Mr. Firpo favors for its meat dishes, pleasant atmosphere and riverside view of the docks and the boats.
If you like tango, a dinner and show at QUERANDI (5199-1770, $80 for two) demonstrates the history of the dance from its African roots to its current leggy sexiness, though the music makes conversation impossible. 
Gabriel Miremont, the curator of the Museo Evita, likes grabbing lunch at GRAN VICTORIA (4345-7703, $22 for two) overlooking the Plaza de Mayo.

ENTERTAINMENT
The pedestrian shopping streets of Lavalle and Florida form the heart of the Microcentro, the city center. A top destination is GALERIAS PACIFICO, but don't just look in the windows; beautiful murals decorate this 1889 building. The San Telmo district, known both for its antique trade and tango connections, remains pleasantly ungentrified, its balconied buildings seemingly crumbling away.
With players like Diego Maradona calling Argentina home, soccer is the national sport. Catch a game with the town favorite Boca Juniors at La Boca stadium. Fifty years after the death of Evita Peron, the actress who became first lady, the new MUSEO EVITA (4807-9433) sheds light on this near mythical national icon.

LOCAL LORE
Ratearse is a local word for skipping school, literally meaning hiding underground like a rat -- which is what students used to do in the Manzana de las Luces tunnels that snake under the oldest parts of the city. The purpose of the tunnels, which are hundreds of years old and were rediscovered in 1912, remains a mystery, but some speculate that they might have been used for smuggling or hiding from pirates. They are open to visitors through the MANZANA DE LAS LUCES MUSEUM (4342-3964).

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Two Earnings Reports Set Off Biggest Rally in a Month

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks rose yesterday, sending the Dow Jones industrial average to its biggest rally in a month, on optimism that earnings are recovering after McDonald's and Procter & Gamble reported quarterly profits that beat analyst estimates. The dollar strengthened and Treasuries fell.
 The Dow Jones average gained 165.26 points, or 2 percent, to 8,471.61, its largest advance since April 2. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 16.03 points, or 1.8 percent, to 914.84. The Nasdaq composite index added 27.70 points, or 1.9 percent, to 1,462.24. 
 Financial shares made up a fifth of the gain on the S.& P. 500. Ten securities firms, including units of Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase, agreed to pay $1.4 billion in a settlement for violating securities laws.
Almost two-thirds of S.& P. 500 companies have reported results for the quarter that ended in March. Profits have climbed 12 percent, the fastest growth since the third quarter of 2000, according to Thomson Financial. Analysts predict earnings will rise 6 percent this quarter and 13 percent next quarter, Thomson Financial said.
Three stocks advanced for every one that declined on the New York Stock Exchange, the broadest rally since Jan. 2. On the Nasdaq, two stocks gained for every one that fell. About 1.2 billion shares traded on the Big Board, 7 percent below the three-month daily average.
McDonald's gained $1.12, or 7.1 percent, to $16.93, the biggest gain in the Dow average. The company said first-quarter profit rose 29 percent, to $327.4 million, as revenue grew at the fastest pace in more than a year.
Procter & Gamble added $1.55, to $90.69, after it said fiscal third-quarter profit rose 23 percent on higher sales of Crest toothpaste and Pampers diapers.
Citigroup climbed 81 cents, to $39.26. The company will pay $400 million, the largest penalty, to resolve two years of investigations into conflicts of interest in Wall Street research.
J. P. Morgan gained 85 cents, to $28.81; it will pay $80 million. Merrill Lynch, which will pay $200 million, rose 21 cents, to $40.55.
Cisco Systems led computer-related shares higher. The stock rose 64 cents, to $14.98, after a U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray analyst, Sanjiv Wadhwani, said it might report profit above his expectations on May 6.
Intel added 47 cents, to $18.75. I.B.M. advanced $1.24, to $85.12.
The euro fell the most against the dollar in three weeks as a German industry report showed business confidence in Europe's biggest economy slumped to a 16-month low. In New York, the euro settled at $1.098 from $1.103 on Friday.
Treasury securities prices fell as investors speculated that the government would sell a record amount of debt this quarter to finance a widening budget deficit.
The government said yesterday that it would borrow a net $79 billion this quarter, a record for the April-June period, to meet the shortfall. Goldman, Sachs & Company economists project the Treasury will sell $51 billion of 3-, 5- and 10-year notes in the next two weeks to help finance the deficit, which may reach $425 billion this year, they said.
The benchmark 10-year note fell 3/32, to a price of 99 25/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.90 percent from 3.89 percent on Friday.
And the 30-year bond lost 5/32, to 108 12/32. Its yield increased to 4.83 percent from 4.81 percent.
Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)


	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	99.717	99.424	High Rate	1.120	1.140	Investment Rate	1.141	1.165	Low Rate	1.09%	1.10%	Median Rate	1.11%	1.13%	Total applied for	$44,339,568	$38,463,556	Accepted	$20,190,535	$21,859,797	Noncompetitive	$1,591,804	$966,608	

Both issues are dated May 1. The three-month bills mature on July 31, and the six-month bills on Oct. 30.

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: DIPLOMACY; 
North Korea Said to Offer Small Nuclear Steps, at a Price

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said today that North Korea had put forward a plan in its meeting with American and Chinese envoys last week under which it would "deal with" its nuclear programs but would "expect something considerable in return."
 Speaking to reporters at the State Department, Mr. Powell seemed to be softening the administration's tough talk over North Korea, saying that the North Korean offer would be discussed with other Asian nations and could possibly lead to further negotiations to defuse the crisis. 
 Mr. Powell declined to provide other details of North Korea's offer, but other administration officials said North Korea had asked for a step-by-step package under which it would receive oil shipments, food aid, security guarantees, energy assistance, economic benefits and construction of a light-water nuclear reactor. In return, they said, North Korea had offered to take very small steps. 
The officials said that under its proposal North Korea would dismantle its nuclear weapons only at the end of the process. Moreover, they said, it was not clear that this would affect both its plutonium weapons program, frozen in 1994, and the highly enriched uranium program disclosed last year.
American officials said that North Korea's offer was seen throughout the Bush administration as almost absurdly unacceptable. They said this was the view of both hard-liners, who oppose negotiations with North Korea, and moderates, who favor continued diplomatic contact.
To underscore that view, administration officials described themselves last Thursday as angry and disappointed after it was disclosed that North Korea acknowledged in Beijing earlier in the week that it possessed nuclear weapons and had begun making bomb-grade plutonium.
President Bush, reflecting his own tough view, accused North Korea of going "back to the old blackmail game."
Today the tone was somewhat different. Asian diplomats and American officials said that after the disclosures last week, Mr. Powell was seeking today to present a more positive face because of pressure from China, South Korea and Japan, all of which favor further dialogue with North Korea.
Responding to reporters' questions after a meeting with the Jordanian foreign minister, Mr. Powell said the Beijing session actually "turned out to be quite useful," adding that North Korea "acknowledged a number of things that they were doing and, in effect, said these are now up for further discussion."
The changed tone also reflected the continuing divisions in the administration over how to handle North Korea, with hard-liners favoring more economic, diplomatic and possibly military pressure, and moderates advocating a continuation of diplomatic contacts and a possible negotiated solution.
On the need for future talks, however, a self-described hard-liner said today that all sides actually favored continued efforts to talk, at least for now -- if only because they felt that if North Korea continued its intransigence, a tougher approach would be more acceptable down the road.
"There are some people in this administration who argue that there's little point in talking to the North Koreans because they are always going to cheat," one official said. But he added that North Korea's latest proposal was such a "nonstarter" that it was worth pursuing in order to show the futility of negotiating with the North.
Another official said that since the Beijing meeting last week there had been nothing but negative publicity about how unacceptable the North's proposals were. Disclosures that North Korea had effectively ended the three-part discussions on the first day fed an atmosphere of disappointment and dismay.
Mr. Powell, this official said, sought to balance the reporting of the meeting by suggesting that the situation was dire but not hopeless. An Asian diplomat familiar with the administration's thinking echoed that view.
"Like any meeting, the Beijing meeting contained good news and bad news," the Asian official said. "The bad news is that they said they had nuclear weapons. But the good news is that they came with their own bold approach, so to speak, and we didn't have enough time to clarify what they meant."
He added that the "bad news" was disclosed last week, whereas the details of the North Korean proposals had only circulated over the weekend, with the return of James A. Kelly, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs, who had been the senior American envoy to meet with the North.
An administration official added, "There was so much bad news in the last five days that it was decided to tone things down a little."
Administration officials said all three negotiating partners -- China, Japan and South Korea -- were disappointed by North Korea's response last week. But all three favored a more conciliatory tone and continued discussions to get more details of North Korea's thinking.
The next step in the process, they said, would be for more discussions among the three, possibly meeting together as Secretary Powell did with his Asian counterparts in Mexico last year.
China, several officials said, was embarrassed by the failure of the Beijing meeting, since Chinese leaders had worked hard to set it up and had high hopes. On the other hand, China was described today as still eager to keep the conversation going.
President Bush is known to be highly skeptical of negotiating with North Korea. He has said he loathes its leader, Kim Jong Il, a mercurial and reclusive dictator of a country that is enduring widespread deprivation and starvation. But American officials say that after the Iraq war, they are reluctant to embark on any more confrontations, at least for a while.
Hard-liners, for now, are not pressing forpenalties against North Korea, though some in the Pentagon had sought to discourage the last round of talks in Beijing -- or, alternatively, to select the envoys or control the agenda.
Should diplomacy fail, Defense Department officials are ready to try to persuade Mr. Bush to seek economic penalties against the North, but Washington has little leverage. It would have to persuade Japan, China and South Korea to cut their considerable ties to the North, which is likely to be an uphill battle by all accounts.

HEADLINE: Leaders, With Upper Hand, Give Pataki Time on Budget 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, April 28 

 BODY:
The state's two top legislative leaders delayed adoption of a state budget today to give Gov. George E. Pataki more time to sign onto their spending plan, even as they sent a strong message to the Republican governor that they had the votes and willingness to act without him.
 The Legislature took the first step toward overriding the governor's veto of a bill that would have given school districts an extra two weeks to present their budgets to voters. Legislative leaders at the same time postponed moving on bills that would restore hundreds of millions of dollars in spending to the $90.8 billion budget Mr. Pataki had proposed in January. 
 Both moves were intended to put pressure on the governor, and he appeared bowed by it. He made a brief appearance this evening to say that he hoped the legislative leaders could reach agreement before they passed their own budget plan.
"We're still trying to reach a three-way agreement, which I think would be preferable to having things blow up or having parties just go off on their own," Mr. Pataki said. Later, the governor joined the legislative leaders in negotiations but emerged from that meeting saying that he would "push them and urge them and make suggestions as to how they can lower the spending levels."
Behind the scenes, aides to the three-term governor have been trying to dissuade Republican state senators from voting for the Legislature's plan. But aides to Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader in the State Senate, said today that his Republican caucus was solidly behind him and that Mr. Bruno was advising the governor to come to terms with the possibility that the Legislature had the fortitude to pass a budget plan over his veto.
"We are telling the governor's people we are out of time," an aide to Mr. Bruno said. "The conference is solid."
Indeed, a month after the legal deadline for adopting a budget, the Legislature is in position to begin passing parts of a budget that would restore $1.9 billion worth of funds Mr. Pataki proposed to cut.
But while Mr. Bruno and Sheldon Silver, the Democratic speaker of the State Assembly, have begun to print reams of appropriation bills for everything from education and transportation to economic development to public protection, they said they would delay passing any of the bills for a day, to make another attempt at bringing Mr. Pataki into the process.
"We are still trying to get a three-way agreement, which is very, very difficult to get," Mr. Bruno said. "But we are still trying and while we are trying we are going to hold on our votes until, probably, tomorrow."
While the legislative leaders said they had come to agreement on the restorations, they have not yet agreed on the specific revenues to pay for them. Under legislative rules, a revenue bill would have to be introduced on Tuesday if a vote were to be held on it by Friday. Both leaders said they hoped to have a budget passed by Thursday or Friday.
Perhaps the most closely watched bill, on education, was introduced in the Legislature on Sunday and will be eligible for a vote on Wednesday. The Legislature has proposed restoring $1.1 billion of the $1.4 billion in cuts Mr. Pataki had proposed as part of his plan to close an $11.5 billion gap.
Written in more than 700 pages of legalese, the bill appears to maintain traditional shares of aid to localities. And some programs important to Mr. Silver, such as prekindergarten classes that the governor sought to cut, would be restored, officials said. 
Other restorations crucial to Mr. Bruno -- aid to Boces and money for transportation, building and operating costs -- would also be restored, one official said. 
Still at question, however, was which, of the roughly $300 million in the governor's cuts, the Legislature chose to leave intact.
"Exactly how much a given school district will receive, that's still being delineated," said Assemblyman Steven Sanders, a Manhattan Democrat who is chairman of the chamber's Education Committee.
He said that the details would emerge in the next day or two but that it appeared that New York City, which lost $423 million in aid under the governor's proposed budget, would get "the vast majority" of that money back.
There has been no movement on other assistance Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has sought, such as approval for a commuter tax and East River tolls to help the city raise new revenue.
Meanwhile, the Assembly today voted to override the governor's veto of a bill to extend by two weeks the May 20 deadline for school districts to present their budgets to voters. The measure, which passed by 111 to 38, was the first legislative override of a gubernatorial veto since 1996. Mr. Bruno said the Senate would vote on the override Tuesday.
Ten Republicans, mostly from upstate districts, where state aid makes up most of the budget, joined in the Assembly vote. (One Democrat was absent.) It came after a short but heated debate in which the Republicans, who are considered the governor's strongest allies in Albany, accused the Democratic majority of trying to embarrass Mr. Pataki.

HEADLINE: California Lawmakers Move to Fight U.S. Pollution Rules 

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, April 28 

 BODY:
A group of state legislators moved today to undercut revised regulations by the Bush administration that give utilities and other industrial plants more flexibility in complying with air pollution standards.
 The legislators introduced a state bill that would effectively revive the old federal regulations as a new state requirement. The legislation passed its first hurdle tonight in a State Senate committee, and it is being closely watched by other states as the first legislative challenge to the revised regulations, which many environmentalists have criticized as lax on polluters. 
 "Air quality is at the top of the list of concerns in California, and we are focused on doing the right thing," said State Senator Byron D. Sher, a Stanford Democrat who is a sponsor of the bill. "We are also sending a message about our unhappiness generally with what has been happening with the current administration on environmental laws." 
At least 10 states, including California and New York, have sued the Environmental Protection Agency over the revised regulations, which were announced in December and took effect last month. The suit contends that the changes amounted to a significant weakening of the Clean Air Act by making it easier for some industrial polluters to avoid installing modern pollution controls.
"We think the new rules will increase pollution and are inconsistent with the Clean Air Act," said an assistant attorney general in New York, Jared Snyder. 
The E.P.A. says the changes were intended to give the operators of power plants greater leeway in upgrading old plants and to eliminate some requirements that discouraged the installation of modern pollution controls. The rules revised the so-called new source review provision of the Clean Air Act. That provision required the installation of modern pollution controls whenever a plant had renovations not considered routine.
"We think the new regulations give a better result than the old regulations," said Bill Wehrum, the E.P.A.'s counsel to the assistant administrator for air and radiation.
But environmentalists and many state governments insist that the changes give big utilities and other industries an excuse to avoid pollution controls. Though many critics conceded that the new source review provision was imperfect, they suggested that the changed rules were even more flawed.
In a letter in December to the administrator of the federal agency, Christie Whitman, Gov. Gray Davis of California said the revisions would "bring us more air pollution" and "more health problems." Mr. Davis also suggested that the state might go it alone if Washington did not alter its stance.
"We trust that the federal E.P.A. will honor its commitment allowing California to continue enforcing environmental initiatives that are more protective of public health than federal rules and to allow other states to adopt California's more protective standards, should they choose to do so," Mr. Davis said.
A spokesman said Mr. Davis generally supported the effort that began today in Sacramento. Other supporters include Assemblyman Marco Antonio Firebaugh, the Sacramento Democrat who is the Assembly majority floor leader. Senator Sher said the hope was to have the measure pass in a few months so that it would become law at the end of the year.
Some opponents, however, have already lined up against it.
Representatives from the California Council for Environmental and Economic Balance, an advocacy group for business and labor, said the legislation was unnecessary. In a letter to Mr. Sher, the group argued that the more flexible federal regulations would improve the air quality in the state by encouraging companies to change their plants. It also suggested that creating a separate California standard would impede the economic recovery here.
"Confusion and uncertainty is likely to cause businesses to defer or cancel expenditures on new facilities and equipment subject to air permitting requirements," the group said. "This is the wrong message to send when California needs an economic recovery."
Carl Zichella, regional director in Sacramento for the Sierra Club, which backs the state legislation, said the proposed law would have little effect on businesses.
"The legislation is keeping in place the existing state system that has made progress over the years," Mr. Zichella said. "Business has had to comply with this already."
Mr. Wehrum of the Environmental Protection Agency would not speculate on what effects the legislation, should it become law, would have on the revised federal regulations. Under the Clean Air Act, he said, states can impose separate air quality requirements, if the agency deems them "at least as stringent" as the federal government's.
"We promulgated the changes because we wanted the program to work better," Mr. Wehrum said. "We think we accomplished that with the changes. But the proof will be in the pudding."

HEADLINE: Tyson Earnings Get a Lift From Settlement 

BYLINE:  AP

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., April 28 

 BODY:
Tyson Foods Inc., the world's largest meat company, said today that its second-quarter earnings rose nearly 11 percent, largely as a result of a legal settlement. 
 The company's profit for the three months ending March 29 was $72 million, or 20 cents a share, up from a profit of $65 million, or 18 cents a share, a year earlier. 
 The results included a $94 million gain related to a settlement of litigation over an allegation of price-fixing for vitamins in animal feed. Without that gain, Tyson would have reported a profit of just 3 cents a share. 
Revenue for the period was $5.8 billion, matching the company's performance a year ago. 
Last week, Tyson said it would close its Berlin, Md., chicken plant by the end of the year and begin scaling back its operations immediately. The closing will eliminate about 650 jobs and shutter a facility with a broad mix of operations, including a hatchery, feed mill and processing plant. 
Tyson, which is based in Springdale, Ark., said last month that its earnings would fall short of forecasts, and that it expected to break even for the quarter. Analysts revised their forecasts accordingly. 
Before the warning, Tyson had forecast a profit of 10 cents to 14 cents a share for the quarter. The company attributed the lower results to a slow economy and a glut in the protein market, along with higher prices for grain and live cattle. 
The chief executive, John Tyson, said today that he expected earnings to improve later this year. 
"An improving economy and a better balance in the supply and demand for meat proteins leads us to believe we will have better results in the second half of our fiscal year," Tyson said.

HEADLINE: U.S.-Europe Discord Rocks the Shared Economic Boat 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE

DATELINE: PARIS, April 27 

 BODY:
Louis Vuitton of France sells its handbags there and Antinori of Italy its wines. The German software maker SAP sells more of its products there than it does at home.
 There is the United States. Not only does 27 percent of SAP's $7.5 billion of annual revenue flow from the other side of the Atlantic, compared with 22 percent from Germany, but its biggest competitors, companies like Oracle and PeopleSoft, are also American. "It is our market of reference," said Markus Berner, a company executive. 
 The conclusion of SAP and many European businesses: restoring economic growth in Europe may depend in large measure on restoring growth in the United States.
But on opposite sides of the Atlantic, ideas about fueling growth could not be more divergent. Europe has imposed on itself a fiscal discipline so tight that it leaves little room for economic pump priming. The United States is back to cutting taxes and running up record deficits.
On top of that, Washington now says it wants to punish some of its closest European allies for their opposition to the Iraq war. The risk is that the diplomatic differences separating the United States from many of its European allies will only widen the economic divide.
In France, in particular, there is widespread skittishness over American calls to boycott French products and suggestions by Secretary of State Colin L. Powell that the United States will review policies toward France. 
But across Europe the nervousness goes beyond the prospect of selling fewer Vuitton handbags or being cut out of reconstruction contracts in Iraq. What may be at risk is the gradual convergence of economic policies that has made the North Atlantic countries arguably the world's most prosperous and closely knit economic region.
"For the first time since after World War II, the convergence process is unraveling," said Jean-Philippe Cotis, the chief economist at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. "This is a problem if it continues."
Each side has a lot to lose. The buildup to the Iraq war and the war itself have cost the world economy roughly $75 billion to $100 billion, by some estimates. The prospects for revival with the war's end are fragile all around as the global economy emerges, albeit fitfully and under the shadow of SARS, from that slowdown.
In its latest outlook on the world economy, Mr. Cotis's organization predicted that the climb out of sluggishness would be "progressive, if unspectacular."
There is much to lose politically as well. Without new growth, President Bush risks repeating his father's fate: winning the war and losing the economy. In Europe, too, the future of leaders in Germany, France, Italy and Spain may depend on their ability to restore growth and avoid falling back into eurosclerosis.
The economic strains add to lingering political tensions, and the finger-pointing has already commenced. At the gathering of ministers of the Group of 8 industrialized countries in Washington this month, Treasury Secretary John W. Snow called on Europe to do more to bolster growth.
Ernst Welteke, a German member of the European Central Bank's governing council, brushed him aside. "It's the old saying," he told reporters. "The harder you beat central bankers, the thicker we get."
Some say the divide is philosophical.
"When push comes to shove, United States policy makers are happy to amend the stability culture if they think it will produce greater gains in growth," said David Mackie, chief European economist at J. P. Morgan Chase in London. "In Europe they abide by the stability culture even if this acts as a threat to greater growth."
Under the tight rules governing the euro, government deficits may not exceed 3 percent of total economic output. Countries that are above the limit, or threaten to go there, like Germany, France and Italy, have been censured by the European Union.
Others say the reasons are less philosophical than financial.
The United States can run up deficits, they argue, because the promise of growth holds out the prospect that they will be paid off within a reasonable time. European governments, by contrast, must subject themselves to tight financial discipline because their economies never get up the head of steam to pay later for the generosity.
"It is really a problem of a lack of resilience," Mr. Cotis said. "The Europeans didn't keep their powder dry, so they have no powder now."
Like many economists, Mr. Cotis foresees the global economy on the mend, if haltingly. A report his organization issued on Thursday predicts a revival next year, with the United States growing at 4 percent and Europe at 2.4 percent. 
The relative optimism is based on the decline of geopolitical risks after the Iraq war, he explained, yet it is damped by uncertainties around terrorism and the health crisis in Asia.
In a sense, the euro has sent a strong signal about the gradual convergence of economic views on both sides of the Atlantic. By forcing Europe toward frugality, the euro was supposed to bring Europe closer economically to the United States.
But the euro has yet to help Europe catch up with the record of growth that America accumulated in the 1990's, which some thought the adoption of the common currency had the potential to do.
"At the start of monetary union there was hope among European authorities that the euro zone would develop its own internal dynamics, without relying on outside influence," said Lorenzo Codogno, a senior economist at Bank of America in London. "That is not the case, basically."
Now the United States' return to deficit spending is causing concern among European politicians and investors, who fear that it will eventually force Washington to compete for international capital by raising interest rates. 
That, in turn, would make investment capital more expensive and add one more obstacle to the fragile revival.
To diminish the differences in approach, the leaders of the Group of 8 countries, who will gather in June in Evian, France, are expected to make the central point of their final statement the need to restart economic growth. That should please the United States.
But stimulating new growth may also depend on restoring public confidence after the diplomatic infighting over Iraq and reassuring European allies that the United States is willing to listen to their preferences, diplomatic or economic.
Mr. Mackie of J. P. Morgan says tempers can cool if economies revive. "If things start looking better," he said, "this might ease tensions."

HEADLINE: City and State to Give Free Asthma Care to Homeless Children 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
After three years of litigation, New York City and the state have agreed to provide free medical care to thousands of homeless children with asthma.
 A federal district judge ruled that the children were entitled to care under Medicaid, the federal-state program for low-income people. 
 City and state officials said yesterday that they would immediately provide screening and treatment for asthma under a court order settling a lawsuit filed in 2000.
Plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit produced reams of evidence to support their contention that "New York City is facing an asthma epidemic" and that "the epidemic is especially severe among the city's homeless children." 
City officials testified that 22 percent of children in the city's low-income neighborhoods had asthma.
The judge, John G. Koeltl of Federal District Court in Manhattan, said the "evidence suggests that almost 40 percent" of children in the city's homeless shelters suffered from asthma and would benefit from the new services.
James B. Anderson, a spokesman for the New York City Department of Homeless Services, said there were 16,655 children from 9,235 families in city shelters on Sunday night.
The number of children in city homeless shelters has shot up 89 percent in four years, from a daily average of 8,826 in 1999, Mr. Anderson said. He attributed the increase to "a combination of economic problems, higher unemployment and a tight housing market."
Under the agreement, homeless families in city shelters will receive detailed information about asthma. Every homeless child on Medicaid can receive health screenings that include "assessment, diagnosis and treatment of asthma."
The treatment is particularly important because several effective medicines are available to prevent asthma attacks, or to reduce their frequency and severity, so the children can lead normal lives.
The city agreed to take many steps to inform homeless families that their children were eligible for a wide range of free services to prevent and treat asthma.
In addition, New York City promised to provide annual training to people who work in its homeless shelters to help them recognize and treat asthma. The city will provide more general training on asthma to workers at its job centers and offices that take applications for welfare, food stamps and Medicaid. The city will disseminate information on asthma in public schools and at day care centers.
"This settlement assures that thousands of children suffering from asthma will be properly treated," said Gretchen Buchenholz, executive director of the Association to Benefit Children, one of three groups that filed the lawsuit on behalf of homeless children.
The plaintiffs included a boy named Dajour B., who was 19 months old when the lawsuit was filed. Court papers say he had "persistent and severe asthma" and was often rushed to hospital emergency rooms for treatment of symptoms but never received regular, effective medical care.
Under the federal Medicaid law, states that receive federal Medicaid money must provide certain benefits, including hospital care, doctors' services and "periodic screening, diagnostic and treatment services" for children. States are required to treat children for health problems discovered through the screenings, even if such treatment is not available to adults under the state Medicaid program.
The plaintiffs said the city and the state had systematically denied adequate treatment and screening services to homeless children with asthma.
The city and the state initially blamed each other. The New York State Health Department said that it had delegated responsibility to the city and that it was not responsible for the city's deficiencies in treating homeless children with asthma. The city argued that the federal Medicaid law applied exclusively to the state.
The city and the state both tried to get the lawsuit dismissed by arguing that the Medicaid law did not refer specifically to asthma or homeless children.
But Judge Koeltl said, "This argument misses the mark and is without merit." Congress, he said, "has placed the ultimate responsibility to administer the Medicaid Act on the states," and this duty cannot be delegated.
The litigation was costly. New York City agreed to pay $460,000 in lawyers' fees to the plaintiffs' counsel, and the state agreed to pay $390,000. Judge Koeltl approved the payments.
David S. Frankel, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said, "The idea here is to provide clear, understandable information to homeless families, in a variety of forms and settings, to ensure that they will actually take advantage of the screening and treatment program."
Mr. Anderson, the city government spokesman, said, "We see this as an opportunity to inform and educate parents about asthma."
The suit was filed under a federal civil rights law that authorizes people to sue state and city officials for "deprivation of any rights" secured by federal statutes. Federal courts have repeatedly held that Medicaid beneficiaries can use the law to enforce their rights.

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: TELEVISION; 
Iranian News Channel Makes Inroads in Iraq

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, April 28 

 BODY:
As the power gradually comes back on in Baghdad, Iraqis are tuning into television for the first time in several weeks. News is starting to stream into teahouses, barbershops and living rooms, but it is not coming from Iraq, or even America.
 It is coming from Iran. 
 Al Alam television, a station that most Iraqis assume is owned by the Iranian government, is pumping professionally produced, round-the-clock news to televisions in Baghdad from a powerful transmitter just over the border in Iran, about 85 miles away. The only viewing requirement is a television; no satellite dish is needed. 
"I am very famous in Iraq," said Haidar Ali al-Assadi, an Iraqi who is a principal Baghdad correspondent. "All of Iraq is watching Al Alam. Before, everyone knew Saddam Hussein. Now they know me."
As the Bush administration tries to win over Iraqis, nervously eyeing Islamic fundamentalist influence from the Shiite government and other groups in Iran, daily reports from Tehran are flashing from the television screens of every Baghdad resident with electricity.
The station, which broadcasts in Arabic, provided the only real source of news during the war, when the alternative was the ponderous party-line reporting of Iraqi state television, which few Iraqis trusted. Al Alam, which started in February, was an immediate hit.
"When I finished my work, I would go home to watch television," said Muhanad Kerim, 38, a barber with a small shop in downtown Baghdad. Without electricity at home, Mr. Kerim now watches at work, where today a corner television set was tuned to the station, while two American soldiers waited for a trim.
"Iraqi people never saw television like this," said Mr. Assadi, a customer in the barbershop. Mr. Kerim nodded in agreement. Accustomed to a highly controlled state media, Iraqis are intrigued by the station's Western-style newscasts, with interviews ranging from political pundits to average people, and clips of speeches by American politicians. 
Not everybody likes the channel. Residents of a wealthy Baghdad neighborhood, a quiet riverfront stretch of palm trees and large houses, expressed dismay at what they called an anti-American tone and a preachy style of reporting. Rich, secular Iraqi Muslims like the American administration and fear the influence of fundamentalists.
"It's propaganda," said Faisal al-Khodairy, an American-educated man whose businesses includes a bank, a pharmaceuticals producer and a construction company. "The Iranians want to push a huge influx of Iranian views into Iraq."
However annoying residents like Mr. Khodairy may find it, Al Alam is virtually the only channel in Baghdad. Washington has organized a station that beams newscasts as well as segments from the major networks to Iraqi television sets briefly at night from a military plane. But many interviewed here today said the channel was poorly done, had fuzzy reception and, in short, was not worth watching.
Al Alam's dominance on the airwaves comes as frustration with the American reconstruction effort is approaching a high boil. With power still out for most of the day, stoplights not working, scant police patrols and some neighborhoods still lacking running water, local residents say restoring the city's life functions is taking too long.
This is something Mr. Assadi, a smiling man of 28, has addressed in his reports. He is keenly aware of his power as a television reporter, saying, "I am a media man, and I can make people either for or against America." But he said he was reserving judgment about America's intervention in Iraq.
Mr. Assadi, who used to work as a Farsi translator, is an Iraqi Shiite. He defended the station's reporting as evenhanded and hard-hitting. He denied that the station was anti-American in tone and said he actively sought, but rarely got, American official comment.
Regarding tone, another Iraq correspondent for Al Alam, Safa Issa, said, "We are free, just like Al Jazeera."
In fact, the channel has used reporters from Al Jazeera, as well as local Iraqis, to cover the war in Iraq, said Hoseyn Beheshtipur, the station's managing director, in an interview in the Iranian news media on April 16. The channel broadcasts by satellite to other countries, and offers English-language service.
Mr. Beheshtipur said the station sought "to inform the public of news that countries which own their media do not want to disseminate, and to act as a bridge between Islamic countries." He added, "We broadcast both the effects of the war on Iraq and news provided by America itself."
Mr. Assadi said he was trying to provide good, fast reporting. As an Iraqi who lived under Saddam Hussein, he has filled his reports with details of the sufferings of his people. He has not yet come to a decision about the Americans in his country.
"America is like a new friend," said Mr. Assadi, the power flickering in the barbershop as Mr. Kerim put the finishing touches on his haircut. "I just met him. I must give him a chance."
Still, he said, "the reconstruction is going slowly." He added: "The people are unemployed. If it's a bad friend, I'll stand against it. I hope this will reach your government."

HEADLINE: THE SARS EPIDEMIC: CANADA; 
Toronto Officials Seek End to Travel Advisory

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: TORONTO, April 28 

 BODY:
Armed with fresh evidence that the SARS epidemic here is subsiding, senior Canadian health officials traveled to Geneva tonight to try to persuade the World Health Organization to retract an advisory asking visitors to put off unnecessary travel to Toronto.
 Since a single Chinese immigrant brought the mysterious respiratory disease to Toronto two months ago, 21 people have died and five more remain in critical condition. A total of 267 people have been stricken with the disease here. 
 But public health authorities here now contend that in the past five days the city has passed the worst, and that the disease is substantially under control. There has not been a new case outside the hospital system in 10 days, and the number of active cases of people ill has come down in recent days to 39. 
Only 489 of more than 7,000 people who were put in quarantine due to exposure to people with SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, remain in 10-day isolation.
"These numbers show a very encouraging trend," Dr. Colin D'Cunha, Ontario's chief medical officer, said.
Ontario's health minister, Tony Clement, will lead a delegation of experts who are scheduled to meet Tuesday with W.H.O. officials to reconsider an advisory from last Wednesday that stunned public officials and business leaders here.
W.H.O. officials said they put Toronto on a list that otherwise includes only Asian locations because of the threat that the disease could spread from here to developing countries that could not manage it. 
The organization has argued that several SARS cases in the Philippines, the United States and Australia are linked to travel in Toronto. Canada disputes that Toronto is connected to most of those cases, and says the likelihood of someone acquiring the disease in the city today outside a hospital is virtually nil.
Dick Thompson, a spokesman for the W.H.O., said senior managers would meet Tuesday to decide whether their initial decision should remain in effect. "I can't predict the outcome," he said in a telephone interview. "We would hope this is a completely public health-related decision. Otherwise everyone loses, including Toronto."
Mr. Thompson said it was not certain that the six to eight W.H.O. experts who would decide on the advisory would do so on Tuesday.
W.H.O. officials today said the worst of the epidemic appears to have passed in Singapore, Hong Kong and Canada, while it continues to race through mainland China.
Canada has put enormous pressure on the World Health Organization to reverse its decision with telephone lobbying by Prime Minister Jean Chretien and several cabinet members.
Mr. Chretien plans to spend tonight at a Toronto hotel, and hold an unusual cabinet meeting here Tuesday for symbolic purposes. Residents are calm, and masks rare.
Over the warm weekend, people were out shopping in droves even in Chinatown, as the public has become unified and defiant in protest to an advisory that residents overwhelmingly believe was unnecessary and excessive. The Toronto Blue Jays' parent company, Rogers Communications, is offering thousands of 69-cent tickets for Tuesday night's game against the Texas Rangers in an effort to attract a massive crowd that will show the world Torontonians are not afraid to go out. 
The advisory has caused the cancellations of conventions and otherwise crippled the local tourism industry, which employs 95,000 people. Economists predict that the epidemic could cost the country $30 million a day and shave 1 percent off the national economy's growth this year.
Federal Health Minister Anne McLellan said the government was considering a pilot project for Toronto's international airport to screen passengers with infrared machines that would take their temperatures.
The measure would come as a concession to the W.H.O., which would like to see tighter screening for the disease at the airport.
"There is no magic bullet," Ms. McLellan acknowledged, reminding reporters that a person could travel before suffering symptoms, which include a fever and cough.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS; 
Newspaper in Seattle Sues Rival That Is Also Partner

BYLINE:  By JACQUES STEINBERG

DATELINE: SEATTLE, April 28 

 BODY:
The Seattle Post-Intelligencer and its parent company, the Hearst Corporation, filed suit here today against the Seattle Times Company, hoping to block any attempt by The Times to dissolve a 20-year-old joint operating arrangement between the papers.
 On Saturday, The Times announced that after three years of losses it had been trying, without success, to modify the agreement that the papers use to share advertising, circulation and production costs. Under the current profit-sharing agreement, The Times receives 60 percent of what remains after common expenses; The Post-Intelligencer receives 40 percent. 
 Under a 1999 amendment to the original joint operating agreement, both The Times -- which is controlled by its original owner, the Blethen family -- and The Post-Intelligencer are entitled to begin proceedings to dissolve their relationship after three years of losses, raising the possibility that one of the papers will be shut in the process.
In a statement on Saturday, Frank A. Blethen, the publisher of The Times, said he had informed Hearst that The Times was prepared to begin those proceedings. His family owns 50.5 percent of The Times, with the remainder owned by Knight Ridder. 
"We believe they are well aware that the current agreement will yield substantial losses for the foreseeable future," said Mr. Blethen, whose great-grandfather bought The Times in 1896. "It is not our intent to let the Hearst Corporation bleed one of the few remaining independent newspapers out of existence."
In its court filing today in State Superior Court, Hearst argued that the losses sustained by The Times -- the magnitude of them has not been publicly disclosed -- are not enough to justify beginning proceedings to terminate the arrangement, because of the "extraordinary forces" that contributed to them. Hearst cited the effects of the strikes that both papers endured in late 2000 and early 2001, as well as of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the recession.
In a statement today, Victor F. Ganzi, the president and chief executive of Hearst, said: "We believe that the past three years don't constitute a fair test of this j.o.a.'s continued economic viability."
Mr. Blethen and his spokeswoman, Kerry Coughlin, said today that they had no immediate response to the suit, saying they had not yet had an opportunity to read it.
But in his statement Saturday night, Mr. Blethen said that he expected Hearst to take legal action and that "we believe it is Hearst's strategy to kill The Seattle Times."
Mr. Blethen said in his statement that "our goal is not to kill the P-I." But in a brief interview today at the annual meeting of newspaper publishers being held here he said that he did not believe that Seattle could support two daily newspapers without a joint operating agreement. 
The two newspapers, which have been battling for readers since the late 19th century, had entered into the joint operating agreement in 1983 primarily as a means to keep The Post-Intelligencer from going out of business and to prevent Seattle from becoming the latest in a growing list of American cities served by only one major daily paper. 
Under the arrangement, one of a dozen such agreements permitted by the Newspaper Preservation Act, The Times provides advertising and circulation services for both papers while each maintains separate, competitive newsgathering operations.
In the six-month period ended Sept. 30, the last for which audited figures are available, The Times had an average daily circulation of 224,139 while The Post-Intelligencer had a daily circulation of 157,557, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations.

HEADLINE: More Than Money Is at Stake in Votes ByAirline Unions 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
Workers in other industries could only dream about the rules of everyday conduct established by agreements between the major airlines and their unions over the last few decades. Pilots worked 80 hours or less during an entire month. Mechanics were paid for waving planes away from gates. Flight attendants got to stay in luxury hotels on the road.
 Over the last two years, though, billions of dollars in losses have forced not just deep pay cuts on airline unions. They also have brought an overhaul of the so-called work rules that will drastically revamp how employees of the major airlines do their jobs. The inspiration is profitable airlines like Southwest and JetBlue, and the goal is survival. 
 But the process of rewriting the rules has brought rancor between unions and management to a new high. Last week, American Airlines' parent, the AMR Corporation, was led to the brink of bankruptcy in part by a fight over flight attendants' schedules. The next test comes today, as flight attendants and machinists at United Airlines, which is bankrupt, vote on a collective $1 billion in concessions sought by the airline, which has asked a court to impose restrictive new contracts on its employees if they do not go along. 
Executives at airlines that have pushed hard to tighten work rules say the changes are a turning point. "What we've got now is a system that's significantly more competitive and frankly makes a lot more sense," said Jerrold A. Glass, the senior vice president for employee relations at US Airways.
Yet, the attack on work rules strikes at the very heart of the airline unions' strength, said Gary Chaison, a professor of industrial relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. Their dissolution is viewed within the labor movement as further erosion of the unions' sway. "These are things built over time, and once you go after them, then everything is open," he said.
United's employees are voting on a six-and-a-half-year contract that Glenn F. Tilton, the chief executive of United's parent, the UAL Corporation, called critical to the airline's future. United's pilots have already granted $1.1 billion in givebacks over that same period.
The United mechanics' union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, was the only airline union to reject contract concessions before the airline filed for bankruptcy last December.
A complicating factor this time is an organizing drive by a rival union, the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Organization, which has fought concessions at other carriers. Airline officials said yesterday that they were hopeful the contracts would be approved by both unions.
Even before United secures all its concessions, Northwest Airlines is joining the fray. It has told its employees it wants $1 billion a year in concessions, including sweeping work-rule changes, by July 1, and has issued proposals to each of its major unions.
Northwest is not in as bad shape financially as its rivals, but it has watched them successfully, if not harmoniously, roll back work rules. Only last week did Northwest's chief executive, Richard H. Anderson, raise the prospect of a Chapter 11 filing if the airline cannot get the concessions it seeks.
The situation dismayed Mollie Reiley, a veteran of three decades at the airline and trustee for Teamsters Union Local 2000, which represents its flight attendants.
"They're coming to us and asking us to undo 25 years of negotiating," said Ms. Reiley, flipping through Northwest's contract proposal in the back of a taxicab on her way into Manhattan last week to attend the airline's annual shareholders' meeting. "I don't think there's a union in the country that would willingly step up to this."
By far the most significant work-rule change is the elimination of a practice called "receipt and dispatch," in which only licensed mechanics are allowed to wave planes to or from airport gates, even though baggage handlers and other ground workers could easily do the task.
The practice required the airlines to keep hundreds more mechanics on staff than were needed to fix airplanes. It also meant mechanics, some earning $100,000 a year or more, had to be scheduled to work during the day, although repairs are made mostly at night.
US Airways has eliminated the practice at all but 6 major airports; United wants to end it at 18. In court documents, United estimated that it could eliminate almost 900 jobs if other workers could do the task.
Flight attendants at United, US Airways and American also face changes. United, which used to promise flight attendants 17 hours on the job per three-day assignment, now would guarantee only 15 hours. And it is proposing to have crews return from overseas flights after one day's rest instead of two, saving the airline on hotel bills and meals.
American stops paying flight attendants the moment they leave a jet, though they might not reach their homes or hotels for an hour or more. Steven Baumert, an American flight attendant based in Miami, said work-rule changes mean that he must spend more time on the job and that he earns less than he did for the same number of hours under the old contract.
John McCorkle, a flight attendant at US Airways who writes an industry newsletter, said, "They've basically changed every little thing, and all those little things add up to the employee working more days for less pay." 
Pilots, by far the best-paid airline employees, have also faced their share of changes. Northwest's proposal to the Air Line Pilots Association, a union with 66,000 members at 42 airlines, would raise the maximum time that a pilot can fly to 90 hours a month, from 81 hours a month now. Pilots also could end up working more days per month.
Vacation time is another target. Under Northwest's proposal, pilots would have to abandon the practice of signing up for assignments that start before their vacations end, allowing them to stretch their holidays.
Under current work rules, a pilot on a two-week vacation is allowed to bid for a trip that begins the latter part of the second week. Because the vacationing pilot is not available to come to the airport, the airline must call in a reserve pilot, one who is not actively on the job, to take the shift. The pilot who signed up for the assignment gets paid and gets the time off, while the reserve pilot does the work and also gets paid.
US Airways already bans that practice, and its contract eliminated another work rule that sometimes caused flights to be delayed for hours. Under previous contracts, if a pilot called in sick, the airline had to bring in a reserve pilot to replace the ill pilot, even if there were pilots on hand at the airport waiting for flights that were hours away. Passengers simply had to wait until the reserve pilot arrived. Now, the airline is allowed to assign the flight to a waiting pilot, and turn that pilot's later assignment to the reserve pilot when he or she arrives.
Mr. Glass, the US Airways vice president, said the streamlining has only begun. "To be competitive and survive, we have to keep working at improving the systems we have, and we're not there yet," he said.
But Ms. Reiley, the Teamsters trustee, said her members were "getting very angry" and would keep fighting to protect their contracts.

An article in Business Day on Tuesday about changing work rules in the airline industry referred incompletely to the hours worked by pilots in a month. While contracts with the airlines limit them to about 80 hours in the cockpit, they spend additional time on other duties.

HEADLINE: Congress, Back at Work, Tries to Mend Breach Over Tax Cut 

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28 

 BODY:
Congress returned today, and Congressional Republicans quickly set out to devise a strategy to enact President Bush's proposed tax cut and repair a rift between House and Senate leaders over the size of the reduction.
 Congressional aides said the House speaker, J. Dennis Hastert, and the Senate majority leader, Bill Frist, were scheduled to meet Tuesday evening at the White House with President Bush, with the tax package and the spring legislative agenda likely to be major topics of discussion. The full Republican leadership of the House and the Senate is to hear from the president on Wednesday morning. 
 "This will be a discussion about the Congressional agenda," said Bob Stevenson, a spokesman for Dr. Frist, about the Tuesday session. "Obviously the jobs and growth package will figure into that." 
It will be the first meeting between the president and his two chief allies in Congress since a budget deal reached two weeks ago in the Senate deteriorated into acrimony over Dr. Frist's failure to tell his House counterparts about an agreement among some senators to hold tax cuts to $350 billion, rather than $550 billion sought by the House.
Mr. Stevenson said Dr. Frist, who spent much of the two-week recess in Asia on a Senate trip, realized he had slipped up by not informing the House and was trying to contend with the consequences while pushing for the largest possible tax cut number.
"It goes with the turf," said Mr. Stevenson, about the criticism leveled at the majority leader.
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, said he "absolutely" believed that Dr. Frist would be able to put the issue behind him. After an hourlong private meeting of Senate Republican leaders late this afternoon, Mr. McConnell said he did not think the dispute would present "any lasting problem either within the Senate or across the Capitol," referring to the House.
In the House, officials said the leadership was trying to move beyond the political spat and make some progress on the tax cut package, the chief Republican domestic economic initiative.
"We don't have to have some rehash of what went wrong," said Stuart Roy, a spokesman for the House majority leader, Tom DeLay. Mr. DeLay had said immediately after learning of the Senate side deal that there could be long-term consequences for the House-Senate relationship. Mr. Roy said Mr. DeLay's view now was "that we don't need some big mea culpa meeting to hold hands and sing 'Kumbaya.' " He said the best solution was to get an acceptable tax deal.
House officials also said there was sentiment that Dr. Frist was entitled to some leeway for being so new in his job, which he took over in January after Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, was forced to step down.
Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the Republican who is chairman of the committee that will have to write the tax plan, said today that he expected the House to pass tax cut legislation near the full $550 billion, while the Senate would probably be closer to "$350 billion plus," with any amount over the $350 billion offset by spending cuts or other tax changes.
In an interview on CNN, Mr. Grassley also appeared to issue a warning to Mr. Bush and fellow Republicans that they should tread more lightly when it comes to pressuring some in the party to back a bigger tax cut.
Conservative groups have been running advertisements criticizing two Republican senators, Olympia J. Snowe of Maine and George V. Voinovich of Ohio, for opposing a larger tax cut, and Mr. Bush last week campaigned for the tax cut in Mr. Voinovich's home state.
"If Republicans push too hard, you have what happened to us two years ago, with Senator Jeffords leaving the party," said Mr. Grassley, referring to the party switch by James M. Jeffords of Vermont that cost Republicans control of the Senate in 2001. He quickly added that he knew of no Senate moderate considering a switch but said that Republicans should "learn from history."
As the Senate went back to business, Democrats and Republicans picked up where they had left off, with a floor fight over a judicial nomination. This time the center of the fight was Jeffrey Sutton, selected by Mr. Bush to serve on an appeals court in Cincinnati. Mr. Sutton's nomination is being opposed by Democrats and some advocates for the disabled, who question his record as a lawyer on disability issues. A vote is expected Tuesday.
Dr. Frist, in a speech to a medical group today, did try to restore some momentum for another domestic initiative, the administration's proposal to provide some prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries.
In a speech to the American Hospital Association meeting, Dr. Frist said the "legislative stars in Washington are aligned" for adding a prescription drug benefit to the health insurance plan for older Americans. He said he expected a Senate vote on a drug plan before the Fourth of July recess, with the House potentially moving more quickly.
But he warned that the window for approving a plan was narrow, with the presidential election campaign becoming a factor after the summer. Democrats say the president's $400 billion plan is not comprehensive enough.

HEADLINE: Finding Fraud on Wall Street 

 BODY:
After five months of negotiating the fine print, 10 Wall Street firms accused of issuing tainted stock research agreed yesterday to the terms of a landmark $1.4 billion settlement. Three of the firms -- Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney, Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse First Boston -- were charged with actually issuing "fraudulent" stock recommendations. This unambiguous language, not the fines' dollar amounts, may be the most significant outcome of the inquiry undertaken by the New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, and other regulators. 
 The language sets the record clear: brokerage firms compromised their integrity in an effort to curry favor with their banking clients at the expense of individual investors. Along with a treasure trove of new evidence, this finding should strengthen the legal position of investors seeking restitution through private litigation. 
 Jack Grubman and Henry Blodget, analysts who became celebrities during the market bubble, agreed to a lifetime ban from the securities industry. They will also pay fines totaling $19 million, a modest sum in light of their combined compensation and the nature of their behavior. But as with their former employers -- Citigroup and Merrill Lynch -- these fines may represent only a fraction of their eventual liability. 
Mr. Spitzer's inquiry became front-page news when he produced e-mail showing how Mr. Blodget, Merrill's Internet analyst, touted stocks he privately called "junk." Mr. Grubman issued similarly inflated valuations to please Citigroup's investment banking clients. Evidence released yesterday also pointed to improper contacts between Mr. Grubman and Sanford Weill, Citigroup's chairman. Citigroup is paying the largest penalty and is being singled out for the most intrusive monitoring of its research operations.
The settlement's structural reforms, announced last December, are aimed at insulating research analysts from their investment-banking brethren. Brokerage firms must also provide clients with competing independent research and end the infamous practice, called "spinning," of allotting hot initial public offering shares to favored clients. Firms are already adopting many of these reforms to regain investors' trust. Even experienced investors were shocked to discover how widespread these practices were. The settlement should be closely monitored to prevent their reappearance.

HEADLINE: WALL STREET SETTLEMENT: THE ATTORNEY GENERAL; 
Finding Fraud On Wall St. May Be a Step To Higher Post

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28 

 BODY:
The question was about tax loopholes and whether the 10 securities firms that agreed to pay $1.4 billion to resolve charges of wrongdoing by their research analysts would be able to squirm out of their plight by writing off their fines. It put the men behind the lectern at the Securities and Exchange Commission's headquarters on the spot.
 But not Eliot Spitzer. "Maybe I can be a little less discreet," Mr. Spitzer, the attorney general from New York, chimed in. "I always try to be." 
 With that, he shifted the focus to Congress, urging lawmakers to act to close the loopholes, and insisting his office and the S.E.C. had done their jobs.
"Spoken like a man whose Hill is in Albany and not in Washington," said William H. Donaldson, the chairman of the S.E.C., to laughter. 
Mr. Spitzer's hill, some say, is just about anywhere he wants it to be these days, having been indiscreet enough to take on the biggest names on Wall Street during a relentless investigation of securities fraud. For more than a year, he has plunged forward, making cases and headlines along the way, and some say paving his future with stepping stones bearing the names of Henry Blodget, Jack B. Grubman and the like.
At the news conference here today announcing the settlement of the case against the 10 firms, Mr. Spitzer was just one player of many. Nonetheless, it was a defining moment for Mr. Spitzer, who just five years ago took a gamble and used his family's vast wealth to oust Dennis C. Vacco, the Republican attorney general at the time.
As attorney general, Mr. Spitzer revived the long-dormant Martin Act, a 1921 state law giving the attorney general of New York jurisdiction over securities trading.
Mr. Spitzer uncovered, among other things, damaging e-mail messages among stock analysts at Merrill Lynch & Company, the nation's biggest brokerage firm and a mainstay of New York's financial community. He accused the analysts of urging customers to buy stocks that the analysts believed were losing bets just so that Merrill could curry favor with companies it wanted as clients.
In doing the job, Mr. Spitzer, 43, has followed in the tradition of activist and consumer-oriented attorneys general, like Louis J. Lefkowitz, who set the standard, and Robert Abrams.
But in his prepared remarks, he likened the pursuit of Wall Street evildoers to another crusader, Theodore Roosevelt, the populist Republican president who dubbed himself a Trust Buster and crusaded against unchecked corporate wealth and power.
"We are at a rare moment," he said. "It is akin to the moment we were at 100 years ago."
Before he was president, Mr. Roosevelt was New York's governor, and many say that is the real goal of Mr. Spitzer.
Indeed, many of those who make their living from Wall Street are seething over Mr. Spitzer, blaming him for pursuing scandal at the expense of their livelihoods and New York's economy. Many complain, quietly, of course, that Mr. Spitzer has relentlessly undermined the public's trust in the stock market while boosting his own political fortunes.
Many of Mr. Spitzer's fellow Democrats, however, feel otherwise.
"New York Democrats need someone who can galvanize them," said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic consultant in New York who was one of Mr. Spitzer's campaign advisers in 1988. "Eliot Spitzer appears to be that person right now."
 "This is not without its perils," Mr. Sheinkopf added. "The danger is that he has angered a large portion of New York's traditional fund-raising base, Wall Street."
Mr. Spitzer, in an interview after the news conference, acknowledged the potential difficulties. "This case has left me without some friends I had before," he said.
But, he said, it might have made him friends elsewhere. "I've got a job to do and I'm going to do it," he said. "I hate to sound overly moralistic, but it's the only way to do this job."
Mr. Spitzer also said it was premature for him to talk about a possible campaign for governor, though people in both parties say he is the man to beat should he choose to run for governor in 2006. "All I can tell you is that I have made no decision about that," he said.

HEADLINE: Powell, Denouncing Crackdown, Calls Cuba 'Aberration' in West 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 28 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell criticized Cuba today as an "aberration in the Western Hemisphere" and said the administration is studying ways to respond to the Havana government's recent crackdown on its critics.
 "We're reviewing all of our policies and our approach toward Cuba in light of what I think is a deteriorating human rights situation," Mr. Powell told reporters after a meeting with the Jordanian foreign minister. 
 In recent weeks, a growing number of longtime advocates of greater engagement with Cuba have voiced dismay at President Fidel Castro's actions, including jailing about 75 government critics and human rights advocates and executing three men who hijacked a ferry to try to reach the United States.
"This is disastrous," said Pamela Falk, a professor of international law who has worked to increase cultural visits to Cuba and expand sales of American grain there. "Castro and the government of Cuba have managed to alienate any allies they had."
Representative Jo Ann Emerson, a Missouri Republican who has been at the forefront of opening Cuba to agricultural sales, said she was "appalled and outraged" at the recent executions and jailings.
"My colleagues in Congress and those in the agricultural community deeply believe that exporting our food is good policy for the Cuban people," Ms. Emerson said. "But unless the Cuban regime reverses course, peaceful political and economic change in Cuba will be impossible to achieve."
The entire board of directors of one pro-engagement organization, the Cuba Policy Group, resigned last week in protest. Brian Alexander, the former executive director of the foundation, said some board members were distressed that some of Cuba's best-known dissidents were included in the roundup.
"Every person who has gone to Cuba in recent months probably now knows a political prisoner," he said. "That takes it to a personal level."
Mr. Castro has defended his actions, saying the executions were necessary to curtail a wave of hijacking. In a speech on Friday, he said it was necessary to imprison dissidents to keep James C. Cason, the chief of the American diplomatic mission in Havana, from stirring up antigovernment protests.

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: THE PRESIDENT; 
Bush, Visiting Michigan, Promises All Iraqis a Voice in a New Government

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., April 28 

 BODY:
President Bush said today that he would make good on his promise to bring stability to Iraq, and that Iraqis of all faiths and ethnic backgrounds could be assured of a voice in their new government.
 Speaking to an audience made up mainly of Iraqi immigrants, Mr. Bush gave an upbeat account of progress being made by the United States in restoring water and power supplies, addressing health care needs, distributing food and restoring order to the streets. 
 "Every day, Iraqis are moving toward democracy and embracing the responsibilities of active citizenship," he said. "Every day, life in Iraq improves as coalition troops work to secure unsafe areas and bring food and medical care to those in need." 
Mr. Bush did not make any long-term financial commitment to rebuilding Iraq, referring only to the $2.5 billion Congress has already approved for the initial costs. He also avoided any specific predictions about how long the United States would retain a civilian or military presence in Iraq, though he counseled patience after decades of dictatorship.
Saying Iraq had embarked on a "hard journey," he said the United States would stand by Iraq as it worked toward a representative government and a role as an anchor of regional stability.
"America pledged to rid Iraq of an oppressive regime, and we kept our word," he said to cheers from the crowd. "America now pledges to help Iraqis build a prosperous and peaceful nation, and we will keep our word again."
Mr. Bush was interrupted several times by the exuberant crowd, which chanted, "U.S.A., U.S.A!" While he was recounting the story of an Iraqi immigrant to the United States who said she never believed Saddam Hussein would be gone, a man in the audience yelled, "He's gone!"
"You're right he's gone," Mr. Bush replied. 
He said all the people of Iraq, whether "Sunni or Shia or Kurd or Chaldean or Assyrian or Turkoman or Christian or Jew or Muslim," should have a place as Iraq chooses its own leaders.
"America has no intention of imposing our form of government or culture," he said. "Yet, we will ensure that all Iraqis have a voice in the new government and all citizens have their rights protected."
Mr. Bush is expected to proclaim formally this week that the combat operation in Iraq is over. In the one I-told-you-so moment in his speech, he noted that there were people who had doubted that the United States and its allies would be welcomed as a liberating force in Iraq.
"They were mistaken, and we know why," he said. "The desire for freedom is not the property of one culture, it is the universal hope of human beings in every culture."
In Baghdad today, about 300 Iraqi political figures met at the invitation of the United States and Britain, and agreed to call a conference in a month to begin selecting a postwar government for Iraq.
But in a round-table meeting here before his speech with 17 Iraqi-Americans of diverse faiths and backgrounds, Mr. Bush got a first-hand taste of the difficulties he will face in encouraging cooperation and accommodation among Iraq's religious and ethnic groups.
Asad Khailany, a Sunni Muslim Kurd who is a leader of the Kurdish movement in the United States, suggested to the president that Iraq be divided into three autonomous or semiautonomous regions, each with a government reflecting the ethnic and religious makeup of its people. 
Another participant in the discussion, Tarik Daoud, a Christian who was born in Iraq and who had earlier stressed the need to view Iraqis as one people, began to disagree with Mr. Khailany, but Mr. Bush quickly broke in to bring the argument to an end almost before it had begun.
"We're not going to have a debate on the form of the government," Mr. Bush said. "This debate is going to take place in Iraq."
Later he added, "The political issues, which you're rightly concerned about, become easier to deal with when the human condition is improved in a noticeable way."
Mr. Bush heard mostly praise from the 17 participants in the round-table discussion, many of whom urged the United States to stay in Iraq for as long as it takes to insure stability and a transition to a stable government. Despite widespread criticism from the large Arab-American population in the Detroit area that the administration's immigration policies and its aggressive effort to root out terrorism have infringed on civil liberties, none of the participants raised the issue with Mr. Bush.
Mark Dickow, who was born in Iraq and is now a lawyer in Michigan, said he was looking forward to Mr. Bush's winning another term in the White House. Mr. Bush replied, "Forget that, please," adding, "Let's just make sure Iraq works."
It was Mr. Bush's ninth trip as president to Michigan, a state he lost to Al Gore in 2000. In addition to the round-table discussion and the speech, he also met here with the top executives of the three big automobile manufacturers to seek their help in pushing his tax cut through Congress and to ask their views of how the economy is faring.
The White House did not provide any details of the meeting, but the auto executives said afterward that they supported the president's tax plan, including its call for eliminating the tax on stock dividends.

HEADLINE: Citing Funds, Ballet Tech Cancels Next Season 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER DUNNING 

 BODY:
Eliot Feld's Ballet Tech company will suspend operations for the 2003-4 season, canceling three engagements at the Joyce Theater, Mr. Feld announced yesterday, saying he had made the decision to avoid a projected deficit of $665,000. The company-affiliated school, which offers free dance training and academic instruction to New York City public schoolchildren, will continue, he said. 
 "The cause is twofold," Mr. Feld said in a statement. "One: the pervasive economic woes have affected us much in the same way as they have others, stalling both earned and unearned income. Two: our principal supporter, the LuEsther Mertz Charitable Trust, has gradually reduced its grants to us from a high in 1994 of $822,290 (24 percent of our expenses) to a promise of $350,000 (8 percent of our expenses) in 2004." 
 A spokesman for the charitable trust declined to comment.
The suspension is the first among major American dance companies as they try to cope with the troubled economy. "There has been a general consolidation within many of the companies," said Andrea Snyder, executive director of Dance/USA, a national service organization. "Companies have shortened seasons and downsized dancers." She said middle-size companies like Mr. Feld's, which has 14 dancers and a budget of $4 million, appeared to be struggling the hardest. 
John Munger, director of research and information at Dance/USA, said earned income and public and private giving to companies like Ballet Tech had not changed greatly from 2000 to 2002. "But my indicators suggest that we may see nasty cutoffs," Mr. Munger said, citing recent cutbacks by the Pew Charitable Trust and the McKnight Foundation and a trend of radical adjustments in state arts financing. 
Mr. Feld said the company had held its own in public and private grants this year with the exception of the Mertz Charitable Trust, the company's principal donor. He said he had cut four dancers from the roster and had made cutbacks in set, lighting and costume design as well as in his own salary, and had reduced the school staff. 
The training program, founded in 1978 in partnership with the city, has an annual budget of $1.8 million and provides dance and, from fourth grade on, academic training to 135 children selected by audition from 450 schools. 
"The Board of Ballet Tech Foundation will try mightily during this next year to formalize a sustainable collaboration, both educational and economic, with our partner of 25 years, the New York City Department of Education," Mr. Feld said in his statement.

HEADLINE: Art Auctions Buffeted by Events; 
In an Uncertain Season, 'Distress Sales' and Thinner Catalogs

BYLINE:  By CAROL VOGEL 

 BODY:
Times could not have been worse for Sotheby's, for Christie's and for Phillips, de Pury & Luxembourg. Just as their experts began trying to persuade sellers to put their precious Monets or Warhols on the auction block in sales beginning next week, it seemed the world was against them.
 What collector would want to sell in a shaky economy with war in the air? To make matters worse, no superrich collectors died this winter, so there were no big estates that an auction house could use as bait to lure other property. 
 "In some ways it was harder than after Sept. 11," said David Norman, director of Sotheby's Impressionist and modern art department in New York. "After Sept. 11 the event had occurred. There was disruption and there was fear. This time we were working against the unknown. We were asking for consignments before a war." 
When times are tough, however, distress sales are often what bolster the market. It is no wonder, then, that paintings, drawings and sculptures are being sold this year by troubled companies like Vivendi, Enron and Idemitsu Kosan, Japan's second-largest oil refiner. There is also property from Galerie Seomi, a Korean art gallery, which experts say needs to raise cash to pay debts from clients who defaulted on payments.
Other sellers this spring include personalities like Peter Brant, the newsprint magnate; Jocelyn Wildenstein, the former wife of the art dealer Alec Wildenstein; and Charles Saatchi, the collector and advertising magnate. There are seasoned risk takers selling, too, like Ronald Lauder, the cosmetics heir, and Francois Pinault, the owner of Christie's. Both men have their auction house loyalties, their focused collecting agendas and their belief that great art will sell in any climate.
Most of the catalogs are thinner than in the past. And fearing leaner times, experts were particularly concerned about keeping estimates reasonable.
"We felt it was wiser to have 31 lots of good quality that were well priced and saleable than 50 lots and have a struggle," said Nicholas Maclean, co-head of Christie's Impressionist and modern art department. The work of young, contemporary artists are noticeably absent from sales this spring; experts said they didn't want to take the risk on some of these artists, whose prices seemed to have peaked recently. But the sales include something for almost every other taste. Looking for classic, Impressionist art? Sotheby's sale on May 6 has several outstanding examples. One, a Renoir portrait, "In the Roses (Madame Leon Clapisson)," from 1882, may well turn out to be the season's most expensive painting.
This painting, of a French gentleman's wife sitting in her garden, has not been seen since 1937, when it was part of an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. While Sotheby's will not say anything about the sellers, the catalogue raisonne of the artist says Mrs. Huguette M. Clark, a Manhattan collector, owns the painting. It is expected to fetch $20 million to $30 million.
Sotheby's is also offering two Degas pastels being sold by the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. One, "Dancer" from 1885-90, depicts a lone dancer on a stage as she is about to take her bow. It is estimated to sell for $9 million to $12 million. Christie's also has an important Degas in its May 7 auction of Impressionist and modern art. The work, "Little Dancer at 14," one of his famous bronzes, is a posthumous 1922 cast of a dancer with a cream-colored grosgrain silk bodice and a tulle-and-gauze tutu. Mr. Pinault is selling it after owning it for four years. He bought it for $12.3 million at Sotheby's in 1999.
That sculpture is not the most expensive work in Christie's sale. A Cezanne self-portrait comes with an estimate of $15 million to $20 million. Still the price is low considering that the Wildenstein Gallery was recently offering it privately for $50 million. Painted in 1895 when the artist was 55, it is a sober portrait conveying a kind of wariness through his use of highly arched eyebrows and a penetrating stare. While Christie's will not confirm who the seller is, experts say it belongs to the Iemitsu Kosan Company, which reported in December that it was reducing its $11.4 billion debt.
Competition this season will not be just among auction houses but among artists as well. Big ticket works by masters like Klein, Giacometti and Rothko will go head-to-head, sometimes in the same evening auction. Both Sotheby's and Christie's have a Giacometti sculpture of five gaunt female figures on a rectangular base. Both were conceived in 1950. The only difference is that Christie's bronze has been painted by the artist while Sotheby's has not. The work at Christie's, which is considered the rarer of the two because of the painted surface, is estimated to sell for $8 million to $12 million. The one at Sotheby's is expected to fetch $8 million to $10 million.
Christie's sale of postwar and contemporary art on May 14 has two Rothkos painted a year apart. The smaller of the two, "Brown and Blacks in Reds" from 1957, is 90 inches by 60 inches. It is from the Seagram Collection that Vivendi inherited when it bought the company two years ago. Now this troubled entertainment conglomerate is selling its assets, and the Rothko is expected to bring $6 million to $8 million.
Mr. Pinault is selling the other Rothko in Christie's sale. "No. 9 (White and Black on Wine)" from 1958 is much bigger, 105 inches by 166 inches. This year Mr. Pinault bought a group of important Rothkos that were on loan to the National Gallery in Washington from Bunny Mellon, the widow of Paul Mellon, whose father, Andrew W. Mellon, helped found the National Gallery of Art in Washington. The reason Mr. Pinault is selling this one, experts say, is that he does not believe it is as good as the ones from Mrs. Mellon. Christie's painting, one of this artist's larger classic abstract compositions, is estimated to sell for $8 million to $12 million.
Mr. Pinault is also selling a rare Yves Klein, "Re2" from 1958, one of his trademark deep blue monochromatic paintings with sponges. The next night Phillips is selling "Re 21," another of his monochromatic blue paintings. Christie's Klein is the smaller of the two, measuring roughly 53 inches by 47 inches, and experts say the composition is more successful. (It is estimated to sell for $3 million to $4 million.) Meanwhile Phillips's work from 1960 is larger, measuring 78 inches by 65 inches, and is expected to bring $6 million to $8 million. It, too, comes with impeccable provenance. The seller is Ronald S. Lauder, chairman of the Museum of Modern Art and a friend of Daniella Luxembourg, Phillips's president. It was for sale last summer at the Gagosian Gallery on Madison Avenue.
Phillips, which has moved its headquarters from West 57th Street to Chelsea and drastically reduced its staff and sales schedule, will not have an auction of Impressionist and modern art this spring. It is having a sale of contemporary art on May 15. About three weeks ago, when experts there learned of the Klein Christie's was selling, Phillips changed the date of its sale from Monday, May 12, to Thursday, May 15, because it expected to have a better chance selling its Klein if its auction was second.
"It wasn't specifically about the Klein," said Michael McGinnis, head of the Phillips contemporary art department. "But yes, we're probably in a better position coming in second."
The Phillips sale, like Sotheby's and Christie's contemporary art auctions, is offering fewer works by emerging artists. "That bubbly moment of young people buying cutting-edge art is over," said Tobias Meyer, director of Sotheby's contemporary art worldwide. "People now want the classics, art that endures." Sotheby's for example, is selling a group of works that are designated from the AG Foundation, named for Agnes Gund, the philanthropist and collector. Among the best of the group is Pollock's "No. 17, 1949," one of the artist's famous drip paintings. This one is expected to bring $5 million to $7 million.
Christie's sale on May 14 is the largest of the three, and it, too, features a more classic selection of artists. Besides the Rothkos and the Klein, it has an outstanding rare 1947 work by Gorky. "Year After Year," an unusually lush abstract painting, was sold at Christie's 10 years ago for $3.8 million. Now it has an asking price of $13 million to $15 million. Since there are almost no Gorky paintings from this date in private hands, and since it is what several serious collectors are looking for, Christie's experts do not seem worried by the price.
"People are still buying," said Brett Gorvey, co-head of Christie's postwar and contemporary art department. "All the same players we saw last season are back. The big question is whether the Koreans will be buyers, and whether the market can absorb all that's up for sale."

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
Improving the Neighborhood at Ohio State

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio, April 23 

 BODY:
After antiwar demonstrations some three decades ago at Ohio State University, many merchants along High Street, the commercial road just east of the sprawling campus, boarded up their windows. The university turned its back on the unsightly street and began expanding in the opposite direction, across the Olentangy River to the west.
 But in recent years, university officials have concluded that the jumble of fast-food restaurants and dilapidated storefronts along the stretch of High Street bordering the campus has made it harder to attract high-caliber students and faculty. More than half of Ohio State's 48,000 students live in the suburbs rather than on or near the campus. 
 So, like many universities these days, Ohio State is trying to improve its neighborhood -- most visibly by transforming a 7.4-acre site on High Street, just south of the law school, into a mixed-use project intended both to attract shoppers and stimulate investment. 
The land, now cleared, was once home to 32 businesses, many of them bars that had struggled for more than a decade after the legal drinking age was raised to 21 from 18. About half a mile to the south is the Short North, a neighborhood known for its galleries and antique stores.
Later this year, Campus Partners for Community Urban Development, a nonprofit group created by the university and the city (but controlled by the university), hopes finally to begin building the $120 million project. To be called South Campus Gateway, it is expected to include five buildings with 250,000 square feet of retail space, 70,000 square feet of offices, 200 apartments and parking for 1,200 cars.
To manage the development of the site and handle retail leasing, Campus Partners recently turned to Jones Lang LaSalle, one of several big real estate companies with divisions specializing in helping universities improve their surroundings, get more value out of their real estate and build student housing.
The company has worked with 16 colleges and universities, including the University of Pennsylvania, Georgia Tech and San Jose State University. It has been involved in developing 3.3 million square feet of space for schools and manages 1.3 million more. 
Other real estate companies, including Trammell Crow and the Staubach Company, have also recognized that university development can be an attractive niche. "You're going to see more and more of it," said Gregory S. Latran, who manages higher education services for Trammell Crow. "It's going to be very important from a competitive standpoint for universities to look at not only what they control within the campus envelope but also what's outside it."
This month Howard University announced that Trammell Crow would be the lead developer in a project to rebuild a rundown area near its campus in Washington, D.C.
Universities like Ohio State that coexist uneasily with low-income neighborhoods have two choices, said Terry D. Foegler, the president of Campus Partners. They can either wall themselves off from the community, or engage in "enlightened self-interest."
In 1994, after a woman in the freshman class was killed half a block from High Street, Ohio State created Campus Partners, not only to improve the shopping district but also to increase home ownership in a poor residential neighborhood to the east of High Street, Weiland Park. 
A number of universities have set up nonprofit entities to handle their real estate transactions, but Mr. Foegler argues that his organization is unusual because it is devoted to neighborhood revitalization rather than university expansion.
In addition to the Gateway project, Campus Partners is working with the Ohio Capital Corporation for Housing to acquire and rehabilitate more than 1,300 substandard homes in the area. It started a modest program to encourage faculty members to move to the neighborhood by giving them $3,000 no-interest loans that will be forgiven over five years. It is also trying to create a business improvement district for High Street.
Operating semi-independently has helped defuse some of the suspicion that commonly surrounds town-gown relationships. Wayne Garland, president of Buckeye Real Estate, which owns or manages 1,100 apartments near the school, said Campus Partners' approach was more inclusive than the university's. "They are trying to involve all the stakeholders and get feedback from everybody," he said. "I personally would not have given them the same amount of support if I thought the university was making all the decisions."
Campus Partners qualified for the New Markets Tax Credit program initiated in the Clinton administration to stimulate economic development in low-income neighborhoods. In March, Campus Partners was awarded $35 million in tax-credit allocations that will allow investors a 39 percent tax credit. The money will be used to finance Gateway's retail development, Mr. Foegler said.
The $20 million to acquire the land for Gateway came from the university endowment fund. The city of Columbus has agreed to spend $5.7 million to bury power lines and make other improvements, and the state will pay $4.5 million toward the cost of the parking structure. Most of the remaining money will come from bonds. The university also contributed $5 million toward the purchase of other real estate on High Street.
The Druker Company of Boston was initially selected as the developer and as an equity partner in the project. But last year, Campus Partners decided that it no longer needed an equity partner because the venture's risk had been substantially reduced. A Barnes & Noble bookstore had signed a 20-year lease for 50,000 square feet of space at Gateway, the office space would be leased by the university, and about 70 percent of the housing was to be set aside for law students.
"We were bringing a lot to the table," Mr. Foegler said. Ronald M. Druker said that since his family-owned development company did not handle development on a fee basis, "we felt they would be best served by bringing in someone else."
In January, Jones Lang LaSalle was brought in to replace Druker. Herman E. Bulls, chief executive of the company's public institutions group, said it did not invest in university real estate ventures but operated as a developer on a fee basis. Private and institutional developers often make unsuitable equity partners, Mr. Bulls said. "What happens is that the private developer is looking for an exit strategy," he said, "while the institutional developer wants to be there forever."
An equity developer would also demand a higher rate of return than a university, making it likely that most of the retail space would be leased to national chain stores.
Many in Columbus fear that chain stores will predominate at Gateway. But Robert Welanetz, a consultant who is on Gateway's leasing team, said the goal was to have a mix of local, regional and national retailers, with the national chains occupying no more than 35 percent of the space.
Campus Partners has been criticized for its slow pace, and Mr. Foegler said he spent his first 18 months on the job working with dozens of community groups to gain their support. The task of assembling the land took two years, requiring legal action against some owners that was settled out of court.
Thomas L. Lussenhop, president and chief executive of Columbus Downtown Development, a nonprofit group, was the managing director of real estate for the University of Pennsylvania in the 1990's when it built Sansom Common in West Philadelphia, a site that Penn had owned for years. It included a 55,000-square-foot bookstore, a 238-room hotel and 100,000 square feet of retail, restaurant and entertainment space. Mr. Lussenhop said that the careful approach of Campus Partners would pay off.
"The fact that it's taking a long time," he said, "is merely reflective of the fact that they took on a hard problem. If it were easy to do, the market would have done it."

HEADLINE: THE SARS EPIDEMIC: MARKETS; 
Stocks Rise in Asia on Hopes That Worst of SARS Is Over

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, April 29 

 BODY:
Stock markets rose sharply across most of East Asia today as investors gained hope that an outbreak of a deadly respiratory disease could be brought under control.
 The advances today, led by airline shares, came after a World Health Organization official said that the risk to travelers from SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, was overestimated. 
 The W.H.O. announced Monday that the disease appeared to have peaked and gone into decline in Canada, Singapore and here, and had disappeared in Vietnam, although it is still spreading in mainland China and Taiwan.
The Hang Seng index here leaped 3.6 percent today on the heaviest trading volume in eight months. The Singapore market rose 3.5 percent; South Korea's broad market soared 5 percent; the ASX 200 index in Australia increased 1.2 percent; and the Jakarta market climbed 3 percent. 
Even the stock market in Taiwan climbed 1.4 percent, after three days of heavy losses and despite the quarantine today of a second hospital after 17 workers were suspected of having contracted SARS.
In the currency markets, the New Taiwan dollar, the Japanese yen and many other Asian currencies strengthened against the United States dollar today; Japanese financial markets were closed for a holiday, however.
The exception today was the Shanghai stock market, which dropped 1.8 percent, but this was just half of its gains on Monday. 
The China Securities Regulatory Commission announced this evening the closing of stock markets and futures markets in mainland China until May 12.
While the commission did not explain its action, exchange officials in Shanghai had been predicting that such a move would be made in an effort to control the spread of SARS at once-crowded brokerage firms and trading halls.
At the end of the morning session today at the Hong Kong Exchange, traders took off their bright red jackets and headed for lunch after the market's first big gains since the local government announced an outbreak of a mysterious respiratory disease nearly seven weeks ago.
Donna Tsang, a trader wearing a soft pink face mask that matched her blouse and skirt, said that the SARS problem appeared to be ebbing somewhat. "SARS is not over, it has just calmed down," she said, adding that recent gains on Wall Street had played little role in today's advance.
The exchange urges floor traders to wear face masks and hands them out free, but half the traders were not wearing them today. Masks are also becoming less common on the streets in Hong Kong, the city hardest hit by the disease. There were 12 more deaths from SARS here today, raising the total to 150. 
But there were just 15 new cases of SARS here today, while 49 people were discharged from hospitals after recovering from the disease. Dr. Margaret Chan, Hong Kong's health director, warned this afternoon that people should not let down their guard yet.
"We need to maintain our vigilance," she said at a news conference. 
William C. Belchere, an economist with J. P. Morgan Chase, said that many participants in financial markets remained concerned about the continued spread of the disease in mainland China. Nine more deaths were reported there today, raising the total to 148, along with 202 new cases.
But given that SARS has been present in China since November, there should be hundreds of thousands of cases by now if the disease spread easily, instead of the 3,303 cases reported over the last five months, Mr. Belchere said.
"It looks like the worst of SARS is by us, and that gets people back to fundamentals and the balance sheets of companies," he said. 
Even with today's rally, Asian markets have substantially underperformed markets elsewhere, especially Wall Street. Fears of SARS have sharply curtailed demand in many regional economies, even though the limited number of actual illnesses has meant little disruption in the supply of goods and services.
Many economists are still reducing their forecasts for China's economic output this year as tourism, both domestic and foreign, has collapsed; retail sales have weakened; and the sales of many service businesses, from restaurants to hotels, have slowed. While China's output for the full year is expected to increase as much as 6 percent or 7 percent, the Chinese economy is now widely forecast to shrink somewhat in the current quarter and show slow growth in the next quarter even if the disease is brought under control fairly soon.
But stock markets had been weak across much of East Asia through March and much of April on fears that SARS would be even worse. There had been worries that the disease would infect millions of people within months, as was the case with some of the flu pandemics of the 20th century, and that a widespread outbreak would cause even greater economic disruption than is now seen.
Some floor traders here said that for all the ebullience today, a considerable risk remained both to financial markets and to people as long as the disease remained out of control in China. 
"I'm surprised that the market went up," said Shum Yan-yee, leaving the trading floor today. "SARS may not be over very soon."

HEADLINE: First, the War; Now, Investor Consequences 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
The nation's first military foray under its new doctrine of pre-emption ended in victory, but the war and the uncertainty it created still cost the economy dearly. Those consequences, along with the potential for more diplomatic and military conflicts, are giving some international investors pause as they decide where in the world to put their capital.
 "The American administration has made it clear that they wish to take that battle to more than just Iraq," said Martin M. Gagen, chief executive of the 3i Corporation for the United States and Asia. 3i is Europe's biggest venture capital firm. 
 "My working assumption is that there will be other events," he said. "It may not be as significant as invading another country, but you could see very high-level diplomatic initiatives against these countries overseas. You'd be foolish to think it would have no impact on the economics." 
In the eyes of many investors, the United States' fundamental economic strength continues to justify its place as a favored target for capital. They still see the flexibility of the nation's markets and its prospects for growth as superior to those of Europe and Japan, and they cite these factors as the most important for investment. But by influencing the economy, the federal budget and international relations, American foreign policy has begun to creep into the picture.
"America is more dependent on the rest of the world for capital than at any time in the past 50 years," said David P. Bowers, chief global investment strategist of Merrill Lynch. "What the rest of the world is being asked to fund is very different from what they were being asked to fund three years ago. Three years ago they were being asked to fund a private sector miracle. Now they're being asked to fund Bush's tax cuts and the war on Iraq."
Mr. Bowers, speaking from London, asserted that America's foreign policy had created tension and vulnerability in its economic situation. "At the end of the day, the U.S. is prepared to act unilaterally," he said. "The bottom line is that if you are a net debtor to the rest of the world, ultimately you have to be multilateral."
In an article he wrote two weeks ago, Mr. Bowers cited "a geopolitical change under way that could spell trouble for the funding of the U.S. economy" as the "most disturbing" risk threatening a strong recovery.
For some other strategists, the nation's nascent unilateralism has become part of a bigger discussion of how investors perceive the American investment environment.
"The current differences of opinion over first the necessity of a war in Iraq, secondly the conduct of the peace in Iraq, and the postwar environment -- they're important yet incidental to the larger question of whether the United States is headed in some longer-term sense on the right course," said Stuart A. Schweitzer, a strategist at J. P. Morgan Fleming Asset Management.
Mr. Schweitzer expressed confidence in the nation's potential for growth, but he said that "heightened tensions with traditional allies" were affecting international investors' confidence in the United States. Mr. Gagen said bad blood had already made it harder to seal big transactions between French and American companies. He said he also worried that the nation's foreign policy could make settlement of trade disputes more difficult.
"The next time there's a major trade negotiation between any of these parties," he said, "we just don't know what sort of impact these things will cause."
Though these frictions are hard to measure, the White House's foreign policy choices have had some tangible effects in the short term. Economists generally agree that the war in Iraq exacted a heavy toll on the economy, even before the fighting began. According to some Wall Street experts, the uncertainty preceding the conflict may have cost the economy $50 billion or more in lost spending by consumers and businesses. Some investors have also worried that the nation's activist foreign policy could hurt businesses that rely on exports.
The direct costs of the war in Iraq to the government are also easily measured. Congress allotted $79 billion to pay for the war and related expenses this year. In addition, the reduction in economic activity that preceded the fighting is likely to have lowered federal tax receipts.
That weakening of the government's fiscal balance is contributing to the concerns of investors here and abroad, Mr. Schweitzer said. "Foreign investors care not only about whether the U.S. is fundamentally right or not about what it's doing in other countries. Foreign investors also attach a great deal of significance to the budget position -- to whether the U.S. is being fiscally prudent or not."
Steve Alexander, a managing director at BNP Paribas who heads the private capital group for North America, explained that geopolitical risks were implicitly "baked into" most indexes of economic activity that investors would watch routinely. "The geopolitical elements probably add some flavor, but I don't think they drive it," he said.
Indeed, some investors consider themselves virtually immune to geopolitical risks. "Our companies are going to come to market in years, not months, so we don't tend to have a short-term economic horizon," said Peter Schwartz, a venture partner at Alta Partners in San Francisco. "You would say that about the people investing with us as well."
But Mr. Bowers contended that if the rest of the world changed its view of the United States, it would cut to the core of the economy. The nation's gross saving rate -- including all sources of saving, from households to governments to corporate accounts -- is at its lowest level since 1945. So increases in investment are likely to depend on foreign funds. "There are some really fundamental issues here which really do matter," Mr. Bowers said.
Not everyone is convinced, however, that a more unilateralist foreign policy is a bad thing for the United States, from an economic perspective. Joseph R. Schmuckler, president and chief operating officer of Nomura Securities International, suggested that the war in Iraq might actually help the United States to attract investment.
"Lack of United States and allied resolve in combating the war on terrorism, and allowing the uncertainties and risks to continue to weigh on investors' minds, is not only a negative for the United States but for other free-market economies around the world," he said. "Without question, doing nothing is not an answer. We can't survive in the long term without fighting back this enemy."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Good Earnings Reports Propel Shares Higher for 2nd Day

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
A succession of better-than-expected earnings reports sent stocks climbing for a second day yesterday as investors grew more convinced that the worst was over for the economy and Wall Street. A surge in consumer confidence fed the buying momentum, and allowed the market to overcome several waves of profit taking.
 Upbeat profit reports again flowed in from big companies, this time, Northrop Grumman, DuPont and Bristol-Myers Squibb. 
 "We basically are on a bit more solid footing than we have been in quite a while," said Steven Goldman, chief market strategist at Weeden & Company in Greenwich, Conn.
And the uptick in consumer sentiment is "a good reason for people to be enthusiastic," said Brian Bruce, director for global investments at PanAgora Asset Management in Boston.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 31.38 points, or 0.4 percent, at 8,502.99. On Monday, the Dow climbed 165.26 points.
The broader market also advanced. The Nasdaq composite index rose 9.06 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,471.30. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 3 points, or 0.3 percent, to 917.84.
Investors seemed torn between caution, which manifested itself in profit taking, and a desire to be part of the market's latest advance.
"After the rally we have had," said Brian Pears, head equity trader at Victory Capital Management in Cleveland, "people have become a lot more selective about their purchases. The cliche is, 'The easy money has been made at this point.' " 
Economic news was encouraging. The Conference Board reported that consumer confidence rose sharply in April after the swift outcome in Iraq. 
Investors pay close attention to the mood of consumers, whose spending accounts for two-thirds of the economy.
There was also good news about workers' wages and benefits, which the Labor Department said rose by 1.3 percent in the first quarter. It was the biggest increase in nearly 13 years and almost double the 0.7 percent gain seen in the fourth quarter of 2002.
Over the past few weeks, companies have reported surprisingly strong profits and economic readings have turned more positive, prompting investors to buy stocks with renewed confidence.
"Investors were bracing for a slowdown in the economy," Mr. Goldman said. "If anything, earnings are coming in a tad bit better than expected and that is alleviating some uncertainty."
Among the gainers, Northrop Grumman climbed $2.76, to $89.29, after posting first-quarter earnings that were 35 cents a share higher than Wall Street expected and increasing its 2003 outlook.
DuPont rose 64 cents, to $42.37, on quarterly profits that surpassed analysts' expectations by 7 cents a share. Bristol-Myers Squibb advanced 85 cents, to $25.21, after reporting earnings that were a penny a share higher than analysts anticipated.
But Alliance Capital fell 85 cents, to $31.50, on first-quarter earnings that missed analysts' expectations by 5 cents a share.
Treasury bond prices fell yesterday as stocks gained. The benchmark 10-year note lost 6/32, to 99 19/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.93 percent from 3.90 percent on Monday.
The 30-year bond fell 7/32, to 108 5/32. Its yield climbed to 4.84 percent from 4.83 percent.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of a four-week bill:

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Shows a SubstantialGain 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29 

 BODY:
Consumers' confidence in the economy jumped this month by the most in 12 years, a private research group said today, as the fighting in Iraq wound down, energy costs fell and stock prices rose.
 The group, the Conference Board, said its consumer confidence index increased to 81 from a reading of 61.4 in March. The rise was the biggest since March 1991, the month in which the previous war with Iraq ended. 
 "One barrier to growth has tumbled and that opens the door to brisker household spending," said James O'Sullivan, an economist at UBS Warburg in Stamford, Conn. A sustained rise in consumer confidence is needed to generate more spending for an economy that has grown at an annual rate of less than 2 percent in each of the last two quarters, economists said.
A separate report from the Labor Department showed that first-quarter labor costs rose the most in 14 years as employers paid more for benefits. The employment cost index increased 1.3 percent, almost double the fourth-quarter rise of 0.7 percent. Benefit costs surged 2.2 percent, reflecting higher expenses for health insurance and retirement benefits.
For the confidence index, analysts had forecast a level of 70 this month after a previously reported March reading of 62.5, based on the median of 62 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey. The March reading was the lowest since October 1993.
Rudolf Thunberg, an economist at Reid Thunberg & Company whose forecast of 80 was the highest in the survey, said he doubted that sentiment would keep rising. As the previous war with Iraq showed, he said, "the postwar euphoria tends to fade and the weak labor market is likely to keep consumers cautious." About a half-million jobs were lost in the last two months.
Consumers' assessment of the current job market edged up this month from a nine-year low. The percentage of consumers who saw jobs as plentiful rose to 13 percent compared with 11.4 percent in each of the previous two months. The percentage that thought jobs were scarce decreased to 29.5 percent from 32.3 percent.
The part of the confidence index that tracks consumers' expectations for the next six months rose to 84.8 from 61.4, also the biggest gain since March 1991. A gauge of optimism about the present situation rose to 75.3 this month from 61.4 in March, the biggest gain in more than a year.
A fall in oil prices and a stock rally may be leading to optimism. In the last two months, crude oil prices have fallen by a third since reaching a 12-year high of $39.99 a barrel on Feb. 27 in the buildup to the war. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks is up 14 percent since reaching a five-month low on March 11.
The Conference Board surveys 5,000 households about general economic conditions, their employment prospects and their spending plans. The survey reflected responses received through April 22.

HEADLINE: Report Finds Deep Poverty Is on the Rise 

BYLINE:  By SAM DILLON 

 BODY:
The number of black Americans under 18 years old who live in extreme poverty has risen sharply since 2000 and is now at its highest level since the government began collecting such figures in 1980, according to a study by the Children's Defense Fund, a child welfare advocacy group.
 In 2001, the last year for which government figures are available, nearly one million black children were living in families with after-tax incomes that were less than half the amount used to define poverty, said the new study, which was based on Census Bureau statistics and is to be released publicly today. The defense fund provided a copy in advance to The New York Times. 
 The poverty line for a family of three was about $14,100, the study said, so a family of three living in extreme poverty had a disposable income of about $7,060, the study said. 
 In early 2000, only 686,000 black children were that poor, the study said, indicating that the economic circumstances of the United States' poorest black families deteriorated sharply from 2000 to 2001.
 Deborah Weinstein, the director of the division of the Children's Defense Fund, who oversaw the research that produced the study, said its release had been timed to influence the national debate over President Bush's tax cut proposal, which her group opposes, as well as deliberations in the Senate, where the 1996 law that reshaped the nation's welfare landscape is up for reauthorization. 
 The Children's Defense Fund has been a consistent critic of the vast overhaul of the American welfare system carried out during the 1990's.
 "The study shows that in the first recession since the welfare law took effect, black children who have the fewest protections are falling into extreme poverty in record numbers," Ms. Weinstein said. "So as we consider our federal policies, are we going to help children who need help the most, or rich people who don't need help at all?"
 Supporters of the welfare changes of the past decade characterized the study as an effort to focus on a narrow slice of bad news, while ignoring what the supporters see as the overwhelming benefits that the overhaul had for most poor families.
 "The Children's Defense Fund searched with a laser for something that was negative to say, because the poverty picture in America since the 1996 welfare reform is unambiguously positive," said Jason Turner, a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation, who as New York City's commissioner of human resources from 1998 to 2001 was in charge of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's welfare policies.
 The study focused not just on poor black children, but specifically on black children living in extreme poverty.
 Mr. Turner said that such a study ignored the gains made in recent years by the larger population of poor black children. In 1995, he said, 41.5 percent of black children lived below the poverty line, but by 2001, only 30 percent were living in poverty.
 The generalized decline in poverty among black children was not in dispute.
 "Recent studies show overall poverty has declined among black children, but fail to show the record-breaking increase in extreme poverty among these children," the Children's Defense Fund said in a statement that accompanied the study. "Today's analysis further shows that safety nets for the worst-off families are being eroded by Bush administration policies that cause fewer extremely poor children of all races to receive cash and in-kind assistance."
 Margy Waller, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who was a senior adviser to President Bill Clinton for welfare issues, said that other recent research, including her own, hadsupported the conclusion that the gradual disappearance of safety net programs had driven some of the country's poorest families deeper into poverty, even as the status of other poor families improved. Mr. Clinton signed the 1996 overhaul of the welfare system into law.
 "This data is not surprising to me because other work I've seen has shown that since the welfare reform there have been some increases in extreme poverty, resulting from lost public benefits," Ms. Waller said. "I think that the '96 welfare reform law has been beneficial for many families. But we also know that some families are worse off."

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: ANTIQUITIES; 
Campaign Starts to Help Iraq Rebuild Cultural Institutions

BYLINE:  By MARTIN GOTTLIEB 

DATELINE: LONDON, April 29 

 BODY:
Representatives of many of the world's great museums gathered amid the ancient artifacts of the British Museum today to announce a campaign to rebuild as much as possible the plundered cultural institutions of Iraq.
 Experts from the Louvre in Paris, New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art, Berlin's State Museum and Russia's Hermitage unveiled a plan to inventory within six months the losses in a wave of looting at the National Museum in Baghdad, the National Library and other museums and sites. They also pledged to provide assistance to their beleaguered Iraqi colleagues in restoring damaged antiquities. The meeting included archaeologists from leading Western universities and officials of Unesco and the British government. 
 A Unesco representative announced that Koichiro Matsuura, the organization's director general, would meet with Secretary General Kofi Annan Wednesday to ask him to urge the Security Council to pass a resolution imposing an embargo for a "limited period" on the sale of all Iraqi cultural objects on the international market. 
The measures were proposed to curb the growing trade in illicit antiquities that is believed to have absorbed thousands of objects looted from museums and archaeological sites after the first Persian Gulf war in 1991.
Neil MacGregor, the director of the British Museum, said that his institution would act as a clearinghouse for efforts to help Iraqi specialists find looted objects and restore damaged ones. 
Donny George, the research director of Iraq's National Museum, described 20 extraordinarily important items that are missing from its collection after it was ransacked as American troops moved into the city earlier this month. 
They include the "Warka Vase," a sacred limestone piece decorated in relief, dating from 3100 B.C.; marble statues of Poseidon, Apollo and Eros from the fabled ruin at Hetra; and a headless statue, covered in inscriptions, of King Entemena of Lagash, from 2400 B.C. 
Mr. George said that a significant part of the looting was professionally organized by gangs with glass cutters and sets of keys. But the pillage might have been prevented, he said, with only a slightly more vigorous response from from the American military. "Moving a tank for 50 or 60 meters would have saved the museum," he said.
Although some evidence suggests that people with inside knowledge of the museum were responsible for stealing the more valuable items, Mr. George said he had no information indicating that the culprits were officials connected with his antiquities department or with the government of Saddam Hussein. 
Mr. George also reported that many valuable items were saved because they were moved out of the museum in the weeks before the war.
John Curtis, the curator of the British Museum's Near East Collection, who returned from a brief trip to Baghdad with Dr. George, pointed to the theft of a bronze statue of an Akkadian king, saying it seemed to reveal a coordinated effort. 
"It is so large and heavy that it would have required five or six people to move," he said. 
The group also decided to issue an appeal to the United States "urgently to secure the frontiers of Iraq," Mr. MacGregor said, after hearing of the experience of Mr. George as he traveled to the conference. Mr. George said that he drove from Baghdad to Amman, Jordan, and was first stopped at the border at an American checkpoint. No search was conducted of his belongings, he said. Yet when he arrived at the Jordanian checkpoint he underwent a complete search. He learned that the Jordanians had confiscated artifacts and documents from 12 people during their checks.
Tessa Jowell, Britain's secretary of state for culture, said the government of Prime Minister Tony Blair would seek to toughen Britain's laws on the sale of antiquities and raise additional funds for the project of Mr. MacGregor and his staff.
Sharply questioned about whether Britain had done all it could to ensure that the Americans would protect cultural resources in Baghdad, she argued that nobody could have anticipated the extent of the looters' destruction. 
"Quite clearly what has happened is a disaster," she said.

HEADLINE: Republican Leaders of Congress Say They Will End Budget Feud and Strike Deal on Tax Cut 

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29 

 BODY:
Republican leaders of Congress said today they were ready to put a budget feud to rest and strike a deal on a tax cut, with the Senate majority leader, Bill Frist, saying his objective now was to get the largest possible tax cut.
 "My goal is to grow that number as high as I possibly can," said Dr. Frist, who this month angered House Republicans by not telling them of a private Senate agreement to hold tax cuts to $350 billion while the House was approving $550 billion. Senator Frist, of Tennessee, said today he had apologized to his counterparts in the House and was ready to move on. 
 "The big mistake, lesson learned, is no surprises," said Dr. Frist, who met in the White House this evening with President Bush and the House speaker, Representative J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, to map legislative strategy before another White House meeting with the Republican leadership of Congress on Wednesday.
The Congressional budget adopted earlier this month allows up to $1.2 trillion in total tax cuts over the next decade, but the Senate protected just $350 billion of those from procedural obstacles while the House figure was set at $550 billion. The fight remains centered mainly on those numbers.
Dr. Frist said he would push his colleagues to expand the $350 billion by paying for anything above that level through spending reductions and other tax changes, which are referred to as offsets. He said the Senate figure of $350 billion could grow to $450 billion or higher with offsets that he said would be hashed out over the next week.
 "Ultimately, I'd like to get up to $1.2 trillion as we go forward and over the course of the budgeting cycle in terms of appropriate tax policy," he said. White House officials said they would also consider offsets as a way to raise the tax-cut number for what Republicans call a jobs and growth package.
But the offsets will be difficult to achieve in practice. If the money is squeezed out of spending, it would have to come from popular social programs. And some Republicans are already resisting the idea of raising other taxes to pay for new cuts.
 "I think it is counterproductive to raise taxes on one side and lower taxes on another," said the House majority leader, Representative Tom DeLay of Texas.
Mr. DeLay said he now "feels comfortable" that Dr. Frist understands the mistake he made last month and would not repeat it. Mr. DeLay and other Republicans also moved to shift the attention from intramural squabbling to Democratic reservations about the tax cuts.
"We are not going to allow the Democrats to practice the politics of economic destruction again by foul-mouthing the economy at the same time they are trying to submarine the president's economic package," said Mr. DeLay, who said the opposition felt "an obligation to gripe."
 And gripe it did, saying that the Republican tax push was tantamount to a corporation's borrowing money to pay dividends. Most Senate Democrats, joined by a handful of Republicans, oppose any tax cuts that total more than $350 billion.
 "We'll be borrowing money to pay outa tax cut, and a tax cut of a magnitude that will leave us with a debt that is in excess of anything our country has ever experienced in one year," said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader. He planned a news briefing on Wednesday to highlight his complaints with the Bush administration plan to eliminate taxes on corporate dividends.
With Republicans trying to settle on a strategy and Democrats plotting their response, most of the business on the tax cuts was conducted behind closed doors at locations scattered around the city. Tonight Mr. Bush met with Mr. Hastert and Dr. Frist for an hour and 15 minutes on the Truman Balcony at the White House, where aides said they discussed the tax cut, AIDS policy, Medicare and federal judges. 
 Earlier in the day, Vice President Dick Cheney met at lunch with Republican senators. Then Treasury Secretary John W. Snow and Stephen Friedman, chairman of the National Economic Council, met first with Representative Bill Thomas of California, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, and then with Dr. Frist and Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Finance Committee.
Mr. Thomas and Mr. Grassley also met today, then Mr. Grassley conferred with the Republican members of his committee as preliminary steps in determining what the elements of the tax legislation will be. The two chairmen hope to have their committees vote on legislation next week. Under this schedule, bills would be considered on the House and Senate floors using special, expedited rules the following week, and a final agreement could be approved the week before Memorial Day.
 Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, chairman of the Budget Committee and a senior Republican on the Finance Committee, suggested today that one way to reduce the 10-year tax-cut number would be to put the reductions in place this year and then end them before the 10-year period was up, employing a process lawmakers call sunsetting.
The theory behind such a practice is that it would be difficult for Congress not to re-enact a tax cut once it was on the books but that the additional money would not count in the 10-year calculations.
Senator Max Baucus of Montana, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, said he and other Democrats on his panel were prepared to vote for a tax bill as long as the cost did not exceed $350 billion and there was no reduction in the income tax on stock dividends.

HEADLINE: Hypocrisy & Apple Pie 

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN DOWD; E-mail: liberties@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Richard Perle is at ease with neo-imperial swagger.
 At the White House Correspondents Association dinner on Saturday night, the Pentagon's Prince of Darkness lectured Hans Blix as if he were a colonial subject, instructing him on why an invasion of Iraq had been justified even though no weapons of mass destruction had yet been found. 
 Asked afterward how Mr. Blix had reacted, Mr. Perle replied merrily: "He's a Swedish disarmament lawyer. He's used to a lot of abuse." 
When one partygoer told Mr. Perle that she would miss the buzzy, standing-room-only "black coffee briefings" on Iraq held by hard-liners at the American Enterprise Institute, he suggested the neo-cons might hold another round.
"We'll have green tea briefings on North Korea," he said slyly.
On Fox News, Bill Kristol spoke up for a more brazen imperial attitude. "We need to err on the side of being strong," he said. "And if people want to say we're an imperial power, fine. If three years from now, we have beaten back these threats and have a decent regime there, it'll be worth it."
But imperial flair is rare. America is a furtive empire, afraid to raise its flag or linger too long or even call things by their real names. The U.S. is having a hard time figuring out how to wield its colonial power, how to balance collegiality with coercion, how to savor the fruits of imperialism without acknowledging its imperialist hubris. 
When Kofi Annan called the Americans in Iraq an "occupying power" last week, Bush officials freaked. Maybe they would have preferred Honored Guests.
The Pentagon once more outgunned the State Department this week, changing the name of a new governing body of Iraqis from "interim authority" to "transitional government" to signal that the U.S. would leave quickly and give its Armani-clad puppet, Ahmad Chalabi, an advantage. But it doesn't matter what euphemistic name is used; if there are too many militant Shiite clerics involved, Rummy, the real authority, will tell them to take their camels and vamoose.
"America is the empire that dare not speak its name," Niall Ferguson, the Oxford professor who wrote "Empire," told a crowd at the Council on Foreign Relations here on Monday. He believes that America is so invested in its "creation myth," breaking away from a wicked empire, that Americans will always be self-deceiving -- and even self-defeating -- imperialists.
"The great thing about the American empire is that so many Americans disbelieve in its existence," he said. "Ever since the annexation of Texas and invasion of the Philippines, the U.S. has systematically pursued an imperial policy. 
"It's simply a suspension of disbelief by Americans. They think they're so different that when they have bases in foreign territories, it's not an empire. When they invade sovereign territory, it's not an empire."
Asked in an interview about Viceroy Jay Garner's promise that U.S. military overlords would "leave fairly rapidly," Mr. Ferguson replied: "I'm hoping he's lying. Successful empires must be based on hypocrisy. The Americans can say they're doing things in the name of freedom, liberty and apple pie. But they must build a civil society and revive the economy before they have elections.
"From 1882 until 1922, the British promised the international community 66 times that they would leave Egypt, but they never did. If they leave Iraq to its own devices, the whole thing will blow up."
Afghanistan offers cautionary lessons. It was the abandonment by the U.S. after Afghanistan's war in 1989 with the Soviet Union that stoked the fury of Al Qaeda. The regime of the American puppet Hamid Karzai is still perilously fragile.
As Carlotta Gall wrote in The Times last weekend, after two U.S. soldiers were killed by Afghan rebels: "In a very real sense the war here has not ended. . . . Nearly every day, there are killings, explosions, shootings and targeted attacks on foreign aid workers, Afghan officials and American forces, as well as continuing feuding between warlords."
Exiled Taliban leaders have called for a holy war against the "occupying forces." The religious police are once more harassing and beating women over dress and behavior, and schools that take little girls are being attacked and threatened.
Until we can get democracy stabilized in our new colonies, Mr. Ferguson offers two words of advice: "Better puppets."

HEADLINE: Problems Are Compounded At Indian Point Plants 

BYLINE:  By LISA W. FODERARO

DATELINE: BUCHANAN, N.Y., April 29 

 BODY:
A day after a power failure at the Indian Point nuclear plant complex, officials were dealing with new problems today: an early-morning fire, and criticism of the long hours that security officers there are forced to work.
 The criticism was prompted by a letter to security officers dated April 21 from an official of the Entergy Corporation, which owns the plants. The letter alerted the officers to the likelihood of working "five 12-hour days and occasionally six 12-hour days" to prepare for an antiterrorism drill in early summer. 
 The letter was made available to The New York Times today by the Project on Government Oversight, a national watchdog group in Washington that has focused on nuclear plant security in the wake of Sept. 11. 
Today the Nuclear Regulatory Commission sent out new orders to the nation's nuclear plants concerning security preparations.
Neil A. Sheehan, a spokesman for the commission, said that the agency sent out three orders, including one that limits security officers to working "no more than 48 hours per week during normal operating times." The agency is giving plants 18 months to fully implement the new rules, he said.
Mr. Sheehan would not say whether the commission would let Entergy follow through with its overtime demands.
"There might be enough maneuvering room in this order to allow them to do this, but that's something we're going to have to take a look at," Mr. Sheehan said. "We're very interested in seeing them improve the quality of their security operations. But clearly we don't want to see guards suffering the effects of fatigue."
The fire and power failure occurred within hours of each other and led to the shutdown of both reactors, but were not related to the issue of security, Mr. Sheehan said. The Indian Point 3 reactor stopped operations after a fire started at 2:59 this morning on the main turbine in a nonnuclear area of the plant, he said.
Plant officials say that some insulating material ignited on the outer casing that houses the turbine. Lubricating oil had apparently leaked onto the insulation and that may have caused the fire, but how the oil got there is still under investigation, said Jim Steets, an Entergy spokesman. The fire, which Mr. Steets described as small but stubborn, was extinguished by the plant's fire brigade, without outside help, at 3:50 a.m. Because the fire lasted more than 15 minutes, the plant had to declare it an "unusual event," the lowest of four emergency classifications set by the regulatory commission. As a result, county, state and federal officials were notified in the middle of the night.
On Monday afternoon, the Indian Point 2 reactor shut down automatically when a power failure occurred off site, causing the plant to disconnect from the electrical grid. Mr. Steets said that both reactors were expected to be back in service within a few days. The N.R.C. said it appeared that Entergy had followed the proper guidelines, both in fighting the fire and in immediately notifying the authorities.
But today, Entergy's critics seemed more exercised about the plant's overtime demands than about the fire. The letter to security officers by Fred Dacimo, a site vice president of Entergy who is in charge of Indian Point, also offered them $500 bonuses upon completion of the drill, which will take place over several days this summer.
"Entergy is a company that believes in pay for performance," the letter said. "Upon the successful execution of the force-on-force exercise, I am prepared to give those security officers, who don't call out sick and remain accident-free, a bonus of $500."
Richard L. Brodsky, a state assemblyman who has campaigned to have Indian Point permanently closed, said the bonuses were evidence that the guards were underpaid. "It's bizarre that we're parceling out the security aspects of Indian Point on a bonus basis," he said. "In my opinion, we should not trust Entergy with the security of the plant."
Peter D. H. Stockton, a security expert who was a special assistant to the secretary of energy in the Clinton administration and now works with the Project on Government Oversight, said that more than 20 guards he had spoken with in recent months complained of fatigue, low pay, inadequate training and poor morale.
Mr. Steets of Entergy said the company had hired 40 security officers in the past few months and planned to hire 50 more over the next several months. "It's a significant addition that will help us reduce the overtime burden so that we can be compliant with the orders of the N.R.C.," he said.
Since the terror attacks of Sept. 11, security has been a special concern at Indian Point, which is about 40 miles north of Midtown Manhattan.
Attention has also focused on whether the plant -- particularly Indian Point 2 -- is operating safely. In recent years the reactor has been plagued by minor leaks and safety lapses, including a February 2000 radiation leak that closed the plant for nearly a year.

HEADLINE: THE SARS EPIDEMIC: CANADA; 
ADVICE TO PUT OFF TRIPS TO TORONTO IS LIFTED BY W.H.O.

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: TORONTO, April 29 

 BODY:
Citing an ebb in the SARS epidemic here, the World Health Organization today lifted a week-old advisory urging travelers to delay all nonessential visits to Toronto.
 The decision was welcomed with sighs of relief from Canadian officials, who had lobbied hard for the reversal and disputed the W.H.O. contention that Toronto had been a source of cases outside Canada. They argued that the advisory unnecessarily damaged the Canadian economy and its international image. 
 But the reversal of an advisory declared only last Wednesday raised questions about the W.H.O.'s decision-making process and whether it had given in to intense pressure from a country with enormous sway in the agency's parent organization, the United Nations.
"It erodes their credibility to reverse themselves so suddenly," said Dr. John Last, a professor emeritus of epidemiology at the University of Ottawa. "It is a serious wound to the body politic of public health, to Canada and to the World Health Organization." 
Twenty-one people have died here of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, and at least five more are in critical condition, making Toronto the most seriously affected locality outside Asia. The W.H.O. linked several cases in the Philippines, Australia and the United States to people who had traveled to Toronto.
But while Toronto still has 39 active SARS cases and 498 people in quarantine, there has not been a new case reported since April 9 in the general community or a new case since April 20 in the hospital system, where the disease has been concentrated. The disease's incubation period is thought to be up to 10 days.
"There is no longer concern of export," said Gro Harlem Brundtland, the W.H.O. director general, explaining the decision. "The magnitude of the probable SARS has decreased."
Dr. Brundtland still maintained that Toronto had exported cases of SARS to other countries, but not for several weeks.
"It was reasonable to issue that travel advice," she said of the original advisory, which covered Toronto, Beijing, Hong Kong and the Chinese provinces of Guangdong and Shanxi. She hinted that the decision to take Toronto off the list could be reversed again if circumstances warranted.
By contrast, much of China remains under the travel advisory. There, SARS caseloads continue to grow, though much more rapidly on the mainland than in Hong Kong. Mainland China reported 389 new cases today; in Hong Kong, the rate of new cases has slowed to about 15 a day, down from 20 to 80 a day earlier in the month.
In all of Canada, there are 148 probable cases of SARS. Four are in British Columbia and the rest are in and around Toronto. All the Toronto cases are linked to a single elderly Chinese immigrant who came home sick from a trip to see her family in Hong Kong in February.
In Washington, Dr. Julie L. Gerberding, director of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told a panel of senators today that the United States had identified 52 probable cases, up from 39 last week. Dr. Gerberding said nearly all of the new probable cases involved people who traveled to affected countries, with the exception of one health care worker and one person infected through household contact.
The W.H.O. imposed one condition on the lifting of the travel advisory in Toronto: that Canada step up screening at the airport there for passengers leaving the country. Canada has agreed to employ infrared temperature-taking machines in Toronto and Vancouver to ensure that anyone with a fever is checked before boarding an international flight.
Dr. Last, the University of Ottawa professor, said the World Health Organization should have waited 20 days, or two incubation periods, before reversing the decision, to guarantee that no one carrying the virus, including those who show no symptoms, can pass it on to others.
But Dr. Last's opinion was clearly in the minority here.
"It shouldn't have been done in the first place," said Mayor Mel Lastman, "but I'm glad they've lifted it so we can get back to normal."
Health officials viewed the decision as an endorsement of their efforts, which have centered on identifying SARS cases and isolating everyone who has come in contact with patients.
Over 7,000 people have been put in quarantine in Toronto. Two local hospitals were virtually shut down, and many others delayed elective surgery and other procedures to control contact between medical workers and the public. Three schools were closed, and later reopened.
Most Torontonians seem to have kept their composure through the epidemic, and the W.H.O.'s original decision prompted a new defiance that sent many out to restaurants and shopping malls. People here never took to wearing masks in large numbers outside of hospitals.
But international confidence may take longer to recover before tourists return and commerce recovers.
The Bank of Canada has lowered its 2003 economic growth projections by a full percentage point, and independent economists have said daily economic damage could easily rise to $30 million a day.
Since the advisory was announced, several conventions have canceled visits to Toronto, where 95,000 jobs depend on tourism. Restaurants, hotels and shopping malls have been hit hard by the decrease in tourism.
"We are obviously very pleased," said Len Crispino, head of the Ontario Chamber of Commerce. "Major business investment has been put on hold and it will take time to recover."
The Canadian dollar, which had fallen in recent days, climbed to a three-year high relative to the United States dollar, to 69.36 cents from 69.04, on the news of the W.H.O. reversal.
Canadian health care officials were careful not to gloat and acknowledged their responsibility to protect other countries against a disease that is still spreading in China.
"We know our vigilance must not stop," said Tony Clement, the Ontario health minister. "I want to assure the international community we are not going to let up."
Prime Minister Jean Chretien had personally lobbied Dr. Brundtland, with whom he has had a warm relationship since her days as prime minister of Norway in the 1990's. Other Canadian cabinet ministers, diplomats and health officials have called Geneva and sent a barrage of medical papers and fact sheets to W.H.O. officials and technicians over the last week. W.H.O. officials privately said during the week that they had not previously felt so much political pressure.
Only 10 days ago, the epidemic looked as if it might spread rapidly through the community, as it has in several Chinese cities.
A nurse with SARS had taken two rush-hour trains shortly before she suffered symptoms, setting off a hurried dash by health care officials to find commuters who had traveled in close proximity. A doctor, not knowing he had SARS, had gone to a well-attended funeral.
More than two weeks later, no one has apparently gotten sick from exposure to either one.
But public health experts cautioned that epidemics frequently have their ups and downs, and spillage into the broader community is still possible.
"I need to remind you that Toronto still has an outbreak of SARS," said Dr. Brundtland, "and the lifting of this travel advice does not change the reality that Toronto has a status as an affected area."

HEADLINE: Where Village Meets Green; 
At 150, Park Is a Melting Pot

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
It happens every spring.
 New Yorkers by the thousands stream into Central Park to revel in the full-throated glory of the new forsythia and cherry blossoms. There, they are again reminded that the park is the city's common ground, the democratic village green where people of all backgrounds and enthusiasms come to pursue their separate pleasures, for the most part congenially. 
 In a single 843-acre rectangle, there are more or less permanent and overlapping communities of folk dancers, horseback riders, bird watchers, storytellers, dog walkers, nannies, chess fans, volleyball players, softball leagues, joggers, cyclists, tennis players, ice skaters, soccer teams, ultimate Frisbee devotees and pint-size fishermen.
There is a racially polychromed assortment of roller skaters who shimmy to a disco beat around a macadam oval northeast of the Sheep Meadow, and there is a separate set of in-line skaters who slalom through rows of soda bottles. There are petanque devotees who play a French version of the Italian game of boccie on a hardscrabble patch of ground, and there are lawn bowlers, in mandatory whites, who play on a manicured court. There is even a weekly lakeside gathering of fans of a guitar-playing folk singer, David Ippolito. 
"There are so many different villages," said George van der Ploeg, 50, a bird watcher. "It's like New York City, with a Greek section in Queens, Asians in Flushing, the South Americans and Russians in Brooklyn. In a way the park is a mirror of the city itself."
All these neighborhoods coexist in a park that is celebrating its 150th birthday this summer in what many believe is its best shape in at least half a century.
Before Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, the park's designers, came along, large urban parks were virtually nonexistent. Elizabeth Barlow Rogers, Central Park's first official administrator, said large American parks were playgrounds for the aristocracy, for hunting or grazing deer. Olmsted and Vaux wanted a people's park. Even if modern minds might find their rationale patronizing, they laid out footpaths beside the carriage roads so poorer people could use the gentry as a refining influence.
Today, people seem to recognize one another's rights because they essentially share the same reason for coming to the park.
"New Yorkers are busy obsessing about all sorts of things that are terrible, and you get into the park and it lifts you up and makes you over," said Sarah Elliott, a doyenne of the bird watchers. "You come back feeling a lot better."

'The Ultimate Freedom'
 While their origins almost 25 years ago were rather spontaneous, the dance skaters have become so institutionalized that they have an association, publish a newsletter and charge dues of $15 a year. Still, at their oval, lawyers and bike messengers; the rich and the subsidized; black, white, Hispanic and Asian mingle seemingly without effort.
Gyrating hedonistically the other day were a shirtless man in rainbow-colored Ali Baba pants showing off his chiseled chest; a 56-year-old Polish woman, youthful in black Spandex and aviator glasses; a stylish wine importer; and a bearded Asian-studies expert known as Three-Bottle Bob for the tower of water bottles balanced on his skull.
Many of the 300 regulars come together on weekends because they love shimmying while skating to a throbbing beat before a delighted crowd.
"You bring that child back again," said Felix Santiago, 33, an actor. "There's no yesterday, no tomorrow. No one questions what you do, where you live and where you're from. It's the ultimate freedom."
At least three couples, including Gail Brillhart Myrick, a white textile designer, and Steven Myrick, a black technical support analyst, met at the oval and married. The Myricks have since produced another dance skater, Justin, now 6.
"If the rest of the world got along as well as we do here, ethnically and economically, the world I feel would be a better place," Ms. Myrick said.
Over the years, complaints have risen about the amplified sound from those who prefer a peaceful park. Lezly Ziering, the 70-year-old chairman of the Central Park Dance Skaters Association, has gradually found ways to muffle the music.
Now he tells critics, "Ours is a small circle, and the park is for everybody."

Regulars and Guerrillas
Most groups that start haphazardly eventually get the Parks Department's blessing with a dedicated ground and permit. For more than 30 years, the folk dancers have been doing Balkan, Israeli and other circle dances on Sundays on a plaza near Belvedere Castle. The 30-team Broadway Show League, where on Thursday you could have watched "The Lion King" defeat "The Producers" in softball, has been at the Heckscher ball fields for 50 years. The Model Yacht Club, made up mostly of men who still like playing with small boats (although ones that cost more than $1,000), has its own house at Conservatory Water.
The petanque enthusiasts, most of them workers in the city's French restaurants, have no court or permit. But 30 years ago, in a move that would have delighted such famous Central Park guerrillas as Joseph Papp and Fred Lebow, they simply staked out a shaded plot of earth southwest of the Heckscher ball fields, choosing it precisely because it was rutted and offered challenging plays.
The two dozen regulars include a maitre d'hotel of La Grenouille, the captains at Le Perigord and Rene Pujol and the bartender at Pierre au Tunnel. After four hours of afternoon play they usually adjourn to Tout Va Bien for glasses of Ricard.
They play whenever weather allows, lobbing orange-size steel balls toward a small pink ball called the cochonnet. As each ball lands, there are cries of "tres bien!" or "ne touche pas!" Arguments over which ball is nearest are settled with a collapsible antenna used as a measuring stick.
What Jacques Despretz, the group's spokesman, likes about petanque is that it can be played at any age.
"As long as you stand on your two feet and can raise you hand and hold a glass of Ricard, you have no problems," Mr. Despretz said.
But Michael Touchard, who is younger and works as a bartender at Tout Va Bien, says he particularly likes playing in Central Park because it seems a far more welcoming place than, say, the Bois de Boulogne, the park's equivalent in Paris.
"In Central Park you have everybody, from the rich who walk their dogs to average Joes," he said. "You have a guy who is a busboy and a guy who owns four restaurants, and they all play together."

Sightings and Serenity
Central Park is for the birds, the bird watchers might insist. And it would be hard to argue seeing the single-mindedness with which they go about spotting the more than 200 species that pass through Central Park on their way to more exotic ports of call.
On a recent Wednesday morning, 16 bird watchers with dangling binoculars gathered at Fifth Avenue and ambled into the Ramble, one of the world's great migratory way stations. Their leader was Ms. Elliott, a red-crested sparrow of a woman who has been leading paying tours of the park's bird life for 25 years.
She pointed out the scraggly nest of a red-tailed hawk tenderly patched together above a stone decoration on the top floor of a regal Fifth Avenue building. Deeper into the park, the bird watchers spied a red-bellied woodpecker, a red-headed woodpecker, a great egret, a white-throated sparrow, a red-winged blackbird, a cardinal, a downy woodpecker, a barn swallow, a rough-winged swallow and a double-crested cormorant.
"This time of year the males have two wonderful eyebrows," Ms. Elliott said, referring to the cormorants gliding below Belvedere Castle. "They're sort of like Groucho Marx, except their eyebrows are twisted and corkscrewed, and that shows the female they mean business."
It is this kind of patter that keeps bird watchers flocking to Ms. Elliott, a former teacher. Of course, the bird watchers were also drawn by the astonishment of "a sighting," craning their necks to check out the flash of a woodpecker's brilliant red crown on a murky branch or gasping at the anomaly of a great egret in Turtle Pond.
But they were also enjoying the serenity of the woodlands and hidden meadows.
Ms. Elliott says her group is made up of "people of the leisure class": retirees and workers with flexible hours. They are people like Mr. van der Ploeg, a real estate broker, and Marge Benedetto, who worked at Coronet and Esquire magazines before rearing the four children who have made her a grandmother 11 times over.
"There's something about living in a high-rise and then having all this," Mrs. Benedetto said, running her eyes across the park's generous expanse. "I guess we're all similar. We like the outdoors and we enjoy being with Sarah Elliott. She's unique."
Ms. Elliott says the members of her community come in as many varieties as the birds. "Some are very much loners and very solitary," she said. "And some are social. They talk all the time. You think this poor person is in great need of talking, and then you find out what they're talking about. They could be comparing recipes. That's when I put my foot down and say, 'Quiet!' "

HEADLINE: Virginia Law Makes Spam, With Fraud, A Felony 

BYLINE:  By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
In the toughest move to date against unsolicited commercial e-mail, Virginia enacted a law yesterday imposing harsh felony penalties for sending such messages to computer users through deceptive means.
 The law would be enforced against those who use fraudulent practices to send bulk e-mail, commonly known as spam, to or from Virginia, a state that is headquarters for a number of major Internet providers, including the nation's largest, America Online. 
 The new statute adds criminal penalties for fraudulent, high-volume spammers. It outlaws practices like forging the return address line of an e-mail message or hacking a computer to send spam surreptitiously. Those found guilty of sending more than 10,000 such deceptive e-mail messages in one day would be subject to a prison term of one to five years and forfeiture of profits and assets connected with these activities. 
Public outrage at spam is causing states and Congress to start looking at stronger measures against it. The Internet industry estimates that spam represents nearly half of all e-mail sent. And a new report by the Federal Trade Commission yesterday found that two-thirds of spam is sent with either false return addresses or a misleading subject line. 
Such anger from computer users is even causing some in the industry to support federal legislation, if only to avoid having to deal with a patchwork of state anti-spam laws. More than two dozen states have anti-spam laws, but enforcement problems and low penalties have made many of the laws ineffective.
Virginia's governor, Mark R. Warner, said the new law could have a significant effect on spam because half of all Internet traffic flows through the state. The passage of e-mail through Virginia-based Internet service providers, he said, gives state prosecutors the ability to reach the purveyors of spam in other states and jurisdictions, noting that an earlier, weaker state anti-spam law had survived constitutional challenges.
"Many spammers see the current system that imposes civil fines as just a cost of doing business," Governor Warner said. "We hope we will see some high-profile prosecutions. If someone faces a jail sentence and a major forfeiture of assets, it will serve as a deterrent." 
But some legal experts said they doubted whether Virginia would have as much of an impact as Mr. Warner suggested. Legal cases, they said, would probably be bogged down by questions over jurisdiction. Moreover, there are practical problems that limit the ability of prosecutors to reach beyond their own states. 
Shane Ham, a senior analyst who studies anti-spam legislation for the Progressive Policy Institute, said, "I can't imagine the state attorney general in Virginia getting a lot of cooperation if they call up the police in California saying that they want them to arrest and extradite someone who is wanted for spamming."
About half the states have tried to regulate various aspects of spam. The first bill was passed in Nevada in 1997, and simply required that marketers offer recipients a way to be removed from e-mail lists. Washington state has brought several anti-spam cases based on laws that prohibit sending e-mail to state residents where the sender or the subject line is falsified.
Some states, including California, require unsolicited e-mail to be identified with "ADV" in the subject line. Some of these allow recipients of e-mail that violates these rules to sue the sender and seek monetary damages.
Experts say these state rules do not appear to have had a significant effect on spam but have instead perplexed big corporations, like credit card companies and catalog merchants, that do business by e-mail.
"We need a single strong national policy to deal with spam so that no one can play the states off against each other," Mr. Ham said. Of course, even national legislation would do little to prevent spam sent from overseas, as a great deal is.
Congress, which ignored anti-spam bills introduced in the last four years, is now expected to give serious consideration to several new proposals. Indeed, prospective Congressional action is, in part, a response to anti-spam efforts by the states. 
The Direct Marketing Association, the lobbying group for companies that sell by postal mail and e-mail, has reversed its previous opposition to national anti-spam legislation, largely to secure a more unified set of rules.
The group would particularly like to avoid provisions that could force marketers who are found to violate the law to make payments to individuals who received their e-mail messages.
Earlier this month, Senators Conrad Burns, Republican of Montana, and Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, introduced a bill that would require senders to label unsolicited commercial e-mail and ban them from falsifying the sender's name or the subject. 
This week, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York introduced a bill, intended, he said, to impose criminal penalties on senders who repeatedly violate the law and to create a national registry of people who do not want to receive spam. "Last year, spam was an annoyance," Mr. Schumer said yesterday. "This year, it is a significant problem, and next year, it could start to really kill the use of e-mail."
Representative Zoe Lofgren, Democrat of California, plans to introduce a bill that, like some state statutes, would require bulk spam to be labeled with "ADV" in the subject line. The bill would also carry out a proposal by Prof. Lawrence Lessig of Stanford forcing the senders of spam to pay computer users a bounty for reporting it.
All these proposals are meant to restrict deceptive marketers -- those selling things like rich-quick schemes and penis enlargers -- as well as merchants of pornography. They do not address the great quantities of nondeceptive marketing e-mail sent by big companies and even the Internet service providers themselves. America Online, for example, sends nearly two million marketing e-mail messages a day to its 35 million members. 
But the diffuse nature of the Internet defies orderly regulation, even at the national level, when e-mail travels from state to state and country to country, often in untraceable ways. Many experts think that fighting spam will require new technological approaches that supplement legislation coming from many sources -- including spam purveyors, Internet access providers and big companies that seek customers by e-mail.
Many anti-spam proposals will be debated in a three-day forum on spam in Washington starting today. The F.T.C. -- which already prosecutes some spammers using existing anti-fraud laws -- is organizing the forum and will take an unusually comprehensive look into the technology and economics of the spammers and the potential techniques to thwart them.
E-mail marketers, like Scott Richter, president of OptInRealBig.com, of Westminster, Colo., will debate with anti-spam activists like Alan Murphy, an investigator for Spamhaus, a British registry meant to identify spammers. (Mr. Richter is prominent on Mr. Murphy's list.)
Even Mr. Richter now says that a national law may be a good idea. "I want one law," he said in an interview. "Now, if someone lives in certain states, I have to put 'ADV' in the header. What if he moves and I don't know it?"
Mr. Richter, however, does not want rules that would restrict his marketing too much, where he sells diet pills, among other things. "I'm a U.S. citizen and I've worked hard to build this business," he said. "I don't want to have to move to the Bahamas or to China."

C4) Chart/Map: "Trying to Check Spam"Many states have enacted laws that regulate bulk e-mail and require people who send it to give recipients a way to avoid receiving it. Some prohibit unsolicited bulk e-mail. Where bulk e-mail is allowed, bulk e-mailers are required to provide recipients some way to opt out of future e-mails. Some prohibit bulk e-mailers from using false routing information or other methods to hide their identities while others require that bulk e-mails be labeled as advertisements.

HEADLINE: Former President of NOW Is Taking Helm at Y.W.C.A. 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, April 29 

 BODY:
Trying to breathe new life into a 145-year-old organization, the Y.W.C.A. of the U.S.A. has chosen Patricia Ireland, the outspoken former president of the National Organization for Women, to be its new chief executive. 
 Ms. Ireland's appointment, to be announced on Wednesday, coincides with the Y.W.C.A.'s relocation of its national headquarters to Washington from Manhattan. 
 "This is just an irresistible opportunity," Ms. Ireland said in an interview on Monday. "I want to be back in the public policy arena." 
She attributed her selection for the post, which sheis to assume by May 15, to her "unique experience" with NOW and her public visibility.
"The Y.W.C.A. has not had a presence in Washington and not had an emphasis on advocacy at a time that it seems very important," Ms. Ireland said. 
The Y.W.C.A., she said, has programs that include child care, job training and prevention of violence against women, all of which are being hurt by federal budget cuts.
"The local affiliates and local associations have these great programs," she said. "But all the programs are being cut because the budget in Washington is being cut."
At NOW, Ms. Ireland combined grass-roots organizational techniques with an insider's knowledge of Washington to provide the group with a national voice. She vows to do the same in her new position. 
"It's a question of organizing and advocating," she said.Ms. Ireland plans to direct her efforts to gain economic empowerment and racial equality for women and girls, two of the organization's central goals.
"The bottom line is the bottom line," she said. "If we had greater economic empowerment, a lot of other issues would be easier to deal with."
Ms. Ireland said she would work closely with local organizations to determine where Y.W.C.A. advocacy has succeeded or failed. In doing so, she will be able to more effectively lobby for the Y.W.C.A.'s causes on Capitol Hill, she said.
She named possible Y.W.C.A. campaigns: fair voting rights for people of all races (she is a Floridian, and says the 2000 presidential election is still in her mind) and celebrity spokeswomen (she suggested the tennis star Serena Williams as a role model for young women).
"Perhaps we will even have a 'Feed the Models' rally in New York City, in the fashion district," she said, not entirely in jest.
Ms. Ireland also said the Y.W.C.A. headquarters' new site in Washington places it near many resources, including a network of civil rights and social justice groups.
"Part of the joy of this is that I don't have to figure it all out myself," she said.
She is eager, she said, to be a part of the Y.W.C.A.'s "tremendous history," which has included work on behalf of women's suffrage, sex education and racial equality. 
"In one sense, I'm diving back into the women's movement," she said. "The Y.W.C.A. has a certain amount of respectability that I would like to capitalize on."
At NOW, an organization that is pro-women and pro-lesbian and abortion rights, she developed a reputation for bucking conservative norms. A decade ago, Ms. Ireland raised eyebrows by living with another woman in Washington while remaining married to her husband, with whom she recently celebrated their 35th wedding anniversary.
She said she did not know what criteria the Y.W.C.A.'s executive board used in its selection, but she added that "there were certainly no questions about my personal life," in the interview process.
Today, Ms. Ireland, 57, one of America's most prominent feminists, finds herself leading an organization historically associated with traditional Christian values. But she points out that the Y.W.C.A. is "enriched by many faiths" and has an extensive history of progressivism.
"The Y.W.C.A.'s long history includes taking positions that were at the time very radical and distressful to the common culture," she said, noting that in the early 20th century the organization was among the first public advocates of racial integration and equality.

HEADLINE: Legislators Pursue a Budget That Reverses Pataki's Cuts 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER and JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 29 

 BODY:
Defying Gov. George E. Pataki, state lawmakers began passing a state budget tonight that restores most of the cuts to education and Medicaid that the governor had proposed. The plan would raise both the sales tax and income taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers to pay for it.
 Legislative leaders also promised to provide more than $1 billion in new revenue for New York City, though they had not agreed on specifics. Along with the restorations of school aid and Medicaid money, the plan would provide Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg with almost all of the assistance he had sought from Albany to help close the city's budget gap, the leaders said. 
 But Mr. Pataki defiantly vowed to veto the Legislature's budget plan and to punish politically any lawmaker who went along with it. 
Still, both chambers immediately started passing appropriation bills for transportation, public protection and some government services by formidable vote tallies. By late evening, lawmakers were preparing for the printer the bill to increase taxes and raise the revenue to pay for their spending.
By moving forward, the Legislature sets the stage for what promises to be a bruising showdown with the governor.
Until midday yesterday, the legislative leaders had hoped that they could get Mr. Pataki to join them in a mutually acceptable budget. The state faces an $11.5 billion budget gap, and the governor has vowed not to raise income taxes to solve the crisis.
In a news conference in his second-floor office this afternoon, Mr. Pataki said that he could not go along with the deal. He said that he would veto any budget bills the Legislature passed and that he would do his best to thwart an override.
"The consequences to the Legislature -- should this plan become law -- are clear," Mr. Pataki said, in a speech that he delivered to reporters and his aides.
"I will do everything in my ability to prevent this plan from becoming law, including exercising my veto powers," the governor said. "I will fight for the people of New York. I will fight for the principles that have made New York a better state. And I will fight to ensure that any legislator, Democrat or Republican, Assembly member or senator, will be held accountable by the people for their choice."
He said the Legislature's plan would require at least $7 billion worth of tax increases over the next two years and would suffocate any chance for an economic recovery in New York, a claim that lawmakers said was inaccurate.
After delivering his statement, the governor pivoted away from a lectern and left the room as his aides applauded loudly, preventing reporters from asking follow-up questions.
Later in the day, details of the budget plan began to trickle out. A legislative aide said the revenue bill includes an increase in the sales tax for the next three years, to 4.25 percent from 4 percent. It also includes a temporary surcharge on those residents who earn an adjusted annual gross income of $150,00 or more. The income tax rate would increase to 7.5 percent from 6.85 percent, then go back down to its current level in three years.
The bill includes many other new revenue sources that could generate as much as $1 billion. 
With momentum seeming to move against him, Mr. Pataki staked his political fortune on the strength of his case. But within minutes of his announcement, in a reflection of the Legislature's determination, the Senate, controlled by the governor's Republican allies, voted 58-to-0 to override Mr. Pataki's veto of a bill that would extend by two weeks the May 20 deadline for school districts around the state to present their budgets to voters. The State Assembly, led by Democrats, passed the bill the previous day by a vote of 111 to 38, with nine Republicans in support.
Legislators from both parties were girding themselves for the likelihood that the three-term governor would make good on his threat to veto their budget, and that they would have to override his veto. For Republicans, it was tantamount to a rebellion against their party leader.
Several Republicans in the State Senate said, however, they would stand solidly with their majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, despite the governor's threat to oppose them when they face re-election campaigns next year.
Dale M. Volker, a Republican senator from Depew in western New York, said the threat was empty, as he doubted that the governor would truly stand by his vow to hurt fellow Republicans, all of whom are gearing up to play host to President Bush at the presidential nominating convention in New York City in September 2004.
"We are all Republicans," Mr. Volker said. "He is not going to take anybody out."
Senator Volker said the strategies of the governor's political advisers "are old." Much more important to the legislators, he said, was the outcry from their constituents against the governor's budget, which was considered likely to lead to increases in local property taxes to compensate for proposed cuts in school aid, Medicaid and other state assistance.
"This is more than political, much bigger," Mr. Volker said.
A two-thirds majority is needed in each chamber to override the governor's vetoes. In the Assembly, where 103 of the 150 members are Democrats, 101 votes are needed for an override. The governor would need at least four Democrats, assuming all Republicans sided with him.
In the Senate, Mr. Bruno needs four Democratic votes to override the governor's veto, assuming that all 37 of his Republican colleagues stand with him. The chamber has 62 members.
The Assembly Republicans today were the governor's only allies. The 47 Republicans voted as a block against the two budget bills the Assembly passed, contending that they could not support the spending bills until they saw a revenue bill.
That bill began to take shape as the night wore on. In addition to the $2.5 billion in new taxes, and $1 billion in other revenues, the plan would include $4.2 billion worth of borrowing. It can come to a vote in three days.
How the budget battle plays out may depend on the Assembly's minority leader, Charles Nesbitt of Albion.
"We obviously feel very close to the governor and have a lot of respect for his judgment," Mr. Nesbitt said. "It's the state's economy that is providing this money, and it's our responsibility to nurture a healthy state economy."
But when it came to Mr. Pataki's political threat, many lawmakers in both parties shrugged it off. "If the governor looks at his approval ratings, I don't think he's striking fear into anyone's hearts," said Assemblyman Michael N. Gianaris, a Democrat from Queens.
Even Mr. Bruno, Mr. Pataki's ally in Albany, seemed to indicate that lawmakers would rather take their chances with Mr. Pataki than invoke the wrath of property taxpayers. Saying at one point that he considered Mr. Pataki perhaps the greatest governor in state history, he said he nonetheless differed deeply with him in the current budget debate.
"I consider the governor a partner," Mr. Bruno said. "We are having a disagreement at the moment."
He said he considered the move the legislators are making to be courageous. "When this is all said and done, we are going to be representative of the great majority of the people," Mr. Bruno said.
Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, also expressed confidence that the Legislature had reversed what he called the governor's "wrong choices." Asked about the governor's threat to punish lawmakers politically, he said, "I think the governor perhaps should take a step back from his anger and recognize we all have to govern together."
The last time a governor's veto of budget bills was overridden was in 1982, under Hugh L. Carey. Never, however, has a Legislature succeeded in enacting a tax increase that a governor vetoed.
"The real jawbreaker will be the vote to override the veto of a revenue raiser," said William L. Parment, a Democratic Assemblyman from Jamestown. "That's a tough veto to override."

HEADLINE: World Briefing United Nations: Protesting Cuba's Place On Rights Panel 

BYLINE:  By Daniel B. Schneider (NYT) 

 BODY:
 The United States walked out of a meeting to protest Cuba's election to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights for another three-year term. 
Sichan Siv, the American representative to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, which oversees the rights group, said after the vote: "This is an outrage for us. We view Cuba as the worst violator of human rights in this hemisphere." Regional groups decide who fills seats. Latin America chose six countries, including Cuba, for six open seats, and all six were elected by acclamation. Cuba began its recent crackdown on dissidents as the Human Rights Commission was holding its annual meeting in Geneva. Daniel B. Schneider (NYT)

HEADLINE: As Venezuela Slides, the Poor Stand By Their Man 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, April 25 

 BODY:
Unemployed and penniless, Ermis Montilla, 31, lives for now with his family in a shack made of cardboard and corrugated tin. But he has nothing but praise for President Hugo Chavez.
 With building materials from the government, and advice from army engineers, Mr. Montilla is proudly constructing his own home on a hillside of Caracas. He has even become a community leader, imbued with a sense of civic consciousness he says Mr. Chavez has awakened in him. 
 "The opponents of Chavez always promised and promised but never spoke to us," said Mr. Montilla, a father of three. "Now, we have rights. Before, when we talked, no one listened."
But even as President Chavez has cast himself as a champion of the downtrodden, the paradox of his popularity is that there are more and more people like Mr. Montilla: living in poverty but ardent supporters of the president.
Since Mr. Chavez was elected in 1998, poverty has grown an estimated 10 percent and now includes nearly 68 percent of Venezuelans. Economists expect the underclass to grow still more in coming months, as the economy continues a tailspin that began last year in the wake of a short-lived coup against Mr. Chavez and three national strikes led by his opposition.
"If there is more unemployment, more poverty, more crime, why are the poor still with Chavez?" asked Ana Maria Sanjuan, a sociologist at the Central University. "The reason is simple. Chavez is the only one who has addressed the poor, the one who gives a hope to the poor about a possible inclusion."
Beyond his direct apeals to the poor, analysts note, Mr. Chavez has also carefully directed his assistance programs, like the one benefiting Mr. Montilla. 
Taken as a whole, these programs fail to form a broad, coherent public policy, said Luis Pedro Espana, a poverty expert and director of the Institute of Economic and Social Studies at Andres Bello Catholic University in Caracas. But they go a long way toward explaining Mr. Chavez's enduring popularity as the economy shrinks. 
The programs -- ranging from new homes to subsidized food markets to mobile clinics -- are welcomed in long-neglected barrios, deftly spread, and then their importance inflated, Mr. Espana said.
"The government does not really have a social policy," he said. "What they have is social theater."
No one blames Mr. Chavez for bringing poverty -- he won office in 1998 after two decades in which poverty rose to nearly 60 percent from 28 percent of the population.
But the downward economic slide has come hard and fast, particularly since last year. Indeed, the economy may fall by 17 percent, unemployment is approaching 20 percent, thousands of businesses are closing and capital flight amounts to billions of dollars. The government and many economists in the United States blame the effects of a two-month national strike called in December by Chavez opponents. The opposition blames government mismanagement.
In any case, Mr. Chavez retains the support of nearly 40 percent of Venezuelans, higher than other Latin American leaders and vital if he is to avoid losing power in a referendum that opposition groups are demanding for later this year.
Mr. Chavez's poverty programs, and his vocal promotion of the rights of the poor, have been remarkably effective in mobilizing a community as a rule not politically active.
In the wretched neighborhoods ringing Caracas, where the president has drawn most of his support, it is easy to find throngs faithful to the man they call "my commander."
"He moves us and that is why I am here," said Marisela Araujo, 36, as she waited to catch a glimpse of Mr. Chavez at the opening of a government-subsidized food market. "The people here -- we are not paid like the opposition says. No one told us to come. We come here because we love him."
In interviews across several of Caracas's poorest neighborhoods, residents did not readily point to tangible benefits under Mr. Chavez's time in office. Those were seemingly in short supply.
Instead, most quickly pointed to the Constitution, the 50-cent bible of Mr. Chavez's self-styled revolution, for having instilled pride and provided direction.
Critics call the Constitution a mobilizing tool manipulated by Mr. Chavez. But the devoted tout articles in the jumbled document that give rights to people to undertake their own urban planning projects, embark on community activism and allow them to seek titles to plots where they have built makeshift homes.
The Constitution goes hand in hand with government efforts to organize local councils that do everything from paving sidewalks topicking up trash. Even where Venezuelans still live in poverty, they say they now believe they have a voice in the political process.
"The people have learned how to build," said Jose Gregorio Blanco, a community leader. "The president wants people to go and learn, to learn how to get things done."
More tangibly, the government has more than doubled spending on education, mostly for teacher salaries. While other spending is murkier, the government is clearly funneling aid and services toward poor neighborhoods.
In the barrio Las Marias, where Mr. Blanco provided a tour, five buildings with 288 apartments for the poor are being built. In Isaias Medina Angarita, residents thank Mr. Chavez for paved sidewalks. In the Sucre district, the Florencio Jimenez school, long neglected, now serves free lunches and offers expanded school hours for 563 pupils.
The government has also set up people's banks, giving credit to small enterprises. It is handing out titles to poor squatters in Caracas slums. Low-priced or free medical services are provided through roaming clinics. 
The programs have the feel of old-style patronage. With them, Mr. Chavez has managed to erase doubt among followers by taking up the populist script in a way that has not been seen in Latin America in recent years, spending hours with crowds of followers.
In Caricuao, a poor neighborhood of Soviet-style apartment blocks in southwest Caracas, his aides led a hunched group of elderly women from the crowd and provided them seating under a white tent, just feet from the president, who was there to inaugurate the first of what will be 100 markets across the city. Afterward, they expressed everlasting loyalty.
"He does not care if you are rich or poor," explained Irda de Belandria, 66. "His heart is so pure."
But for the neighborhood, the affection for Mr. Chavez may outlast the material effect of the markets, which offer only a modest assortment of goods like canned products, powdered milk and sugar. Even the actual opening was unclear.
The president left, and military officers shut the metal gates over the storefront. One woman asked when it would reopen.
"I do not know," a military official said. "They told us tomorrow, maybe."

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: NATO; 
4-Nation Plan For Defense Of Europe

BYLINE:  By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, April 29 

 BODY:
Their goals may have been laudable, but their timing could not have been worse.
 The leaders of four European nations that opposed the American-led war in Iraq unveiled a plan today for closer cooperation aimed at making Europe's defense more coherent and more independent of that of the United States. 
 In a ballroom of the Hilton Hotel, President Jacques Chirac of France, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany, Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt of Belgium and Premier Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg all emphasized -- more than once -- that their security and defense initiative would strengthen, not undermine, the NATO alliance and their relationships with their other European Union partners.
"This is not directed against NATO," Mr. Schroder said. "It's a reinforcement of NATO, because it will strengthen the European pillar." 
But at another point he said, "In NATO we don't suffer from too much America; we suffer from not enough Europe."
Asked about the exclusionary nature of their summit meeting, the four leaders insisted that all they were doing was a bit of creative repackaging, citing proposals, communiques, meetings and initiatives that went back years. "We didn't have a meeting here of putschists, certainly not," Mr. Juncker said.
But perceptions are crucial to diplomacy. And in the face of strong warnings from the United States and Britain not to do anything to harm NATO, the fact that the meeting took place at all sent a strong signal that a core group within NATO and the European Union was prepared to create joint strategies without consulting its partners in advance. 
The summit meeting also left bad feelings among European Union members who were left out.
In particular, the four leaders had been advised not to set up a European military headquarters, on the ground that doing so would risk rivaling the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, or Shape, which directs the alliance's military planning from southern Belgium.
But among the group's proposals was the creation of a military center in Belgium in the summer of 2004 for "planning and command" of joint European Union operations outside the NATO theater. Mr. Chirac insisted that the new center would increase efficiency. "This is not about duplicating Shape," he said, "but eliminating duplication by national headquarters."
But in Washington, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said NATO was more in need of better weapons. "What we need is not more headquarters," he told a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. "What we need is more capability and fleshing out the structure and the forces that are there with the equipment that they need."
Mr. Bush warned France in an interview with NBC News on April 25 not to use its position in Europe "to create alliances against the United States, or Britain or Spain or any of the new countries that are the new democracies in Europe."
Underscoring the centrality of NATO, Mr. Bush said, "It's very important that Europe not become fractured to the point where the United States won't have relations with a united Europe, whole, free and at peace."
Deep suspicions of the four countries remain since their initial refusal of an American request to bolster Turkey's defenses before the war in Iraq, considered the most serious rift in NATO history.
Other initiatives announced at today's meeting include the creation of a joint rapid reaction unit built on an existing French-German brigade into which Belgian commandos and a Luxembourg reconnaissance team will be integrated.
The group also reiterated the need to unite European military air transport, disaster relief, training and arms procurement.
The proposals will be presented to the 11 other members of the European Union this weekend.
There was no mention in the four leaders' communique of increasing Europe's military spending, a sore point within the European Union and in Europe's relationship with Washington.
The European Union's foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, who decided not to attend the summit meeting, said it would be valuable only if it spurred governments to spend more money on their militaries.
France spends 2.6 percent of its gross domestic product on military expenses, but the three other nations at today's meeting are among the lowest military spenders in Europe.
There were calls from politicians and newspapers in Europe to call off today's meeting. In fact, it was seen in the end largely as a maneuver by Mr. Verhofstadt to garner support at home in the weeks before a tight general electionon May 18.

HEADLINE: Union Members Rally at City Hall Against City's Plans for Job Cuts 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Thousands of union members rallied outside City Hall last night in the largest protest so far against Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's planned layoffs and budget cuts.
 Carrying signs that read, "We've just begun to fight," and "Don't balance the budget on our backs," the protesters urged the mayor to cancel the layoffs and instead push for more aid from Albany and for higher taxes on the rich. 
 The rally was organized by District Council 37, the largest municipal union, which has 125,000 members and has been hit harder than any other union by Mr. Bloomberg's plans to lay off 4,500 workers. 
"This fight is not just about D.C. 37 members," said Lillian Roberts, the district council's executive director. "This fight is about the quality of life for all New Yorkers. In order for the city's good years to return, we need a budget that does not work against the city work force."
She was flanked by a handful of politicians and a phalanx of top labor leaders, including Dennis Rivera, president of 1199/S.E.I.U.; Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers; and Roger Toussaint, president of Transport Workers Union Local 100.
The Police Department estimated that there were 15,000 protesters, who stood on either side of Broadway, stretching hundreds of yards north from Park Place to above Chambers Street.
The rally's main message was that Mayor Bloomberg should look anywhere but to layoffs, union concessions or service cuts to trim the city's $4 billion budget. Speaker after speaker said that union members made the city work, that they were not well paid and that it was wrong to squeeze them more to balance the budget.
Mr. Bloomberg has been at loggerheads with the unions over their failure to agree with him on $600 million in savings he asked for on employee benefits.
Struggling to speak over the cheering crowd, Ms. Weingarten, who is also chairwoman of the Municipal Labor Committee, said, "They are saying, 'Either you give up your benefits or you accept layoffs.' Is that a fair choice?"
The crowd thundered, "No!"
At a news conference, Mr. Bloomberg said he was sympathetic to municipal workers. "Nobody wants to lose their job," he said. "Nobody wants to not get raises, and my commitment when I came into office was do the best I can to protect the workers, to downsize only through attrition and through early retirement."
But he said that he had no choice but to order layoffs because some union leaders appeared to find limited layoffs more acceptable than granting concessions, which anger almost all union members.
"They would rather have a handful of happy members left," Mr. Bloomberg said. "I don't know that that's good representation but that's up to the union members to go to their leaders and say what they want to do. If they want to help prevent layoffs they can do it."
The protesters directed their fire at not just the mayor, but also at Gov. George E. Pataki, the rich, and private contractors doing business for the city, insisting that they could all do more to eliminate the city's budget deficit. As for whether the unions had any role in helping close the deficit, the protesters were mum.
"The mayor is out of touch," said Arthur Cheliotes, president of a communications' workers local representing 8,000 city supervisors and middle managers. "He doesn't understand the working people of the city. He and his rich friends continue to get a free ride. The time has come for the rich to pay."
The union members appeared as a sea of green and blue T-shirts, and for many of them, the rally was not so much a time to scream, but a time to relax and chat in the sun with buddies from work.
"I'm here because I don't agree with the layoffs," said Ina Stennett, who earns $25,000 a year after 22 years as a clerical worker in socia services. "Too many people lost their jobs with the World Trade Center, and now we're losing more jobs. I don't see how layoffs are going to help the city."
Even as he said the mayor had a good heart, Yosry Aly, who has worked for 16 yearls as a city tax auditor, faulted Mr. Bloomberg for ordering layoffs in his department, saying they were shortsighted.
"Every tax auditor brings in $1 million to $2 million a year," he said. "If your problem is money, then why are you laying off auditors who bring in money?"
Hundreds of workers from the Civil Service Employees Association, the transport workers and other unions joined the rally. In addition, nearly 1,000 workers from a group that protested the war in Iraq, United for Peace and Justice, marched from Washington Square to join the rally, asserting that less money should go to the Pentagon and more to the nation's cities.
The city's labor unions appear divided over where to focus their criticism. District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees made Mr. Bloomberg its target, while 1199, the giant health care union, held its big demonstration in Albany, to pressure Governor Pataki, and the teachers' union has been planning a rally in Albany to urge the governor to restore his threatened education cuts.
Several of the speakers directed their words at Albany, insisting the governor could do more to bail out the city. Marty Markowitz, the Brooklyn borough president, told the crowd, "Our message is to the governor -- show us the money."
"Our message is to the mayor. You helped elect the governor," he said. "He owes you big time. Now collect your I.O.U.'s."

HEADLINE: City, in Deep Hole, Stretches Out Hand To Private Donors 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration, hampered by a $3.8 billion deficit and dim prospects of financial assistance from the state government, is leaning on New York's private sector for a helping hand in ways unlike any other administration in recent memory.
 Since taking office, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has asked friends to pay for major city events and has told his commissioners to look to foundations and corporations to help the city pay for certain programs. He has hired a chief marketing officer to persuade corporations to pay to sponsor events and city sites. His schools chancellor has tapped Caroline Kennedy to raise money for public education. 
 And the mayor recently restarted the New York City Public Private Initiatives, a city-controlled nonprofit group begun under the Giuliani administration to pay for various pet projects. Its goal is to persuade as many wealthy individuals and foundations as possible to shore up certain services the city can no longer afford to provide. 
Under the Bloomberg administration, the private sector has been underwriting everything from Parks Department festivals to positions within the Department of Cultural Affairs to building a $1.2 million counterterrorism center and creating a mobile chemical and biological detection lab, both for the Police Department. The next major wave of financing will most likely be focused on educational programs, an area where government dollars are shrinking.
To put it in perspective, between 1994 and 2001, the Public Private Initiatives raised $11 million, excluding funds raised for World Trade Center victims. Since Mr. Bloomberg took office 13 months ago, it has raised nearly $14 million.
"Not in my lifetime has there been this level of concentrated expectation that the private sector will help basic city services," said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City.
Mr. Bloomberg recently asked Steven Rattner, a managing principal in a private investment firm and a well-known philanthropist, to be the chairman of the Public Private Initiatives. (Name change under consideration: The Mayor's Fund to Advance New York.) A former associate director of development at Stanford University, Joel Getz, is the president. 
"We need enormous involvement and help," said Patricia E. Harris, the deputy mayor for administration. "P.P.I. will be more aggressive in reaching out to more foundations, corporations and individuals for support."
Of course, government has always depended on the largess of the private sector. But the city's needs are their largest since the fiscal crisis of the 1970's, which is the last time government aggressively courted the private sector to help bail it out.
And today's problems -- and their private-sector solutions -- are quite different from those of that era. In the 1970's, New York's many hometown banks were involved in the city's recovery, stretching out debt payments and working closely with city officials to get its house in order. This was partially out of self-interest since many had large investments in New York City bonds. 
Back then, foundations tended to pay for local civic groups to supplement city services like community policing or cleaning streets. Unlike now, the city was trying to stave off bankruptcy, and the efforts of the private sector, labor unions and state agencies focused on that goal, with those groups often lobbying for the city in Albany and Washington. 
But now, the private sector is being asked to help address directly what are essentially holes in the city's operating budget, either with direct financial assistance for programs the city would like but cannot afford, like a colon cancer prevention program or a Parks Department winter festival, or to pay to be the host of special events in the city, like the Republican National Convention, which will be held in New York in August of next year. 
"I am not so sure that private charity played such a big role in the 1970's," said Osborn Elliott, the chairman of the Citizens Committee for New York City, which was created in 1975 in response to the city's fiscal crisis. "The big things that the private sector did was lobby, buy bonds and create neighborhood initiatives."
Further, the city has never quite had a mayor like Mr. Bloomberg, who has spent most of his professional life as a generous philanthropist. Philanthropy is a quid pro quo sport among affluent New Yorkers, and Mr. Bloomberg has plenty of chits to call in. Now, when he calls on friends whose charities he has supported, his pet cause is New York City. 
The approach is not without risks. Because of a national economic slowdown and a downturn on Wall Street, corporations, private donors and foundations all have less to give than they did even two years ago. Some nonprofit groups, which tend to supplement city programs even in flush times, are concerned that the city will end up competing with them for scarce resources.
"We recognize that in times of fiscal shortfalls, the city won't be able to fund certain things," said Laura Wolff, program officer of the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation, which finances advocacy groups. "But there needs to be recognition that there is no hidden pot of money."
"Government and nonprofs are the two legs on the stool," Ms. Wolff went on, "and you can fiddle with the balance, but if one leg goes away," it will be hard for groups that traditionally rely on both the government and the private sector to survive.
Ms. Harris said that Public Private Initiatives was looking to young donors -- "the next Steven Rattners"-- and companies like BP, which are just establishing themselves as corporate citizens in New York, and others apart from the list of usual suspects in the philanthropic world, which she said would reduce competition with smaller organizations. (BP Amoco will finance three fellowships in the Department of Cultural Affairs.) 
Mayor Bloomberg has looked to private money -- including his own -- before he even took office. It is well known that the mayor has dipped into his pocket anonymously to pay for a large part of the restoration of Gracie Mansion, and to finance small arts organizations to the tune of $20 million.
And he has turned to his friends. When it came time to raise $9 million to pay for the commemoration ceremonies for the first anniversary of Sept. 11, Mr. Bloomberg asked three friends -- Gerald M. Levin, the former chairman of AOL Time Warner; Stanley S. Shuman, managing director of Allen & Company; and Thomas S. Murphy, retired chairman of Capital Cities/ABC -- to raise it. 
All three men will sit on the newly configured Public Private Initiatives board, which Mr. Rattner said would have about 30 members, including the gossip columnist Liz Smith and 10 other prior members. 
Private money has been used by the Bloomberg administration to bring a special session of Congress to New York last year, to attract the Grammys and to restore the Governors Room in City Hall. Verizon gave money for an after-school program and other causes, and the Paul and Klara Porzelt Foundation has donated $25,000 to restore the mural on the ceiling of the City Council chamber.
Ms. Smith, in the sort of oddball effort that city officials love, implored her readers to send checks to the city in lieu of gifts for her 80th birthday and then continued to press the case in subsequent columns; the effort raised more than $200,000.
Sometimes, what donors can offer is expertise, office space, people or other resources. In one recent case, a few nonprofit groups had workers fan out across the city to help the federal government's effort to get low-income residents to apply for the earned-income tax credit. A pharmaceutical company donated smoking-cessation patches for the city to dole out to potential quitters.
"There are many ways for private philanthropy to work with the city," said Karen L. Rosa, the executive director of the Altman Foundation, which gives money to social welfare, health care, education and arts groups. "We bring a lot more than dollars. We need to do more in terms of sharing expertise and knowledge about programs. It is less likely that we would give money directly to the city. There is no way private philanthropy can fill those gaps."
The city's efforts will certainly hold the attention of the nonprofit world.
"I applaud the mayor's efforts," said Jonathan Greengrass, the acting director of Learning Leaders, which supports public education. "But I would also say that we are concerned about the long-term impact they will have on our fund-raising. It is a concern to everybody because it is such an unknown. Of course, in New York there is a tendency to get upset about things before seeing if they have really happened."

HEADLINE: The Forgotten Half of Budgeting 

 BODY:
As Congress returns to business this week, with leaders bent on pushing President Bush's tax cut up from its $350 billion floor toward the $550 billion ceiling, there is little talk about the vital programs that face future cutbacks in the budget plan. At least $168 billion across the decade is scheduled to be wrenched out of domestic spending as more than $2 trillion in deficits and borrowing is rung up under Mr. Bush's "growth" program. 
 It may be pitifully wishful thinking at this point, but instead of enacting another swath of tax cuts, Congress should keep the revenue and direct it at some of the following priorities: 
 *Fiscal relief for the states, which are slashing health care benefits for the needy as they wrestle with booming deficits that cannot be rolled over into some other administration's debt-besotted future. Many senators favor emergency aid on the order of $35 billion, much of it for Medicaid costs. But it remains to be seen how many have the will to fight for it.
*Extended benefits for unemployed Americans, whose emergency benefits program expires May 31. The nation continues to hemorrhage jobs, and everyone who is trying to find employment is not succeeding in this economy. The cost of continuing the emergency benefits is about $1 billion a month -- a fraction of the cost of the lowest-denominator tax cut plan. 
*More money for education, which faces a $20 billion cut over 10 years in the budget. If Congress skipped the tax cut, education funds could easily be made whole, and the administration could match the rhetoric of the president's no-child-left-behind promises with adequate financing. Lawmakers could also cover the cost of educating children with special learning needs, a federal mandate that is short by billions of dollars annually. 
*Funds for homeland defense. The gap is quickly growing between federal directives to localities and financing. The Senate sought, then dropped, extra financing for vulnerable ports in budget negotiations. And for all the homage to first responders, cuts loom for local law enforcement.
These budget needs and more have barely been debated, let alone attended to. Obviously, asking the public whether it would rather see these needs met or have a cut in the dividends tax would produce an answer the Bush administration does not want to hear. The president and Republican leaders shamefully prefer to keep the national focus on the wrong ball.

HEADLINE: AFTEREFFECTS: FINANCES; 
Iraqi-Born Billionaire Has Big Stake in Bank That Holds Baghdad's Oil-for-Food Funds

BYLINE:  By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

 BODY:
One of the largest private shareholders in BNP Paribas, the French bank that holds more than $13 billion in Iraqi oil funds administered through the United Nation's oil-for-food program, is an Iraqi-born businessman who once helped to arm Iraq in the 1980's and brokered business deals with Saddam Hussein's government, according to public records and interviews.
 The involvement of the businessman, the British billionaire Nadhmi Auchi, raises questions about how carefully the United Nations has vetted the bank in its continuing role as repository of oil-for-food funds. 
 The oil-for-food program began in 1996 as an effort to ease the impact of economic sanctions on civilians after the United Nations imposed them on Iraq in 1990. Although the United Nations pressed Iraq to allow banks other than BNP Paribas to be the primary repository for billions of dollars in oil revenue, Iraq successfully insisted that BNP Paribas remain the sole caretaker of the program's escrow account. 
There is no evidence that Mr. Auchi, or BNP Paribas itself, engaged in any irregularities in the handling of the Iraqi funds. 
A United Nations spokesman said it was now impossible to determine why Iraq insisted on BNP Paribas, other than that the Iraqis had "confidence and trust" in the bank.
"It's moved on with the winds of history," said the spokesman, Ian Steele. He said the United Nations had no knowledge of Mr. Auchi or his investment in BNP Paribas.
The United Nations gained nominal control of Iraqi oil profits through the oil-for-food program. But critics in the United States government and elsewhere say the United Nations has not policed the program effectively, and that some funds were diverted by Iraqi officials. The United Nations has defended its stewardship of the program. 
BNP Paribas said that it had had no contact with Mr. Auchi since it was formed in 2000 from the merger of Banque Nationale de Paris and Paribas, and that Mr. Auchi was uninvolved in the bank's management or shareholder relations. It also said that BNP had secured the oil-for-food account before its merger with Paribas and that Mr. Auchi played no part in winning the account.
BNP Paribas added that its participation in the oil-for-food program was the result of competitive bidding and that the United States Treasury had approved its participation.
"We believe we were appointed by the U.N. for this contract because they were looking for a large European financial institution and we are the largest bank in continental Europe," BNP Paribas said in a statement. "The oil-for-food program revenues represent about one-tenth of 1 percent of the total revenues of our company. It has no significant influence on our size or our level of profitability."
Mr. Auchi, who declined to be interviewed for this article, holds his stake in BNP Paribas through a Luxembourg concern he controls called General Mediterranean Holdings. As recently as 2001, General Mediterranean Holdings described itself in an annual report as one of largest single shareholders in BNP Paribas. 
 Mr. Auchi's London lawyer, David Corker, said that since 2001 General Mediterranean Holdings had reduced its BNP Paribas stake to about 0.4 percent of the bank's total shares, about half of the position he held before then. That stake would still make Mr. Auchi one of the bank's biggest single shareholders. Mr. Corker said his client had "never knowingly had any business dealings with the Hussein regime."
Mr. Auchi first became involved with Paribas, the predecessor to BNP Paribas, in the 1970's. He also played a central role in the 2000 merger of Paribas and BNP, helping to steer Paribas away from a merger with a rival concern.
In 1996, according to European news accounts, Belgium's ambassador to Luxembourg charged that Banque Continentale du Luxembourg, a bank that Mr. Auchi and Paribas jointly controlled until 1994, had handled personal accounts for Mr. Hussein.
Mr. Auchi sold his stake in the bank to Paribas in 1994, and Paribas sold off its stake in 1996. Mr. Corker said that Banque Continentale contested the Belgian ambassador's charge. Banque Continentale declined to comment.
Earlier this month, Mr. Auchi was arrested and released on bail in London pending a court hearing next week on fraud charges involving the French oil giant TotalFinaElf. French prosecutors have accused Mr. Auchi of helping channel bribes to Total's executives, a charge Mr. Corker denies.
Mr. Auchi was born in Iraq in 1937 and lived there until 1981, his lawyer said. He became a British citizen in 1981. Mr. Auchi sold Italian naval vessels to Mr. Hussein's government in the early 1980's.
In 1993, an Italian banker told Italian investigators that in 1987, Mr. Auchi had helped an engineering concern secure a contract for an oil pipeline from Iraq to Saudi Arabia by bribing members of the Hussein government, according to a transcript of a police interrogation. A translated copy of that interview was furnished to The New York Times by Kreindler & Kreindler, a New York law firm hoping to recover financial damages for the victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. 
The banker, Pierfrancesco Pacini Battaglia, told Italian investigators that Mr. Auchi was "one of the most important intermediaries in the affairs of Middle Eastern countries." 
Mr. Auchi's lawyer said his client never paid bribes to Iraqi officials involved with the Saudi pipeline project.
