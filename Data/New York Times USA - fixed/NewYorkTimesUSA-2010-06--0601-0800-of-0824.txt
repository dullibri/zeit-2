HEADLINE: In Price War, E-Readers Go Below $200

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE

 BODY:
A price war is brewing in the growing market for electronic reading devices. 
 Barnes & Noble, the national bookseller, announced Monday that it was dropping the price of its six-month-old Nook e-reader to $199 from $259 and introducing a new version of the device, which connects to the Internet only over Wi-Fi networks, for $149.
 Responding rapidly, Amazon.com then cut the price of its popular Kindle e-reader below the Nook, to $189 from $259. 
 The price cuts were made as manufacturers of e-readers faced a mounting threat from Apple's iPad. Even though it is far more expensive than the e-readers, the iPad, which starts at $500, performs a range of functions with a versatile, colorful display that contrasts sharply with the static, monochrome screen of e-book readers. Apple said it sold more than two million iPads in the two months since the tablet's introduction.
 ''It was obvious that the price of stand-alone e-readers had to come down,'' said James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, citing the threat by Apple and other tablet makers. ''We just never thought it was going to happen this rapidly.''
 Analysts had expected the prices of e-readers would gradually fall because of the natural decline in component costs and the increased profitability of e-books themselves. 
 Until this spring, e-book sellers like Amazon and Barnes & Noble sold many best-selling e-books at a loss to entice customers. But then five of the six major American publishers agreed with Apple to change to a so-called agency sales model. 
 Under the new agreement, booksellers were required to raise prices on many digital books and were able to make a 30 percent commission on the sales, which allows them to sacrifice some profit on their hardware.
 Steven P. Jobs, Apple's chief executive, said this month at the announcement for the company's new iPhone model that iPad owners had downloaded more than five million books in the last two months, or 2.5 books for each iPad. It was seen then as a troubling sign for Amazon because it revealed that iPad buyers were willing to make small sacrifices to read books on a general-purpose tablet that is heavier and has a bright LCD screen that can cause eye fatigue.
 The price cuts should add further momentum to what, despite incursions by the iPad, has been a growing market for dedicated e-reading devices. Amazon and its rivals are on pace to sell 6.6 million e-reading devices this year, up from 3.1 million in 2009, according to Forrester.
 But even as the market grows, several smaller players have encountered problems. IRex Technologies, based in the Netherlands, recently sought bankruptcy protection from creditors, citing problems with its division in the United States. 
 This month, the Skiff e-reading platform, developed by Hearst, was acquired by the News Corporation, casting doubts on the planned introduction of a Skiff reading device.
 Plastic Logic, the 10-year-old offspring of Cambridge University, has been delaying its $800 professional document- and book-reading device, the Que. It planned to have the reader on the market in April, but keeps pushing back a release date.
 Sony may be particularly affected by the price cuts. It was the first to the market with an e-reader in 2006, but it has fallen behind its rivals because it lacks Amazon's online sales prowess and Barnes & Noble's physical retail presence. Its $169 Pocket Edition model lacks a wireless connection, which suggests that Monday's price cuts will put pressure on Sony to also cut prices. Sony has two other models, the $199 Touch Edition and the $349 Internet-connected Daily Edition. 
 With recent software upgrades, Barnes & Noble has improved the Nook, which now has features to counter Amazon's aggressiveness on e-book prices and the brand power of the Kindle. Barnes & Noble allows Nook owners to read entire e-books within stores and lend e-books to friends for up to two weeks. Now, with yet another software upgrade, Nook owners have free access to AT&T's nationwide Wi-Fi network.
 ''I don't see more than two, or maybe three dedicated reading companies in the market for selling e-books,'' William J. Lynch, chief executive of Barnes & Noble, said. ''I think you are starting to see a shake-out now.''
 Mr. Lynch also predicted that within 12 months, e-reading devices ''that people will actually want to buy'' could be available for less than $100.

HEADLINE: Tough Confirmation Battle Looming for Medicare Nominee

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama's nominee to run Medicare and Medicaid, Dr. Donald M. Berwick, is a man with a mission, a preacher and a teacher who has been showing hospitals how they can save lives and money by zealously adhering to clinical protocols for the treatment of patients.
 Hospital executives who have worked with Dr. Berwick describe him as a visionary, inspiring leader. 
 But a battle has erupted over his nomination, suggesting that Dr. Berwick faces a long uphill struggle to win Senate confirmation.
 Republicans are using the nomination to revive their arguments against the new health care law, which they see as a potent issue in this fall's elections, and Dr. Berwick has given them plenty of ammunition.
 In two decades as a professor of health policy and as a prolific writer, he has spoken of the need to ration health care and cap spending and has confessed to a love affair with the British health care system. He has made numerous public appearances to talk about health care and has published a book of his speeches on the topic.
 Mr. Obama nominated Dr. Berwick on April 19 to be administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the largest purchaser of health care in the United States. The post has been vacant since October 2006, and the need to fill it has become more pressing with passage of the new law. The agency must write and enforce dozens of regulations to expand Medicaid, trim Medicare and test new ways to deliver care.
 The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, describes Dr. Berwick as an ''expert on rationing.'' Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, calls him ''the perfect nominee for a president whose aim has always been to save money by rationing health care.''
 Dr. Berwick, a pediatrician, is president and co-founder of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, a not-for-profit organization in Cambridge, Mass.
 In an introduction to Dr. Berwick's book, Dr. Frank Davidoff, a former editor of the Annals of Internal Medicine who works for the institute part time, said, ''Don Berwick preaches revolution.'' 
 He is trying to overthrow ''a stupid system'' that serves the needs of doctors, administrators and insurers rather than patients, Dr. Davidoff said.
 Administration officials say they are confident that Dr. Berwick will be confirmed, and they say Republicans have taken his comments out of context. In fact, many of the comments have been repeated, with slight variations, in Dr. Berwick's articles and lectures over the years. 
 In an interview last year in the journal Biotechnology Healthcare, Dr. Berwick said, ''The decision is not whether or not we will ration care -- the decision is whether we will ration with our eyes open.''
 Asked about such statements, Reid H. Cherlin, a White House spokesman, said: ''Rationing is rampant in the system today, as insurers make arbitrary decisions about who can get the care they need. Don Berwick wants to see a system in which those decisions are transparent, and the people who make them are held accountable.''
 In his book, ''Escape Fire: Designs for the Future of Health Care,'' Dr. Berwick sharply criticized ''the dangerous, toxic and expensive assumption that more is better.'' He insists that the nation can cut health costs without harming patients because vast sums are misspent. 
 ''I have said before, and I'll stand behind it, that the waste level in American medicine approaches 50 percent,'' he said in an interview in the journal Health Affairs in 2005.
 Dr. Berwick has championed efforts to ''reduce the total supply of high-technology medical and surgical care'' and to consolidate services in regional centers.
 Long before the uproar over ''death panels'' last year, Dr. Berwick was urging health care providers to ''reduce the use of unwanted and ineffective medical procedures at the end of life.'' 
 ''Using unwanted procedures in terminal illness is a form of assault,'' he said in 1993 at the annual conference of his institute. ''In economic terms, it is waste.''
 On more than one occasion, Dr. Berwick has suggested a need for a cap on total health spending, with limits on annual increases.
 In speeches and articles celebrating the 60th anniversary of Britain's National Health Service in 2008, Dr. Berwick said he was ''in love with the N.H.S.'' and explained why it was ''such a seductress.''
 ''The N.H.S. is not just a national treasure,'' he wrote; ''it is a global treasure.'' 
 Among its virtues, he told a British audience, is that ''you cap your health care budget.'' 
 Instead of trying to protect the wealthy, Dr. Berwick wrote, the British recognized that ''sick people tend to be poorer and that poor people tend to be sicker, and that any health care funding plan that is just must redistribute wealth.''
 Dr. Berwick offered a suggestion to the British: ''Please don't put your faith in market forces.'' 
 ''In the United States,'' he wrote, ''competition is a major reason for our duplicative, supply-driven, fragmented care system.''
 Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the senior Republican on the Finance Committee, said he had no doubts about Dr. Berwick's academic and professional qualifications, but wanted him to explain his comments on rationing.
 ''It doesn't help him to say good things about the British health care system,'' Mr. Grassley said after meeting with Dr. Berwick on Wednesday. Whatever doubts might exist in Washington, Dr. Berwick has fans in hospitals around the country.
 Theodore E. Townsend, president of St. Luke's Hospital in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, said: ''Dr. Berwick has inspired me and this community. He has used his charisma and his leadership ability to improve the quality of care at hundreds and hundreds of hospitals. I can't think of anyone else who has had that kind of impact.''
 Donna C. Isgett, senior vice president of McLeod Health in Florence, S.C., said Dr. Berwick had been ''instrumental in catapulting us to a much higher level of care.'' 
 ''He rolled up his sleeves and worked with our employees to reduce medication errors, infections, accidental falls and mortality rates,'' Ms. Isgett said. ''We are not a prestigious institution in Boston. We serve rural counties in one of the poorest regions of the country, but Don has been here and knows us.''

HEADLINE: White House Budget Chief Is Leaving

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Peter R. Orszag will leave his job as the White House budget director in July, according to someone familiar with his plans, making him perhaps the first official to leave the Obama cabinet and removing a major player from President Obama's economic team. 
 Mr. Orszag, an economist who previously spent nearly two years as director of the Congressional Budget Office, somewhat reluctantly accepted Mr. Obama's invitation to join the cabinet after the 2008 election and never planned to stay more than two years. Typically, budget directors do not. While the president recently urged Mr. Orszag to remain, the calendar for drafting the next budget weighed in favor of Mr. Orszag's leaving sooner. So did Mr. Orszag's personal calendar: He is getting married in September.
 By fall, as Congress is taking final action on the budget for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, the Office of Management and Budget is busy preparing the next year's budget request to be released in February. Mr. Orszag argued inside the White House that his successor should be in place to put the next budget together from the start.
 In recent months, Mr. Orszag, 41, has espoused deficit reduction strategies in administration debates against those who pressed for more stimulus spending and tax cuts to keep the economy from slipping back into recession.

HEADLINE: As Law Takes Effect, Obama Warns Insurers on Big Rate Increases

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK and SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Reed Abelson contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama, whose vilification of insurers helped push a landmark health care overhaul through Congress, plans to sternly warn industry executives at a White House meeting on Tuesday against imposing hefty rate increases in anticipation of tightening regulation under the new law, administration officials said Monday.
 The White House is concerned that health insurers will blame the new law for increases in premiums that are intended to maximize profits rather than covering claims. The administration is also closely watching investigations by a number of states into the actuarial soundness of double-digit rate increases. 
 ''Our message to them is to work with this law, not against it; don't try and take advantage of it or we will work with state authorities and gather the authority we have to stop rate gouging,'' David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's senior adviser, said in an interview. ''Our concern is that they not try and, under the cover of the act, get in under the wire here on rate increases.'' 
 The law does not grant the federal government new authority to regulate health care premiums, which remains the province of state insurance departments. But with important provisions taking effect this summer and fall, the Obama administration has repeatedly reminded insurers -- and the public -- that it will expose industry pricing to what the health secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, has called a ''bright spotlight.''
 The White House meeting coincides with Monday's release of a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health policy research group, that found that premiums for the policies most recently bought by individuals had increased by an average of 20 percent.
 ''The survey shows that the steep increases we have been reading about over the last several months are not just extreme cases,'' said Drew Altman, the foundation's president. 
 Mr. Obama's message to insurers will serve to put the industry on notice and position the White House politically should voters start to link premium increases to the new law. With the law expected to play a significant role in the midterm elections, the president has been using his platform to sell the bill's most immediate benefits and, by extension, to defend Democrats in Congress who risked their careers to vote for it. 
 He will do so again Tuesday; after his private meeting, Mr. Obama will appear in the East Room, where he will highlight new regulations to protect consumers from discriminatory insurance practices, end lifetime limits on coverage and ban unjustified revocations of coverage.
 Mr. Axelrod likened them to ''essentially a patients' bill of rights, the strongest in history.''
 White House officials said Tuesday's attendees will include top executives from 13 leading health insurers, as well as Karen M. Ignagni, the president of America's Health Insurance Plans, the industry trade group. Five state insurance commissioners also are expected to attend.
 The insurers have attributed this year's increases to skyrocketing medical costs and to the economic downturn, which has prompted healthier consumers to forgo health insurance, leaving a sicker and costlier pool to cover. 
 ''Our companies are receiving rate increase requests from hospitals across the country of 40, 50 and 60 percent,'' said Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for the trade group. ''That has a direct impact on the cost of health care coverage.''
 But a report released Monday by Health Care for America Now, a coalition that supports the new law, stressed that the growth in premiums in the first eight years of this decade had far exceeded medical inflation -- 97 percent to 39 percent. 
 The new law requires the health secretary to work with states to establish a process for annual reviews of ''unreasonable increases in premiums.'' Administration officials said Monday that they were still writing regulations to define ''unreasonable increases.''
 Mr. Obama's approach to the health insurance industry has rarely been subtle, starting with his campaign, when he spoke of his dying mother's struggle to persuade her insurer to cover her cancer treatments. 
 In March, with his health bill hanging by a thread in Congress, Mr. Obama ducked into a White House meeting with insurance executives to deliver a letter from an Ohio cancer survivor who had dropped her coverage after learning her premiums were rising 40 percent. 
 But for all of Mr. Obama's browbeating, the new health care law stopped short of giving the administration the power to reject or limit rate increases. Instead, it established the annual reviews, starting next year, and makes available $250 million in grants to states to implement the review process. 
 States that accept the grants must recommend whether insurers with patterns of excessive pricing should be allowed to market policies through newly created exchanges, which will help individuals and businesses shop for coverage starting in 2014. Insurers also will be required to justify increases deemed unreasonable on their Web sites.
 In the closing weeks of the health care debate, the White House offered a proposal to give the health secretary authority to deny unreasonable increases. It did not make it into the final legislation, but Senate Democrats have reintroduced it as a standalone bill. 
 The regulatory clout of state insurance departments varies widely, with some having minimal power to block rate increases. But in recent months, several states have taken unusually assertive steps.
 In California, state regulators announced that they would order independent reviews of increases being sought by four large health insurers. That move came after the department discovered miscalculations in rate requests by Anthem Blue Cross, prompting the company to withdraw its plan to raise premiums by as much as 39 percent.
 In Massachusetts, the administration of Gov. Deval Patrick, a Democrat, used long-untapped power to deny 9 of 10 rate increases requested by the state's insurers, provoking a lawsuit from the industry. A court in Maine recently upheld a smaller rate increase for that state's largest insurer -- 10.9 percent instead of 18.1 percent -- that had been ordered by the insurance superintendent.
 In New York, Gov. David A. Paterson, a Democrat, signed legislation this month giving the state power to block unreasonable rates. And in Pennsylvania, Gov. Edward G. Rendell, also a Democrat, announced two weeks ago that his insurance commissioner, Joel Ario, would investigate large increases by the state's biggest insurers.
 ''The plans are cherry-picking the best risk,'' Mr. Ario, who will attend the White House session, said in an interview. 
 The federal law, which will require that most Americans obtain insurance, includes a number of provisions intended to slow the growth of premiums. For instance, insurance companies soon will have to spend at least 80 percent of revenue from premiums on claims, as opposed to administration and profit. 
 Insurers have warned since early in the debate that the overhaul might result in increased premiums for many consumers. The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found otherwise, projecting that it would have minimal effect on group premiums, which account for 83 percent of the market. Their analysis forecast that premiums for individual policies would rise faster than they would without the new law, but that the increases would largely be offset by government subsidies. 
 Whatever the law's ultimate effect, many of this year's most egregious rate increases were announced well before it was clear the bill would pass.

HEADLINE: China's Currency Off the Table, G-20 Focuses on Europe

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- China's decision to allow its currency to rise gradually against the dollar has strengthened the Obama administration's hand going into a summit meeting of the Group of 20 countries this weekend in Toronto. But other challenges, from Europe's debt crisis to changes in banking regulation, could test the unity of the G-20 as it moves from crisis control to a more complicated agenda of economic coordination.
 A senior administration official said on Monday that China's announcement had significantly changed the dynamics for the G-20 meeting, removing for now what had been the dominant item on the agenda. Other G-20 members, from the European Union to Brazil and India, had called for China to agree to exchange-rate flexibility, and other finance ministers had repeatedly pressed the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, on the matter, officials said. 
 While the foreign exchange issue was not conclusively settled -- Mr. Geithner reiterated his statement over the weekend that the test would be in how far China moved, and how fast -- the Chinese announcement allows the administration to focus on Europe, where growth is lagging far behind East Asia and North America. 
 Officials said on Monday that the pace and path of European fiscal consolidation was likely to be the main topic of discussion, along with three critical questions relating to regulatory reform: how tough to make new capital requirements for banks, how best to oversee the trading of derivatives, and whether to impose a tax on giant banks, which is favored by the United States and most European economies. Canada, Japan and Australia oppose the bank tax. 
 The administration official said the United States, while satisfied with Europe's decision to conduct bank stress tests, would press it to continue its political and financial pledge to solving its debt and fiscal problems.
 The official said that Mr. Obama's letter to G-20 leaders last week, in which he urged countries not to move too quickly to pare their budgets, was intended as a cautionary message and said that the United States and the European Union were in substantial agreement on the need to cut deficits in the medium term. 
 But political experts on both sides of the Atlantic say that the American approach of pumping money into the economy is also not certain to work.
 ''Everybody wants a self-sustaining recovery in private-sector demand, but how?'' said Daniel Gros, director of the Center for European Policy Studies, a research organization based in Brussels. ''By keeping deficits high (the U.S. approach) or by starting the exit now to strengthen private-sector confidence (the E.U. approach)? Who knows what will work better?'' 
 Another area of tension threatens to overshadow what was supposed to be a signature legislative accomplishment: passage of a sweeping overhaul of the Depression-era financial architecture. Congressional negotiators are trying to wrap up work this week on a merger of the House and Senate versions of a major overhaul of financial regulations. 
 The United States needs agreement from other wealthy nations on new liquidity requirements and higher capital standards for giant banks and new restrictions on the trading of derivatives. But while the desirability of those new rules was not in question, Mr. Geithner left a meeting of G-20 finance ministers in Busan, South Korea, early this month without agreement on their scope and timing. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a global regulatory body, on Friday postponed to December 2011 its deadline for completing new capital standards, a reflection of the lack of consensus in Busan.
 ''New rules to enhance both the quantity and quality of capital held by financial institutions are widely acknowledged as essential elements of global financial reform efforts,'' said Daniel M. Price, who was President George W. Bush's personal representative to a G-20 leaders' meeting, in November 2008. ''Yet there is disagreement among financial institutions and among regulators on what counts as capital, how capital should be computed and what the macroeconomic impact of these new rules will be.''
 As the crisis gave way to a painful recession, Mr. Obama used the G-20 meetings last year in London and Pittsburgh to obtain consensus on stimulus spending, stabilizing banking systems, providing more financing for the International Monetary Fund and respecting trade agreements.
 But analysts now caution that it would be unrealistic to expect the G-20, given its members' disparate interests, to be a global economic steering committee. 
 ''The G-20 has not delivered that much in terms of financial regulation, and neither has it delivered that much in terms of macroeconomic coordination,'' said Nicolas Veron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a policy research organization based in Brussels. ''There is very little the G-20 can do about the crisis in Europe. It's for the Europeans to sort out, and the I.M.F. has to play its role.''
 Others say that the G-20 has represented a remarkable advance for global dialogue in a short time.
 ''There were real questions about the viability of the organization'' when the G-20 leaders first met in Washington, said Madeleine K. Albright, the former secretary of state, who was an emissary, along with Jim Leach, a former congressman, for Mr. Obama at that meeting. 
 Last year's summit meetings in London and Pittsburgh were ''a big step forward in creating a sense of common purpose,'' Dr. Albright said.
 The G-20 was created in 1999, in the aftermath of the 1997 Asian financial crisis. It was mostly a gathering of finance ministers and central bank governors until Mr. Bush elevated its status.
 The previous dominant economic forum for world leaders, the G-8, was similarly born out of a crisis: the 1973 oil shock and the subsequent worldwide recession. (Leaders of the G-8 countries will meet in Ontario, on Friday and Saturday, before the start of the G-20 meeting in Toronto.) 
 Though the worst of the latest crisis has passed, Mr. Obama argued in his letter that the need for concerted action remained. 
 ''In fact, should confidence in the strength of our recoveries diminish, we should be prepared to respond again as quickly and as forcefully as needed to avoid a slowdown in economic activity,'' he wrote. 
 But Agnes Benassy-Quere, an economist and the director of Cepii, a research group in Paris, said that European governments did not believe they could afford more stimulus spending. ''It is clear that what is happening in Europe will weigh negatively on U.S. recovery,'' she said.

HEADLINE: European Leader Defends Efforts to Tighten Region's Belt

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER and STEPHEN CASTLE; Alison Smale contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- The European Union's top official rejected concerns that Europe was moving too quickly toward economic austerity, saying it was vital to cut debt to restore market and voter confidence as the key to future growth.
 ''Without addressing this issue, there will be no confidence, and without confidence, no growth,'' said the European Commission president, Jose Manuel Barroso, in an interview on Monday, before this weekend's Group of 20 summit meeting in Toronto.
 Mr. Barroso, speaking animatedly for 90 minutes, was rebutting a criticism by President Obama and some economists that Europe's rush to cut government spending to appease market sentiment risked worsening the region's economic slump. Mr. Obama wrote in a letter last week to his Group of 20 counterparts that withdrawing fiscal stimulus too soon could lead to ''renewed economic hardships and recession.''
 Mr. Barroso also rejected an American contention, made recently by Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, that Europe was driving Turkey into the arms of its less secular Islamic neighbors. If Turkey is ''moving eastward, it is, in my view, in no small part because it was pushed, and pushed by some in Europe, refusing to give Turkey the kind of organic link to the West that Turkey sought,'' Mr. Gates said. 
 Mr. Barroso said: ''I was surprised by those remarks. They don't conform to the facts. The distance Turkey started to show'' from NATO partners and the West ''started with the invasion of Iraq and the pressure put on Turkey by the previous U.S. administration'' of President George W. Bush.
 He acknowledged that some European positions were not helpful -- France and Germany have both emphasized that the European Union is a club with a Christian character -- but he said that the union should continue to pursue eventual Turkish membership. He cautioned that it was necessary to listen to Turkish officials with respect. ''They are extremely sensitive to the way we listen to and respect what they have to propose,'' he said. ''We should adapt our paradigm to the 21st century.''
 The relationship between the European Union and the United States is vital, but ''very frankly, this relationship is not living up to its full potential,'' Mr. Barroso said. He pointed to the European flavor of some of Mr. Obama's health and regulatory policies, and to the more pro-American mindset of the current crop of French, German and British leaders, contending that this moment was unusually ripe for trans-Atlantic cooperation. ''The conditions were never so good as today,'' he said.
 ''It is still, by far, the most important economic relationship in the world'' in terms of trade and investment, Mr. Barroso said, but ''we should do more to bridge the regulatory gap and have a common agenda for jobs and growth.''
 Concerned by Mr. Obama's postponement of a European Union-United States summit meeting in May, Mr. Barroso confirmed that he had set up a small study group to examine ways to make the relationship more substantive and coordinated, especially on issues of job growth and regulation. He said that he wanted to produce ''deliverables'' and that the two sides could do more in relations with third parties, like Russia and China.
 Yet the European Union has more regular summit meetings with Russia, he pointed out -- two a year.
 He expressed concern that the Group of 20's success so far in regulating the world's economy may run out of steam this weekend in Toronto. Progress has been made, ''but now we wouldn't like that momentum to be lost,'' he said. 
 The United States has resisted some European proposals for new financial regulations and a tax on global financial transactions. But Mr. Barroso said that American and European positions were converging on some issues, including imposing a levy on banks.
 His main goal in his second term -- ''my dream,'' he said -- is ''to make the E.U. really stronger in terms of economic governance, to make Europe, and also our partners, understand that we should not only be a monetary union, but also an economic union.''
 Asked if the German focus on financial security and stability harmed the internal economic balance of the euro zone, Mr. Barroso defended Chancellor Angela Merkel and said that the problem was not that Germany should become less competitive, but that other countries should become more so. ''Basically, they are right,'' he said of the Germans. He said that German budgetary tightening would not start this year, and that its impact had been exaggerated.
 Spain, too, he said, is not in great danger if its program of budget cuts and structural reform, including easing the hiring and firing of workers, is carried out. 
 The French-German relationship is a delicate one, he acknowledged, but ''should not be seen as a kind of directoire for Europe,'' he said. ''It is an indispensable relationship'' for Europe, ''necessary but not sufficient'' to run Europe's affairs.
 Despite the differences in financial cultures in Europe between France and Germany, and between north and south, Mr. Barroso said ''there's an amazing degree of convergence'' on the need for ''both fiscal sustainability and structural reform.'' That, he said, represented ''Europe's contribution'' toward global growth.
 Under the pressure of the crisis, which resulted in a huge package to relieve pressure on the euro, he said, Europe had moved beyond what anyone imagined was possible a year ago. ''We weren't ready institutionally to deal with this issue of the divergence in the debt in the framework of monetary union,'' he said. ''That's why we went to the limits of the treaty and created instruments not in violation of the treaty, but beyond.''
 The problem is leadership, not institutions, he said. 
 ''There's a tendency in many politicians to become inward-looking, more protectionist, more nationalistic and more defensive, in the bad sense of the word,'' he said. ''This is something that we're seeing, not only in Europe, that we have to be attentive to.''
 But results are what count in the end, he said. The European Union, by its nature, may take more time to make decisions, he said, and individual leaders will play to domestic politics. ''I say to my friends, 'Don't just listen to the vuvuzelas; look at who scores the goals.' And this is the important thing.''

HEADLINE: Panel Is Unlikely to Lift Drilling Ban This Year

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The bipartisan commission named by President Obama in May to study the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the future of American offshore drilling will hold its first formal meeting in mid-July at the earliest, most likely delaying the delivery of its final report into next year, a co-chairman of the panel said Friday in an interview.
 The co-chairman, William K. Reilly, who served as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency under the first President George Bush, also said it was unlikely that the panel would recommend the lifting of the six-month moratorium on deep-water drilling before it completed its report. Such a move would require profound changes in industry practice and government oversight that could not be done that quickly, Mr. Reilly said in his first extensive remarks on the commission's work.
 The oil industry, its supporters in Congress and Gulf Coast officials have called for swiftly lifting the moratorium, saying that the ban was causing severe economic hardship and that drilling could resume safely under tighter interim rules. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and some other Obama administration officials had given the industry hope that the ban would be lifted as soon as new regulations were in place. 
 But Mr. Reilly said that ending the moratorium would require that the industry adopt safer drilling techniques and that the government regulatory agencies, particularly the Minerals Management Service, a part of the Interior Department, be markedly strengthened.''Those things would have to happen faster than past history would suggest is possible,'' he said.
 He also noted that a Congressional hearing last week revealed that the five major oil companies relied on a common and clearly inadequate plan for responding to a major offshore spill. 
 ''I would be very wary of encouraging more deep-water development until I was confident that the response plans were more realistic,'' Mr. Reilly said in the telephone interview. ''They are not realistic at this time.''
 Mr. Reilly has taken a leave from the board of ConocoPhillips, one of the oil companies whose chief executives testified before Congress last week.
 Mr. Obama set a six-month deadline for the panel to produce its report, but the clock does not begin until the seven-member body officially meets. The group's start has been set back by delays in naming the other five members and by a complicated White House vetting process for staff members.
 On Monday evening, a senior administration official said Richard J. Lazarus, a Georgetown University law professor and a former Justice Department environmental law specialist, would be the panel's executive director. 
 Mr. Obama named the two co-chairmen, Mr. Reilly and former Senator Bob Graham, a Democrat from Florida, on May 22. But the White House did not designate the other five members until June 14. They are Frances G. Beinecke, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council; Donald Boesch, president of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science; Terry D. Garcia, an executive vice president at the National Geographic Society; Cherry A. Murray, dean of the Harvard University School of Engineering and Applied Sciences; and Frances Ulmer, chancellor of the University of Alaska Anchorage.
 The panel as yet has no staff or budget, although the White House has requested $15 million from Congress for the group.
 Mr. Obama said that the mandate of the commission was to find the causes of the BP disaster and to make recommendations for preventing such accidents in the future. The president was explicit, both in public comments and in private statements to him and to Mr. Graham, Mr. Reilly said, that the United States would depend for the foreseeable future on oil and natural gas from beneath the Gulf of Mexico. The investigative panel is not charged with determining whether offshore oil development can be conducted safely; rather, its mission is to show how it can resume with greater safeguards.
 ''The president was clear,'' Mr. Reilly said. ''He was not inviting us to revise his energy policy. He said he was much more concerned to look ahead than look backward.''
 Mr. Reilly said he expected his group to examine the reliability of blowout preventers, the toxicity of dispersants, the quality and frequency of inspections, and the possible need for simultaneous relief wells in deep water. 
 Officials with experience in earlier investigative panels said it was essential to understand why the Deepwater Horizon accident happened before meaningful recommendations could be made about future actions.
 Bruce Babbitt, who served on the commission that investigated the Three Mile Island nuclear accident in 1979 and later was President Bill Clinton's interior secretary, said the entire culture of the offshore drilling industry would have to change. 
 ''You have to strengthen regulation,'' Mr. Babbitt said, ''but there has to be some way of implanting some safety DNA across the entire industry.''
 The Three Mile Island panel's recommendations led to the creation of a nuclear safety institute that trains plant operators and inspectors. Mr. Babbitt said something similar might be needed in the oil and gas industry.
 He also said that the Minerals Management Service should be blown apart, not merely restructured, as Mr. Salazar has proposed. Environmental regulation must be taken out of the Interior Department and transferred to the E.P.A., Mr. Babbitt said.
 Philip D. Zelikow, who served as executive director of the commission that investigated the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, urged the new panel to follow his group's path by writing a narrative history of the gulf accident. That is the best way, Mr. Zelikow said, to understand the factors that led to the disaster and to generate public and political support for the changes that will be needed to prevent a recurrence. 
 ''To explain is not necessarily to excuse,'' he said, ''but it is the first step in understanding.''
 He said that in studying previous disasters, like the shuttle Challenger explosion, he learned that government agencies and private corporations engaged in cutting-edge endeavors, like deep-sea drilling or space exploration, began over time to ''normalize'' and discount the risk.
 ''Here is an industry increasingly obliged to engage in ultrahazardous activity,'' Mr. Zelikow said. ''I wouldn't look just at BP. They are functioning in a much larger institutional culture. Everyone who worked on this rig has worked on other projects, maybe at other companies. What you want to discover is if there is something distinct and pathological about all of these institutions, or something distinctly pathological about BP.''
 He added that it might be impossible for Mr. Reilly and the other commissioners to avoid the question of whether deep-water drilling should be pursued at all before recommending how it could resume, even though that matter was beyond their presidential mandate.
 ''I don't think you can answer one question without answering the other,'' Mr. Zelikow said.

HEADLINE: Ex-Banker To Be Deputy To Bloomberg

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is expected to announce Tuesday that he has selected a former Wall Street banker as the next deputy mayor for economic development, according to administration and business officials. 
 The banker, Robert Steel, worked at both Goldman Sachs and Wachovia and served as under secretary for domestic finance in the federal Treasury Department during the financial crisis in 2007 and 2008. 
 Mr. Steel, 58, who lives in Greenwich, Conn., will replace Robert C. Lieber, also a former banker, who announced his departure last month.
 Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, a business group, said Mr. Steel's selection served as a signal that Mr. Bloomberg would not be coasting to the end of his term.
 ''It's a terrific choice,'' Ms. Wylde said. ''He understands the challenges, particularly those facing the financial services industry. It's somebody who can really make sure that we retain our stature in the world of global finance.''
 A spokesman for the mayor, Stu Loeser, declined to comment on the appointment on Monday.
 Mr. Bloomberg has often gone outside government circles to pick top members of his administration. He recently appointed Stephen Goldsmith, a former mayor of Indianapolis and a management expert, to succeed Edward Skyler as deputy mayor for operations, despite his unfamiliarity with New York.
 But now Mr. Bloomberg has added a deputy mayor who will have to learn quickly about the complexity and limitations of government's role in stimulating economic development. At the same time, he will have to balance the city's often difficult relationship with the governor's office over major projects, including ground zero, Battery Park City and the convention center. 
 ''When you put Steel together with Goldsmith, they'll really need a lot of staff people who know New York City,'' said an executive who has worked in government and the private sector and who requested anonymity to avoid being seen as criticizing the mayor. ''They're smart guys, but they're going to have to deal with the Byzantine politics and craziness that is New York.''

HEADLINE: Even on Gulf Coast, Energy and Economy Surpass Spill Concerns, Poll Finds

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and MARJORIE CONNELLY; Dalia Sussman and Marina Stefan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Overwhelmingly, Americans think the nation needs a fundamental overhaul of its energy policies, and most expect alternative forms to replace oil as a major source within 25 years. Yet a majority are unwilling to pay higher gasoline prices to help develop new fuel sources.
 Those are among the findings of the latest nationwide New York Times/CBS News poll. 
 The poll, which examines the public's reaction to the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico, highlights some of the complex political challenges the Obama administration faces. For instance, despite intense news coverage and widespread public concern about the economic and ecological damage from the gulf disaster, most Americans remain far more concerned about jobs and the nation's overall economy. 
 And in that regard, President Obama does not fare well: 54 percent of the public say he does not have a clear plan for creating jobs, while only 34 percent say he does, an ominous sign heading into this fall's midterm elections. 
 Respondents were nearly evenly split on the president's handling of the economy -- 45 percent approve, 48 percent disapprove. His job approval rating remains just below 50 percent. And by a nearly 2-to-1 margin, Americans think the country is on the wrong track.
 They are also impatient with Mr. Obama's response to the oil disaster in the gulf, by a large margin, and attribute the spill to risks taken by BP and its partners in the failed well, according to the poll, which was conducted by telephone from June 16 to 2o with 1,259 adults. 
 The survey included an in-depth look at the attitudes of people most directly affected by the oil spill -- those living in counties in Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi that border the Gulf of Mexico.
 Gulf Coast residents, whose communities are most affected by the leak and whose livelihoods have been linked to oil for generations, are more likely than Americans over all to say they are confident that those who were affected by the spill will be fairly compensated by BP. A majority say the Obama administration has a lot or some control over whether BP will pay for the damages caused by the spill. Last week, the president received a promise from BP executives to create a $20 billion fund to pay damage claims from the accident.
 Gulf Coast residents are also more likely than other Americans to support increased drilling off the coastlines of the United States. 
 By a large margin, the public over all said more regulation of offshore drilling to protect the environment was needed, but respondents were also more likely to attribute the BP accident to a failure of the federal government to enforce existing rules than to a lack of adequate regulation.
 Reba Davis, 78, a retired vocational nurse in Abilene, Tex., one of the poll respondents, said she believed that BP took shortcuts to save money in drilling the doomed well, but she also said the government needed to take a stronger hand in overseeing offshore operations.
 ''The responsibility totally lies with BP and the regulatory system in our country, which is pretty slim and needs to be ramped up and enforced,'' Mrs. Davis said in a follow-up telephone interview.
 Large majorities disapprove of the way BP is handling the spill and have little faith in the oil industry generally to act in the public interest. By a 2-to-1 margin, they trust the federal government more than BP to handle the cleanup efforts in the gulf.
 Yet they also think the Obama administration could be doing more to fix the damage from the leak. Fifty-nine percent said Mr. Obama did not have a clear plan for dealing with the spill.
 Lewis Cullen, 78, an insurance executive who retired to Orange Beach, Ala., said the spill had slashed the value of his home. ''If I wanted to sell my property I couldn't, and anyway it would be worth half of what it was last year,'' Mr. Cullen said. ''It's going to take years for this to go away. I read there's a good possibility they won't be able to stop it ever.''
 The dependence of local residents on gulf-related industries like fishing and oil is evident in the poll. About 3 in 10 said they or someone in their household worked in those industries. 
 They are divided on the benefits of the government's six-month moratorium on offshore drilling put into place after the Deepwater Horizon blowout, while the majority of Americans think it is a good idea.
 Two months after the rig explosion and fire, just 18 percent of Americans think that BP will be able to stop the leak in the next month. Instead, about half, 48 percent, think it will take the oil company several more months; 16 percent think it will take a year or longer; and 7 percent say the company will never be able to stop the leak.
 Respondents who live in the counties in Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi that have been most affected by the oil spill gave similar responses.
 Yet optimism is resilient. Two-thirds of all Americans, including about the same proportion of Gulf Coast residents, say that despite severe environmental damage, the fish, birds, turtles and other wildlife of the region will recover. And about 8 in 10 Americans, including more than 7 in 10 Gulf Coast residents, say the region's economy, including businesses like tourism and fishing, will eventually bounce back.
 The longer that people think the oil will continue to leak, the less likely they are to think that the region's ecology and economy will recover. Still, even among those who think the leak will continue for another year or longer, most are optimistic.
 Two-thirds of those living along the Gulf Coast say they have been affected by the oil spill; a third say they have been directly affected, and another third indirectly affected. They cite lost jobs and income and damage to local fisheries as the main consequences of the spill. Forty-five percent are very concerned that they or someone in their household will be unemployed in the coming year. Eight in 10 gulf residents say their communities are suffering financially.
 ''Obama has put a moratorium on deep-well drilling, and it's going to kill us,'' said Barbara Hebert, 71, of Houma, La., a retired nurse anesthetist. ''Next year this is going to be a ghost town. We don't want the industry shut down. Just go over the plans and see that safety issues are taken care of.''

HEADLINE: When Greatness Slips Away

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
We've blown so many enormous opportunities over the past several years. In the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, 2001, when most of the world had lined up in support of the United States, President George W. Bush had the chance to lead a vast cooperative, international effort to combat terrorism and lay the groundwork for a more peaceful, more secure world.
 He blew it with the invasion of Iraq. 
 In the tragic aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, we had not just the chance but an obligation to call on our best talent to creatively rebuild the historic city of New Orleans. That could have kick-started a major renovation of the nation's infrastructure and served as the incubator for a new and desperately needed urban policy. Despite President Bush's vow of ''bold action'' during a carefully staged, nationally televised appearance in the French Quarter, we did nothing of the kind.
 The collapse of the economy in the Great Recession gave us the starkest, most painful evidence imaginable of the failure of laissez-faire economics and the destructive force of the alliance of big business and government against the interests of ordinary Americans. Radical change was called for. (One thinks of Franklin Roosevelt raging against the ''economic royalists'' and asserting that ''we need to correct, by drastic means if necessary, the faults in our economic system from which we now suffer.'')
 But there has been no radical change, only caution and timidity and more of the same. The royalists remain triumphant and working people are absorbing blow after devastating blow. More than 1.2 million of the long-term jobless are due to lose their unemployment benefits this month.
 The oil catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico, as horrible as it has been, was yet another opportunity. In his address to the nation from the Oval Office last week, President Obama could have laid out a dramatic new energy policy for the U.S., calling on every American to do his or her part to help us escape the insidious, nonstop destruction that is the result of our obsessive reliance on fossil fuels.
 He chose not to.
 As a nation, we are becoming more and more accustomed to a sense of helplessness. We no longer rise to the great challenges before us. It's not just that we can't plug the oil leak, which is the perfect metaphor for what we've become. We can't seem to do much of anything.
 The city of Detroit is using federal money to destroy thousands upon thousands of empty homes, giving in to a sense of desperation that says there is no way to rebuild the city so let's do the opposite: let's destroy even more of it. Lots more of it.
 There are plans aplenty for demolishing large parts of what's left of Detroit, which in its heyday was the symbol of an America that was still a powerfully constructive force, a place that could produce things and improve the lives of its people and inspire the rest of the world.
 Referring to an aspect of one of the plans, The Times's Susan Saulny wrote in an article in Monday's paper: ''An urban homestead -- one of the more popular parts of the plan -- would be tantamount to country living in the city, the plan says, with homeowners enjoying an agricultural environment and lower taxes in exchange for disconnecting from some city services like water.''
 The June 28 cover story of Time magazine is headlined, ''The Broken States of America.'' As I've mentioned here several times, the states are facing a catastrophic fiscal situation that is short-circuiting essential services, pushing even more people out of work, and undermining the feeble national economic recovery.
 As Time reported: ''Schools, health services, libraries -- and the salaries that go with them -- are all on the chopping block as states and cities face their worst cash squeeze since the Great Depression.''
 We are submitting to this debacle with the same pathetic lack of creativity and helpless mind-set that now seems to be the default position of Americans in the 21st century. We have become a nation that is good at destroying things -- with wars overseas and mind-bogglingly self-destructive policies here at home -- but that has lost sight of how to build and maintain a flourishing society. We're dismantling our public school system and, incredibly, attacking our spectacularly successful system of higher education, which is the finest in the world.
 How is it possible that we would let this happen?
 We've got all kinds of sorry explanations for why we can't do any of the things we need to do. The Democrats can't get 60 votes in the Senate. Our budget deficits are too high. Rush Limbaugh or Glenn Beck might object.
 Meanwhile, the greatness of the United States, which so many have taken for granted for so long, is steadily slipping away.

HEADLINE: Taxing Investment Profits

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''The Unemployed Held Hostage'' (editorial, June 15) criticizes some senators for questioning the proposed tax increase for ''carried interest,'' or investment partnership profits. 
 As your editorial points out, none of the revenue raised through any change to this tax is needed to finance an extension of unemployment insurance. The Senate can approve an extension of unemployment insurance today without raising any offsetting revenue.
 Linking these two issues ignores the significant number of jobs that the new tax would put at risk by burdening more than 1.2 million real estate partnerships with a huge tax increase. This is particularly troubling given that commercial real estate is already reeling from falling prices, higher vacancies and a continuing liquidity crunch.
 The senators whom you singled out for doing the bidding of Wall Street are actually defending Main Street and the millions of people -- construction workers, building maintenance workers, engineering professionals and others -- who derive their livelihood from the real estate sector. A higher tax on investment profits results in lower real estate values, which translates into lower property taxes, which crimps local government spending on public services and employees.
 These senators are exactly right: now is not the time to pass the largest tax increase on real estate in decades.

HEADLINE: A New Path to Divorce in New York

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Divorce, No-Fault Style,'' by Stephanie Coontz (Op-Ed, June 17):
 Having to establish grounds to get divorced can be viewed as an encroachment on freedom.
 Consenting adults deserve the freedom to choose when to end their marriages without having to explain themselves to the court, just as they do not have to explain to the state why they are choosing to marry. 
 The crux of the matter in a divorce action in court is not the grounds (reason) for the divorce; it is about how parenting time will be allocated, how assets and liabilities will be divided and how and whether money will flow between the former spouses once the divorce is final. Those issues must be front and center, ahead of why they have decided not to remain married.
 Why should any government have the right to tell people they must prove that their marriage is over for specific reasons the state deems worthy? New York has stood alone on this issue.
 Couples are the best experts in the viability of their own marriages. It is time to allow overstretched matrimonial judicial resources (needed by people in matrimonial litigations) to focus on solving how the business of the divorce will be handled, not the reason it is happening.
 Empowering couples in the divorce process to make their own choices will with luck lead to more couples' choosing to resolve their divorces with the help of mediators and the support of counsel, as opposed to litigating in the court system.
 Cara M. Raich New York, June 17, 2010
 The writer, a mediator-lawyer in private practice, is president of the Family and Divorce Mediation Council of Greater New York.
 To the Editor:
 As a longtime divorce lawyer who now specializes in mediation, I can testify to the truth of a study cited in ''Divorce, No-Fault Style'' showing that mediation has ''powerful and long-term effects in reducing the kinds of parental conflict that produce the worst outcomes for children'' and that couples, after settling disputes in half the time of those who litigate, are also more likely to consult with each other about the children's welfare afterward.
 The repeal of New York's antiquated fault-based adversarial system will not only save time and money but also, much more important, limit damage to children in encouraging more civilized ways to end a marriage than matrimonial-lawyer mayhem.
 Lois Brenner New York, June 17, 2010
 The writer is the author of ''Getting Your Share,'' a divorce guide for women.
 To the Editor:
 It was indeed reassuring to read about the progress toward no-fault divorce in New York (''No-Fault Divorce Finally in Sight for New York,'' front page, June 16). The decision to divorce is one that most adults wrestle with for years, and making the process more humane should not be confused with making the decision without care.
 What will change is that the crisis that divorce presents will be confined to the emotional, relational and economic transitions, without being amplified by unnecessary pressures in the legal system. And while it may well be therapeutic for divorcing parties to come to terms with the reasons their marriage unraveled, that process is most authentically and successfully addressed as a private matter.
 Elana Katz New York, June 16, 2010
 The writer is the director of the Family and Divorce Mediation Program at the Ackerman Institute for the Family.
 To the Editor:
 You state that New York's passage of no-fault legislation would make it ''the last state'' to adopt no-fault divorce. In fact, New York already allows no-fault divorce; it is just stingy about it.
 In New York, no-fault divorce is available only by mutual consent and, even then, only after a one-year separation period. If just one spouse wants out (or if the consenting couple doesn't want to wait a year), divorce is available only upon proof of marital fault.
 Many other states also have two-track divorce regimes that allow fast-track fault-based divorce and slower-paced no-fault divorce. What is unusual about New York's no-fault law is its combination of a mutual-consent requirement and a one-year separation period. The proposed legislation is more generous.
 Passage of an easy-access no-fault law will not necessarily remove fault from the divorce equation. About half the states make marital fault relevant to the economic consequences of divorce (property distribution and/or alimony -- sometimes called maintenance).
 While calling your spouse a slob may not affect your right to divorce, it may affect how much money you have in your pocket when the marriage ends.
 Cynthia Lee Starnes East Lansing, Mich., June 17, 2010
 The writer is a professor of family law at Michigan State University.
 To the Editor:
 While the New York State Senate passage of no-fault divorce has been the focus of much news coverage, little attention has been given to the two accompanying, monumentally important divorce reform bills that also passed: post-marital compensation guidelines and interim counsel fees.
 Post-marital compensation guidelines, long sought by the advocates who fight for low-income women's rights, are a critical step forward to creating monetary fairness for the non-monied spouse, most often the woman. If passed in the Assembly, women will be able to count on receiving fair and consistent awards of post-marital income.
 Interim counsel fees, already passed in the Assembly, create an even playing field by ensuring that the non-monied spouse gains access to marital funds to cover legal fees. No longer will the monied spouse be able to take advantage of the non-monied spouse by being the only one with legal representation.
 Both of these bills will go a long way to ensuring that women are treated fairly in court, not left disadvantaged and destitute by divorce.
 I urge the Assembly leadership, which has long prided itself on advancing women's rights, to move quickly to make these measures a reality and bring fairness to the courts and needed relief to New York families.

HEADLINE: 27-Year Sentence for Plant Manager

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
A federal judge in Iowa on Monday announced a prison sentence of 27 years on financial fraud charges for Sholom Rubashkin, the former manager of a kosher meatpacking plant where hundreds of illegal immigrant workers were arrested in a 2008 raid that garnered national attention.
 Although the case against Mr. Rubashkin originally centered on immigration charges, during the trial in Sioux Falls, S.D., prosecutors focused instead on financial abuses when he was in charge of the Agriprocessors slaughterhouse in Postville, Iowa. 
 The sentence, two years more than prosecutors had requested, was unusually high in the recent history of financial crimes -- longer than the term for Jeffrey K. Skilling, the former chief executive of Enron, and L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former chief executive of Tyco.
 Lawyers for Mr. Rubashkin said they would appeal the decision, challenging the interpretation of federal sentencing guidelines by Judge Linda R. Reade. The appeal would expand the controversy surrounding the case, which has already included six former United States attorneys general writing to the judge to assail the prosecutors' logic in seeking a term that could amount to a life sentence.
 The sentence is also likely to deepen the belief among some Orthodox Jewish leaders, who have sustained an international campaign on Mr. Rubashkin's behalf, that he was unfairly tried.
 In an unusual procedure, Judge Reade, of the Northern District of Iowa, released a 52-page memorandum on Monday, a day before the scheduled sentencing hearing, in which she explained her decision. She will formally impose the sentence on Tuesday.
 The raid on the Postville plant became an emblem of the Bush administration's tough immigration enforcement strategy. It led to the bankruptcy of Agriprocessors, prison and deportation for hundreds of illegal immigrant workers, and a battered economy for the northeast Iowa town.
 Mr. Rubashkin was convicted in November in a federal trial of 86 counts of financial fraud for his mishandling of a revolving loan from First Bank Business Capital of St. Louis, among other loans. After that conviction, prosecutors dismissed separate federal immigration charges.
 Judge Reade noted that Mr. Rubashkin had misled the bank repeatedly about the finances of Agriprocessors, ordering employees to create fake invoices and moving cash secretly among different accounts, including some designated for religious purposes. The maneuvers caused a loss to the bank of $26 million, the judge found.
 In one episode, Judge Reade wrote, Mr. Rubashkin lent $4,500 to illegal immigrants working in the plant so they could buy new fake identity documents, after immigration authorities had questioned the validity of their original hiring documents.
 Judge Reade rejected a defense argument that Mr. Rubashkin was not motivated by greed, but was trying out of loyalty and religious faith to sustain a business owned by his father, Aaron Rubashkin. At the time of the raid, Agriprocessors was the largest kosher beef producer in the country.
 ''No matter defendant's motive,'' Judge Reade wrote, ''he defrauded the victim banks out of millions of dollars.'' She also sentenced Mr. Rubashkin to pay almost $27 million in restitution to the institutions.
 ''There was no bank robbery, he never intended to cheat or steal from anyone,'' said Guy Cook, Mr. Rubashkin's defense lawyer. Mr. Cook said the term was ''essentially a life sentence'' for Mr. Rubashkin, who is 50, and was especially difficult for Mr. Rubashkin's 10 children, one of whom is autistic.
 Mr. Cook said Mr. Rubashkin, who was informed of the sentence Monday morning in a county jail, had taken the news calmly. ''He understands that ultimately what happens to him is in God's hands,'' Mr. Cook said.
 Some Jewish leaders were not calm.
 ''Our community will react just as I have, with shock and disgust,'' said Rabbi Pesach Lerner, executive vice president of the National Council of Young Israel, who has organized support for Mr. Rubashkin among Orthodox Jews. Rabbi Lerner said he would try to raise an outcry to bring attention to the appeal.
 In a separate state trial in Iowa, Mr. Rubashkin was acquitted earlier this month of all charges that he knowingly employed under-age workers at the Agriprocessors plant.
 While state prosecutors were not able to convince the jury that Mr. Rubashkin was personally aware of minors in the plant, the trial evidence showed that at least 29 immigrants under 18 were employed on Agriprocessors' packing lines, some working night shifts and wielding sharp knives.
 The company itself pleaded guilty at the outset of the trial to multiple charges of abuse of under-age laborers. Because Agriprocessors is bankrupt, prosecutors said they would not be able to collect any fine.
 Last year, responding to the Agriprocessors events, the Iowa state legislature passed a law making it easier to convict employers who hire child laborers and increasing penalties.
 Nearly 400 immigrants who worked in the plant, most from Guatemala, served federal prison sentences of up to five months for identity theft and were deported.
 But some of the former workers will be allowed to remain in the United States. To date, 41 of the immigrants have been approved to receive a special visa, known as a U-visa, that is granted to victims of violent abuse, said Sonia Parras Konrad, a lawyer who represented those workers. The workers showed that they had been struck by managers or sexually assaulted while working at Agriprocessors, she said.
 Ms. Parras praised Judge Reade's sentence.
 ''Even though these labor practices never came out in court, the sentence sends a really good message that this kind of practice will not be tolerated,'' she said.
 The federal prosecutors had originally sought a life sentence for Mr. Rubashkin, but then revised their request to 25 years. Six former attorneys general, including Janet Reno and Edwin Meese III, wrote to Judge Reade in April arguing that a life sentence would be a severe misreading of the sentencing guidelines as applied to white-collar crimes.
 Mr. Skilling was sentenced to 24 years, after the court found he caused losses at Enron of $80 million. Mr. Kozlowski, who was convicted of a $150 million fraud, was sentenced in state court to 8 1/3 to 25 years.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: Because of an editing error, an article on June 22 about the sentencing for financial fraud of Sholom Rubashkin, the former manager of a meatpacking plant in Iowa, misidentified the location of his trial. It was in federal court in Sioux Falls, S.D. -- not in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. (That is where he was sentenced.) The article also misstated Mr. Rubashkin's age. He is 50, not 51.

HEADLINE: From Run for the White House To a Run Just to Stay in Place

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
PARKER, Ariz. -- He still tells the story about the call he got at 2 a.m. from the woman in Chandler who was upset about changes in her garbage pick up, and the ossified joke concerning two Irish brothers (''The only ethnic group in America you can still joke about'') boozed up at a bar.
 Just as he did in 2008, and 2000, and most likely in the tender years of his earliest campaigns here -- long before ''that one,'' maverick, and not-a-maverick -- he takes extra time for veterans, freshly scrubbed little kids and older women who wait patiently at the back of a senior center with one of his many books and a camera. He still calls the room ''my friends.''
 But less than two years after he was defeated by Barack Obama, nothing seems quite the same for Senator John McCain, who has gone from being his party's candidate for president rallying 1,000 supporters at a Florida football stadium to furiously defending his Senate seat before 60 recession-weary residents in a Hampton Inn in Lake Havasu, Ariz. 
 Gone are the jovial back-and-forths with veteran biker dudes at state fairs, long bus rides through South Carolina watching the U.S. Open with Senator Lindsey Graham and visions of party dominance in Washington. Gone are his efforts to engage Mr. Obama directly; instead, he portrays himself as taking on the status quo of Mr. Obama's Washington.
 Mr. McCain's new position is one of defense: he is fending off a primary fight from the right flank of his party in the form of former Representative J. D. Hayworth, as well as withering criticism of his former position on immigration from constituents. He also seems to be engaged in a battle within himself, hewing to the high road, as he has historically done, but at times unleashing the anger he seems to feel about the outcome of the 2008 race.
 Mr. Hayworth trails Mr. McCain in polls, fund-raising and endorsements. The Phoenix area is dotted with large billboards for Mr. McCain, and Mr. Hayworth's campaign remains strikingly upstart.
 But between the unusually late primary date of Aug. 24 -- which could have an impact on turnout -- and the volatility of an energized primary base that has never quite cottoned to Mr. McCain, his team is concerned enough to keep him pressing the flesh all his non-Washington days.
 On the trail these days, there is less of the energy generated by a run for the White House. And the candidate often seems to be striking a different tone.
 Back in 2008, at a town-hall-style meeting, presidential candidate McCain snatched the microphone away from an older woman who referred to Mr. Obama as ''an Arab'' and protested: ''No, no ma'am. He's a decent family man with whom I happen to have some disagreements.''
 The other day, in front of about 100 people at the Parker Community/Senior Center here in western Arizona, a man who identified himself as a Vietnam veteran said, ''I want to know what this guy, what's his name, let me see, Hussein, Barack Hussein Obama, is doing about our health care.''
 Senate candidate McCain's face flashed with brief amusement, and then he gazed toward the scuffed floor and settled into a grimace. ''We all want to be respectful of the president of the United States,'' he said.
 Both remarkably sprightly and just this side of cranky, a visibly thinner Mr. McCain zips around Arizona regularly these days, scurrying from public forum to campaign office opening to West Valley business luncheon. The crowds can be loving or volatile.
 Speaking without notes on subjects like North Korea, deficit spending, immigration policy and Social Security for 20 minutes at a time, Mr. McCain often reflects the experience and savvy he has come by honestly through years on the stump.
 But just as often he squints as if he is bracing for a verbal blow. And he can shift from the animated Mr. McCain of past campaigns -- quick with a joke or a warm ''Thank you for your service'' to a young mother whose husband is on his third tour to Iraq -- to being uneasy and defensive about the parochial issues he finds himself hectored about.
 ''I'm not going to come in here and tell the local government what to do,'' Mr. McCain snapped at Darla Tilley, director of the Parker center for the elderly, who pressed him in early June on the lack of nursing homes and assisted-living facilities in her county. A little while later, before leaving for his next stop, Mr. McCain pivoted to contrition. ''I hope to be more like you,'' he told her.
 In an interview later, Ms. Tilley said she had been upset less by the exchange than by the fact that ''the senator didn't really seem to know or understand how many state-funded programs we have lost here.''
 If it galls Mr. McCain, a two-time presidential candidate, senior senator and war hero to have to race across this vast state to defend himself against a former radio talk show host who once suggested that same-sex marriage could lead to nuptials with animals, it is not readily apparent.
 He never mentions Mr. Hayworth by name and has so far refused to debate him. ''I have a day job,'' he said in response to one voter who pressed him on this. McCain campaign officials refused numerous requests for interviews.
 Most often Mr. McCain is flanked by just an aide or two -- the old posse of elected officials and fellow war heroes back home or plotting their own political futures -- while he toughs it out at a North Scottsdale library before voters who are not afraid to confront him.
 ''We all know what happened after 9/11,'' said one man in the audience here. ''Why didn't you close this border down? Where were you, Senator?''
 The senator sparred at the library with a voter, Richard Martin, who took him to task for 15 minutes over his history of immigration legislation, his distaste for torture and his refusal to debate his opponent. ''You won't have any debates,'' Mr. Martin fumed. ''You're afraid of J. D. Hayworth. The people in Arizona deserve debates.''
 As several stops with him around his state this month demonstrate, Mr. McCain, whose tirelessness at age 73 is a thing of visual wonder, is often under fire from voters weary of shape- shifting politicians this year.
 Nowhere is this more clear than on immigration. Mr. McCain has been dinged for moving significantly from his former position of giving working papers to some illegal immigrants to a border-control-only approach on the issue. But it is crystal clear that this is what his primary constituents want and expect from him.
 While border crime has decreased in this state in recent years, the killing of a prominent rancher in the south by what the police suspect was an illegal immigrant set off rage across the state, and helped fuel a tough new state law directed at immigrants.
 Repeatedly over three days, Mr. McCain was asked why he had supported ''amnesty'' for illegal immigrants in the past (''I never supported amnesty,'' he says), and how he feels about a proposed state law intended to prevent children of illegal immigrants born in the United States from automatically becoming citizens. (He deflected the question.) One woman suggested she would like to ''get a gun'' and help border agents herself, a not-uncommon refrain here.
 ''People in the southern part of the state are not safe in their homes,'' Mr. McCain said repeatedly, to the sound of applause.
 Yet for all his oratory about Arizona issues, Mr. McCain is also a one-man show of Washington bashing, generally focused on the deficit and the new health care plan.
 ''My favorite bumper sticker is the one that says, 'Don't tell Obama what comes after a trillion,' '' he said, using a reliable laugh line.

HEADLINE: Feinberg Says Faster Claim Payment Is Needed

BYLINE: By LIZ ROBBINS

 BODY:
BP said on Monday that it had so far spent about $2 billion in its response to the oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, including containment efforts, economic and environmental claims and state and federal costs.
 But while the company said it had already paid out $105 million in claims in the two months since the offshore rig accident that loosed the torrent of crude oil, Kenneth R. Feinberg, the newly appointed director of the fund set up to help victims in the gulf region said that he would work to make payouts faster. 
 ''Do not underestimate the anger and frustration of people in the Gulf, the uncertainty of not knowing what they'll receive and when they'll receive it,'' Mr. Feinberg, whom President Obama appointed to run the fund, said on CNBC Monday morning. Anger swelled over the weekend when BP's chief executive, Tony Hayward, took a day off to watch his yacht compete in an exclusive race off the southern coast of England on Saturday. Rahm Emanuel, the White House Chief of Staff, called it yet another public relations gaffe by Mr. Hayward. 
 Apparently in response to widespread criticism, BP said on Monday that Mr. Hayward had canceled his planned appearance at the World National Oil Companies Congress, a three-day conference in London this week. ''Mr. Hayward's very heavy schedule of commitments to Gulf of Mexico activities have led him to ask Steve Westwell, the BP Group Chief of Staff, to make the speech in his stead,'' Sheila Williams, a BP spokeswoman in London, said in an e-mail message. 
 Monday brought several oil spill-related developments in the courts, on the water and in the public opinion polls. The United States Chemical Safety Board said it was opening an investigation into the April 20 explosion and fire on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, which killed 11 workers, sank the rig and left the Maconda well gushing crude oil a mile below the surface of the gulf. 
 A federal District Court judge in New Orleans heard arguments on Monday from companies supplying offshore oil rigs who sued to lift a six-month moratorium President Obama imposed on the 33 rigs currently idle in the Gulf, as well as new deepwater drilling projects, pending results of the investigation into the accident. 
 Containment efforts continued at the wellhead after a temporary shutdown on Sunday that showed the improvised oil recapture system's vulnerability to weather. Adm. Thad W. Allen of the Coast Guard, the federal commander of the response to the disaster, said that the two devices in place at the well captured 23,291 barrels on Sunday. ''That is slightly below what we've been getting the last couple of days,'' Admiral Allen said in a conference call with reporters. ''That was due to lightning in the area.''
 Last week, lightning struck a derrick on top of one of the ships that is collecting oil siphoned from the leaking well, starting a small fire. As a result, ''whenever lightning is within five miles of the platform, they shut down production,'' Admiral Allen said.
 BP intends to install a new system by the middle of next month that will make the operation less prone to dangerous weather conditions and create several backup systems to collect the oil, which continues to gush from the well at a greater rate than the containment systems can collect it. 
 The company and the Coast Guard are still aiming for the second week of August as the time when two relief wells to be completed and operating. BP has said the relief wells offer the best chance to stop the flow of oil completely. 
 A new CBS/New York Times poll found that public confidence in BP's ability to stop the leak within the next month is fairly low, while confidence is higher that the region's industry and wildlife will eventually recover from the spill. According to the poll, about 48 percent of Americans think it will take the oil company several more months to stop the leak; 18 percent think BP will be successful in the next month; 16 percent think it will take a year or longer; and 7 percent say the company will never be able to stop the leak. 
 Two-thirds of all Americans say that despite severe environmental damage, the gulf's wildlife, like fish and birds, will recover. And about 8 in 10 Americans, including more than 7 in 10 Gulf Coast residents, say that the region's economy, including businesses like tourism and fishing, will eventually return to normal.

HEADLINE: 2 Sides Clash at City Hall Over Domino Housing Plan

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
By some standards, a developer's plan to transform the defunct Domino Sugar refinery north of the Williamsburg Bridge in Brooklyn is a good deal, offering 660 of its planned 2,200 apartments to poor and working-class New Yorkers, shops to animate the streets and a public esplanade along the East River.
 ''We're taking this narrow, vacant industrial site and turning it into an incredibly powerful economic engine for the neighborhood,'' said the developer, Michael Lappin, president of the Community Preservation Corporation. 
 But as the $1.4 billion project nears the end of the city's often unpredictable approval process, its fate is subject to Brooklyn's fractious politics, a weak economy and a once working-class community exhausted by the pace of luxury development during the real estate boom. Critics say the benefit of moderate-income housing would be outweighed by the project's tall buildings, densely packed on 11 acres, and its impact on a crowded subway station nearby.
 The proposal calls for the preservation of the main refinery building and its 40-foot-high Domino Sugar sign and the construction of four towers between Kent Avenue and the river, between South Third and South Fourth Streets. Two of the towers would be 40 stories tall, the others 25 and 30 stories tall.
 Although the City Planning Commission has approved the project, known as New Domino, it is unclear how much political muscle the Bloomberg administration is exerting on its behalf as the City Council debates the merits of developing the site. The Council and the mayor have the final say on the plan.
 The opposing sides were in full view on the steps of City Hall on Monday, as the Council's first hearing on the project began. 
 ''We are here today to support the Domino project because we need affordable housing,'' said Yolanda Coco, a tenant advocate for the group East Brooklyn Churches, who, like two dozen other supporters, wore a T-shirt with the slogan DomiYes. 
 ''We're facing a lot of evictions,'' she said, ''because people cannot afford the rents.''
 Diana Reyna, a councilwoman, and Representative Nydia M. Velazquez spoke to the crowd in favor of the project.
 Then the opposition mounted the City Hall steps, led by Councilman Steve Levin, who exclaimed, ''We have had it with overdevelopment in our neighborhood.''
 Mr. Levin, whose district includes the site, was backed by his mentor, Vito J. Lopez, the powerful Brooklyn assemblyman who plays a critical role in state and city housing development. Mr. Lopez said he wanted more lower-cost housing and a smaller project.
 ''We want 800 units of affordable housing,'' Mr. Lopez said. ''They can cut the 40-story tower to 28.''
 Mr. Lopez, Mr. Levin and Ms. Reyna, who was once a supporter of Mr. Lopez and now openly feuds with him, have clashed repeatedly over the same issues involving other projects, including Rose Plaza, a planned waterfront condominium project in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Mr. Lopez, Mr. Levin and a faction of the Satmar Hasidic sect refused to support the project until the developer promised that 30 percent of the units would be moderately priced. Ms. Reyna, as well as a different faction of Satmars, generally backed the project from the beginning.
 Ms. Reyna, who represents a district adjacent to the Domino site, said the developer had designed a ''good plan,'' a result of four years of negotiations and revisions: it includes space for a school, public recreation, rental apartments and subsidized condominiums for working families. She said she would prefer that the project moved forward, saying additional burdens could undermine its financial viability. There are 51 stalled residential projects in her district, she said.
 At the Domino site, the developer has promised that 30 percent of the units would be moderately priced, more than the 20 percent that has become standard. Like many other residential projects, it would require substantial subsidies from the city's housing programs.
 Christine C. Quinn, speaker of the City Council, is trying to negotiate a compromise between the two sides. But the Community Preservation Corporation, which is involved in midpriced housing projects, may have little room to negotiate, because its costs have soared since it bought the property six years ago.
 The city designated the refinery building a landmark last year. Its preservation will cost more than $40 million; the shell will have to be preserved, with a new building constructed inside it. At the same time, the corporation's plan to cross-subsidize the lower-cost housing by selling condominiums has been undermined, at least temporarily, by a soft economy and an abundance of unsold apartments in the area.
 The Rev. Mariano Cisco, of St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church in Bushwick, Brooklyn, supports the Domino project. It '' responds to the needs of the community,'' he said. 
 But Christopher H. Olechowski, chairman of Community Board 1, which includes the site, disagrees. ''People are pretty much fed up,'' he said. ''Our neighborhood is inundated.''

HEADLINE: For a Healthier Bronx, A Farm of Their Own

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
IT'S hard to imagine two places in New York State more different than the South Bronx and Schoharie County.
 The South Bronx has 31,582 people per square mile. The county has 51. 
 Less than 2 percent of the people who live in the South Bronx are white. Schoharie County, about three hours straight north by car, is 95 percent white.
 The South Bronx is home to four jails, two sewage plants and an untold number of subway rats. Schoharie County has 13,600 cows, 1,305 sheep, 291 hogs and several hundred farmers to tend those animals and grow vegetables and fruit.
 Dennis Derryck, a 70-year-old mathematician and professor at the New School for Management and Urban Policy, has become the unlikely matchmaker between the two worlds. 
 Mr. Derryck, who lives in Harlem, is Schoharie County's newest farmer. His spread is Corbin Hills Road Farm, 92 acres with a pretty farmhouse and a silo that needs a roof. It's the cornerstone of a project linking the upstate rural and downstate urban through beets and berries, an effort to get healthy food into what is the poorest Congressional district east of the Mississippi. 
 Unlike others who have come to the South Bronx to solve social problems through vegetables, he is offering neither charity nor an outsider's idea of what the neighborhood might want to cook. He's developed a commercial community-supported agriculture plan (C.S.A.) that lets residents determine what they'll get, with an enticing prize at the end for people who stick with it: a chance to own shares in the farm.
 He started the project because, like others who have spent time looking at what people eat in the South Bronx, he became frustrated.
 ''If there is a food revolution, it's not yet including the low income,'' Mr. Derryck said. Every day, hundreds of thousands of pounds of produce travel through the South Bronx to the Hunts Point market, one of the world's largest food distribution centers. Little of it is actually sold in the surrounding neighborhood. 
 The South Bronx has more health problems than any other part of New York, according to studies by the city health department. Many, like diabetes and obesity, are connected to diet. Mr. Derryck thought a community supported agriculture program rooted in the actual community could help.
 In a traditional C.S.A. plan, people pay farmers at the beginning of a season for weekly deliveries of whatever grows on the farm. Last year, 18,000 New Yorkers participated in 80 such plans, according to the advocacy group Just Food. It's a model that doesn't translate well to poor neighborhoods, where handing over, say, $500 at one time with the promise that someone will send you a box of flowers, herbs and vegetables you probably don't want isn't a popular notion.
 So he decided to turn the model on its head, giving plan members a say in what is grown, and, with the help of nonprofit groups, making it less expensive as well.
 ''Most people I talked with say, 'Can I get enough food to feed my family,' '' Mr. Derryck said. ''They don't want parsnips and thyme. They want 10 pounds of potatoes.''
 He cajoled almost every person he has ever served with on a nonprofit board, raising $562,000. He also got a $300,000 bank loan. He bought the farm in February 2009, then went shopping for a farm manager, a tractor and a refrigerated truck for delivery in the Bronx. Once he pays off investors and the loan, which might take five years or more, he intends to pass shares in the farm to the members of the plan. 
 Mr. Derryck's farm won't be producing until August. And even then, it can't grow enough to fill the boxes. So a small group of Schoharie County farmers have signed on, agreeing to offer vegetables and fruit at a discount to help Mr. Derryck make budget. Mr. Derryck thinks the plan can eventually generate $1.2 million a year for Schoharie County farmers, and expand its roster of supporters to include foster-care families and day care centers.
 Richard Ball, who grows some of the finest carrots in the state as well as cardoons and haricots verts for restaurants like Daniel and Per Se, met with Mr. Derryck and decided the crazy professor from Harlem had a cause worth supporting. He also figured it could build business and upstate-downstate good will.
 ''If we simply got New York to be New York's customer, we'd be in great shape,'' he said.
 Seven nonprofit groups in the South Bronx have signed on as sponsors, passing on shares to employees and clients, others offering some financial help and still others serving as the collection and distribution points. The first week, Mr. Derryck sold 171 shares. This week, it reached 228.
 ''Clearly, we have struck a nerve,'' Mr. Derryck said.
 People can pay $3.75 to $20 a week, depending on income, subsidies and share size. Members only have to pay for two weeks' supply of food at a time, and they can use food stamps. 
 Judith Raphael signed up right away. She has spent the last seven years raising two children in the neighborhood and each summer hosts the Taking Back the Bad Rap of Hunts Point celebration.
 Despite what critics who have never lived in the South Bronx might think, people really do want to eat fresh fruit and vegetables, she said. But the options are slim. At the bodega, you might find spotty bananas and potatoes. At the only grocery store within walking distance, the broccoli is usually yellowing, the apples soft and the lettuce packaged. 
 And it's not cheap.
 ''By the time you bought everything you need for the household, you get to the vegetables and you just say forget it, you can't afford it,'' she said. ''People might not buy a bag of oranges because it's too expensive, but that doesn't mean they don't want to cook a good dinner.''
 The boxes that showed up Thursday held such beautiful food that people couldn't stop smiling. 
 There were pantry fillers like red potatoes, turnips and beets. But there was also plenty of pristine chard, crisp sugar snap peas and fresh oregano. And even though strawberries were too expensive for Mr. Derryck's initial budget, each family got a box -- the farmers' gift to their new urban partners. ''Right off the bat you want them to think they are making a right decision,'' Mr. Ball said.
 But all that glowing good will doesn't mean the project is going to work. Life in the South Bronx just isn't that easy, and people are skeptical. Many groups have parachuted in trying to fix things, using fashionable terms like food deserts and food justice. 
 The city-run Green Carts program, which has issued permits for 113 produce carts in the Bronx, rarely shows up in Hunts Point, residents say. And City Harvest comes by every few weeks to hand out about 20,000 pounds of fruit and vegetables, bringing along chefs like Eric Ripert to demonstrate how to cook vegetable fried rice.
 Even Heather Mills, the former wife of Paul McCartney, sends her brand of nutrition into Hunts Point. In 2008, she donated $1 million to the Hunts Point Alliance for Children for fresh produce, and provides frozen vegan imitation chicken, fish and hamburgers from her food company, Meatless Meats. She is also donating money to the Corbin Hills Road Farm project.
 But not everyone in the South Bronx is enamored with programs that aren't home grown.
 ''It's been like this hippie approach to food justice that starts to have this hand-out mentality,'' said Zena Nelson, who started the South Bronx Food Co-op in 2007. The co-op, which Ms. Nelson recently left, has agreed to buy 25 shares of the Schoharie C.S.A. plan to provide food for its members.
 She empathizes with Mr. Derryck, who has to juggle the demands of his agricultural enterprise as well as the competing dietary interests of a community with roots in West Africa, the Caribbean, the American South and Latin America. 
 ''This community is going to be a tough one,'' Mr. Derryck said. ''If I blow it, I'm not getting a second chance.''
 That's why he thinks the project will sustain itself only if residents have an ownership stake. Once plan members take control of the farm, they can collectively decide to use their shares to reduce the price of their weekly take, and make other decisions about how the farm is run and what's grown. He envisions farm camps and weekend visits.
 But it's a concept that can confuse supporters and plan members alike. 
 ''I don't even know what they are talking about,'' said Juan Duncan, an immigrant from the Dominican Republic who has been unemployed since March. Still, when he saw a flier outlining the concept, he enrolled. He's sick and tired of grocery store prices. ''Five or six dollars for a little bunch of asparagus with a rubber band around it?'' he asked incredulously.
 That the plan did not offer plantains was his only regret. ''But I understand why,'' he said.
 Nancy Biberman has been working with people in the South Bronx for nearly three decades. She is the founder and president of the Women's Housing and Economic Development Project, one of the biggest partners in Mr. Derryck's project.
 ''If you don't understand what ownership of anything other than a television or a cellphone is, the notion of being a shareholder in a cooperative farm is a hard concept to understand,'' she said. But at this point, anything that gets good food into the South Bronx is worth a try.
 ''You know how you throw the spaghetti against the wall and see what sticks?'' she said. ''We'll throw all the vegetables against the wall and see what happens. The problems are so serious, it's kind of unconscionable to not try everything.''

HEADLINE: U.A.W. Chief Is Taking On Toyota Plants

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Locked into concessions to the Detroit carmakers and with its membership at a 70-year low, the United Automobile Workers union is picking a fight with a longtime adversary, Toyota, in a bid to regain some of its clout.
 The union has been trying, and failing, to organize workers at Toyota for almost as long as the company has had assembly plants in this country. But now Bob King, the union's new leader, says Toyota is vulnerable because of its safety problems and recalls. 
 He has called on union members to picket Toyota dealerships and has vowed to ''pound on Toyota'' on the organizing issue at its 10 plants in the United States, all nonunion. 
 The problem for the U.A.W. is that the auto industry's troubles have actually compounded the challenge of organizing workers, labor experts say. 
 The union has little in the way of a sales pitch on wages and benefits now that the Detroit automakers have cut wages and benefits to union members to be more in line with Toyota and the other so-called transplant manufacturers.
 ''Toyota was most vulnerable when the auto industry was booming,'' said Jeffrey K. Liker, a University of Michigan professor and author of a book about the Japanese carmaker. 
 ''Now they look over the fence and say, 'Look at how many plants the U.A.W. has lost.' ''
 Still, Mr. King has plenty to gain among his own ranks by taking on Toyota, even if the effort falls short, the experts said. Giving Toyota another black eye could show members that the union can still flex its muscles even after the beating it has taken.
 ''The union could really use a victory,'' said Harry Katz, dean of the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations. ''To win would be big for them, but even getting close would be a powerful statement.''
 When the Detroit carmakers dominated the market, the U.A.W. was able to negotiate high wages and generous benefits because each company knew it would not be worse off than the others. Now Toyota, Honda, Nissan and other transplant companies employ tens of thousands of nonunion hourly workers in the United States, greatly reducing the union's bargaining power.
 A Toyota spokesman, Mike Goss, said the company recognized its workers' right to unionize but that they had not chosen to do so in more than 20 years of manufacturing in this country. The company employees 34,000 blue-collar and management workers in the United States.
 ''Our job as a company is to give them good pay and benefits, which we know we do, and to have open communication between team members and management,'' Mr. Goss, said. ''It's also our job to operate our company with some employment stability in mind.''
 Professor Liker said morale among Toyota workers soared to ''historic highs'' during the recession, as U.A.W.-represented plants closed but Toyota kept its work force intact. The company halted some production as demand fell, but employees were still asked to report every day, often for training.
 ''People were extremely grateful when they looked at their neighbors losing their jobs and medical benefits, and Toyota was still bringing them in with full pay and benefits and not laying anybody off,'' Professor Liker said.
 Accordingly, convincing Toyota workers that the U.A.W. offers any better job protection than they already have could prove difficult. The U.A.W. needs Toyota workers to suffer more of a hardship before most would be willing to put themselves through the risks that inherently come with trying to unionize, said Gary N. Chaison, a professor of industrial relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass.
 ''If you lose a job at a Toyota plant, you're going to be unemployed for a long period of time,'' Professor Chaison said. ''They don't want to spoil a good thing that they have. They don't want to take chances. Many of these workers are just thankful that they have good jobs in manufacturing with benefits.''
 The only jobs that Toyota has eliminated in large numbers were at a plant with union workers in California, known as New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., or Nummi, which was a joint venture with General Motors until G.M. withdrew as part of its bankruptcy. Toyota said the plant was not viable without a partner and closed it in April, laying off 4,700 U.A.W. workers.
 The U.A.W. vehemently protested the closing, with Mr. King joining picket lines, and negotiated $281 million in severance pay for the workers.
 Last month, Toyota revealed plans to build electric cars at the Nummi plant in conjunction with a small luxury carmaker, Tesla, but the operation will be much smaller, with significantly fewer workers than it had under Toyota and G.M. Toyota also said it would begin building the Corolla compact sedan, which used to be the primary product of the plant, at a new nonunion plant in Mississippi.
 Mr. King said the Detroit automakers had never closed a plant just to open a new one with different workers at lower wages. Bringing workers at the foreign-based carmakers into the U.A.W., he said, was essential to create a level playing field and to ensure workers earned fair wages throughout the industry.
 ''When you have everybody organized and you do pattern bargaining, you can deliver on that promise,'' he said.
 The U.A.W. is also just plain desperate for members. Membership fell below 400,000 last year, a level not seen since 1940, after years of plant closures by General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler. At its peak 40 years ago, the union had about 1.5 million members.
 ''King has to talk about organizing because the U.A.W. has a big problem: it's hemorrhaging members,'' Professor Chaison said. ''If you claim to be a labor movement, you have to grow.''

HEADLINE: Mortgage Delays Blamed For Decline in Home Sales

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Sales of existing homes fell in May, hurt by delays in mortgage applications and uncertainty over a federal flood insurance program, the National Association of Realtors said on Tuesday.
 There were 5.66 million sales of existing homes last month, down from a revised 5.79 million in April, the association said. While the seasonally adjusted figure for May was weaker than the 6.12 million analysts had expected, it represented a 19 percent increase from the same month last year.
 The association's chief economist, Lawrence Yun, said the year-over-year increase was driven by a federal tax credit that applied only to home buyers who close before the end of June, making it unlikely that the performance would be sustained. 
 ''We are witnessing the ongoing effects of the home buyer tax credit, which we will also see in June real estate closings,'' Mr. Yun said. ''However, approximately 180,000 home buyers who signed a contract in good faith to receive the tax credit may not be able to finalize by the end of June due to delays in the mortgage process, particularly for short sales.''
 Congress left for recess at the end of March without renewing the flood insurance program, so it was suspended from March 28 until President Obama in April signed legislation that provided a temporary extension until May 31. While technically buyers could still get a mortgage as long as they had proof that they had applied for flood insurance, some reported that in practice this was not easy or even possible. 
 Mr. Yun said uncertainty over the program apparently had some impact on May sales. More than 35 percent of homes in Louisiana and Florida were required by lenders to have flood insurance, the highest proportion nationwide, according to the Realtors association's figures. 
 He said the association was also monitoring the potential impact of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill on home sales in those two states.
 Because of the credit expiration, significant weakness in the housing market is to be expected over the next several months, said Dan Greenhaus, the chief economic strategist for Miller Tabak & Company. 
 Home sales ultimately affect the overall picture for consumer spending, driving things like remodeling and durable goods sales. 
 ''While housing is not the giant part of the economy some imply that it is, we continue to believe that housing remains a crucially important part of the economy from a sentiment standpoint,'' Mr. Greenhaus said. 
 He added: ''As housing weakens, will consumers continually feel exuberant about their respective financial situations? We think not.'' 
 Stuart Hoffman, a senior economist at PNC, said it was ''a little disappointing that sales didn't rise in May'' from April. But he noted that home prices were 2.7 percent higher than a year ago, ''so that does show there is definitely some stability in home prices.'' 
 The 2.2 percent month-over-month decline in the pace of home sales was concentrated in the Northeast. The Realtors association also said inventories shrank to 3.89 million, a supply that is good for just over eight months. 
 Single-family home sales declined 1.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.98 million in May compared with 5.06 million in April. Sales of condominiums and co-ops fell to 680,000 in May, compared with 730,000 in April, the association said.
 The national median existing home price for all housing types was $179,600 in May.

HEADLINE: Outside a Former Tobacco Temple, Smokers Feel Put Upon

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON and EMILY B. HAGER

 BODY:
There was a time when people did not think twice about smoking. That was when a pack of cigarettes could be bought for pocket change, when it was still legal to smoke in bars and restaurants, when Philip Morris -- the nation's largest tobacco company --still had its headquarters in the Philip Morris building. 
 Of course, things have changed. After all, the Philip Morris building is not even called that anymore. (When it was new, in the early 1980s, it was called the Philip Morris Research Center and Headquarters, at first. Philip Morris's parent company, the Altria Group, moved its headquarters to Richmond, Va., two years ago.) 
 On the sidewalk alongside that building, at 120 Park Avenue, across from Grand Central Terminal, is an oasis for smokers in an increasingly smoke-free city: two thigh-high ashtrays and room to stand for the few minutes between lighting up and stubbing out. Smokers know this place well: Some come from as far as a block and a half away, because they dare not light up outside their own office buildings. 
 It is between a subway entrance and, of all things, a tobacco shop. And it is not a happy place. The latest sin tax, part of an emergency budget measure to keep the state government running, will add $1.60 in state taxes to a pack of cigarettes. In New York City, where cigarettes are also subject to municipal taxes, the price of a pack of some brands will jump to more than $11 -- or more than 50 cents per cigarette.
 Smokers came and went in this open-air smoking lounge, but the anger against the new tax -- and sense that smokers are being picked on in budget-conscious times -- remained.
 ''I'm definitely not happy about it,'' John O'Gorman, a risk manager who was smoking a Marlboro Light, said of the new cigarette tax, which takes effect on July 1. ''There have got to be easier ways to raise more money.''
 All right, Mr. O'Gorman: Pretend that you were a governor facing a big budget shortfall. What would you tax to raise additional revenue?
 ''All the cars coming into Manhattan,'' because they contribute to air pollution, Mr. O'Gorman said. ''Maybe there's a way to tax that.''
 Among a cross section of smokers the consensus was that the new tax was an economic penalty. How much of a penalty depended on each smoker's own story, on how cost-conscious they had become in a recession, on whether they had jobs or had lost them. Some said that paying an extra $1.60 a pack would make cigarettes cost so much that they would get serious about quitting once and for all. 
 Doreen Campo, on a smoke break on Madison Avenue between 40th and 41st Streets, said her mother had died of lung cancer after smoking for years. Ms. Campo, 51, said she had continued to smoke, but the new tax could change that. 
 ''I won't be able to afford to smoke,'' she said, smoking a Marlboro Light. ''It's too expensive. It's expensive now. You end up short. You end up not eating because you want those cigarettes.''
 Still, she said, picking on smokers for new and higher taxes amounted to economic discrimination. ''I mean, everybody has a right to do what they want to do,'' she said. ''It ruined the business for the bars because no one wants to go out in the cold to have a cigarette, or if you're having a conversation, instead of you and me having a conversation, we have to get up and excuse ourselves and go outside. Even the restaurants. First they have smoking sections. Then they have none. Then you have the annoying people that pass by and they go like this.''
 She waved her arms as if she were clearing smoke from a fire.
 Daniel Conard, a sales manager smoking outside the former Philip Morris building, said the price still had a way to go before he decided that smoking was unaffordable. How high would the price per pack have to go? ''For myself,'' he said, ''it would be $15.''
 But New York is not getting much revenue from him, even now. ''I'm from Kentucky,'' he said. ''I go home and buy a few cartons.'' And not that often: ''I'm a work smoker,'' he said. ''I don't smoke at home.'' He said he smoked two or three cigarettes a day.
 He mentioned a tax on soda, an idea that Gov. David A. Paterson floated earlier in the year. ''Smoking's not good,'' he said. ''Drinking soda's not good for the well-being of society, I guess. Still, I smoke. My great aunt smoked all her life and lived to 105. Some people do that.''

HEADLINE: City Growth May Affect Party Control In Albany

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
New York City accounted for two-thirds of the state's population growth since 2000, according to census estimates, suggesting that after redistricting is completed in 2011, the State Legislature could remain controlled by Democrats for years to come. 
 As of July 1, 2009, census estimates released on Tuesday show, the city's population was a record 8,391,881 -- just shy of the 8.4 million that city demographers predict it will hit when the 2010 census results are released.
 Though the city's gain of more than 45,000 people since the year before represented a growth rate of only 0.5 percent, it was the largest numerical increase of any city in the country. From 2000 through 2009, the city grew by 383,000, or nearly 5 percent.
 In 2000, 42 percent of the state's population lived in New York City. In 2009, 43 percent did. Because redistricting is done on the basis of population and the city is overwhelmingly Democratic, the balance of power in Albany is likely to remain the same or perhaps shift even further in favor of the Democrats.
 ''Whoever ends up in charge of redistricting,'' said Andrew A. Beveridge, a Queens College sociologist, ''will find it virtually impossible to ignore the fact that the population and power shift from upstate to downstate continued unabated.''
 Since 2000, most of the state's double-digit population gains outside New York City were recorded in the city's suburbs, including Harrison, Montgomery, New Paltz, Old Westbury, Peekskill, Rye Brook, Sleepy Hollow, Southampton and Woodbury.
 The highest growth rate, 78 percent, was in Kiryas Joel, the Orange County enclave where Hasidic Jews predominate. 
 Meanwhile, cities in economically distressed parts of the state like Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse experienced population declines of 6 percent to 8 percent.
 With the Assembly firmly in Democratic hands, whichever party controls the State Senate typically plays a pivotal role in redistricting. Democrats now hold a two-vote margin.
 This year, a number of candidates for state office have pledged to support a nonpartisan redistricting commission to draw the lines on the basis of the 2010 census for the following decade, beginning with the 2012 elections. That would make it more difficult for either party to tinker with the redistricting.
 After the 2000 census, Republicans tried to squeeze as many sparsely populated districts as possible into the upstate region, favoring their party, while adding numbers of heavily populated districts in the metropolitan area, which is more Democratic.

HEADLINE: Census Reports It Has Reached Almost All Households

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
As of Tuesday, 98 percent of the 47 million households that had failed to return their census questionnaires had been contacted by a census worker. 
 Metropolitan New York was among the regions with the lowest completion rates, with 94 percent of questionnaires turned in; an area in Mississippi was the least complete local census office, with about 88 percent, Robert M. Groves, the Census Bureau director, said in an interview. 
 Despite fears of hostility toward the federal government, incidents involving census workers have been relatively few. Since April, in the course of knocking on 47 million doors an average of two times, the bureau has logged 430 on-the-job incidents against enumerators, including 13 cases where shots were fired (one man was killed in Baltimore) and 139 cases where a weapon was pulled. Ten workers were robbed, one was bitten by a duck and another by a rooster. 
 ''I don't see a pattern,'' Mr. Groves said. ''The assaults are not all ideological, but there is a group where the respondents articulated a hatred of the federal government.''
 Presaging 2010 census results, Texas accounted for much of the nation's urban growth in the year ending July 1, 2009, according to census data released Tuesday. 
 Four Texas cities -- San Antonio, Fort Worth, Houston and Austin -- were among the nine cities in the nation with the biggest numerical gains in population during the year beginning July 1, 2008. Over the period since 2005, Houston has led every other American city in growth and, with three other Texas cities, accounted for four of the six cities in the country with the greatest population gains.
 Frisco, Tex., north of Dallas, grew by 6.2 percent to 102,000 since 2008, the fastest rate of any city with more than 100,000 people in the country. Since the start of the decade, Frisco expanded from 33,000 people, an average annual growth rate of 204 percent, also the nation's highest. 
 ''The rise of Texas cities can be attributed to their relative immunity to the housing bubble burst and later recession that plagued other parts of the Sun Belt, the continued draw of immigrants and their mix of both new and old economy industries,'' said William H. Frey, a Brookings Institution demographer. 
 Detroit continued its decline, but by fewer than 2,000 to 910,920 since the year before, compared with 951,000 when the decade began, holding up better than some had expected. 
 New Orleans continued its comeback, growing by more than 18,000 in a single year to nearly 355,000, but still well below its nearly 455,000 before the city was badly damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005.
 Most of the fastest-growing cities were in Texas, North Carolina, Nevada, Colorado and Arizona, although the recession appeared to have dampened the pace of that growth. Traditional magnets for retirees and job-seekers lost some of their attraction.
 Baltimore, Cleveland, Pittsburgh and Buffalo registered declines, but Los Angeles; Chicago; Philadelphia; San Francisco; Indianapolis; Columbus, Ohio; Boston; and Washington recorded gains. New York City grew by 45,000 people to 8,391,881, a growth rate of only 0.5 percent, but the largest one-year numerical gain of any city in the country.
 Chicago recorded its highest growth rate this decade as did Denver, Seattle and Washington.

HEADLINE: Creative Suite 5 Helps Raise Adobe's Profit

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The software maker Adobe Systems posted higher net income for its most recent quarter, a result of strong demand for the software packages it sells to professional designers and developers. 
 Adobe earned $148.6 million, or 28 cents a share, up 18 percent from $126.1 million, or 24 cents a share, a year earlier.
 Revenue in the period, which ended June 4 and was the second quarter of Adobe's fiscal year, grew 34 percent, to $943 million, from $704.7 million a year earlier, largely on strong demand for Creative Suite 5, which was introduced in April.
 Adjusted earnings were 44 cents a share, slightly better than the 42 cents expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.
 ''Our growth is being fueled by the explosion of digital content across all media and devices,'' the chief executive, Shantanu Narayen, said in a statement.
 Creative Suite, which includes programs like Photoshop for photo editing and Illustrator for graphic design and illustration, brings in the bulk of Adobe's revenue. Poor timing hurt sales of the previous version, Creative Suite 4, which went on sale in the fall of 2008 just as the financial crisis hit.
 As a result, sales of CS5 are being helped by pent-up demand from customers who have held back on upgrades and are now two versions behind.
 For the current quarter, Adobe forecast adjusted earnings of 46 to 50 cents a share on revenue of $950 million to $1 billion. Analysts expected a profit of 48 cents a share on revenue of $958.7 million.
 Shares of Adobe, which is based in San Jose, Calif., fell about 2 percent in after-hours trading. Before the release of results, the stock had closed down 37 cents at $32.76.

HEADLINE: Very Brief Tenants, and Why Landlords Like Them

BYLINE: By KEITH MULVIHILL

 BODY:
''Four days ago this was nothing; that wall didn't exist,'' an ebullient Charles Gibb, the president of Belvedere Vodka, said on a recent night as he pointed to a pristine white wall in a meatpacking district space covered with images of a model wearing a citrus-pink caftan. 
 Nearby, the comedian Chelsea Handler chatted with admirers while sipping a cocktail. Clusters of well-dressed young people raised camera-phones to snap photos of the occasional celebrity (Ashley Olsen and Kelly Osbourne, among others, stopped by).
 The garment in the photos was created by the designer Matthew Williamson especially for the occasion: the introduction of Belvedere's pink grapefruit flavor. (The caftan was for sale across the street, at the Williamson boutique, for $1,195.) 
 Three days later, the photographs, the stars and all traces of Belvedere were gone -- one more pop-up shop that served its purpose. 
 The concept of a ''now you see it, now you don't'' store is commonly tied to a holiday theme: the New York beauty store Ricky's opens more than a dozen Halloween costume shops in September and October. And last winter Toys ''R'' Us opened 33 Holiday Express locations in the tristate area. 
 But in the last few years pop-ups have flourished in New York regardless of the holiday calendar. For building owners they are a way to fill vacant space and for sellers they offer a place to gauge the reception to their brand or introduce new products, without a long-term rental commitment.
 ''The great thing about a pop-up space is that it allows you to have one very consistent, very clear and very distinct message around the brand,'' Mr. Gibb said. Belvedere negotiated a deal to lease the 6,500-square-foot second-floor space at 414 West 14th Street a few months in advance. Within a few days of the three-night event, a team of designers, painters and construction workers turned it into a softly lighted den of glamour.
 David Sitt, vice president of operations at Sitt Asset Management, which owns the recently rehabbed building with the Carlyle Group, said attention-grabbing pop-ups, like the Belvedere Vodka event, could be a way to introduce prospective clients to the building.
 ''This is an open house that pays for itself,'' he said. ''You never know who's connected with who. Someone could walk in and fall in love with the building or tell a potential client.''
 Jeffrey Roseman, an executive vice president of Newmark Knight Frank Retail, said a recent pop-up store at 626 Broadway for Zumiez, an action-sports retailer based in Everett, Wash., was an effective way to advertise the space itself, as well as the Zumiez brand. 
 ''When I was showing the space to prospective retailers,'' Mr. Roseman said, ''they were jamming out of that store, music was blasting and kids were running in and buying stuff. The retailer we brought in there really had an opportunity to see life in a prospective store.''
 Occasionally, pop-up retailers may go on to negotiate a long-term lease. ''It's like taking the car out for a spin before you buy it,'' Mr. Roseman said.
 Generally, Mr. Roseman said, the per-square-foot prices for pop-ups are comparable to long-term leases on a pro-rated basis. ''It's a month's rent for what it would rent for on a long-term basis,'' he said. ''It's generally not a discount for the month.''
 Whether or not the surge of pop-ups over the last few years is strictly a reaction to the recession is hard to say, as no one tracks their occurrence. Still, given the economic climate, there is no dearth of empty high-visibility retail space, and opportunities for pop-ups still seem strong. One wrench in the longevity of the concept is declining rents, which may attract more long-term tenants and quell landlords' desire to deal with pop-ups.
 The retail rental market ''is starting to pick up,'' Mr. Sitt said. ''Starting in 2011, I don't think you'll see as many'' pop-ups.
 But judging by the swift business at Target's Liberty of London pop-up shop in March at 42nd Street and Sixth Avenue across from Bryant Park (open for a few days, it sold out of merchandise and closed a day early), it appears that shoppers have not tired of them. 
 ''I think they're here to stay; it's great advertising,'' Mr. Roseman said. 
 Mark Helder, the architect and owner of Metropolitan Green, a recently completed condominium in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, said he wasn't actually looking for a long-term leasing client; he preferred the flexibility offered by revolving pop-ups. 
 Metropolitan Green was completed in December and took on its first retail pop-up client in the cozy 660-square foot storefront. 
 ''My original idea was to provide a space that could be used by local artisans,'' said Mr. Helder. People can use the space anywhere from a long weekend to a maximum of two months. The monthly rate is just under $4,000, which includes utilities, insurance and Wi-Fi. 
 For some building owners, the choice of offering a temporary lease may have little to do with cash flow. In April, the Architectural League of New York signed a two-month agreement for a 3,100-square-foot storefront at 250 Hudson Street, and mounted a photo-driven exhibit called ''The City We Imagined/The City We Made: New New York 2001-2010.''
 ''We are not making any money on the deal but we thought it might be good to show a little life on the street,'' said Dennis P. Brady, the managing director at Jack Resnick & Sons, the company that owns the building. ''We figured it's good for the neighborhood, good for the store and good for the building.''
 ''It's only two months, so even if I do get someone who comes along and wants the store, by the time you put a deal together it's going to be two months anyway,'' Mr. Brady said.
 Ellen Baer, president of the Hudson Square Business Improvement District, said she could not be happier. Late last fall, after taking stock of vacant retail space, Ms. Baer said she began gauging building owners' interest in doing pop-ups, whether retail or gallery shows. 
 ''It helps to showcase available spaces, it brings foot traffic here that might not otherwise come to this neighborhood, and it provides people with activities that are consistent with the theme and vibe of the neighborhood,'' Ms. Baer said.
 Similar pop-ups by other neighborhood business improvement groups are happening throughout the city. The Port Authority currently has a month-to-month lease agreement with the Fashion Center business improvement district and the Times Square Alliance. The retail space, a storefront at the Port Authority Bus Terminal at 41st Street and Eighth Avenue, has been called Blank SL8. In April and May it was home to TerraCycle, a New Jersey-based store that sells products made from waste materials. In downtown Brooklyn, at 177 Livingston Street, a 5,000-square-foot retail space is a temporary home to two arts and one education organization that are hosting monthly events.
 ''Using vacant retail space for temporary shops or exhibits is brilliant,'' said Bill Chororos, who was visiting the Architectural League's exhibit on Hudson Street on a recent weekend. ''Anything is better than dead space.''
 ''To people not in the real estate business, the notion that landlords can leave empty retail space for years is mind-boggling,'' Mr. Chororos said.

HEADLINE: Cutting Off the Unemployed

 BODY:
It was bad enough when the Senate left town for a long Memorial Day break without passing a bill to extend expiring unemployment benefits. It's worse now. 
 Back in session for nearly three weeks, the Senate still has not acted. That means that 900,000 jobless workers have already lost their benefits, a number that will swell to an estimated 1.6 million people if an extension is not passed by the July Fourth holiday. Lost benefits -- the average check is $309 a week -- deprives struggling Americans of cash they need for buying food, paying the rent or mortgage and other essentials. 
 All indications are that when the Senate finally does pass a bill, it will be stingy and cynical -- hacking away at jobless benefits and fiscal aid to cash-strapped states, while preserving tax breaks for the wealthy and other well-connected political donors. 
 The problem, as always, is getting 60 votes to overcome hurdles imposed by the Republican minority. But Republicans aren't the only culprits here. 
 Passage was delayed last week as several Democratic senators -- including John Kerry of Massachusetts, Mark Warner of Virginia and Maria Cantwell of Washington -- worked to water down a provision in the bill that would have largely closed an unfair loophole that benefits rich fund managers in investment partnerships. Unfortunately, the senators seem to have won that fight. 
 This has led to even more maneuvering. Senator Olympia Snowe, a Republican of Maine, is now trying to eliminate another tax provision in the bill. The provision, which would raise roughly $9 billion over 10 years, would stop owners of some small corporations from overpaying themselves in profits and underpaying themselves in salary to lessen their payroll taxes. 
 At the same time, many lawmakers -- mostly Republicans, but not all -- are claiming that extending jobless benefits and aid to states is simply too costly. That may sound like good politics, but it is very bad economics. If the government fails to keep spending when the economy is weak, especially on core safety-net issues, it will only worsen unemployment and impede the chances of recovery. 
 Neither basic economics nor basic decency seems to matter. To win votes for passage, the Democratic leadership has agreed to drop the extra $25 a week that was added to unemployment benefits last year as part of the stimulus package. That would cut $6 billion from the roughly $40 billion it would cost to extend benefits through November. Senate leaders also are considering sizable cuts to the bill's proposed $24 billion aid package for the states. 
 It's unclear if even those cutbacks will be enough to win passage. What is clear is that unemployment is high, the safety net is frayed and the Senate has other priorities than helping struggling Americans.

HEADLINE: When Caution Carries Risk

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
 Ben Bernanke believes that he and his Federal Reserve colleagues have the ability to lift economic growth at their meeting this week. The Fed, he has said, ''retains considerable power to expand aggregate demand and economic activity, even when its accustomed policy rate is at zero,'' as it is today.
 Mr. Bernanke also believes that the economy is growing ''not fast enough,'' as he recently put it. He has predicted that unemployment will remain high for years and that ''a lot of people are going to be under financial stress.''
 Yet he has been unwilling to use his power to lift growth and reduce joblessness from near a 27-year high. Instead, Fed officials are expected to announce on Wednesday that they have left their policy unchanged, even if they acknowledge that the economy has recently weakened. 
 How can this be? How can Mr. Bernanke simultaneously think that growth is too slow and that it shouldn't be sped up? There is an answer -- whether or not you find it persuasive.
 Above all, top Fed officials are worried that financial markets are fragile. They are not so much worried about inflation, the traditional source of Fed angst, as they are about upsetting the markets' confidence in Washington. Yes, investors remain happy to lend the United States money at rock-bottom interest rates, despite our budget deficit and all of the emergency Fed programs that will eventually need to be unwound. But no one knows how long that confidence will last.
 In effect, Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues have decided to accept an all-but-certain downside -- high unemployment, for years to come -- rather than risk an even worse situation -- a market panic, a spike in long-term interest rates and yet higher unemployment. As the last few years have shown, market sentiment can change unexpectedly and sharply.
 Still, you have to wonder if the Fed is paying enough attention to the risks of its own approach. They do exist. The recent data on jobless claims, consumer spending and home sales have been weak. On Tuesday, Britain announced a budget-cutting plan that will depress short-term growth there and spill over somewhat into the global economy. The necessary budget cuts in Greece and other parts of Europe won't help global growth, either.
 The main historical lesson of financial crises is that governments are usually too passive. They respond in dribs and drabs, as Japan did in the 1990s and Europe did in 2008. Or they remove support too quickly, as Franklin Roosevelt did in 1937, and then the economy struggles to escape its funk.
 Look around at the American economy today. Unemployment is 9.7 percent. Inflation in recent months has been zero. States are cutting their budgets. Congress is balking at spending the money to prevent state layoffs. The Fed is standing pat, too. Bond investors, fickle as they may be, show no signs of panicking. 
 Which seems to be the greater risk: too much action or too little?
 The Fed's benchmark interest rate, which has been near zero since late 2008, determines the overnight rate at which banks lend one another money. The overnight bank rate, in turn, sets other short-term interest rates. But the benchmark rate has only an indirect effect on long-term rates. That's why the 30-year fixed mortgage rates can be near 5 percent while the Fed rate is zero.
 If Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues decided to take further action, their most likely move would be to bring down long-term rates. They could do so by buying the bonds that backed longer-term loans. With lower borrowing costs, households and businesses would probably spend more money. The Fed did precisely this during the financial crisis, and the drop in rates seemed to help spending. 
 Last week, the San Francisco Fed released a report analyzing interest rate policy since the crisis began. The report suggested that the effective benchmark rate -- taking into account both the zero percent short-term rate and the bond purchases -- was now roughly negative 2 percent. 
 The most notable part of the report, however, was what it showed the effective rate should be. Based on a formula that considers past Fed policy and current levels of unemployment and inflation, the effective rate today should be negative 5 percent. In layman's terms, the report was saying that the Fed was erring on the side of timidity.
 Mr. Bernanke and other Fed leaders do not quibble with these numbers. If anything, Mr. Bernanke has gone out of his way to distance himself from the presidents of some regional Fed banks who have begun publicly worrying that the Fed has pumped too much money into the economy and that inflation is about to rise. Mr. Bernanke has instead said inflation is subdued and pointed to surveys showing that economists expect it to remain so.
 His worry is a different one. 
 In a recent appearance before the House Budget Committee, he spoke repeatedly about market confidence. Specifically, he mentioned ''the potential loss of confidence in the markets'' if Congress did not come up with a plan for reducing the budget deficit. 
 There is a direct analogy between the budget deficit and the Fed's asset holdings. Neither is sustainable. Congress needs to demonstrate that it has a plan for reducing the deficit over the long haul so that investors will be confident enough to continue lending the United States money at low rates. 
 The Fed, meanwhile, has to show it has a strategy for selling the trillions of dollars of assets it bought during the crisis -- without damaging the value of private investors' holdings and without, at some point, igniting inflation. ''The more we buy,'' Donald Kohn, the Fed's vice chairman said last month, ''the more assets we will ultimately need to dispose of.'' The more the Fed buys, the greater the risk that it will find the point at which the market becomes unnerved.
 In the end, Mr. Bernanke's dilemma has no certain solution. Taking more aggressive action might have only a modest effect on spending, and nobody -- including the most passionate advocates for more government action -- can really know how long the bond markets will stay calm. The decision comes down to weighing the probabilities and the possible outcomes. 
 Let's just be clear about the risks and costs that the Fed has chosen. It is betting that, for once, policy makers are not underreacting to a financial crisis. And it is willing to accept a jobless rate of almost 10 percent, with all of the attendant human costs.
 ''About half of the unemployed have been unemployed for six months or more, which means that they are losing skills, they're losing contact with the job market,'' a prominent economist said at a public dinner in Washington this month. ''If things go on and they simply sit at home or work very irregularly, when the economy gets back to a more normal state, they're not going to be able to find good work.''
 That economist happened to be Ben Bernanke, one of the few people with the power to do something about the situation.

HEADLINE: Drilling Ban Blocked; U.S. Will Issue New Order

BYLINE: By CHARLIE SAVAGE; Jackie Calmes contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A federal judge in New Orleans on Tuesday blocked a six-month moratorium on deep-water drilling projects that the Obama administration imposed after the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The White House swiftly vowed to appeal the ruling. 
 In a 22-page opinion, the judge, Martin L. C. Feldman of United States District Court, issued a preliminary injunction against the enforcement of a late May order halting all offshore exploratory drilling in more than 500 feet of water. 
 Citing potential economic harm to businesses and workers, Judge Feldman wrote that the Obama administration had failed to justify the need for such ''a blanket, generic, indeed punitive, moratorium'' on deep-water oil and gas drilling.
 ''The blanket moratorium, with no parameters, seems to assume that because one rig failed and although no one yet fully knows why, all companies and rigs drilling new wells over 500 feet also universally present an imminent danger,'' wrote Judge Feldman, a 1983 appointee of President Ronald Reagan. The administration's order halted 33 exploratory drilling projects and suspended new permits, but did not affect platforms that were already in production. 
 In a statement on Tuesday evening, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said that within days he would issue a new order imposing a moratorium on deep-water drilling that would contain additional information showing why it was necessary.
 Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, said the administration ''will immediately appeal'' the judge's ruling to a federal appeals court in New Orleans. He said it made sense to suspend exploratory deep-water drilling until the completion of the investigation into the April 20 explosion at the Deepwater Horizon rig leased by BP and the still-flowing leak from the underwater well.
 President Obama ''strongly believes,'' Mr. Gibbs said, ''that continuing to drill at these depths without knowing what happened does not make any sense'' and would jeopardize ''the safety of those on the rigs and safety of the environment in the gulf.''
 The immediate impact of the ruling was not clear. A White House official said the administration would likely seek a stay pending its appeal. And the decision left room for the government to assemble a stronger record in support of suspending such operations.
 The ruling on Tuesday was the result of a lawsuit filed this month by a coalition of businesses that provide services and equipment to offshore drilling platforms. The coalition asked the judge to block the moratorium, arguing that there was no evidence that existing projects were unsafe. The state of Louisiana filed a brief supporting the lawsuit, arguing that the suspension would cause irrevocable harm to its economy.
 Judge Feldman agreed, noting that ''oil and gas production is quite simply elemental to gulf communities.'' He portrayed the Interior Department's record in support of the moratorium as inadequate and misleading, saying that a preliminary injunction was necessary because the suspension would likely be ruled ''arbitrary and capricious'' after a trial.
 ''Some of the plaintiffs' contracts have been affected; the court is persuaded that it is only a matter of time before more business and jobs and livelihoods will be lost,'' he wrote, adding, ''The effect on employment, jobs, loss of domestic energy supplies caused by the moratorium as the plaintiffs (and other suppliers, and the rigs themselves) lose business, and the movement of the rigs to other sites around the world will clearly ripple throughout the economy in this region.''
 Several groups critical of the ruling highlighted a financial disclosure form filed by Judge Feldman in May 2009. It showed that as recently as 2008, he owned stock in several energy-related firms -- including Transocean, which owned the Deepwater Horizon rig. 
 A coalition of environmental groups released a statement by Catherine Wannamaker, senior lawyer at the Southern Environmental Law Center, decrying the ruling as ''outrageous.''
 ''The tragic explosion, the unstopped gushing of oil, and resulting damage to fishing and tourism industries, cultures, wildlife and the whole Gulf Coast should be more than enough cause for pausing risky deep-water activities until safety and environmental protection is assured,'' she said. ''Unfortunately, today's court decision allows short-term profit for some to trump safety, lives and the environmental health of the Gulf Coast upon which so many depend.''
 Members of Congress issued warring statements over the ruling. Representative Darrell Issa, a California Republican, criticized the Obama administration's efforts to impose the moratorium as ''cold and irresponsible,'' saying it would put ''tens of thousands of jobs'' in danger because oil and gas companies could move their equipment elsewhere in the world.
 Representative Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, praised the ruling against the moratorium as ''welcome news for thousands of Louisiana welders, pipefitters, engineers and roustabouts whose jobs were threatened by a political decision.''
 But Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, pointed out that the moratorium did not apply to the vast majority of rigs because they are already in production. He criticized resuming deep-water exploratory drilling before new safety measures are established.
 ''This is another bad decision in a disaster riddled with bad decisions by the oil industry,'' Mr. Markey said. ''The only thing worse than one oil spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico would be two oil spill disasters. This judge's decision flies in the face of mounting evidence that there are serious safety risks that must be examined with these 33 deep-water rigs before they start drilling again.''

HEADLINE: About Those Premiums

 BODY:
President Obama told health insurers on Tuesday not to use health care reform as an excuse to raise the cost of premiums. The warning is timely. With critics still scare-mongering about the supposed cost of reform, insurers in several states have been seeking double-digit premium increases that look hard to justify as necessary to keep up with medical inflation. 
 The president acknowledged that there are a lot of factors driving up the cost of care. The health insurers have certainly perpetrated a lot of abuses over the years. But at least when it comes to who is responsible for relentlessly rising health care costs, that falls more on the hospitals, doctors and other providers who charge high prices and deliver more services than are medically necessary, and on the drug- and device-makers who push their most expensive products.
 Even so, it will be important to monitor insurance rate increases carefully. And the Obama administration must be prepared to push hard. Unfortunately, the reform law did not give the federal government the power to regulate premiums. It did provide some weaker tools to help keep insurance costs down: new rules requiring companies to publicly identify the reasons for unreasonable rate increases; new exchanges where insurers will have to compete for business; and a new office and grant program to help state regulators evaluate and contest proposed rate increases.
 The president also unveiled new regulations effective this year that should end some of the insurance companies' worst practices, such as rescinding policies for frivolous reasons after a person becomes sick; he thanked the industry for dropping this tactic earlier than required. He listed a number of other benefits that consumers will see soon, including a ban on lifetime coverage limits. 
 Mr. Obama vowed to defend the new law against Republican efforts to repeal or weaken it. He still needs to ignite strong popular support for reforms that could transform the American health care system. Requiring insurers to play fair is part of that effort.

HEADLINE: Obama Hopes to Expand Economic Ties With Russia, but Pitfalls Exist

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
In his quest to restore relations with Russia, President Obama focused first on security issues like disarmament and Iran. But with an arms control treaty signed and sanctions against Tehran approved, Mr. Obama hopes this week to open a new phase intended to build the robust economic relationship that has eluded his predecessors.
 At Mr. Obama's invitation, President Dmitri A. Medvedev traveled to the United States on Tuesday, stopping first in California to woo Silicon Valley technology companies to help build his own Russian center of innovation. On Thursday, the two presidents will meet at the White House to discuss expanding trade and investment.
 The focus on economic cooperation is intended to take the relationship between the two countries to a new level after years of mutual suspicion that peaked in 2008 during Russia's war with Georgia, its small neighbor to the south. ''We want to develop a multidimensional relationship with Russia,'' said Michael McFaul, Mr. Obama's top Russia adviser. ''This trip will build on the foundation of these core security interests.'' 
 If Mr. Obama can open up economic avenues, that could further the emerging partnership. ''I think of those mutually beneficial economic ties as ballast that could keep the overall relationship on an even keel even when adverse political winds threaten to blow us off course,'' said Edward S. Verona, president of the U.S.-Russia Business Council.
 Mr. Obama has already revived a civilian nuclear cooperation agreement that could be lucrative to Russia, and he will have what Mr. McFaul called ''a pretty serious discussion'' with Mr. Medvedev about how to secure Russian membership in the World Trade Organization after 17 years of talks. Russia is by far the largest economy outside the 153-nation organization, which sets rules for international trade, and Mr. Medvedev expressed frustration that ''we have been led around by the nose for a long time,'' as he told The Wall Street Journal last week.
 ''An agreement between the two presidents on Russia's W.T.O. accession could take away the remaining hurdles,'' said Anders Aslund, a Russia specialist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. ''It would be a game changer for Russia's domestic development, rendering the economy more open and competitive, while integrating Russia more firmly in the international community.''
 But expanding economic relations may prove harder than negotiating an arms treaty. Since the end of the cold war, every American president has talked about forging closer trade and investment ties with Russia, but with limited success. The United States did only $24 billion in trade with Russia last year -- double the figure of just a few years ago, but still less than trade with Brazil, Taiwan or South Korea and a small fraction of the $366 billion in trade with China last year.
 One reason is the lack of a genuine rule of law in Russia. Foreign companies and investors have found themselves subject to capricious or even corrupt decisions by the Russian government and politically connected moguls with little real recourse in a judicial system that still defers to the Kremlin or local authorities.
 Take the cases of three men as examples:
 Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, once Russia's richest man and its most successful capitalist, was in talks to sell a stake in his oil company to Exxon Mobil or ChevronTexaco when he was arrested in a political dispute with the Kremlin in 2003. He has been behind bars ever since and is on trial again in Moscow on what independent analysts consider trumped-up charges.
 William F. Browder, once the largest foreign portfolio investor in Moscow, was denied entry to the country in 2005 and had his companies used in what he says was a huge fraud scheme. A lawyer he had hired, Sergei Magnitsky, was arrested and died in prison last year when the authorities withheld medical treatment.
 Robert Dudley was chief executive of BP's joint venture with Russian oil moguls, called TNK-BP, until a fight over control of the company led to problems renewing his visa and ultimately forced him out of the country in 2008. He is now managing BP's response to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
 Mr. Browder is now waging a campaign warning American businesses away from Russia, briefing corporate lawyers for companies that Mr. Medvedev will visit and the staffs of several California lawmakers.
 ''Medvedev is on a trip to attract U.S. technology companies to come to Russia and saying many nice things about the rule of law and modernization, when, in fact, the difference between his words and reality could not be more stark,'' Mr. Browder said. ''My advice to U.S. technology companies is to steer clear of Russia because it's insanity to go there. They not only will risk their money, but also the lives of their employees.''
 Others argue that American investment only props up the current authoritarian system.
 ''Western capital helps to support the status quo,'' said Lilia Shevtsova, an analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Center. ''It injects financial and technological Viagra to the existing system. Western capital could become an engine of modernization only under new rules of the game -- that is, when Russia moves toward real competition and rule of law.''
 Toby Gati, a strategic adviser to companies working in Russia, was more optimistic. ''We have the beginnings of a new mind-set on both sides, with the Russians now developing a stake in working with the U.S. for mainly economic reasons,'' said Ms. Gati, who works for the law firm Akin Gump. 
 But to make it work, she said, Moscow needs to guarantee property rights and rule of law: ''These are things Medvedev has spoken about, to his credit,'' she said, ''but so far he has done little to make them happen.''
 Mr. Medvedev is arguing that Russia is open for business. He met with American business leaders in St. Petersburg last week and agreed to have dinner in San Francisco on Tuesday night with Silicon Valley pioneers invited by former Secretary of State George P. Shultz. On Wednesday, he will visit Silicon Valley to draw investment and inspiration for a Russian version in the Moscow suburb of Skolkovo.
 Among the supporters of his initiative is Eric E. Schmidt, chief executive of Google, who said he thought greater technology cooperation would force changes in Russia's business environment.
 ''My personal view,'' Mr. Schmidt said in an e-mail message, ''is that the presence of such technical companies, especially with foreign partnerships, are a great way to get the openness, transparency and societal change needed for the Russians to continue their development into a modern first-world government. Their presence in Russia will help pressure the incumbents who fear change and will also clearly benefit the citizens over all.''

HEADLINE: Banks Have Repaid 75% Of Bailout, Geithner Says

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, said on Tuesday that taxpayers were recovering their investment from the financial bailouts as the program was wound down. But he acknowledged there would probably be a loss from the rescue of the insurer American International Group. 
 Mr. Geithner told a watchdog panel that banks had repaid about 75 percent of the bailout money they received, and the government's investments in those banks had brought taxpayers $21 billion.
 Mr. Geithner also said at a hearing of the Congressional Oversight Panel that the auto industry had made significant structural changes, and that the chances that General Motors and Chrysler would repay their bailout money had improved.
 The oversight panel was created by Congress to oversee the Treasury Department's $700 billion financial bailout program, created at the height of the financial crisis in the fall of 2008. The panel has been critical of the program, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP.
 TARP ''has helped restore financial stability at a much lower cost than anticipated,'' Mr. Geithner said in his testimony. 
 The panel's chairwoman, Elizabeth Warren, said that with the program's Oct. 3 expiration approaching, ''this panel must know whether Treasury has carefully monitored the financial system to measure potential risks.''
 She criticized the department for not conducting additional stress tests of the financial system, as was done with the 19 biggest banks.
 Panel members also criticized the Obama administration's flagship effort to help people in danger of losing their homes, which is falling flat, according to numbers released Monday. More than a third of the 1.24 million borrowers who have enrolled in the $75 billion mortgage modification program have dropped out.
 Richard Neiman, an oversight panel member who is New York's top banking regulator, said many families that relied on the government's program to keep their homes ''may be left out in the cold.'' He asked Mr. Geithner why thousands of mortgage modifications had been canceled.
 Mr. Geithner said the homeowners involved had been unable to prove income and therefore their eligibility for the program. 
 Mr. Geithner said A.I.G. was making progress in restructuring its operations and divesting businesses so that taxpayers could recoup their investment. However, he added, the government's investment ''will likely still result in some loss.'' The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that taxpayers will lose $36 billion. Much of the money needed to repay the government will come from the sale of assets.

HEADLINE: For Jeb Bush, Life at Ease Out of Office (for Now), Defending Family Name

BYLINE: By MATT BAI

 BODY:
CORAL GABLES, Fla. -- For months now, Jeb Bush has been listening as President Obama blasts his older brother's administration for the battered economy, budget deficits and even the lax oversight of oil wells.
 ''It's kind of like a kid coming to school saying, 'The dog ate my homework,' '' Mr. Bush, this state's former governor, said over lunch last week at the Biltmore Hotel. ''It's childish. This is what children do until they mature. They don't accept responsibility.''
 In fact, instead of constantly bashing the 43rd president, Mr. Bush offered, perhaps Mr. Obama could learn something from him, especially when it comes to ignoring the Washington chatter. ''This would break his heart, to get advice that applies some of the lessons of leadership my brother learned, because he apparently likes to act like he's still campaigning, and he likes to blame George's administration for everything,'' Mr. Bush said, dangling a ketchup-soaked French fry. ''But he really seems like he's getting caught up in what people are writing about him.''
 ''I mean, good God, man, read a book!'' Mr. Bush said with a laugh. ''Go watch ESPN!'' 
 At 57, Jeb Bush remains an intriguing figure inside his fractious party. At a moment when Republicans are groping for an agenda beyond opposition, Mr. Bush has long been considered one of the party's true idea guys, someone a lot of party insiders think could still be a serious presidential contender.
 But Mr. Bush, the son and brother of presidents, occupies just as intriguing a place within his own family. American presidents have traditionally felt themselves duty-bound not to criticize their successors (no matter what their successors may say about them), which means that Jeb is the only Bush in public life who can defend the family name.
 ''George isn't going to break that,'' Mr. Bush said, meaning the ex-presidents' code, ''and if he was asked to serve in some way, he would do it, in spite of all the 'it's Bush's fault.' That's just the kind of guy he is.''
 Often depicted as the most mercurial and bookish of the Bushes, Jeb, who now runs his own consulting firm, seems at ease out of public office. He wore a loose-fitting guayabera, rather than a suit, and responded to questions amiably, with little hint of the prickliness that has sometime marked his interactions with reporters.
 Mr. Bush said he met Mr. Obama in 2009 when he accompanied his father, George Bush, to the White House a few weeks after the inauguration. ''He was extraordinarily kind and gentle to my dad, which I love,'' Mr. Bush said. 
 He gives Mr. Obama credit for trying to spur innovation in public schools, a policy area about which Mr. Bush is passionate, but his admiration ends there.
 ''By and large, I think the president, instead of being a 21st-century leader, is Hubert Humphrey on steroids,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I don't think there's much newness in spending more money as the solution to every problem.'' 
 Though he headlines the occasional fund-raiser around the country, Mr. Bush has exercized his political influence this year largely out of the public view. He has been deeply involved as an informal adviser to the party's candidates for governor, whom he sees as the most likely sources of new Republican policy ideas. ''It doesn't seem like it's going to be happening in Washington anytime soon,'' Mr. Bush dryly observed.
 No matter what happens in November's midterm elections, Republicans will have to make a difficult calibration as they head into the presidential season. The party needs a messenger who can keep its Tea Party-type activists energized behind an agenda and a nominee. But Republicans will also be looking for someone who can reposition the party nationally and make its more strident ideology palatable to the wider American electorate.
 This explains why some influential Republicans persist in believing that Mr. Bush might still make a strong candidate in 2012. He is a favorite of the anti-establishment crowd (he is said to have mentored Marco Rubio, the Senate challenger in Florida who gave the Tea Partiers a national lift), but he is also a political celebrity with a pronounced independent streak. As governor, for instance, Mr. Bush strongly opposed drilling in the shallow waters off Florida, and he favors increasing legal immigration, rather than restricting it. 
 Mr. Bush says he has no interest in running, because he wants to make money for his family, but his political allies seem to read a ''for now'' into such statements. ''Every presidential wanna-be and every member of the House and Senate I talk to, if you ask them who is a difference-maker in our party, they will tell you Jeb Bush,'' said Al Cardenas, the former party chairman in Florida.
 Washington wisdom -- such as it is -- holds that the real impediment to Mr. Bush's political future would be the Bush brand, which has taken a pounding both inside the party and out. Neither George W. Bush nor his father ranks among the more successful presidents of our time, to put it politely. 
 Jeb Bush's admirers insist, however, that whatever cloud existed over the name is lifting, as memories of the last Bush era recede, replaced by a hardened conservative opposition to Mr. Obama's policies. And those who know Mr. Bush say he has never concerned himself with it. ''He's the guy who cares about that the least,'' said Nicholas Ayers, executive director of the Republican Governors Association.
 In fact, talking to Mr. Bush, one senses that the problem for him as a future candidate might not be the efficacy of the Bush brand, but rather what he might need to do in order to transcend it. George W. Bush ran successfully for president in part by putting some distance between himself and his father, signaling to the Republican base that he was more a Reagan conservative than he was a ''read my lips'' pragmatist.
 It is harder to imagine Jeb Bush, the fierce defender of his family, ever publicly acknowledging his brother's failures in a way that would enable him to come across as a different, more capable kind of Bush. When I asked him whether Mr. Obama had a legitimate point -- whether his brother's administration did, in fact, bear responsibility for the country's economic collapse -- Mr. Bush paused and, for the only time in our interview, appeared to carefully assemble his words.
 ''Look, I think there was a whole series of decisions made over a long period of time, the cumulative effect of which created the financial meltdown that has created the hardship that we're facing,'' he said slowly. ''Congress, the administration, everyone can accept some responsibility.'' 
 ''The issue to me is what we do now,'' Jeb Bush said. ''Who cares who's to blame?''

HEADLINE: JPMorgan Sets Sights Overseas

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
JPMorgan Chase emerged from the financial crisis as one of the strongest banks on American soil. Now it wants to make up lost ground overseas. 
 The bank's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, announced a series of management changes toward that end on Tuesday, appointing one of his closest lieutenants to a new position with a mandate to start a global corporate banking business and scout out opportunities in Europe, Latin America and Asia.
 The executive, Heidi G. Miller, was named president of the bank's international operations and chairwoman of a new global advisory committee made up of about a dozen senior bankers and regional business heads. The new role should further cement Ms. Miller's standing as one of the most powerful women on Wall Street. 
 Ms. Miller's appointment set off other changes to the bank's organizational chart. Michael J. Cavanagh, JPMorgan's chief financial officer, will take over for Ms. Miller as head of the bank's Treasury and Securities division, which focuses on back-office recordkeeping and securities lending for big institutional investors like hedge funds and pension funds.
 Douglas L. Braunstein, 49, the head of investment banking for the Americas, will succeed Mr. Cavanagh, 44. Mr. Braunstein's successor has not been named.
 Mr. Dimon, 54, said in a brief telephone interview on Tuesday that he had been contemplating the changes for several months, with an eye toward developing a roster of younger managers that could someday succeed him. 
 Although James E. Staley, 53, head of JPMorgan's investment bank, is widely believed to be Mr. Dimon's most likely successor, Mr. Cavanagh's star rocketed during the financial crisis, when he helped engineer the acquisitions of Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual and steer the bank through months of turbulent markets. Since then, the bank's performance and stock price have stood out among its peers.
 Mary Erdoes, 42, who runs JPMorgan's asset management division, and Charles W. Scharf, 45, the head of its retail operations, are also viewed as potential candidates down the road. 
 At the same time, Mr. Dimon has made expanding overseas a priority. JPMorgan Chase gets about a quarter of its revenue from international operations and has few retail branches outside the United States. Even its global investment banking and treasury services businesses focus mainly on Western Europe.
 Other big banks, like HSBC and Standard Chartered, have much stronger toeholds in emerging markets. Citigroup, where Mr. Dimon and Ms. Miller rose through the ranks together, derives nearly 60 percent of its revenue from overseas and has had retail operations in China and India for decades. 
 With growth trends tilting toward the emerging markets and the prospect of tighter regulation from Washington, Mr. Dimon sees untapped opportunity. Analysts project that the growth rate of banking will be two to three times faster in emerging markets than the United States. 
 ''We have got to invest locally, look at clients globally and look at new markets,'' he said in the interview. ''We are going to get the whole company behind it.'' 
 Mr. Dimon, who spent the last two weeks hopscotching across China, India and Russia, had been laying the groundwork for international expansion for some time. A few years ago, he assigned two top lieutenants to scout out potential consumer banking opportunities overseas. He created a network of global advisers, including Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, and established a partnership with a buyout firm started by several former Citigroup colleagues to hunt for overseas acquisitions. 
 The global credit crisis postponed those plans. But at a meeting of the bank's top executives on Sea Island, Ga., last summer, Mr. Dimon committed to spending billions of dollars in the coming years to bolster the bank's overseas business. The bank plans to focus on a dozen or so emerging markets, Mr. Dimon said, including the so-called BRIC countries, Brazil, Russia, India and China, as well as places like Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and parts of Africa.
 Mr. Dimon has already made a handful of deals to add to the bank's international portfolio. Earlier this year, it bought a commodities trading unit from the Royal Bank of Scotland. It plans to buy Gavea Investments, a Brazilian asset management firm. And last week, it announced an investment banking joint venture with First Capital Securities of China. 
 But the centerpiece of his immediate strategy is to create a global corporate bank that can serve multinational clients. Mr. Dimon said he hoped to assign global corporate banking responsibilities to employees in the investment banking and treasury services units, with Ms. Miller in charge of forging cooperation among business lines and regions. 
 ''If she comes up with a great plan, we will put a lot of money behind that,'' Mr. Dimon said. 
 The global bank has a loose structure for its 400 employees, with spaghettilike reporting lines that some senior executives privately say could pose significant challenges. Mr. Dimon says he worries about that, too, but has concluded that having an overarching head of international operations would lead to more accountability. ''The intent of this is to get less bureaucracy,'' he said. 
 The new role for Ms. Miller, who has a doctorate in Latin American studies, puts her in charge of a far smaller business than the treasury services unit, but one that could influence the bank's long-term prospects. 
 A longtime member of Mr. Dimon's inner circle since she served as chief financial officer of Citigroup while he was president, Ms. Miller joined him again to help turn around Bank One, which would later merge with JPMorgan. (She had an eight-month stint as Priceline.com's financial chief during the height of the dot-com boom in 2000.) 
 Mr. Cavanagh, meanwhile, had been angling to run one of the bank's major businesses even before the crisis. Mr. Dimon pressed him to stay on as financial chief. Many see his job move as part of Mr. Dimon's strategy of grooming well-rounded managers. 
 ''I always thought it makes sense to have corporate and line-of-business experience,'' Mr. Dimon said. ''It just gives you a better understanding of the firm.''

HEADLINE: Shares Slide on Weakness in Energy

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Stock prices fell sharply on Tuesday on renewed worries about the housing market and weakness in energy shares after the Obama administration said it would appeal a ruling by a federal judge blocking a moratorium on deep-water drilling.
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 148.89 points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 10,293.52. Almost all the components of the Dow closed lower. 
 Among the broader averages, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was off 17.89 points, or 1.6 percent, at 1,095.31, while the Nasdaq composite index closed 27.29 points, or 1.2 percent, lower at 2,261.80. 
 Sales of existing homes fell 2 percent in May to 5.66 million units, partly because of mortgage application delays, according to the National Association of Realtors. That was lower than the 6.12 million estimated.
 Mark D. Luschini, chief investment strategist of Janney Montgomery Scott, said stocks in sectors heavily dependent on consumer spending tumbled after the housing report. Trading volumes were relatively light, he said, which could have added to the sharpness of the declines.
 ''Housing prices are front and center,'' he said. ''Investors are interested in locking in gains already in portfolios.'' 
 Mr. Luschini said oil service, drilling and exploration companies rallied after United States District Judge Martin Feldman in New Orleans ruled to lift a moratorium on deep-water drilling projects. 
 But those stocks swiftly fell after the Obama administration's announcement that it would appeal.
 ''The stalemate took investors back to the sidelines for that space,'' Mr. Luschini said.
 Exxon Mobil fell $1.19, or 1.9 percent, to $61.94; Sunoco dropped 44 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $34.54, while Transocean lost $1.42, or 2.6 percent, to close at $52.49.
 Oil prices fell 61 cents to settle at $77.21 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 The focus of investors for the remainder of the week is likely to be on economic data, like the report on new home sales to be released on Wednesday, as well as on the start of the quarterly corporate earnings season and the Federal Reserve meeting that started on Tuesday. 
 International events like movements in China's currency and the European debt crisis will also continue to weigh heavily on the market, analysts said. 
 China's position, announced over the weekend, that it would allow its currency to fluctuate against the dollar breathed some life into the market on Monday, but the impetus has since tapered off. Analysts said that it was unlikely that China would allow its currency to move in any significant way. 
 ''I think people are settling down in terms of their views on this,'' said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist for IHS Global Insight. ''They are going to move very gradually. The Chinese value stability above a lot of things, so they are not going to do anything that will create volatility.''
 ''I think the markets are calmer,'' Mr. Behravesh added. ''There are still some problems out there, the euro situation being one.''
 One of Europe's biggest banks, BNP Paribas, was downgraded a notch by Fitch Ratings late Monday, to AA. But Fitch said the outlook was stable.
 The euro fell to $1.2268 against the dollar, from $1.2324 on Monday.
 The Treasury's 10-year note rose 11/32, to 102 26/32. The yield fell to 3.17 percent, from 3.24 percent late Monday.

HEADLINE: State Budget Talks Stuck Over University Proposal

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
ALBANY -- State budget negotiations have further stalled over whether the Assembly will accept Gov. David A. Paterson's proposal to overhaul the state's public university system, according to executive and legislative officials involved in the discussions.
 Mr. Paterson included the higher education overhaul -- which, among other provisions, would allow the State University of New York and City University of New York systems to control their own tuition dollars without legislative approval -- in his original budget proposal. 
 In recent weeks, he has persuaded Senate Democrats to agree to it as part of a final budget deal. But the overhaul remains fiercely resisted by Democrats in the Assembly, who say it would lead inexorably to unbearable tuition increases for students.
 ''The governor is now saying, 'SUNY is what I absolutely, positively need to close down the budget,' '' said one legislative official involved in the discussions, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations between Mr. Paterson and his counterparts in the Legislature.
 The demand has frustrated Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, and John L. Sampson, the Senate Democratic leader, the official said, because they believe the state's budget gap can be closed without resolving the higher education issue. And with the budget now nearly three months late, Mr. Paterson has threatened to force the Legislature's hand on Monday by inserting the rest of his budget, including the higher education proposal, into an emergency bill that lawmakers must pass or risk shutting down the government.
 ''I am not inside their brains; I don't know what they take seriously and what they don't,'' Mr. Paterson said after a meeting with Mr. Silver and Mr. Sampson. ''I think there's a lot of fantasy around here about what's going to happen. But I'll tell you what: When we get to next Monday, we'll see who's telling the truth.''
 The Assembly is balking at deep cuts in school aid, a major portion of the budget that Mr. Paterson wants to reduce by more than $1 billion. The Assembly wishes to restore about $400 million of that amount, a deal the Senate has signaled it would accept if provisions were made for suburban school districts to use some of that money to reduce property tax bills. But Mr. Paterson is unwilling to restore any of those school cuts unless the Assembly agrees to his higher education plan, officials said.
 The governor and his aides view the plan as necessary to make the state university system competitive with those in states like California -- and as a potential legacy for the governor, who is not running for election this year.
 The core of Mr. Paterson's proposal would allow SUNY and CUNY institutions to set their own tuition rates under a cap, eliminating the veto that the Legislature effectively wields. Administration officials said they were hoping to avoid a pattern over the last three decades in which tuition remained flat for years but increased sharply during economic downturns, frustrating long-term planning and unfairly penalizing students who happened to enroll during years with increases. 
 Under the proposal, increases at most public schools would be capped and linked to an index known as the Higher Education Price Index, which typically rises faster than inflation. According to statistics provided by the Paterson administration, had that system been in place at those schools for the last 30 years, tuition growth there would have been about the same on an annual basis. 
 Mr. Paterson's proposal would also allow elite public institutions, like the state university at Stony Brook and Hunter College in New York City, to rise at a higher multiple, in effect creating a two-tiered system. Administration officials believe that the proposal, under which tuition would rise to a maximum of $10,741 over the next decade, would give the state's research institutions the resources they need to compete against other top-tier public universities. 
 But Assembly lawmakers are wary of giving up their leverage to hold down tuition increases without any guarantee that the state would maintain other subsidies to the system, which are typically cut whenever tuition is allowed to increase. They are also worried that New York's financial aid system for college students -- known as the Tuition Assistance Program and among the most generous in the country -- would not keep pace with future increases, pricing out less-wealthy students or relegating them to less expensive schools or programs.
 ''The reality is, there is a state interest in having a level playing field,'' said Deborah J. Glick, chairwoman of the Assembly's higher education committee. ''And elected representatives should have a role in setting tuition.''

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Oversight: A View From Capitol Hill

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The case for allowing the Securities and Exchange Commission to self-finance is not quite so simple as your June 16 editorial ''Reviving Investor Protection'' would make it seem. 
 The S.E.C. was asleep at the switch in the period before the financial crisis, and the resulting outrage at its failed regulation of the financial sector is well placed. The root cause of this failure was the Bush administration's philosophy that industries should regulate themselves.
 Financing was an issue in those years, too: S.E.C. staff shrunk by 14 percent from 2005 to 2007. But in the years since I became chairman of the appropriations subcommittee overseeing the S.E.C. budget in 2007, we have fully restored staffing and provided more financing than the agency requested. Through the yearly appropriations process we are obligated to review and set its budget, and we take that role very seriously. This is not a turf issue, but an oversight issue.
 The anti-regulatory attitude at the S.E.C. that occurred in the past -- and could occur in the future -- cannot be corrected through removing yearly Congressional oversight by the appropriations committees.
 Frankly, I believe that the message that allowing self-financing would send to this agency is fundamentally wrong. It would tell it ''you didn't do your job'' and as a result, ''we will be giving you less oversight rather than more.'' That is the wrong message to send to the S.E.C., investors and the markets.
 Jose E. Serrano Washington, June 16, 2010
 The writer is chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government.

HEADLINE: Obama Says Health Law Shouldn't Be Excuse to Raise Rates

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK and SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Reed Abelson contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama, whose vilification of insurers helped push a landmark health care overhaul through Congress, warned industry executives at the White House on Tuesday not to use the bill ''as an opportunity to enact unjustifiable rate increases that don't boost care and inflate their bottom line.''
 Mr. Obama made his remarks in the East Room of the White House after a private meeting with executives of leading health insurance companies and with state insurance commissioners who regulate them. As the new law is being implemented, the White House wanted to issue a pointed reminder to insurers -- and the public -- that the president intends to monitor the industry's behavior.
 ''There are genuine cost drivers that are not caused by insurance companies,'' Mr. Obama said. ''But what is also true is that we've got to make sure that this new law is not being used as an excuse to simply drive up costs.'' 
 Mr. Obama convened the White House session mark the 90th day (Tuesday was actually the 91st) since he signed the health bill into law. He also used the occasion to unveil what his administration is calling ''a new Patient's Bill of Rights'' -- a set of regulations governing how the industry implements some of the most consumer-friendly provisions of the health care bill.
 The rules, which take effect Sept. 23, prevent insurers from refusing to cover children with pre-existing conditions; impose strict limits on insurers' ability to cap coverage during any given year; end lifetime coverage caps; and end the practice known as rescission, in which companies, citing minor paperwork mistakes, cancel coverage for people who get sick. 
 Under the new regulations, companies will be prohibited from rescinding coverage except in cases involving fraud or intentional misrepresentation of facts. 
 The White House is concerned that health insurers will blame the new law for increases in premiums that are intended to maximize profits rather than cover claims. The administration is also closely watching investigations by a number of states into the actuarial soundness of double-digit rate increases.
 ''Our message to them is to work with this law, not against it; don't try and take advantage of it or we will work with state authorities and gather the authority we have to stop rate gouging,'' David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's senior adviser, said in an interview. ''Our concern is that they not try and, under the cover of the act, get in under the wire here on rate increases.''
 The law does not grant the federal government new authority to regulate health care premiums, which remains the province of state insurance departments. But with important provisions taking effect this summer and fall, the Obama administration has repeatedly reminded insurers -- and the public -- that it will expose industry pricing to what the health secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, has called a ''bright spotlight.''
 The White House meeting follows the release on Monday of a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health policy research group, finding that premiums for the policies most recently bought by individuals had increased by an average of 20 percent.
 ''The survey shows that the steep increases we have been reading about over the last several months are not just extreme cases,'' said Drew Altman, the foundation's president.
 Mr. Obama's message to insurers puts the industry on notice and positions the White House politically in case voters start to link premium increases to the new law. With the law expected to play a significant role in the midterm elections, the president has been using his platform to sell the bill's most immediate benefits and, by extension, to defend Democrats in Congress who risked their careers to vote for it.
 The insurers have attributed this year's increases to skyrocketing medical costs and to the economic downturn, which has prompted healthier consumers to forgo health insurance, leaving a sicker and costlier pool to cover.
 ''Our companies are receiving rate increase requests from hospitals across the country of 40, 50 and 60 percent,'' said Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans, a trade group. ''That has a direct impact on the cost of health care coverage.''
 But a report released Monday by Health Care for America Now, a coalition that supports the new law, stressed that the growth in premiums in the first eight years of this decade had far exceeded medical inflation -- 97 percent to 39 percent.
 The new law requires the health secretary to work with states to establish a process for annual reviews of ''unreasonable increases in premiums.'' Administration officials said Monday that they were still writing regulations to define ''unreasonable increases.''
 Mr. Obama's approach to the health insurance industry has rarely been subtle, starting with his campaign, when he spoke of his dying mother's struggle to persuade her insurer to cover her cancer treatments.
 In March, with his health bill hanging by a thread in Congress, Mr. Obama ducked into a White House meeting with insurance executives to deliver a letter from an Ohio cancer survivor who had dropped her coverage after learning her premiums were rising 40 percent.
 But for all of Mr. Obama's browbeating, the new health care law stopped short of giving the administration the power to reject or limit rate increases. Instead, it established the annual reviews, starting next year, and makes available $250 million in grants to states to implement the review process.
 States that accept the grants must recommend whether insurers with patterns of excessive pricing should be allowed to market policies through newly created exchanges, which will help individuals and businesses shop for coverage starting in 2014. Insurers also will be required to justify increases deemed unreasonable on their Web sites.
 In the closing weeks of the health care debate, the White House offered a proposal to give the health secretary authority to deny unreasonable increases. It did not make it into the final legislation, but Senate Democrats have reintroduced it as a standalone bill.
 The regulatory clout of state insurance departments varies widely, with some having minimal power to block rate increases. But in recent months, several states have taken unusually assertive steps.
 In California, state regulators announced that they would order independent reviews of increases being sought by four large health insurers. That move came after the department discovered miscalculations in rate requests by Anthem Blue Cross, prompting the company to withdraw its plan to raise premiums by as much as 39 percent.
 In Massachusetts, the administration of Gov. Deval Patrick, a Democrat, used long-untapped power to deny 9 of 10 rate increases requested by the state's insurers, provoking a lawsuit from the industry. A court in Maine recently upheld a smaller rate increase for that state's largest insurer -- 10.9 percent instead of 18.1 percent -- that had been ordered by the insurance superintendent.
 In New York, Gov. David A. Paterson, a Democrat, signed legislation this month giving the state power to block unreasonable rates. And in Pennsylvania, Gov. Edward G. Rendell, also a Democrat, announced two weeks ago that his insurance commissioner, Joel Ario, would investigate large increases by the state's biggest insurers.
 ''The plans are cherry-picking the best risk,'' Mr. Ario, who will attend the White House session, said in an interview.
 The federal law, which will require that most Americans obtain insurance, includes a number of provisions intended to slow the growth of premiums. For instance, insurance companies soon will have to spend at least 80 percent of revenue from premiums on claims, as opposed to administration and profit.
 Insurers have warned since early in the debate that the overhaul might result in increased premiums for many consumers. The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found otherwise, projecting that it would have minimal effect on group premiums, which account for 83 percent of the market. Their analysis forecast that premiums for individual policies would rise faster than they would without the new law, but that the increases would largely be offset by government subsidies.
 Whatever the law's ultimate effect, many of this year's most egregious rate increases were announced well before it was clear the bill would pass.

HEADLINE: General's Job Is in Doubt In Exposing Afghan Rifts

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER, THOM SHANKER and DEXTER FILKINS; Helene Cooper and Thom Shanker reported from Washington, and Dexter Filkins from Kabul, Afghanistan. Mark Landler contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama's top commander in Afghanistan flew to Washington on Tuesday to find out whether he would be fired for remarks he and members of his staff made that were contemptuous of senior administration officials, laying bare the disarray and enmity in a foreign-policy team that is struggling with the war.
In an article in Rolling Stone magazine, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal and his aides spoke critically of nearly every member of the president's national security team, including President Obama, and dismissing Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as ''Bite Me.'' 
 The firestorm was fueled by increasing doubts -- even in the military -- that Afghanistan can be won and by crumbling public support for the nine-year war as American casualties rise. 
 The criticism of General McChrystal's statements was swift, and the general had apologized and prepared a letter of resignation, though President Obama had not made up his mind whether to accept it when they meet on Wednesday morning.
 ''I think it's clear that the article in which he and his team appeared showed poor judgment,'' Mr. Obama said after a cabinet meeting. ''But I also want to make sure I talk to him directly before I make final judgment.''
 Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, the general's biggest supporter, released a statement criticizing General McChrystal for ''a significant mistake'' while Adm. Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was described by a senior aide as ''deeply disappointed'' by the comments.
 Whether or not General McChrystal remains at the helm of the Afghan war effort, Mr. Obama will try to use Wednesday's meeting to urge his fractious Afghanistan staff to pull together, said his press secretary, Robert Gibbs. The president, Mr. Gibbs said, will say that ''it is time for everyone involved to put away their petty disagreements, put aside egos and get to the job at hand.''
 But that may be easier said than done. At a time when violence in Afghanistan is sharply rising and several central planks of the president's strategy to ''disrupt, dismantle and defeat'' the Taliban and Al Qaeda have stalled, many of the president's top advisers have continued to criticize one another to reporters and international allies alike, usually in private conversations, and almost always off the record.
 ''Yes, we do hear them disparage each other,'' said a senior European diplomat who works closely with the United States on Afghanistan strategy. ''It's never good to hear that.''
 Bruce O. Riedel, a senior fellow at Brookings Institution who helped the administration formulate its initial Afghan policy, added, ''This flap shows once again that his team is not pulling together, but is engaging in backbiting.''
 The many Afghanistan team conflicts include complaints from the American ambassador, Karl W. Eikenberry, about Richard C. Holbrooke, the special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, who has been portrayed by some as disruptive and whose relationship with President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan chilled last year after difficult meetings following the August election. For his part, Ambassador Eikenberry has had his own tensions with the mercurial Mr. Karzai.
 In one episode that dramatized the building animosities, Gen. James L. Jones, the national security adviser, wrote to Ambassador Eikenberry in February, sympathizing with his complaints about a visit Mr. Holbrooke had recently made to Afghanistan. In the note, which went out over unsecure channels, officials said, General Jones soothed the ambassador by suggesting that Mr. Holbrooke would soon be removed from his job.
 The Jones note prompted Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton to complain to Mr. Obama, and her support for Mr. Holbrooke has kept him in his job. In the article, which was posted on the magazine's Web site on Tuesday, one of General McChrystal's aides is quoted as referring to General Jones as a ''clown.''
 The infighting has been made more severe by the increasingly perilous situation on the ground. Violence in Afghanistan is on the rise. The mission to pacify Marja and Kandahar is far off track. And the effort to create a viable Afghan government is increasingly in doubt because of widespread corruption. Criticism is mounting on Capitol Hill, even among the president's backers, and many allies have announced that they are looking for the exit, with others expected to do the same in the coming months.
 As the administration struggles to manage its relationship with Mr. Karzai, General McChrystal has proved to be the one American official most able to successfully deal with him on a daily basis. Beyond that, Mr. Obama's war strategy is in many ways a McChrystal strategy. The general devised the plan, which called for thousands of extra troops to fight the insurgency and, perhaps more important, create a sense of security for the Afghan people.
 There has been vigorous debate within the administration about how to proceed in Afghanistan, but General McChrystal and his aides did not overtly criticize administration policy.
 Rather, the differences were personal, and publicly aired. One administration official described Mr. Obama as being particularly furious at a McChrystal aide's characterization of him as not seeming ''very engaged'' during their first White House meeting.
 Over all, the magazine article depicted General McChrystal at the head of a small circle of aides engaged in almost locker-room trash talk as they discussed foreign policy, the French, their allegiance to each other and their own concerns about course of the war. The civilian communications adviser who set up the interview, Duncan Boothby, has resigned.
 Even though many advisers fear changing commanders at this stage of the war, there was speculation at the Pentagon and the White House about who could replace General McChrystal.
 Potential successors were thought to include Lt. Gen. David M. Rodriguez, commander of the NATO military corps headquarters in Kabul, which manages the day-to-day fight in Afghanistan. General Rodriguez is a confidant of General McChrystal and previously served as a senior military assistant to Mr. Gates. Another possibility is Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, in charge of the Army's Training and Doctrine Command, who has extensive experience in the Islamic world.
 Another potential successor is Gen. James N. Mattis of the Marine Corps, currently commander of the military's Joint Forces Command. General Mattis is a respected war-fighter with experience in counterinsurgency missions. Some have even suggested Gen. David H. Petraeus, who leads the United States Central Command and General McChrystal's boss and mentor, could take over the Afghan mission himself.
 As the president considers his options, he must also face his own struggles with the military. By all accounts, he felt that his commanders tried to manipulate him into going along with their Afghan strategy, through leaks to the press and public comments.
 The military leadership, meanwhile, continues to be frustrated by what it sees as an unrealistic deadline for completing the mission. Some have also complained that a president distracted by a health care overhaul, a flagging economy and an oil spill has not been a forceful advocate for rallying the public behind the war.
 The author of the Rolling Stone article -- Michael Hastings, a freelance journalist -- appears to have been granted intimate access to General McChrystal's inner circle. Most of the comments seem to have been uttered during unguarded moments, in places like bars and restaurants where the general and his aides gathered to unwind.
 A McChrystal aide is quoted saying of Mr. Holbrooke: ''The Boss says he's like a wounded animal. Holbrooke keeps hearing rumors that he's going to be fired, so that makes him dangerous.'' On another occasion, General McChrystal is described as reacting with exasperation when he receives an e-mail message from Mr. Holbrooke. ''Oh, not another e-mail from Holbrooke. I don't even want to open it.''
 The article also describes a conversation in which General McChrystal and an aide talk about Mr. Biden, who is known to have opposed the decision to escalate the war. ''Are you asking about Vice President Biden?'' General McChrystal jokes.
 ''Biden?'' suggests a top adviser. ''Did you say 'Bite me?' ''
 Military officers interviewed on Tuesday noted that while the general's statements could be viewed as inexcusable and disrespectful, he never indicated a decision not to carry out Mr. Obama's orders or fulfill the president's strategy.
 That distinction may be too subtle in the current phase of poisoned relations between the White House and the military, but it is significant to military officers. For example, when Adm. William J. Fallon, then in charge of the Central Command, was forced into early retirement in March 2008, it was because his statements to Esquire magazine were viewed as directly at odds with White House policy on Iran.
 White House officials sought to play down the infighting within the administration's Afghanistan team, though one senior aide expressed dismay at what he described as ''an undisciplined, jocular culture'' that called into question whether General McChrystal and his advisers were able to execute an operation ''charged with leading 150,000 in a war that is pretty serious.''
 Still, said Denis McDonough, the National Security Council chief of staff and one of the president's closest aides, ''the challenge isn't that we're all on each other's holiday card lists.''
 ''The challenge is to make sure that we're all advancing the national interest by staying on the offense against Al Qaeda,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Beijing Keeps a Tight Rein As Currency Gains Value

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- The Chinese central bank set a reference rate for the renminbi on Wednesday at a level that signaled Beijing was engineering only a very gradual appreciation of the Chinese currency. 
 The daily reference rate for the renminbi has become a focus of attention in the financial markets since Beijing announced on Saturday that it would allow more currency flexibility. Analysts are trying to gauge how rapidly, and when, the government will allow the currency to gain in value against the dollar -- a critical issue in relations between the United States and China. 
 On Wednesday -- the third trading day since the start of the more flexible currency program pledged by Beijing -- the central bank set the reference rate at 6.8102 to the dollar. That was 0.18 percent weaker than Tuesday's fixing, but 0.05 percent firmer than Tuesday's closing level, of 6.8136 to the dollar. During the course of trade Wednesday, the renminbi strengthened by only a hair to close at 6.8130 to the dollar. 
 The daily moves in the renminbi since Monday -- both upward and downward -- have been minimal compared to the fluctuations that are common in more freely traded currencies. But they have been large in relation to the very tight range that Beijing has imposed in the past on the currency, also known as the yuan. 
 Before their pledge of more flexibility on Saturday, the Chinese authorities had unofficially pegged the renminbi at around 6.827 to the dollar, permitting only the tiniest of moves within a trading band that in theory allowed for fluctuations of up to 0.5 percent above and below the daily reference rate. 
 Since Monday, the magnitude of the swings has been large -- though still within the plus or minus 0.5 percent band. 
 Despite the mixed signals sent this week, analysts widely say they believe that the overall trend is for mild and very gentle appreciation of the renminbi against the dollar. 
 In a note on Wednesday, analysts at ING said they were reiterating their view that the pace of appreciation ''will be very slow for the next several months.'' They forecast that the renminbi would be at 6.68 to the dollar one year from now. 
 At the current level, the renminbi remains much weaker against the dollar than many economists and policy makers would like. Many argue that the level of the last two years -- set as part of the Chinese authorities' efforts to bolster exports during the global economic crisis -- gave Chinese manufacturers an unfair trade advantage. 
 Beijing is also balancing domestic economic issues in its carefully formulated and slow move on the currency front. 
 The authorities are wary of adding any more pressure on businesses, which already face a range of issues. Within the last few weeks, labor unrest has intensified nationwide, raising the prospect of hefty wage increases. 
 At the same time, a sharp decline in the euro this year has made Chinese goods more expensive for consumers in Europe, which is China's biggest trading partner. The euro's fall and the effect of any widening of Europe's debt woes are likely, in the short term, to have a larger impact on the Chinese economy than the renminbi's slight moves, many economists believe. 
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales in May Fell Below 1981's Low

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
The new housing market has never been this bad, at least not since the government started tracking such things in 1963.
 Outdoing even the pessimists' expectations, sales of new homes declined by a record amount in May to a new low. The dismal data, released by the Census Bureau on Wednesday, followed a disappointing report on sales of existing homes earlier in the week and added to growing concerns about the strength of the economic recovery.
 Unemployment remains stubbornly high as private sector employers do not add jobs and retail sales are weak. And if no one seems to want to buy a house, many other people apparently are voluntarily ditching the ones they already have. 
 Fannie Mae, the big mortgage finance company that is a ward of the government, said Wednesday that homeowners who intentionally defaulted because they owed much more than the house was worth would be ineligible for a new Fannie Mae-backed loan for seven years.
 ''Walking away from a mortgage is bad for borrowers and bad for communities and our approach is meant to deter the disturbing trend toward strategic defaulting,'' Terence Edwards, Fannie Mae's executive vice president for credit portfolio management, said in a statement.
 Fannie Mae and its sister company Freddie Mac own or guarantee about 30 million mortgages. The new measures could help limit demand for houses for much of the next decade.
 Fannie Mae said it would take legal action to recoup outstanding mortgage debt from borrowers who walk away. According to one study, 588,000 borrowers strategically defaulted in 2008.
 Other economic news on Wednesday was downbeat.
 Policy makers at the Federal Reserve, meeting in Washington, said that ''financial conditions have become less supportive of economic growth.'' As expected, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to keep short-term interest rates near zero.
 Even as mortgage rates fell again last week, flirting with their modern-day lows, the Mortgage Bankers Association said that applications for loans to purchase homes fell. It was the fifth drop in six weeks for the purchase index, which is 36.8 percent below its level in June 2009.
 ''We can't get the phones to ring,'' said Michael E. Menatian, president of the Sanborn Mortgage Corporation in West Hartford, Conn. ''Until there is economic growth -- i.e., more jobs, wage appreciation, overtime and bonuses -- we will have a housing problem.''
 Builders sold new homes in May at an annual rate of 300,000, the Census Bureau said. That was 32.7 percent below the 446,000 rate in April, when buyers could still qualify for a tax credit, and is about a third the level in a normal economy. 
 Analysts had been expecting a drop to about 400,000. ''We would be lying if we said the size of the drop was not shocking,'' Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist for Miller Tabak, said in a research note.
 Sales are now even lower than they were during the recession of the early 1980s, when interest rates approached 20 percent. The previous record low was September 1981.
 ''I think that builders should bite the bullet and stop building houses,'' said Howard Glaser, a housing consultant. ''They keep dumping new inventory into the market when what the market really needs is a moratorium.''
 The builders maintain that they build only when they have orders from customers, and that their buyers are not interested in older stock. But the result is the same: too many houses, new and old, are competing for too few buyers.
 The situation will likely get worse over the summer. In a normal market, the supply of homes available is less than six months. Currently, there are more than eight months' worth of both new and existing homes.
 With more foreclosures headed to the market, those numbers will likely go up.
 Government data released Wednesday showed that newly initiated foreclosures increased 18.6 percent during the first quarter, to 371,000. Foreclosures in process increased 8.5 percent, to 1.17 million.
 Under the system announced Wednesday by Fannie Mae, owners who walk away from their mortgages will be penalized even more than those who filed for multiple bankruptcy protection. Multiple filers are eligible for a new Fannie-backed mortgage after five years.
 A Fannie spokeswoman said executives were not being made available to comment. The release did not address the question of how Fannie intended to distinguish between those who walk away and those who really could not avoid foreclosure.
 Analysts and economists are growing more discouraged about the housing market; a majority said in one new survey that they expected prices to decline again this year. The size of the drop will be dictated by whether the market's current queasiness is a temporary reaction to the end of the $8,000 tax credit or a more permanent malaise.
 Buyers who signed contracts before April 30 qualified for the credit. These purchases will turn up in sales reports as they are completed.
 While the credit clearly stimulated sales, the effect was milder than anticipated. The National Association of Realtors said this week that existing houses sold in May at an annual rate of 5.66 million, down slightly from April. 
 At a mortgage conference last month, David H. Stevens, Federal Housing Administration commissioner, said housing was ''a market purely on life support, sustained by the federal government. Having F.H.A. do this much volume is a sign of a very sick system.''
 In a recent interview, Mr. Stevens said his point was misconstrued. ''The system is showing signs of stabilizing,'' he said. ''We're vastly improved over where we were a year ago.''
 To underline that notion, the Obama administration released this week its first monthly ''housing scorecard.'' It presents an optimistic picture of a housing market saved from the abyss by extensive government intervention.
 Some of its good news, however, was distinctly relative. ''Home equity up more than $1 trillion since first quarter 2009,'' said one headline in the report. But, as the chart clearly indicated, in the three years before that, equity had fallen $6 trillion.

HEADLINE: In Loss, Strasburg Is Mortal But Still Exceeds Hype

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Sure, the fans at Nationals Park like Stephen Strasburg plenty. After all, he gives their franchise hope.
 But Strasburg's biggest fans may be on the sidewalks outside the stadium. They are street vendors, and Strasburg gives them business. 
 Strasburg is not just a pitcher, of course, but a fledgling brand in the multibillion-dollar business that is Major League Baseball. And as such, it is not just the Washington Nationals who are benefiting from his debut this month at age 21 (as The Washington Post recently chronicled here).
 A stroll down Half Street SE - the one block that fans traverse en route from the nearest Metro station to the center-field gate into Nationals Park - yields a not-so-surprising conclusion: Strasburg, who started for the Nationals against the Kansas City Royals on Wednesday night, has been the best thing for business since, well, anyone the Nationals have ever had on their team.
 Granted, that may not be saying much. But vendors like Haiat Diab have no complaints.
 ''When Strasburg is here, we have good business,'' said Diab, 49, who sells hot dogs and sausages outside the stadium for $2.
 Down the street, Pat Mudd, 59, said that her business selling T-shirts and caps had been slow the past year or two because of the recession. But things have picked up in the past few weeks, and she does not think the timing is a coincidence.
 ''He's given us a boost,'' she said of Strasburg. ''He's our hope for right now - it makes a big difference.''
 But Martin Greenbaum, another apparel vendor, was less excited. His problem: he hasn't received any Strasburg-themed gear yet. ''I'm last on the list,'' he said, groaning.
 Still, Greenbaum said that Strasburg's debut had clearly generated more fan interest in the Nationals the past few weeks than the club has seen in recent years.
 ''It's kind of like a snowball or domino effect,'' he said. ''More fans are coming out here, so that helps.''
 Even Greenbaum's wife, who usually falls asleep if she tries to watch a baseball game, has changed her tune. ''Now she's watching,'' Greenbaum said.
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Casting Call (Smile!) For a Hotel In Harlem

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
The scene was 125th Street, but a very different sort of ''Showtime at the Apollo'' played out on Wednesday morning. 
 Harlem is about to get its first new hotel in decades, and 75 or so applicants hoping to land a job there mingled on a soundstage at the Apollo Theater wearing brightly colored leis, sang along to Michael Jackson videos and introduced themselves with nicknames like Amazing Ashton and Phenomenal Patti.
 Billed as a job fair to fill about 25 positions at the Aloft, which is set to open in August with 124 hotel rooms at 124th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard, the event was intended to feel more like an audition than a traditional interview. 
 The hotel -- part of a fast-growing, youth-oriented chain run by the people behind the W hotels -- has a sassy attitude, said Aleks Truglio, the hotel's sales and marketing director. It also has its own lingo, referring to its employees as ''talent.''
 ''We're looking for people who are sassy, savvy, outgoing -- the people who love working with other people and who embrace human contact,'' Ms. Truglio said, adding that the hotel's check-in desk, where guests will be greeted with ''aloha'' rather than ''hello,'' was round, so as to feel welcoming from all angles. 
 The 12-story building, which is still under construction and will eventually have 44 condo apartments on its upper six floors, is expected to provide an economic boost to Harlem, where redevelopment efforts, including new housing and upscale restaurants, appear to be accelerating again after a recessionary lull. This month, a group of investors led by the former N.F.L. star Emmitt Smith was approved for tax-exempt financing for a project that could bring a Hyatt hotel and a Whole Foods store to 125th Street.
 ''There's a great deal of interest,'' said Kenneth J. Knuckles, the chief executive of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone. ''We believe that there's a market here for a hotel, hopefully two.'' 
 Mr. Knuckles praised Aloft, which plans to open a second New York hotel in Downtown Brooklyn in the fall, for working with the Workforce1 Career Center in Harlem to help screen job candidates from the neighborhood. The center, overseen by the city's Department of Small Business Services, winnowed a pool of about 500 applicants down to the group invited to the Apollo for an interview process that was part freshman mixer, part reality show and part speed dating.
 As the candidates entered the room, managers began watching whether they lingered awkwardly at the edges of the group or engaged enthusiastically, then handed out color-coded leis -- pink, you are in; blue, you are out (though the candidates did not know this at the time). There were dance and rap performances by local youth groups, then the candidates separated into teams of blue and pink, with the blues leaving and the 41 pinks sitting for two-minute interviews.
 Daniel Fevre, the hotel's general manager, said he came up with this approach because he wanted an atmosphere in which he could easily see which candidates had the personality and the verve he was casting for -- whether for work as a concierge or as a chambermaid. ''I can teach you how to make a bed,'' Mr. Fevre said. ''I cannot teach you to smile and be friendly and take care of my guests.''
 Judging by body language, not everyone felt comfortable with the process, but most candidates appeared to enjoy it.
 ''It's awesome,'' Rise Shuler said as she waited for her interview, nearly jumping up and down. ''I'm so excited, I'm so excited, I'm so excited.'' An executive assistant at a construction company, Ms. Shuler said she was hoping for a management position.
 ''I love my job; we have fun, but there's no room for growth,'' she said. The hiring event was great, she said, because it gave her a taste of the company's culture. ''If you're a high-energy person and you like to smile a lot'' -- she explained that her name was a version of the Spanish word for smile -- ''then you're a good fit.''

HEADLINE: Gem Tower Tenants Could Receive Low-Interest Loans

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The 34-story International Gem Tower in the city's diamond district has been struggling to get up from the ground, but that has not stopped it from receiving a string of government subsidies and tax breaks.
 The city is already offering the developer $49.6 million in tax breaks, and the federal government recently declared the building a foreign trade zone, absolving jewelry manufacturers of having to pay custom duties on many imports and exports.
 And on Thursday, Gov. David A. Paterson's top economic development officials are expected to approve the largest loan ever under the state's jobs program for future tenants in the tower, up to $100 million. 
 Under the state's program, jewelry and diamond merchants who purchase condominiums in the 748,000-square-foot tower on West 47th Street will be eligible for special low-interest loans of up to $5 million, or half the price of the space.
 The $750 million tower, which will include high-security vaults, a private club and a gym, is designed to house top diamond and jewelry merchants. Supporters say the loan program will help an industry that is competing with diamond centers in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Dubai and Antwerp. 
 ''I'm excited about being part of solidifying an industry that faces a competitive environment and helping bring them to a more modern facility,'' said Dennis M. Mullen, chairman of New York's Empire State Development Corporation.
 But critics contend the government should not be subsidizing the United States diamond trade, which already accounts for 40 percent of diamond sales internationally.
 ''The state should not give more subsidies to an industry that is so well established in the city,'' said Bettina Damiani, director of Good Jobs New York, an advocacy group that tracks government subsidies. ''At a time when we are experiencing a budget crisis, catering to the real estate and diamond industries seems remarkably tone-deaf to the needs of average New Yorkers.''
 Ms. Damiani said the jewelry shops on 47th Street might need some upgrading, but not this level of taxpayer help. 
 New York remains a strong center for the industry simply because it is the gateway for a thriving American market. But industry analysts contend that New York will not be able to bring back the diamond cutters, polishers and manufacturers who have disappeared in recent decades because it is far cheaper to do their work in China or India. The diamond centers in Antwerp, Belgium, and Ramat Gan, Israel, face the same issue.
 The gem tower, being built by the Extell Development Company, was approved in 2006 after initially running into criticism from landlords on 47th Street who feared that the building would steal their tenants rather than generate new jobs. 
 The city agreed to provide the project with as much as $49.6 million in tax breaks, as long as the tower was filled primarily with tenants from the jewelry industry, at least half of which are either new to the city or expanding businesses.
 Extell demolished the vacant buildings on the site and did some excavation before halting work in 2008. A similar project by another developer in Las Vegas was put on hold indefinitely. Thirteen months ago, Extell had a second groundbreaking, which Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg attended. The developer said he would have one-third of the tower under contract by the end of 2009.
 But the going has been slow. The steel has yet to rise above the foundation and a ground-level slab. On Wednesday, a tower crane stood silently over the construction site, much as it has for weeks. Extell officials say they hope to secure a construction loan in the next few weeks.
 Raizy Haas, a senior vice president at Extell, said on Wednesday that they had contracts with a number of companies for about 140,000 square feet, or less than one-fifth of the tower. The Gemological Institute of America, an important pillar of the industry, has agreed to take the fifth floor.
 But success may come down to the same question as any other development project.
 ''They're working hard, flying around the world to get as many people as possible into the building,'' Martin Rapaport, publisher of the Rapaport Diamond Report, said of Extell. ''But the diamond guys who have money are pretty cagey guys. It really depends on price.''
 Most of the public benefits will go to tenants, not the developer, Ms. Haas said. The state loans provide tenants with assurances that the money will be available at a time when small business loans are hard to come by.
 ''We're confident that everyone can benefit,'' she said. ''The industry needs to be revitalized. It's got to be able to compete with the other international diamond and jewelry centers.''

HEADLINE: Even for Picasso, Bidding Stays Cautious in London Auctions

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
LONDON -- Even the magic of a Blue Period Picasso could not seduce collectors into loosening their purse strings at Christie's here on Wednesday night, in spite of considerable excitement leading up to the sale. Although five bidders went for Picasso's ''Portrait of Angel Fernandez de Soto (The Absinthe Drinker),'' a soulful 1903 canvas depicting the artist's friend seated at a Barcelona cafe table and shrouded in tobacco smoke, bidding was slow and deliberate. The painting sold to an unidentified collector for $46.3 million, or $51.8 million with commission -- just above the low end of the price range that had been estimated, and far below the high of $60 million.
 More surprising still, an example of Monet's waterlily series -- painted in 1906 by the lily pond behind his house in Giverny, France -- which had likewise been estimated at between $45 million and $60 million, failed to sell at all. Gasps were heard in the salesroom when the lone telephone bidder stopped at $:29 million, or $43.3 million, short of what the seller was willing to accept. The painting had been sold by Christie's a decade ago in New York for $20.9 million. 
 The sale was the second of two Impressionist and modern art auctions this week, and like the first proved to be a considerably more somber affair than the May auctions in New York, where a 1932 Picasso portrait of his mistress Marie-Therese Walter reclining naked fetched $106.5 million, becoming the most expensive work ever sold at auction. Christie's estimates for Wednesday's sale were the highest in the history of London auctions, a fact that had been much heralded in advance of the evening, and that contributed to high expectations in the salesroom. But the sale brought in just $226.4 million -- a lot of money, but well short of the house's low estimate of $242.8 million.
 (Final prices include the buyer's commission to Christie's: 25 percent of the first $50,000 in the sale of an artwork, 20 percent of the next $50,000 to $1 million, and 12 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)
 Theories about the tempered bidding abounded. ''A sense of reality has entered the market,'' said Thomas Gibson, a London dealer. ''You cannot bully people into paying huge sums just by putting huge estimates on a picture.''
 Dino Zevi, a dealer based in St. Moritz, Switzerland, seemed surprised by the Monet's failure to sell: ''With all the publicity it had, there is no reason why it did not.'' 
 Still, Mr. Zevi added, although the market is clearly ''stronger than it used to be, collectors are picky and there is a price resistance.'' And he considered the baleful Picasso portrait ''a tough picture'' to sell: ''People these days are looking for attractive images. It would have been a struggle anywhere it was sold.''
 Edward Dolman, Christie's chief executive, said after the sale that ''general economic conditions have changed'' in recent months because of issues like the euro crisis, the Deepwater Horizon spill and widespread governmental belt-tightening. ''There's been a reduction in confidence,'' he said. ''People were simply expecting too much.''
 The most talked-about artwork on offer in the current London auction season, the Picasso became well-known in 1995 when the composer Andrew Lloyd Webber bought it at Sotheby's in New York for $29.1 million. Before that it had belonged to the New York collectors Donald and Jean Stralem for nearly 50 years.
 At the time Mr. Lloyd Webber said he was buying the painting for a foundation he had established in 1992 to support the arts. Since then he has lent it to museums, including the National Gallery of Art and the Royal Academy, both in London. In 2006 he surprised the art world by announcing that he planned to sell the painting at Christie's in New York to benefit the foundation. But hours before that sale -- at which the painting was expected to bring $40 million to $60 million -- Christie's withdrew it, after the collector Julius H. Schoeps filed a lawsuit saying that his great-uncle, a Jewish banker in Berlin, had been forced to sell it under the Nazis. A resolution of the claim was announced in March, freeing the painting to be auctioned once again.

HEADLINE: Shape Shifters That Mutate With You

BYLINE: By RUTH LA FERLA

 BODY:
''MODERN'' is a term so routinely invoked in fashion-speak that it lost its meaning long ago. But without quite intending it, JNBY, a new loftlike boutique in SoHo, has revitalized that concept, lending ''modern'' a near-prophetic ring.
 The wares at this first United States outpost of the Chinese retail chain hint at a future in which fashion is the product of a youthful design collective. The brand, founded in 1994, was conceived by an unsung cadre of 12 students largely inspired by the club-wear of the late '80s and '90s. Today a design team still toils anonymously to turn out a line destined to be worn in churning urban centers like Shanghai, Tokyo and Paris, where JNBY has, or soon will have, retail outlets. 
 Based in Hangzhou, the company operates some 600 stores worldwide. But it entered Manhattan gingerly, opening a pop-up shop in SoHo less than a year ago. Its name, it turns out, is short for ''Just Naturally Be Yourself.'' As if New Yorkers needed coaxing.
 On the rack that phrase translates to a utilitarian mode of dress aimed at a steadily homogenizing global market. But it's unlikely that the shrunken leather jackets, duffle coats, leggings, pickled jeans and Grecian-draped frocks showcased here will be novel to the New York University students who appear to form a sizeable portion of the shop's clientele.
 Some may have a hard time ferreting out the standout pieces in what at first glance is a dim sum of shapeless, and soulless, gray, black, taupe and navy body casings suspended from fixtures that look like outsize swing sets. But on closer inspection, the loose-fitting clothes, in sizes 1 to 5 (3 is a medium), are audacious indeed, shifting shape, mood and proportion like an army of soft-skinned Transformers. Their mutability suggests a no-commitment approach to dressing that has parallels in contemporary home design; the clothes are the fashion equivalent of a cleverly constructed sectional that can be pushed, piled, tugged or folded into myriad shapes and configurations.
 ''Just play with it,'' Alice, a cheerily accommodating manager, urged, handing me a black linen wrap, a grainy-textured variation on a dancer's warm-up sweater ($215). Her lilting invitation, uttered like a mantra, ought to be stamped on the company's hang tags.
 With little else to occupy a storm-soaked Sunday afternoon, I obliged, flipping an attenuated cardigan upside down to turn it into a shrug, the strategically placed Y-shaped dart at its rear causing it to billow flatteringly. ''See, you can push up the sleeves,'' Alice said. I did and was impressed to see it mutate into a Gothic-looking wrap.
 With Alice as my prod, I slipped on a button-front dress, hiked it up a few inches to turn it into a curve-enhancing tunic, then tried it on backward, watching, transfixed as it became a bubble top with an off-the-shoulder ''Flashdance'' -era neckline. Shroudlike on hangers, these clothes are far sexier than might be supposed.
 I tugged at the drawstring waist of a taffeta anorak ($315) -- and, presto, a dress; I worked a black cotton shirt ($195), tying its front sash behind me to give it an hourglass shape that evoked Ava Gardner baiting a toreador in ''The Sun Also Rises.'' 
 Alice was unstoppable, jerking me out of my cheesy reverie just long enough to coax me into a bubble skirt. So not me, I grumbled inwardly, but didn't fight. After whisking it into a mirrorless fitting room where creature comforts were in short supply, I ventured back to the sales floor to assess it, toying with its buttons and watching it morph under Alice's vigilant eye. ''If you don't like it short, then wear it long,'' she chirped. ''There is no confinement.''
 The concept of convertible clothing isn't uniquely Chinese, of course, nor is it groundbreaking. The idea was floated at least as far back as the early '90s by Dolce & Gabbana, which unveiled a series of jersey dresses that transformed via buttons to the wearer's whim. And a cursory tour of the Web will turn up any number of looks from designers as varied as Norma Kamali and Rachel Roy that can be hitched, sashed, buttoned or draped to take on new forms and uses.
 But in a value-driven economy, clothes that do double duty are certainly compelling. Among ''frugalistas'' and light-traveling frequent fliers, they carry a cachet that has not been lost on luxury marketers. Only last week, Alber Elbaz, the creative force behind Lanvin, unveiled a resort collection highlighted by daytime chemises that reverse to ruffled chiffon or draped tulle for night.
 Not that the offerings here are especially wallet-friendly. Persuading yourself that a dress can double as a coat or blouse -- or, for that matter, a parachute -- is just another way to rationalize parting with sums that do not compare favorably with those of Topshop or H & M.
 My friend Cam, who accompanied me on a visit to the store shortly after it opened this month, was tempted to buy some streamlined high-heeled pumps for his girlfriend, until he saw the price. ''Four hundred dollars?'' He balked. ''That could buy 12 pair of sneakers.''
 Prices that range from about $195 to close to $500 did not deter a young woman from splurging on a linen tunic marked at just over $200. ''You can't leave here without buying something,'' she trilled on her way out the door. It happens she was right.

HEADLINE: BP Temporarily Removes Containment Cap From Well

BYLINE: By LIZ ROBBINS; John M. Broder, Henry Fountain and Dana Beyerle contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BP's effort to contain the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico suffered another setback on Wednesday when a discharge of liquid and gases forced the company to remove the containment cap that for three weeks had been able to capture much of the oil gushing from its damaged well.
 Adm. Thad W. Allen of the Coast Guard, at a briefing in Washington, said a remote-controlled submersible operating a mile beneath the surface had most likely bumped a vent and compromised the system. Live video from the sea floor showed oil and gas storming out of the well unrestricted. 
 By evening, the cap was back on, nestled in place on the eighth try after about 90 minutes of effort. Live video showed remote-controlled submersibles frequently moving hoses out of the way so that the cap could be lowered over the spewing oil.
 The company said the funneling of oil and gas through a pipe to the drill ship Discoverer Enterprise began shortly after the cap was properly positioned. John Curry, a BP spokesman, said collection would return to full capacity ''as conditions permit.''
 Another system, connected to a drill rig, the Q4000, continued to operate throughout the day, siphoning oil through a separate pipe near the seabed.
 The incident was yet another complication in BP's two-month struggle to contain the tens of thousands of barrels of oil spewing into the gulf every day.
 On Tuesday, BP said it had been able to capture 16,665 barrels of oil through its containment cap, two-thirds of the total recovery operation. But at 8:45 a.m. local time on Wednesday, workers noticed liquids escaping from a valve connected to the Discoverer Enterprise.
 A technician with knowledge of the situation said that gas had apparently flowed up the part of the pipe containing warm water used to prevent the formation of icelike hydrates. Out of concern that more gas might come up, creating the potential for an explosion, the Discoverer Enterprise was moved about 50 feet away, taking the cap with it, said the technician, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment on the work.
 Also Wednesday, Admiral Allen said that two people working with the overall response efforts had died. One was the operator of a vessel assisting the cleanup in Gulf Shores, Ala., who was found dead on his docked boat. The other person died in a swimming pool accident. Neither death appeared to be directly related to the people's specific duties in the effort, Admiral Allen said.
 Stan Vinson, the coroner in Baldwin County, Ala., said the man found dead on his boat was William A. Kruse, 55, of Foley, Ala. He was a charter boat captain hired by BP. ''A single wound to the victim's head appears to be self-inflicted,'' said Edward Delmore, the police chief of Gulf Shores, Ala., in a statement.
 As oil gushed fiercely from a mile under the surface on Wednesday, some beleaguered fishermen in the gulf received a reprieve. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said it opened a small portion -- 8,000 square miles -- of previously closed fishing area in the Gulf of Mexico because it had not observed oil in the area. One area, south of Mississippi, had only been closed since Monday.
 Two-thirds of the federal waters of the Gulf of Mexico are still open for fishing, and the oceanic agency said the closed area now represented 78,597 square miles.
 Still, Florida residents directly experienced the effects of the oil: tar balls and oil mousse (with the consistency of sludge) washed up on the shore of Pensacola Beach and caused several areas for swimming to be closed, said a spokeswoman for the Incident Command in Mobile, Ala.
 In Washington, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said Wednesday that he was preparing new evidence to support a six-month moratorium on deep-water oil and gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and was prepared to vigorously challenge a federal judge's ruling on Tuesday that the drilling ban was unjustified.
 Appearing before a Senate committee, Mr. Salazar said the ''pause'' in the drilling of 33 deepwater wells in the gulf was essential until the causes of the April 20 BP Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil leak were fully understood.
 A federal judge in New Orleans ruled Tuesday that the moratorium Mr. Salazar imposed in May was not supported by the facts or law and was causing extreme economic distress throughout the Gulf Coast. The Obama administration quickly announced that it would appeal the ruling, and Mr. Salazar promised a new order within days to justify the drilling halt.
 But Mr. Salazar left open the possibility that the moratorium could be revised or even lifted for certain types of wells in the gulf before the six months are up.
 At the same hearing, the man whom Mr. Salazar and President Obama have designated to oversee reforms of offshore drilling said he planned to create an investigative unit to root out corruption and speed reorganization of the office.
 The overseer, Michael R. Bromwich, who was appointed director of the Minerals Management Service last week, said in testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee that the new investigations team would report directly to him and would work closely with the Interior Department's inspector general's office, which has issued several tough reports on misconduct at the minerals service in the last decade.
 Mr. Bromwich, a former inspector general in the Justice Department, said the unit would quickly act on charges against agency officials or the companies they are supposed to regulate.
 Also in Washington on Wednesday, the House voted to grant subpoena power to the commission appointed by President Obama to investigate the accident and recommend ways to make offshore drilling safer. The bill, sponsored by Representative Lois Capps, Democrat of California, passed by a vote of 420 to 1.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about BP's temporarily removing the containment cap that had been capturing oil gushing from its damaged well in the Gulf of Mexico misstated part of the name of the federal agency responsible for coastal and deep ocean waters. It is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, not the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Association.

GRAPHIC: CHART: How Much Oil Has Been Captured: BP says it has captured about 348,000 barrels of oil since the first successful containment system was installed in May. But on Wednesday, a cap that was placed on top of the blowout preventer had to be removed after a leak was discovered in one of the valves. (Source: BP)

HEADLINE: The Derivatives Endgame

 BODY:
Financial reform enters a crucial phase on Thursday as House and Senate negotiators begin public debate on the regulation of derivatives, the complex instruments at the heart of the financial crisis. 
 This is arguably the most important issue for big banks because real reform will crimp their huge profits from derivatives deal-making. It also is arguably the most important one for the public. The largely unregulated, multitrillion-dollar market in derivatives fed the bubble, intensified the bust and led to the bailouts. Unreformed, it will do so again. 
 The final bill must ensure that derivatives are traded on transparent exchanges and processed through third-party clearinghouses to guarantee payment in case of default. That would end the opacity that masks the size and risk of derivatives deals, like those that caused the bailout of the American International Group. But to be effective, the new rules must be broadly applied. 
 Exceptions to the rules in the Senate bill are narrowly drawn. Painstakingly negotiated and uniquely customized contracts would not need to be publicly traded, nor would derivatives deals that commercial businesses use to hedge legitimate risks. Any attempt by negotiators to expand the exceptions would be moving in a dangerously wrong direction.
 Lawmakers also have to keep the definition of an ''exchange'' narrow. A transparent exchange is a trading facility in which many participants make bids and offers and everyone can see what prices were offered and paid. Proposed language from the House for the final bill would allow telephone deals to qualify as a proper trade, which is seriously wrongheaded. 
 In addition to trading through clearinghouses and exchanges, the bill must establish legal tools to stop or undo deals that have not been properly cleared or traded. Banks have been pushing hard to handcuff regulators, demanding that only egregious and intentional violations be deemed out of bounds. The new rules will be meaningless unless regulators can quickly and efficiently enforce them.
 Lawmakers also must resist banks that want federal financial backing for derivatives clearinghouses, like access to emergency loans from the Federal Reserve. That would be, in effect, license to take the same outsize risks that precipitated the crisis and the bailouts. 
 Finally, lawmakers must find a way to separate banks' derivatives dealing from federally insured deposits. Ideally, that would involve spinning off derivatives businesses into separate entities. A lite version of reform would involve setting up a separate derivatives affiliate within the bank holding company. What is crucial is that derivatives operations are supported by adequate capital of their own, and that there are no loopholes allowing federally backed banks to keep dealing in derivatives.
 If done well, reform will create transparent and robustly regulated derivatives markets that can fail without taxpayers bearing the losses. Sadly, that is a big if.

HEADLINE: Community Colleges Cutting Back on Open Access

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
WALNUT, Calif. -- When Giovanny Villalta tried to register for winter-term classes at Mount San Antonio College here, he hit the wall.
 ''I was assigned a late registration slot, and by the time I was allowed to register, everything was full,'' Mr. Villalta said. ''Biology, full. Anatomy, full. Physics, full. Psychology, full. History of Asia, full. Any history class that would count toward transferring to a four-year U.C. campus, full.'' 
 So Mr. Villalta, who had been a high school athlete, ended up taking track -- and nothing else. 
 ''It was pretty frustrating,'' he said. ''You feel like you're wasting time, and your life's just going by.'' 
 In this economy, community colleges are widely seen as the solution to many problems. Displaced workers are registering in droves to earn credentials that might get them back in the game. Strapped parents, daunted by the cost of four-year universities, are encouraging their children to spend two years at the local community college. 
 President Obama has announced an American Graduation Initiative to produce five million more community college graduates by 2020. There is even a popular television comedy, ''Community,'' set at a two-year college. 
 ''We're more visible now than we ever have been,'' said George R. Boggs, president of the American Association of Community Colleges. 
 But for students and professors at overstretched colleges, these are hardly the best of times. With state financing slashed almost everywhere, many institutions have cut so deeply into their course offerings and their faculty rosters that they cannot begin to handle the influx of students. 
 In some parts of the country, the budget stresses are so serious that the whole concept of community colleges as open-access institutions -- where anyone, with any educational background, can enroll at any point in life -- is becoming more an aspiration than a reality. 
 ''We have a commitment to educate the top 100 percent of Americans, but this is a tough time,'' said Martha J. Kanter, under secretary of the federal Department of Education and a former community college president. ''Students aren't getting as many classes as they want, so it's going to take them longer to get through.'' 
 On the sunny, hilly campus of Mount SAC (as everyone calls it) east of Los Angeles, Ashley Diaz is one of many dispirited students. In each of her three terms at the college, she has been able to get into only one academic class and one dance class, which she has taken three times. 
 ''I came in with some Advanced Placement credits, so I don't need that many courses before I can transfer to a four-year university,'' Ms. Diaz said. ''I thought I'd be in and out in a year and a half, maybe two. But it's like working my way through quicksand.'' 
 Many students feel stalled, whether they plan to continue at a four-year university or become a firefighter, a nurse or a welder. 
 Crystal Boddie, a 28-year-old child care worker, said she was just one course away from certification as a preschool teacher, which would raise her pay by about $6 an hour. But when she went to register for that class this spring, it was not offered. 
 The college has cut 800 course sections -- more than 10 percent of its classes -- over the last year, even as the number of people attending preregistration orientation sessions has grown about 10 percent. 
 ''We want to create the illusion that we're still open access,'' said Silver Calzada, chairman of counseling at the college. ''But the truth is that with all the classes that have been cut, unless you get a registration slot on the first or second day, you're not going to get into the classes you need. Students see our banners saying 'Dream It. Be It.' And they feel like they've been duped.'' 
 Some professors now stretch their class sizes, taking in as many students as the room will hold. When dozens of extra students showed up for a Thursday evening horticulture class with 35 registered members, for example, the professor, Dave Lannom, brought in 24 chairs from a nearby classroom and said anyone who could find a chair could stay. 
 ''This is a terrible situation,'' Professor Lannom said. ''Students get discouraged and will quit when turned away.''
 Because of budget cuts, California community colleges, the largest higher education system in the country, enrolled 21,000 fewer students in the 2009-10 academic year than the previous year. Some districts reported turning away about half of the new students who tried to enroll for the 2009-10 academic year, said Jack Scott, the chancellor of California's community colleges. 
 ''Unfortunately, we will never be able to accurately account for all of the students who had to either put their college dreams on hold or abandon them altogether because they couldn't get the classes or training they needed,'' Mr. Scott said. 
 Open access has passed its limits elsewhere, too. For the first time, the City University of New York and its six community colleges, whose enrollment grew by 43 percent over the last decade, started waiting lists for admission this fall. 
 ''We capped our enrollment for the fall at 10,804, the same level as last year,'' said Eduardo J. Marti, president of Queensborough Community College. ''That means there will be about 200 to 500 students we might not be able to bring in.'' 
 At Forsyth Technical Community College in Winston-Salem, N.C., where enrollment grew by a third over the last two years, the president, Gary M. Green, said he had no room for hundreds of students who wanted to register. 
 ''I've been in community colleges since 1976, and the door has always been open,'' he said. ''But now, we just don't have the capacity.'' 
 Even in flush times, completion rates at community colleges are shockingly low, in part because so many students hold jobs and attend classes only part time. Over all, only about a quarter of community college students complete their degree in six years, said Ms. Kanter, the education under secretary. Then, too, most need some remedial courses before they can begin college-level work, further lengthening their course of study. And at Mount SAC and many other community colleges, remedial math and English classes fill up rapidly. 
 Recently, foundations like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Lumina have been pouring money into community colleges to increase completion rates, in part by improving remedial education. 
 Almost everywhere, anatomy and physiology classes, and others required for students of health professions, fill up almost instantly. And admission to health-related programs can take years. 
 Mount SAC, for example, has 986 students on the waiting list for its nursing program, which was cut by a third because of reduced financing. The radiologic technology program, which accepts 38 students a year, has a waiting list of 300. 
 Giovanni Davalos, an aspiring X-ray technician, said he had expected to spend three years on the waiting list. But his first hurdle was getting into the remedial classes he needed. 
 This spring, Mr. Davalos took a counseling department class, College Success Strategies. He said he did not necessarily want to take it, but students in that class, which teaches how to plot a sequence of courses leading to a degree, are guaranteed a seat in a remedial English class. 
 ''All together,'' he said, ''it might take me seven years.''

HEADLINE: As the Renminbi Goes ...

 BODY:
The announcement by China's central bank that it would stop pegging its currency to the dollar could be a watershed moment for the global economy -- if China really allows the value of the currency to rise. 
 China's cheap currency policy has not only built up enormous trade surpluses with the United States and Europe, it has become a drag on the economic recovery of other developing nations whose exports can't compete. The policy is skewing global economic management as other countries keep their exchange rates artificially low. It is building enormous financial imbalances by adding to China's huge pile of dollar reserves. 
 With international resentment growing, China's announcement on Saturday was clearly timed to pre-empt criticism at this weekend's summit of the world's 20 leading economies in Canada. Doubts about Beijing's sincerity were immediately raised when the central bank issued a second statement insisting a substantial appreciation of the currency, the renminbi, is ''not in China's interest.'' Its rate policy since then suggests that any rise permitted will be very gradual. 
 The policy of deliberately undervaluing the renminbi has been central to China's economic success over the last two decades. But it is no longer tenable even for China's own economic health. 
 A substantial increase in the currency's value would help combat inflation by keeping import prices low. It would boost the buying power of Chinese workers and help ease the country to a new phase of development based on sharing more of the spoils with its workers and allowing their consumption to power further growth.
 China knows how to do this. From 2005 to 2008, the central bank allowed the currency to appreciate gradually from 8.25 to about 6.83 to the dollar. That aided exporters everywhere, and China's growth did not suffer. With the global economic crisis, Beijing has slammed on the brakes and the renminbi has been stuck at about 6.83. 
 China is now well on the way to economic recovery. Other countries are not so fortunate. Unless China makes a firm commitment to let its currency rise, it will have a hard time managing inflationary pressures and international resentment.

HEADLINE: Levi's Features a Town Trying to Recover

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
A CAMPAIGN for a clothing brand is rolling up its sleeves, figuratively and literally, as the ads are set in an actual distressed town and the advertiser donates money to help revitalization efforts there.
 The campaign is for the flagship Levi's brand sold by Levi Strauss & Company, and it is the start of the second year of an initiative that carries the theme ''Go forth.'' The ads are being filmed and photographed in Braddock, Pa., which attracted national attention in the last year for attempts by the mayor, John Fetterman, to address the dire straits of the town after decades of economic decline.
 Levi Strauss executives plan to put their money where their pants are, donating more than a million dollars over a two-year period to assist Braddock in renovating a community center and further developing an urban farming program. 
 And the company will forgo using models for the campaign, instead casting residents of the Braddock area and paying them to appear in the ads. Some ads will include the words ''Braddock, Pa.'' in a corner.
 The town will also be featured in video clips and an hourlong show, sponsored by Levi's, to appear online and on the IFC and Sundance cable channels.
 The idea to use the residents of an actual community, shown trying to overcome tough times, was prompted by the introduction of a line of Levi's work wear, which includes jeans, corduroys, shirts and jackets. The print ads and billboards will carry headlines like ''Ready to work,'' ''Everybody's work is equally important'' and ''We are all workers.''
 ''We wanted to engage consumers in a conversation about real work,'' said Doug Sweeny, vice president for Levi's brand marketing for the Americas at Levi Strauss in San Francisco.
 ''The apparel category can be about posing, about being somebody you're not,'' he added, whereas the Levi's brand promise is that ''you always feel your true, authentic self when you put on a pair of Levi's jeans.''
 The ads also address a point raised in the last year about the ''Go forth'' campaign, which some deemed too ethereal. The ads included salutes to the pioneering spirit of young Americans and the poetry of Walt Whitman.
 ''We're marrying 'Go forth' with something very tangible,'' Mr. Sweeny said, by grounding the upbeat optimism of the theme with the gritty realism provided by the Braddock settings.
 The suggestion to feature Braddock in the campaign came from the Levi's creative agency, Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore., which also produced the first year of ''Go forth'' ads, which began running last July.
 The agency said it could be risky for the Levi's brand to do this, Mr. Sweeny recalled, but after he met with Mr. Fetterman and other residents, he realized that ''the people have an incredible sense of optimism.''
 ''No one knows'' if Braddock will be able to reverse its decline, Mr. Sweeny said. ''It's a big question mark. Nothing in life is guaranteed.''
 ''But I do fundamentally believe that real work and real people will ultimately drive real change,'' Mr. Sweeny said.
 The campaign plays up the concept that Braddock residents are descendants of the pioneers who first wore Levi's in the 1870s.
 ''People don't think there are frontiers anymore,'' says a girl who narrates a commercial that depicts scenes of life in Braddock. ''They can't see how frontiers are all around us.''
 To underline the connection between then and now, the commercial -- to be shown on television and in movie theaters -- stylistically evokes two movies about the West, ''The Searchers'' (1956) and ''Days of Heaven'' (1978).
 ''We didn't want to photograph people in front of a brick wall and call it work wear,'' said Tyler Whisnand, who with Danielle Flagg is the co-creative director on the Levi's campaign at Wieden & Kennedy.
 ''We wanted to show people who were really doing the work, the hard work, to rebuild after the recession,'' he added, and it is serendipitous that ''they need a good, sturdy pair of jeans or a trucker jacket to get down to work.''
 That the Braddock residents in the ads are attired in Levi's clothing may cause some to consider the campaign a gimmick or a ploy to generate good feelings for Levi Strauss. The mayor, however, is not one of them.
 ''Across the board, it is an authentic, organic partnership,'' Mr. Fetterman said. ''At no point did it ever feel it was a marketing campaign.''
 ''They didn't show up with magic beans and a couple pairs of free jeans and say, 'Come be in our ads,' '' said Mr. Fetterman, whose devotion to Braddock is symbolized by a large tattoo on his left arm of the town's ZIP code, 15104. 
 ''A lot of good has come from it,'' he added, ''and will continue to come from it.'' 
 For instance, a young single mother who recently lost her job will appear in print ads and billboards, Mr. Fetterman said, and ''the money she received helped out a lot.''
 The campaign is to begin appearing July 4. There will also be digital ads and a presence in social media like Facebook.
 The budget will be ''a little above'' what was spent in the first year of the campaign, Mr. Sweeny said. According to the Kantar Media unit of WPP, which tracks ad spending in major media, Levi Strauss spent $55.1 million to advertise Levi's apparel last year, up 55.6 percent from the $35.4 million spent in 2008.

HEADLINE: Halls of Finance Fear Wal-Mart

BYLINE: By ROLFE WINKLER, ROB COX and MARTIN HUTCHINSON

 BODY:
 Many fret about Wal-Mart, but American bankers seem to have a particularly irrational fear of the retailing giant. Three years ago, opposition to Wal-Mart's application for a banking license persuaded the company to retreat. Now lawmakers are poised to use financial reform to keep it even farther at bay.
 That would be a mistake. Extra competition, particularly in the concentrated American credit card market and high-fee retail banking sector, should be encouraged. Wal-Mart has the market power, loyal customer base and financial wherewithal to make that happen. 
 Indeed, the juggernaut, based in Arkansas, is forging ahead with plans to crack the financial services business. Banco Wal-Mart plans to open more than 160 branches in Mexico this year, nearly doubling its presence south of the border. Wal-Mart Canada Bank also opened this month. It is offering a credit card and may make loans, including mortgages.
 As Wal-Mart has done with retail in America, a Wal-Mart bank could be a disciplining force in keeping down costs for customers. It could also act as an engine of credit creation for a significantly underbanked subset of the American populace.
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation estimates that 60 million Americans, most of them low-income, are underserved by local community banks and wind up using usurious check cashers, payday lenders and pawnbrokers for financial services.
 Meanwhile, mergers of big banks, many blessed by regulators concerned with the safety of the financial system -- like the JPMorgan Chase takeover of Washington Mutual -- have concentrated the industry further.
 This consolidation has coincided with a 10 percent annual increase since 2000 in overdraft and other fees, according to the Government Accountability Office. Meanwhile, nearly two-thirds of the domestic credit card business is controlled by three banks.
 So it is no wonder that the banking industry -- in particular the community bank lobby -- is so opposed to letting Wal-Mart onto its turf. As part of the financial reform legislation, bankers have supported a three-year freeze on new applications for industrial loan corporations, the charter Wal-Mart would need.
 That runs contrary to the supposed spirit of reform that seeks to empower and protect consumers. Greater competition, coupled with sounder regulatory supervision, would help accomplish that. And Wal-Mart could be its catalyst.
 Wealth and Taxes 
 Would-be billionaires often say they are discouraged by high tax rates. For example, the private equity industry complained this week that the increase in the British tax rate on capital gains to 28 percent would damage capital formation. The latest World Wealth Report from Merrill Lynch and Cap Gemini suggests otherwise.
 The research examines what used to be called rich people, who are now known as high-net-worth individuals. The cutoff is investable capital of $1 million.
 The financial crisis and recession have been a little rough on those at the top of the global economic heap. From booming 2006 to busting 2009, both the headcount of millionaires and their total net worth increased by a mere 5 percent -- to 10 million and $39 trillion respectively. After accounting for inflation and a generally weak dollar, it is a loss.
 They are still rich and numerous enough to be worth studying. One trend is not surprising. During the period, the global millionaire mix shifted away from the finance-intensive United States and Britain toward rapidly growing China, India and Brazil. It certainly wasn't tax rates that made the difference.
 Another pattern is more surprising -- the lack of correlation between the concentration of wealth and the rate of taxes. A good measure is the ratio of those wealthy individuals to billion dollars of gross domestic product, which corrects for the larger number of millionaires in richer countries.
 In that count, low-tax Switzerland leads, with a ratio of 453. Low-tax (and high government-spending) Japan is second at 323. But high-tax Germany ranks third at 263. And the ratios in lightly taxed China, Brazil and India are around 100.
 Tax rates are not a crucial factor for growing millionaires. Social aspects play a role. As for economic policy, two things seem necessary. First, a high savings rate. That helps explain why Germany and Japan are ahead of Britain and the United States.
 Second, time. Traditionally wealthy countries are more millionaire-rich than the nouveaux riches. But China's extraordinary savings and growth rates should enable it to catch up soon.

HEADLINE: Shares Mixed After Fed Statement

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The major indexes were mixed, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropping for a third day, after the Federal Reserve signaled that European indebtedness might harm American growth and new-home sales sank to a record low.
 General Electric, Chevron and Microsoft retreated more than 1.7 percent after the Federal Open Market Committee said that ''financial conditions have become less supportive of economic growth on balance.'' Adobe Systems dropped 7.3 percent after forecasting revenue that might miss the average analyst estimate. 
 The S.& P. 500 declined 3.27 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 1,092.04, extending this week's drop to 2.3 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 4.92 points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,298.44. The Nasdaq composite index declined 7.57 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 2,254.23.
 ''The Fed's comments are really just reflecting reality,'' said Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak & Company in New York. ''The economy is growing, just not as much as one would like nor as much as the previous decline would suggest. The statement is very much as we expected, reflecting the weaker growth data and the troubling inflationary data.''
 Declines by stocks earlier in the day were driven by a Commerce Department report that purchases of new homes fell in May to a record low as a tax credit expired, showing that the market remains dependent on government support. Sales slumped 33 percent to an annual pace of 300,000 last month from April, which was less than the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Demand in previous months was revised downward.
 ''Housing numbers are ugly with a capital U,'' said Michael Mullaney, who manages $9 billion at Fiduciary Trust in Boston. ''It looks like we're going to double dip in housing. Investors are concerned.''
 Builders rallied despite the drop in home sales. An index of home builders across S.& P. 500 indexes, which had fallen five consecutive days for a loss of 8.6 percent, rose 2.4 percent on Wednesday.
 ''The perception is we will have a double bottom, but those valuations may already be reflected in the building sector,'' said David Lutz, managing director of equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus & Company in Baltimore.
 The S.& P. 500 initially advanced Wednesday after the Fed's statement. Policy makers left the overnight interbank lending rate target unchanged in a range of zero to 0.25 percent, where it has been since December 2008.
 The Fed's statement took note of Europe's debt troubles, saying that conditions were ''largely reflecting developments abroad.''
 The swing between gains and losses for the S.& P. 500 was caused by a ''mixed interpretation of the Fed's statement,'' said Chad Morganlander, a money manager at Stifel Nicolaus. 
 The Federal Open Market Committee ''has essentially said it's going to keep interest rates low, which is good for stocks,'' he said. ''On the negative side, there was a mild downgrade of optimism on the outlook for the economy.''
 Energy producers fell 1 percent as crude oil dropped 86 cents to settle at $76.35 a barrel. Chevron declined 2.4 percent to $72.26, while Exxon Mobil dropped 1.4 percent to $61.10.
 The Treasury's 10-year note rose 13/32, to 103 7/32. The yield fell to 3.12 percent from 3.17 percent late Tuesday.
 Phone companies had the biggest gain in the S.& P. 500 among 10 industries, rising 0.6 percent. The Credit Suisse Group upgraded the industry to market weight from underweight, saying wireless pricing appeared to be stabilizing. Verizon Communications rose 0.9 percent to $29.33.

HEADLINE: Report Offers Optimistic View of Africa's Economies

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
JOHANNESBURG -- Africa is often depicted as a place of war, disease and poverty, with a begging bowl extended to the world. But a new report paints a much more optimistic portrait of a continent with growing national economies and an expanding consumer class that offers foreign investors the highest rates of return in the developing world.
 In a report released Thursday, McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm, presented a bullish message to companies, arguing that ''global businesses cannot afford to ignore the potential.'' 
 ''The growth we've seen in Africa recently is much more widespread than is generally recognized,'' said Arend van Wamelen, an author of the report based in Johannesburg for McKinsey, which advises domestic and international companies investing in Africa. ''There are a lot of underlying good things going on in the economies.''
 The report, titled ''Lions on the Move,'' includes an array of arresting facts from the firm's business and economics research arm, the McKinsey Global Institute. Since 2000, 316 million people on the continent have signed up for cellphone service, more than the entire population of the United States; Africa's billion people spent $860 billion in 2008, more than India's population of 1.2 billion.
 From 2000 to 2008, African economies grew at twice the pace that they did in the 1980s and 1990s. Moreover, Africa was one of only two regions -- Asia was the other -- where the collective economy rose through the global recession of 2009, by 1.4 percent.
 In a clear sign of the reorientation of the economic landscape in Africa, China has provided more financing for roads, power, railways and other infrastructure in recent years than the World Bank.
 And in a sign of increasing security, the number of serious conflicts in which more than 1,000 people died annually declined to an average of 2.6 a year in the 2000s from 4.8 in the 1990s, the report said.
 Many advocates for democracy, the poor and people with AIDS would probably offer a less rosy take on Africa's persistent struggles, but the authors of the McKinsey report contend that the continent as a whole has made solid progress on economic fundamentals.
 Often, Africa's economic growth is seen as a result of the boom in prices for its wealth of natural resources -- oil, gold, platinum and diamonds, among others. As an example of that, the continent's three largest oil producers -- Algeria, Angola and Nigeria -- earned $1 trillion in oil exports from 2000 to 2008, compared with $300 billion in the 1990s, the report found.
 But the McKinsey researchers also concluded that rising commodity prices directly accounted for only about a quarter of the increase in economic growth in the 2000s.
 Economic growth accelerated in 27 of the continent's 30 largest economies, resource-rich and resource-poor alike, they found. Those with great natural wealth grew at about 5.4 percent a year in the same period, while those not so well endowed grew at 4.6 percent.
 McKinsey attributed Africa's economic expansion to rising commodity prices, greater political stability aided by a reduction in violent conflicts, improved macroeconomic performance and market-friendly economic reforms.
 Africa's collective inflation rate fell to 8 percent after 2000, from 22 percent in the 1990s. Budget deficits declined to 1.8 percent of gross domestic product from 4.6 percent. A private sector emerged. Foreign direct investment surged to $62 billion in 2008 from $9 billion in 2000.
 ''Obviously, there are places in terrible shape,'' Mr. van Wamelen said. ''We're not insensitive to that. But on the whole, if you look at the number of people who are destitute, those numbers are falling pretty drastically. The economic trickle down is there.''
 Some of the demographic trends praised in the report could turn out to be double-edged swords. By 2040, McKinsey projects, Africa will have 1.1 billion working-age people, more than in China or India. But even now, South Africa, one of the continent's most dynamic economies, is not growing fast enough to absorb all the young people entering the job market -- or providing them with educations that would equip them for the workplace.
 Indeed, the report notes that Africa has been getting many more children into school but that it needs to do far better at giving them a quality education.
 The report also noted that Africa was urbanizing at a rapid rate. It now has 52 cities with more than a million residents, more than double the number in 1990 and the same number as in Western Europe. The report acknowledged that cities could produce miserable slums, but it also maintained that they increased worker productivity, demand and investment.
 ''If Africa can provide its young people with the education and skills they need, this large work force could account for a significant share of both global consumption and production,'' the report states.

HEADLINE: Lawmakers At Impasse On Trading Derivatives

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Derivatives trading, a business long prized by Wall Street but little noticed by anyone else, is rapidly gaining prominence as the rare part of the nation's vast financial infrastructure that Democrats cannot agree how to regulate.
 House and Senate Democratic leaders failed at a meeting Wednesday morning to persuade Senator Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas, to soften a provision she wrote that would force banks to abandon the lucrative business. 
 A group of centrist House Democrats, and a bloc of legislators from New York, where trading activity is concentrated, have warned that the inclusion of Senator Lincoln's language jeopardizes their support for the broader legislation to overhaul financial regulation.
 Democrats cannot spare votes in either chamber, and the impasse is threatening their self-imposed deadline of coming up with a final version of the bill by Thursday night, ahead of a meeting of the Group of 20 nations this weekend in Toronto.
 ''There's an ongoing process here,'' said Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who is a chief architect of the legislation. ''There's a lot of conversations going on. I'm optimistic that it can be worked out so we can get the bill passed.'' He said the committee would stay in session Thursday until its work was completed.
 The off-stage negotiations overshadowed the fifth day of public meetings between negotiators appointed by the two chambers, which was supposed to focus on rules limiting banks from investing their own money, but instead largely was consumed by a lively but inconsequential debate about the government's role in mortgage lending.
 Senator Lincoln's proposal to prevent banks from trading in derivatives would require five of the nation's largest banks to spin off their trading operations. The banks could maintain the operations as subsidiaries with separate funding sources.
 Mrs. Lincoln, who is facing a difficult race for re-election, is running in part on her credentials as a scourge of Wall Street, and she made the ban on derivatives trading a signature issue as she narrowly prevailed in a contested primary election.
 She met Wednesday morning with a group including the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi; the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid; Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Senate's lead negotiator on financial legislation; and Mr. Frank. The group pressed her to yield, arguing that the broader bill might not pass if the language was not modified. Mrs. Lincoln rejected the entreaties, according to a person who attended the meeting.
 ''We're listening to what people's concerns are,'' Mrs. Lincoln said later on Wednesday.
 Asked if she thought a deal could be reached Thursday, she said: ''I hope so. I hope others will be just as anxious as I am to make sure that we don't see another financial crisis.''
 House Democrats did agree Wednesday to drop language creating a $150 billion fund raised from the financial industry to cover any public costs arising from the failure and clean-up of large financial companies.
 The Senate did not include such a fund in its version of the financial regulation bill after fierce criticism from Republicans who said it would encourage, rather than deter, future government bailouts of financial firms.
 But there was no agreement Wednesday on the Senate's proposal to limit banks from investing their own money, a provision known as the Volcker Rule after its chief proponent, Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman.
 The House bill allows the Federal Reserve to prohibit proprietary trading by a ''systemically important'' financial company. The Senate bill instructs a new systemic risk council to put such a rule into place. Both sides now are inclined to strengthen the Senate's language, but there are uncertainties in the details. 
 Mr. Volcker has urged lawmakers in recent days not to turn the rule into ''Swiss cheese'' by carving out exemptions reducing its effectiveness. Obama administration officials also have urged legislators to preserve a strong version of the rule.
 But Senate Democrats are faced with the likelihood that two members of their own party will vote against the final version of the bill; both Maria Cantwell of Washington and Russ Feingold of Wisconsin regard the legislation as inadequate. As a consequence, the final round of tinkering increasingly is being driven by the need to attract the support of at least three moderate Republicans.
 Senator Scott Brown, Republican of Massachusetts, has made clear that his support is contingent on modifications to the Volcker Rule that would allow banks to hold small stakes in investment funds that they manage. Such investments are a popular means of advertising to clients that the firms are invested in the performance of the funds.
 State Street, based in Boston, is one of the largest managers of such funds.

To the Editor:
 Re '' 'National Mission' '' (editorial, June 21):
 The ''national mission'' for transforming American energy policy should be viewed in a global context. Over the next 50 years, the world's population will grow from 6.8 billion to 9.5 billion, and the demand for energy will follow. We need to double energy capacity to meet the projected needs of these unborn children. 
 That is the issue at hand. Are we active leaders or passive followers in developing the energy of the future? That issue is what will break or make American economic, political, moral and military dominance in the 21st century.
 This isn't just about climate -- it is about the next century of science, technologies, and political and social interactions.
 Cap and trade is a baby step forward.
 The Senate should take the baby step.

HEADLINE: On Wall Street, So Much Cash, So Little Time

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL

 BODY:
Only on Wall Street, in the rarefied realm of buyout moguls, could you actually have too much money. 
 Private equity firms, where corporate takeovers are planned and plotted, today sit atop an estimated $500 billion. But the deal makers are desperate to find deals worth doing, and the clock is ticking.
 The stores of money inside the private equity industry have ramifications far beyond the bid-'em-up crowd on Wall Street. Millions of Americans -- investors, employees, retirees -- have a stake in the game too. 
 Corporate buyout specialists generally raise money from big investors and then buy undervalued or underappreciated companies. To maximize investment returns, they typically leverage their cash with loans from banks or bond investors. 
 In recent years, private investment firms have amassed business empires rivaling the mightiest public corporations, buying up household names like Hilton Hotels, Dunkin' Donuts and Neiman Marcus. 
 Critics contend that leveraged buyouts can saddle takeover targets with dangerous levels of debt. But unlike indebted homeowners, highly leveraged companies under the care of private equity have so far dodged the big bust many have predicted. After an unprecedented burst of buyouts during the boom leading up to 2008, a vast majority of these companies are hanging on. Whether they will avoid a reckoning is uncertain. 
 So for now buyout artists are searching for their next act. Public pension funds, university endowments, insurance companies and other institutions have pledged to invest many billions with them -- provided the deal makers can find companies to buy. If they fail, investors can walk away, taking lucrative business with them. 
 Private equity funds generally tie up investors' money for 10 years. But they typically must invest all the money within the first three to five years of the funds' life. For giant buyout funds raised in 2006 and 2007, at the height of the bubble, time is short. They must invest their money soon or return it to clients -- presumably along with some of the management fees the firms have already collected. Some of the industry's biggest players, like David M. Rubenstein of the Carlyle Group, Henry Kravis of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and David Bonderman of TPG, have more than $10 billion apiece in uncommitted capital -- what is known as ''dry powder'' -- according to Preqin, an industry research firm. 
 Some buyout firms are asking their clients for more time to search for companies to buy. Many more are rushing to invest their cash as quickly as possible, whatever the price.
 Many in the industry are getting caught in bidding wars. Firms are assigning surprisingly high valuations to companies they are acquiring, even though the lofty prices will in all likelihood reduce profits for their investors. A big drop in returns would be particularly vexing for pension funds, which are counting on private equity, hedge funds and other so-called alternative investments to help them meet their mounting liabilities. 
 Given the prices being paid for companies, investors' returns over the life of the fund are likely to drop into the low to mid-teens, said Hugh H. MacArthur, head of global private equity at the consulting firm Bain & Company, which used to be affiliated with Bain Capital, the private equity firm. Returns will be even lower once fees are factored in. Private equity firms typically charge an annual fee of 2 percent and take a 20 percent cut of any profits. 
 While investing in private equity will probably be more lucrative than investing in public markets, ''those are far from the gross returns of the mid- to high teens that we saw a few years ago,'' Mr. MacArthur said.
 One factor in the modest forecast is rising prices for buyouts. Kelly DePonte, a partner at Probitas Partners in San Francisco, which helps private equity firms raise money, said ''tough competition for deals'' had driven up valuations recently. 
 One of the biggest and costliest deals so far this year was the acquisition of a stake in the Interactive Data Corporation, a financial market data company, by two private equity firms, Silver Lake and Warburg Pincus, according to Capital IQ, which tracks the industry. A third, unidentified private equity partner dropped out because the price was too high. 
 The two buyout shops paid $3.4 billion, or $33.86 in cash for each share of I.D.C. -- a premium of nearly 33 percent to the going price in the stock market. Technology companies often command high valuations. Silver Lake and Warburg Pincus declined to comment for this article. 
 Last year, when banks balked at financing deals and private equity firms worried the economic crisis would drag on, the number of deals -- and prices paid -- fell sharply. 
 In July 2009, for instance, Apax Partners paid $28.50 a share, or $571 million, for Bankrate, which owned a number of consumer finance Web sites. The price represented a 15.8 percent premium. Apax had to pay the entire bill itself, with no money from banks. 
 But these days, even small and midsize companies are in a bidding frenzy. More than a dozen buyout firms made initial bids for the Virtual Radiologic Corporation, a company that interprets medical images remotely. Providence Equity Partners eventually paid a 41 percent premium for the company. When a small online education company called Plato Learning hung up a ''for sale'' sign, several suitors showed interest. When Plato last tried to sell itself, in the fall of 2007, it found no takers. 
 Private equity players concede that competition has heated up and prices are rising. But they argue that prices, from a historical standpoint, remain attractive. Prices are well below the stratospheric levels of 2007 and 2008, according to Capital IQ. Buyout executives also say it is too soon to determine what profits will come from these deals. And, they say, losers in bidding wars always claim the winners overpaid.
 Still, those with dry powder are bidding aggressively, in the United States, Europe and Asia.
 TPG -- which, according to Preqin, has one of the largest stockpiles at more than $18 billion -- has bid aggressively at several auctions, according to several investment bankers.
 In fact, TPG has spent $9.2 billion so far this year, investing in 11 companies, including ones in India and Brazil. That makes TPG the industry's top deal maker, according to Dealogic, a research firm. A spokesman for TPG declined to comment.
 Noting that buyout firms are ''feeling a lot of pressure to put the money to work,'' William R. Atwood, head of the Illinois State Board of Investment, said he hoped the firms would not stretch too far for deals. 
 ''There is a big counterpressure -- a requirement for prudence and returns from their investments,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Analysts Question A Threat By Fannie

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
Fannie Mae's decision to begin punishing people who walk away from their unpaid mortgages could prove difficult to sell to the public and might be impossible to execute, housing and lending experts said Thursday. 
 The big mortgage financing company, which owns or guarantees millions of mortgages, announced on Wednesday that it would sue homeowners who have the capacity to pay but default anyway. It also said it would prevent these strategic defaulters from getting a new Fannie Mae-backed loan for seven years, which could potentially shut millions of buyers out of the market.
 But it was unclear, the experts said, why Fannie Mae was threatening delinquent owners and what it hoped to achieve. The new direction seems to run counter to the Obama administration's efforts to reinvigorate the housing market. And there were basic questions about how Fannie would be able to distinguish between those homeowners who defaulted intentionally and the unfortunate ones who had no choice. 
 ''How are they going to do this, and for what result?'' asked Grant Stern, president of the Morningside Mortgage Corporation on Bay Harbor Islands, Fla. ''So they can find the people who have a little money left after their house crashed and take it away from them?''
 A Fannie Mae spokeswoman said that the goal of the new punitive policies was to force defaulting homeowners to work with their servicers to surrender their houses through either a lender-approved short sale or by formally giving up the deed. 
 ''We really want to encourage borrowers to pursue alternatives to foreclosure,'' said the spokeswoman, Janis Smith.
 Fannie's newly aggressive stance comes as the debate is heating up over how much, if at all, borrowers should be held liable for their foreclosures. 
 Republicans recently added a measure to a Federal Housing Administration financing bill in the House of Representatives that would forbid strategic defaulters from getting an F.H.A.-insured loan.
 The California Legislature is debating a proposed law that goes in the other direction, shielding many more delinquent borrowers from debt collectors. 
 Fannie and its sister company, Freddie Mac, control 30 million mortgages, providing liquidity to the housing market. They have been under government conservatorship since September 2008; the ultimate cost of the rescue to taxpayers might hit $400 billion.
 Chris Dickerson of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates Fannie, said, ''We support Fannie Mae taking a policy position that discourages borrowers who can afford to pay their mortgage from walking away.'' 
 Fannie Mae will announce the details of its new program next month, when the servicers who collect mortgage payments on Fannie's loans will get explicit instructions on how to make recommendations for lawsuits.
 But for some in the mortgage business, the new direction seemed little more than a cruel joke. 
 ''Fannie wants to lock people up in a jail of negative net worth for much of the rest of their lives,'' said Lou Barnes, a Colorado mortgage banker. ''They're bringing back the debtor's prison.''
 The plan poses some political problems as well as practical ones. Fannie Mae might be a ward of the government but its new policy is at distinct odds with the Obama administration, which has been trying to restart the fragile housing market by lowering interest rates, offering tax credits and insuring millions of new loans.
 A Treasury Department spokesman said Fannie Mae's plan did not represent official Obama administration policy. A spokesman for Freddie Mac said it was closely following Fannie's moves but had not yet adopted them. 
 Strategic defaults have been a rising concern for years. Lenders first noticed people purposefully ditching their houses early in the financial crisis. In late 2007, Kenneth D. Lewis, then chief executive of Bank of America, said people were remaining current on their credit cards but defaulting on their home loans, a phenomenon that he said ''astonished'' him.
 The lenders are less surprised now, but perhaps more worried. Bank of America said recently that it was putting owners in danger of foreclosure into payment plans that were supposed to be affordable -- but that a third of the borrowers were failing to pay anyway.
 ''You could say the customer is choosing not to make those payments,'' said Jack Schakett, credit loss mitigation executive for Bank of America Home Loans.
 Borrowers who stop paying the mortgage can get a year of free rent, and sometimes two. ''There is a huge incentive for customers to walk away,'' Mr. Schakett said in a recent media briefing.
 Fannie is not saying how many of its borrowers are strategically defaulting. The firm's delinquency rate, traditionally about 0.5 percent of its portfolio, began sharply ascending in mid-2007. At the beginning of this year, it leveled off at 5.5 percent.
 About a quarter of homeowners with mortgages, or about 11 million households, owe more than their home is worth, and are potentially vulnerable to a strategic default. A flat or rising real estate market could encourage many of them to hold on; a declining market would suggest it was time to go.
 Fannie was established as a federal agency in 1938 but was chartered by Congress as a private company in 1968. For years it prospered by virtue of its special status as a government-sponsored entity charged with increasing the nation's homeownership rate, enriching its shareholders and executives in the process.
 During the housing boom Fannie overreached and bought many loans of buyers who were ill-equipped to pay them. Its fate is uncertain; it is not even clear it will be around in seven years to enforce any edicts. 
 Christopher F. Thornberg, a principal at Beacon Economics who correctly forecast that the housing boom would implode, said he understood what Fannie was trying to do, and even sympathized to a degree.
 It is rational economics, he said, to assume that someone who walked away from an unpaid mortgage once might do so again. It also made sense, he said, for Fannie to try to limit strategic defaults from becoming an even bigger problem. And the new program also addresses the moral hazard question, Mr. Thornberg said: If borrowers are not punished for their missteps, they might not learn their lesson and might do it again.
 And yet, he noted, the banks were bailed out, and their executives walked away rich. ''Why should I pay my dues when they did not?'' he said. ''There is no clean answer on this.''

HEADLINE: May Orders In Durables Fell Slightly

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
New orders for durable goods fell slightly in May, but the overall trend shows that spending by consumers and businesses has improved from last year, according to government figures.
 The Commerce Department reported that total orders for durable goods -- products that are generally meant to last more than three years, like washing machines and office equipment -- fell 1.1 percent in May from the previous month, mostly because of a decline in orders for aircraft. 
 Aircraft orders are prone to wide swings and tend to mask underlying trends. Without them, durable goods orders showed an increase of 0.9 percent.
 A category of durable goods that can be a gauge of business spending also rose. The report said that nonmilitary capital goods, excluding aircraft, rose 2.1 percent in May. 
 Both categories showed improvement over April, when such orders fell. And over all, the government report showed that durable goods orders were about 15 percent higher than in May 2009.
 Cliff Waldman, an economist for the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, said the report was generally upbeat.
 ''Capital spending remains positive,'' he said. ''It is in the process of making a positive contribution to manufacturing growth and to the broader economic recovery.'' 
 But adding a word of caution, he said: ''Manufacturing and capital spending do not function in a vacuum. You have to put in the perspective of all the other data on the economic recovery.''
 The statistics on orders for durable goods are closely watched by analysts for clues about the behavior of businesses, particularly manufacturing, one of the few bright performers in the economic recovery. 
 Brian Bethune, IHS Global Insight's chief United States financial economist, said the figure on capital orders in particular indicated improving business confidence and a rebound in corporate profits. ''Equipment and software investment is expected to make another solid contribution to real G.D.P. growth in the second quarter of 2010,'' he said.
 But there are also economic challenges to be weathered.
 The Federal Reserve's policy arm on Wednesday cited restraints to the economic recovery, like the new effect of financial troubles abroad. A lot of the demand for factory orders has come from inventory restocking, which is temporary. Unemployment and weak reports on retail sales and housing suggest forces that could hurt manufacturers.
 The Fed also said the labor market was improving gradually. 
 On Thursday, the Labor Department said there were a seasonally adjusted 457,000 initial jobless claims last week, 19,000 fewer than the week before. The figures for jobless claims have on average been flat in recent months. 
 ''I would say there are some more headwinds,'' Mr. Bethune said. ''But there doesn't seem to be enough of a problem yet to upset the apple cart in terms of the recovery.''
 In the context of other recent reports about the economy, he said, ''all you can conclude is that the economic environment remains highly uncertain.''

HEADLINE: Mortgage Rates at Lowest Level Since 1950s

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mortgages are cheaper today than they have been in a half-century. 
 The average rate for a 30-year fixed loan sank to 4.69 percent this week, beating the low set in December and down from 4.75 percent last week, Freddie Mac said Thursday. Rates for 15-year and five-year mortgages also hit lows. 
 Rates are at their lowest since the mortgage company began keeping records in 1971. The last time they were cheaper was the 1950s, when most long-term home loans lasted just 20 or 25 years.
 Americans normally rush to refinance when rates plummet. But refinancing activity now amounts to less than half the level of early 2009, when long-term rates hovered around 5 percent, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.
 Besides, many people who want to refinance have already done it, said Michael Fratantoni, vice president for research and economics at the trade group. And refinancing costs can total several thousand dollars.
 Rates on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages fell to an average of 4.13 percent. That was the lowest since at least 1991 and down from 4.2 percent a week earlier.
 Rates on five-year adjustable-rate mortgages averaged 3.84 percent, down from 3.89 percent a week earlier. That was also the lowest on Freddie Mac's records, which date to January 2005 for those loans.

HEADLINE: Local Debt in China Worries Its Auditor

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
SHANGHAI -- China won praise last year for reviving domestic growth with aggressive bank lending and a $586 billion economic stimulus package. But now the nation's top auditor is warning that the mounting debt of local governments could undermine the recovery in some parts of the country. 
 Liu Jiayi, head of the National Audit Office, said in a report to the legislature this week that borrowing by local governments had created public debt burdens totaling hundreds of billions of dollars. The report questions whether those governments have the resources to pay down the loans.
 The warning is the latest indication that a portion of the government-backed loans and stimulus money could eventually be categorized as bad loans.
 Much of that money went to huge local infrastructure projects that are now being scrutinized by the national government. Less than two weeks ago, China's State Council, or cabinet, ordered state banks and local governments to clean up the way they finance such projects. The council said many projects were being financed through quasi-independent companies that were sometimes being created to subvert restrictions on lending to local governments.
 It is unclear how serious a threat local government debt is to China's booming economy. Some economists say the nation's debt pales in comparison with that of the United States and Europe and that worries about record bank lending last year turning into mountains of bad debt are exaggerated.
 Nicholas Lardy, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said in a column this week in The Wall Street Journal that many of the worries were misplaced. He said that China was smart to invest in infrastructure projects last year and that if debts mounted, local government could service the debt by raising fees on water and subways.
 But on Thursday Fitch Ratings, the credit rating agency, warned that record loan growth and aggressive efforts by state-run banks to repackage and sell debt to investors had raised credit risks in the country and could ''lead to another financial crisis,'' according to a report published by Bloomberg News.
 In a release issued Wednesday by Fitch, Charlene Chu, the firm's senior director for financial institutions in China, said that the financial positions of Chinese banks were more strained than they appeared to be and that ''future asset quality deterioration is a near certainty.''

HEADLINE: Morgan Stanley to Settle Case Over Subprime Loans

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
BOSTON (Reuters) -- Morgan Stanley agreed Thursday to pay $102 million to end an investigation in Massachusetts into unfair lending practices.
 Martha Coakley, the state's attorney general, said Morgan Stanley had improperly lent billions of dollars to a subprime lender, New Century, which then sold loans to unqualified borrowers. Morgan Stanley also packaged these loans and sold them to big investors like pension funds. 
 Calling the settlement ''unprecedented,'' Ms. Coakley said the amount would be divided among homeowners, taxpayers and the state's pension fund. Morgan Stanley will pay $58 million to affected Massachusetts borrowers and $23 million to the state's pension fund to make up for the investment losses it suffered, and will return $19.5 million to the state's taxpayers.
 Aggressive lending practices helped inflate the housing market, which later collapsed and paved the way for the devastating financial crisis. Massachusetts lenders were especially hard-hit by these risky practices, and state and federal regulators have investigated the matter aggressively.
 A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman said the bank ''is pleased to resolve this matter in a way that will help many Massachusetts homeowners stay in their homes.''
 The Morgan Stanley settlement comes roughly one year after Ms. Coakley reached a similar settlement with Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley's biggest investment banking rival.
 Goldman paid $60 million, and the settlement was the first time that a subprime loan securitizer like an investment bank had agreed to such a deal with a state, Ms. Coakley's office said at the time.
 ''This has become an all-too-familiar pattern in which the deceptive practices of Wall Street devastated homeowners and investors, and ultimately contributed to the collapse of our economy,'' Ms. Coakley said in a news conference on Thursday.
 Morgan Stanley should have seen many red flags, Ms. Coakley said, charging that the investment bank had looked the other way and even relaxed its own standards to keep New Century from taking its business elsewhere.
 ''Even as New Century spiraled towards bankruptcy, its risky lending practices exposed to the public, Morgan Stanley continued to lend money to the subprime originator,'' she said.

HEADLINE: After Tough Year, Pay Cuts and Forfeited Bonuses for Top Toyota Executives

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOYOTA CITY, Japan -- For years, the combined salaries of the president of Toyota Motor and the 38 members of its board have been smaller than the single salary of some top executives at car makers in the United States and elsewhere.
 On Thursday, it was announced here, that disparity grew even greater. 
 At its annual shareholders' conference, Toyota disclosed that it had docked the pay of its top management by 10 percent to help atone for the company's recent safety problems, which have led to the recalls of more than nine million vehicles worldwide. The president, Akio Toyoda, and other top executives also forfeited bonuses for the second consecutive year.
 Mr. Toyoda, who took the helm of the automaker a year ago, was contrite at the gathering, the first meeting of shareholders since Toyota's slow handling of the recalls thrust the company into crisis and led to financial penalties levied by the United States government.
 ''I would like to apologize once again for all the worries we have caused our shareholders,'' Mr. Toyoda, grandson of the automaker's founder, said to the more than 3,000 shareholders who made the trip to Toyota's headquarters here.
 The $15.95 million in total remuneration for Toyota's board for the year ending in March was the lowest in a decade -- and $1.5 million less than the top executive at Ford, Alan Mulally, made last year.
 The pay cuts aside, the modest remuneration at Toyota is a product of a corporate culture in Japan built on consensus-building among a group of managers, each getting much smaller rewards than their counterparts in the West.
 Many Japanese companies think of executive remuneration as a continuum of normal pay, which keeps salaries anchored at a very low base. 
 Moreover, at companies like Toyota, there is a sense that huge disparities in pay will upset employee unity. It is a question of team play, said Ryutaro Kono, an economist at BNP Paribas. 
 ''Given the frequency of periodic personnel rotations in Japanese companies, changes at the top are routine,'' as opposed to drastic management handover, Mr. Kono said. In Japan, he said, ''top-down'' management is unnecessary. 
 In recent days, some people were surprised by compensation packages paid to a handful of foreign executives at Japanese companies -- including one of Toyota's competitors, Nissan Motor -- who were lured to work here with global-standard salaries out of line with domestic salaries. 
 Until now, that gap had been obscured by Japan's murky corporate disclosure rules. But a new rule requiring disclosure of pay for executives receiving 100 million yen ($1.1 million) has put the gap in the spotlight. 
 Investors at a shareholders' meeting Wednesday were shocked when the company disclosed that Carlos Ghosn, chief executive at Nissan, received compensation of $9.5 million for the financial year that ended in March. A few in the crowd heckled, ''Ghosn, go home!'' 
 Mr. Ghosn was defensive. ''If you compare this pay to Japanese standard, you can say it's out of line,'' he said. ''But if you compare them with global standards, there is nothing out of line. In fact, we are below standard.'' 
 The $8.8 million package paid to Howard Stringer, chief executive at Sony, which has been struggling with losses, also made headlines last week. Half of that amount came from stock options. 
 Among Japanese companies listed on the stock market, 1.4 percent of executives and 8.3 percent of presidents were paid more than 100 million yen, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. This probably translates to about 100 people whose earnings will be disclosed under the new rule, the consulting firm said.
 Hiromasa Yonekura, chairman of Sumitomo Chemical and the head of Japan's largest business lobby, the Nippon Keidanren, criticized the new rules. 
 ''I'd understand the need for disclosure if Japanese executives received the enormous salaries seen in the United States,'' Mr. Yonekura said. ''But I still have doubts about whether disclosure is really necessary in Japan.'' 
 Some companies are already eliminating foreign executives thought to be receiving too much pay under Japanese standards. 
 Shinsei Bank, the Japanese lender part-owned by the American investor J. Christopher Flowers, replaced four foreign executives on Wednesday. 
 Among those who resigned were the chief financial officer, Rahul Gupta, who was paid 116 million yen ($1.85 million) in the year to March, and the chief risk officer, Michael Cook, paid 149 million yen ($1.65 million). 
 By contrast, the former chief executive of Shinsei, Masamoto Yashiro, who was replaced by on Wednesday, was paid just 8.5 million yen ($94,200). 
 Analysts say that as Japanese companies globalize and attract more foreign managers, they will need to bring their pay in line with the rest of the world. 
 ''Unless Japan raises its pay to the global standard, they're going to lose out in the war for talent,'' said Yasuharu Inoue, a personnel consultant at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Tokyo. 
 Without proper compensation, no proper consequence faces Japanese executives who do not perform well, Mr. Inoue said. Though executive pay grew in 2008 when Toyota surpassed General Motors to become the world's biggest automaker, Toyota's business has since been hurt by the global economic crisis and recalls of Toyotas and Lexuses because of faulty accelerator pedals and floor mats.

HEADLINE: A New Plan For Valuing Pensions

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
The board that writes accounting rules for states and cities has proposed a new approach for pension disclosures that falls far short of what some financial experts hoped, but which would still force many governments to highlight pension shortfalls they have played down. 
 The current standard has come under heavy fire from mainstream economists, who say it makes virtually all government pension benefits look less costly than they really are. 
 Government officials have granted pensions to teachers, police, judges and other public workers for years, without reflecting the true cost, analysts say. Now the bills are coming due, and in many cases there is not enough money set aside, adding to the fiscal distress across the country. 
 Pensions are a third-rail issue for the Governmental Accounting Standards Board, and it has been working with great deliberation. Its pension project began early in 2006 but is nowhere near completion. Earlier this month, the board issued a ''Preliminary Views'' statement, summarizing its conclusions so far and requesting public feedback. A new standard is unlikely to take effect until at least 2013. 
 Fiscal hawks have been urging the accounting board to require states to measure their pension obligations at fair value. Corporations already do this when they report their pension numbers to the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 But state and local officials have resisted, and the Governmental Accounting Standards Board seems to have taken their objections to heart. Its new proposal would let them keep measuring their pension obligations the same way as before, with one big exception. 
 The rule makers want to shine a bright light on the states and local governments that routinely fail to put enough money into their pensions -- places like Illinois, New Jersey and Pennsylvania -- that year after year contribute less than their actuaries tell them they have to contribute to their pension funds. The accounting board wants those places to show the missing amounts on their balance sheets, not hide them in footnotes. 
 Further, instead of minimizing the shortfalls, those governments would have to calculate the shortfalls in a way that magnifies them. 
 ''I think they hope this will be the disciplinary tool that will get everybody funding at the actuarial rate,'' said Jeremy Gold, an actuary and economist who served on the accounting board's pension advisory task force but who does not like the proposed new method. ''They hope they will be punishing the real laggards.''
 He said the board's stated purpose was to foster correct financial reporting, not mete out punishment. 
 Many states and cities will be relieved at least that more far-reaching types of changes have been sidelined. They had feared a shift to fair value accounting in general and especially now, after big investment losses in 2008. 
 Some economists have been trying to strip down pension numbers to present something like fair value anyway. The most recent such study, by Eileen Norcross of the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and Andrew Biggs of the American Enterprise Institute, determined that if New Jersey's state pension system disclosed its pension numbers at fair value, it would have a shortfall of $170 billion, instead of its reported $46 billion. 
 ''This path is not sustainable,'' Ms. Norcross said.
 Governments and their actuaries argue that it is unfair and misleading to show them at their worst -- or at any particular point in time. States and cities, after all, are fundamentally different from corporations -- they do not do things like acquire each other or file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. 
 In addition, while companies need to bring their pension funds to a standing stop and measure them during such events, governments never engage in such transactions, so they say there is no reason to disclose their financial status at a single time. 
 ''I doubt anybody's imagination is vivid enough to imagine the merger of states such as Kansas and Missouri, or Ohio and Michigan,'' said Rick Roeder, an actuary and consultant in San Diego, in testimony submitted to the accounting board. ''For a plan sponsor with a 50-plus-year time horizon, today's market value can be anything but fair.'' 
 At the heart of the dispute is the way governments gauge the value of the pensions they owe future retirees in today's dollars -- a commonplace financial calculation known as discounting. It is used to calculate things as diverse as bond prices and mortgages.
 Discounting is based on an interest rate, which is supposed to reflect the riskiness and other attributes of the underlying asset. Current accounting rules tell governments to use the investment return they expect over the long term. In practice, this means most public pension funds now use about 8 percent. 
 Many economists criticize this practice, arguing that 8 percent reflects a fairly high degree of risk, though state pensions are guaranteed by law and are therefore virtually risk free. 
 Standard economic theory says they should be measured with a very low discount rate -- something much closer to the rate on Treasury bonds than to the higher risk securities in most pension investment portfolios. These days, many economists think the states should be using a rate of about 4.5 percent to measure their pension obligations. 
 The difference -- three or four percentage points -- translates into hundreds of billions of dollars when applied to pension obligations. 
 The 50 states together reported pension obligations of $3.3 trillion as of mid-2008, and secured with assets of $2.3 trillion, according to the Pew Center on the States. But Ms. Norcross said that if the states had to report their pension obligations on a fair value basis, the number would have been $5.2 trillion.

HEADLINE: An American Concept, Carried Out in Samoan Style

BYLINE: By SARAH WHEATON

 BODY:
The Tea Party movement has been working to oust the establishment by organizing protests throughout the country. Out in the Pacific, meanwhile, one of the United States's colonial holdings, American Samoa, is using a more uncommon forum to rethink the role of the federal government. The island territory of 66,000 people is holding a constitutional convention. 
 Philadelphia 1787 it is not.
 The opening ceremonies this week featured belly-baring men in traditional lava-lava skirts and shell necklaces. Formal consideration of the proposed amendments had to be delayed, in part because of problems with a copy machine before all the Samoan-language versions could be printed. 
 Each of the United States's territories has a slightly different relationship with the federal government, but American Samoa's is among the loosest. The United States provides the majority of the operating budget for the ''unorganized territory,'' but American Samoans, as United States nationals, do not have the same rights as citizens.
 ''Samoa has been the smoothest of the relationships, in part because the treaty which is the basis for the relationship makes the U.S. job so simple, which is to protect their way of life,'' said Allen Stayman, a former official at the Interior Department's Office of Insular Affairs.
 That means that some of the United States Constitution's most sacred concepts -- like the notion of one person, one vote -- do not apply in American Samoa. For example, a network of tribal leaders, known as matai, controls communal lands and they serve as appointed members of the territory's Senate. 
 But one piece of federal legislation that does apply has been blamed for economic hardship. The 2007 federal law increasing the minimum wage prompted the Chicken of the Sea Samoa fish cannery to close, eliminating more than 2,000 jobs.
 One amendment under consideration would remove the United States interior secretary's power to override the governor's veto. But major changes to the territory's political status are not on the agenda at the ''ConCon.'' In his opening remarks in Samoan, Gov. Togiola Tulafono said the two-week convention should offer a road map for the next 100 years, according to a translation by The Samoa News.
 Not everyone wants more autonomy, notably the sizable contingent of United States military veterans who want to keep ties close. One attendee even eschewed the floral lei in favor of a stars-and-stripes tie. 
 The United States Congress has final say on the changes, and proposals at odds with the American Constitution, like a call for a unicameral legislature based wholly on the matai system, would most likely face objections. 
 Still, the 145 delegates could make the convention memorable by codifying the right to trial by jury -- or enshrining the Public Utilities and Services Commission.

HEADLINE: Study Says Natural Gas Use Likely To Double

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Natural gas will provide an increasing share of America's energy needs over the next several decades, doubling its share of the energy market to 40 percent, from 20 percent, according to a report to be released Friday by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
 The increase, the report concluded, will come largely at the expense of coal and will be driven both by abundant supplies of natural gas -- made more available by shale drilling -- and by measures to restrict the carbon dioxide emissions that are linked to climate change. 
 In the long term, however, the future may be dimmer for natural gas if stricter regulations are put in place to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 -- a goal set by President Obama. Although lower in carbon than coal, natural gas is still too carbon-intensive to be used under such a target absent some method of carbon capture, the authors of the report concluded. 
 The report, one of a series on energy resources, is the result of a two-year effort by 14 prominent energy experts, led by Ernest J. Moniz, an M.I.T. professor who is a former under secretary of energy. Previous reports focused on nuclear power and coal. The report was financed in part by the American Clean Skies Foundation, which represents the interests of the natural gas industry.
 In the report, the authors point out that there is a mismatch between current energy practice in the United States and the nation's energy goals. As zero-carbon wind is added to the national electric system, the report said, it is being used to reduce consumption of natural gas, which is relatively benign in carbon impact, rather than coal, which has twice as much carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour. The reason is that gas is more expensive than coal. 
 Gas will eventually replace some of the coal used to make electricity, the study predicts, and gas will be the benchmark against which other carbon-saving technologies like wind or nuclear will be measured. But those other technologies will eventually be needed.
 Some companies that make equipment for coal- and gas-fired generating stations say that the switch to gas from coal has already begun. One reason is that switching to gas will make it easier to meet air quality standards for conventional pollutants, like smog and mercury.
 The study noted that the only natural gas car sold by a major car company in the United States, the Honda GX, costs an extra $5,500, while the VW Passat TSI Eco-fuel, sold only in Europe, costs only $3,700 extra. Converting a gasoline vehicle to natural gas is also much more expensive here than in Europe, the report said, and it suggests that the reasons be examined.
 High-mileage fleet vehicles, like taxis, could be economically converted to natural gas, the study said. But the recent history of natural gas vehicles in the United States suggests that buses and small delivery vehicles are more likely candidates for conversion than the great mass of privately owned vehicles.
 Natural gas vehicles emit about three-quarters as much carbon dioxide per mile as gasoline-powered ones. The switch would not have a large impact on carbon -- only about a ton per vehicle per year for a typical American car, according to the report. 
 ''There is no longer any doubt that we have the capacity to repower our electricity sector and move away from dirtier fuels,'' said Gregory C. Staple, the chief executive of the American Clean Skies Foundation, in a statement. 
 T. Boone Pickens, the Texas oilman, said that the study paid too much attention to the electricity sector and not enough to using natural gas as a substitute for gasoline and diesel in transportation. 
 ''You've got plenty of gas to do both,'' he said. 
 Natural gas has an erratic price history, which has made some American electric utilities nervous about overreliance. But ''abundant global natural gas resources imply greatly expanded natural gas use,'' the study concluded. 
 Globally, the average projection of the amount of recoverable gas represents about a century and a half's supply at current rates of consumption, the report noted. In the United States, the amount of recoverable gas is equal to 92 times the consumption last year, the study said.
 Especially in the United States, one reason for new optimism about supplies is the success that drillers have had exploring shale formations for natural gas. Shale drilling requires fracturing the rock, a technique called ''fracking.'' The method has raised concern about damage to underground water supplies and faces opposition from environmental groups, especially in areas that do not now have oil and gas drilling.
 Somewhat like oil, natural gas deposits are disproportionately concentrated in the Middle East. Natural gas can be chilled until it turns into a liquid and then shipped by tanker, and the American capacity to import such gas has grown, but a long supply chain for natural gas could come to represent another energy vulnerability, the report said.

HEADLINE: The Renminbi Runaround

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Last weekend China announced a change in its currency policy, a move clearly intended to head off pressure from the United States and other countries at this weekend's G-20 summit meeting. Unfortunately, the new policy doesn't address the real issue, which is that China has been promoting its exports at the rest of the world's expense. 
 In fact, far from representing a step in the right direction, the Chinese announcement was an exercise in bad faith -- an attempt to exploit U.S. restraint. To keep the rhetorical temperature down, the Obama administration has used diplomatic language in its efforts to persuade the Chinese government to end its bad behavior. Now the Chinese have responded by seizing on the form of American language to avoid dealing with the substance of American complaints. In short, they're playing games. 
 To understand what's going on, we need to get back to the basics of the situation. 
 China's exchange-rate policy is neither complicated nor unprecedented, except for its sheer scale. It's a classic example of a government keeping the foreign-currency value of its money artificially low by selling its own currency and buying foreign currency. This policy is especially effective in China's case because there are legal restrictions on the movement of funds both into and out of the country, allowing government intervention to dominate the currency market. 
 And the proof that China is, in fact, keeping the value of its currency, the renminbi, artificially low is precisely the fact that the central bank is accumulating so many dollars, euros and other foreign assets -- more than $2 trillion worth so far. There have been all sorts of calculations purporting to show that the renminbi isn't really undervalued, or at least not by much. But if the renminbi isn't deeply undervalued, why has China had to buy around $1 billion a day of foreign currency to keep it from rising? 
 The effect of this currency undervaluation is twofold: it makes Chinese goods artificially cheap to foreigners, while making foreign goods artificially expensive to the Chinese. That is, it's as if China were simultaneously subsidizing its exports and placing a protective tariff on its imports.
 This policy is very damaging at a time when much of the world economy remains deeply depressed. In normal times, you could argue that Chinese purchases of U.S. bonds, while distorting trade, were at least supplying us with cheap credit -- and you could argue that it wasn't China's fault that we used that credit to inflate a vast, destructive housing bubble. But right now we're awash in cheap credit; what's lacking is sufficient demand for goods and services to generate the jobs we need. And China, by running an artificial trade surplus, is aggravating that problem.
 This does not, by the way, mean that China gains from its currency policy. The undervalued renminbi is good for politically influential export companies. But these companies hoard cash rather than passing on the benefits to their workers, hence the recent wave of strikes. Meanwhile, the weak renminbi creates inflationary pressures and diverts a huge fraction of China's national income into the purchase of foreign assets with a very low rate of return. 
 So where does last week's policy announcement fit into all this? Well, China has allowed the renminbi to rise -- but barely. As of Thursday, the currency was only about half a percent higher than its typical level before the announcement. And all indications are that watching the future movement of the renminbi will be like watching paint dry: Chinese officials are still making statements denying that a rise in their currency will do anything to reduce trade imbalances, and prices in the forward market, in which traders agree to exchange currencies at various points in the future, suggest a rise of only about 2 percent in the renminbi by the end of this year. This is basically a joke.
 What the Chinese have done, they claim, to increase the ''flexibility'' of their exchange rate: it's moving around more from day to day than it did in the past, sometimes up, sometimes down. 
 Of course, Chinese policy makers know perfectly well that although U.S. officials have indeed called for more currency flexibility, that was just a diplomatic euphemism for what America, and the world, wants (and has the right to demand): a much stronger renminbi. Having the currency bob up or down slightly makes no difference to the fundamentals.
 So what comes next? China's government is clearly trying to string the rest of us along, putting off action until something -- it's hard to say what -- comes up.
 That's not acceptable. China needs to stop giving us the runaround and deliver real change. And if it refuses, it's time to talk about trade sanctions.

HEADLINE: Democrats See Signs of Hope In Job Trends

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO

 BODY:
A struggling economy has historically meant trouble for the president's party in midterm elections. So it comes as no surprise that Democrats are girding for a tough November.
 They should be. The economy is slowly recovering but remains on its sickbed, and most signs still point to a rough cycle for the party. Political analysts expect Republicans to make gains -- possibly significant ones -- in Congress in November, threatening to retake the House and maybe even the Senate. 
 But digging deeper, beyond the national numbers, reveals at least a few glimmers of hope for Democrats -- still fairly distant and faint, but bright enough to get campaign strategists scanning the horizon and weighing the odds. 
 That is because different parts of the country are recovering at different rates -- and, in a bit of electoral good luck for the Democrats, some of the areas that are beginning to edge upward more quickly, like parts of Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York, happen to be in important battlegrounds for the House and the Senate. 
 ''A lot of the trend lines are turning positive in many of these contested areas,'' said Mark Zandi, a chief economist for Moody's Analytics. ''It really boils down to: Is there enough time for the trend lines to trump the still pretty difficult conditions in the minds of the voters?'' 
 Certainly, the economy will not be the only factor voters weigh at the ballot box. There are areas that weathered the recession relatively well where Democratic incumbents are still in danger. There are also places trailing the national recovery, like Nevada and Florida, which could hurt the party. 
 But officials from both parties agree that the economy remains -- at least, for the moment -- the paramount concern for most voters. And studies have shown that local conditions influence the degree to which economic worries figure into voters' decisions -- a kind of Tip O'Neill rule of pocketbook voting. 
 A detailed examination of House and Senate seats in play, alongside state and local economic data compiled by Moody's Analytics for The New York Times, yields some surprising bits of encouragement for Democrats but also adds color to the overall daunting picture confronting the party. At the very least, any such signs of hope are certain to affect the strategies being worked out now in campaigns.
 ''It's too early to know how the more rapid economic improvement in parts of the country will influence voters' decisions,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ''But there's no doubt that voters' perception of the future of the economy will be a main factor in determining their vote.''
 The Times has identified 114 House seats and 17 Senate seats that are expected to be the most competitive in November. The largest numbers of closely contested elections are expected to be in Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio, where The Times projects a combined 26 competitive House races. 
 All three states, coincidentally, are considered to be on the leading edge of the nation's recovery. Since December, they have added jobs at a faster rate than the country as a whole and even led the country in the total number of jobs added in April. One reason is that manufacturing, a traditional backbone, has been on the rebound; another is that these states generally did not suffer as acutely as other regions from the housing boom and bust. 
 While much attention has been paid to the nation's stubbornly high unemployment rate, political scientists have found little correlation between that measure and midterm elections results. Instead, they have found more broad-based indicators, particularly real personal disposable per capita income, which measures the amount of money a household has after taxes and inflation, to be better gauges.
 About a quarter of the House races The Times expects to be competitive in metropolitan areas that are projected by Moody's to have had positive, albeit mostly modest, after-tax personal income growth between 2009 and 2010. They include several swing districts in upstate New York that have long struggled economically but largely escaped the real estate bubble. 
 In New York's 24th Congressional District, for example, Representative Mike Arcuri, a Democrat, said he senses the improvement but has to be careful about how he couches it with voters.
 ''They just want to know there's light at the end of the tunnel,'' he said. ''I think they're just starting to see that.''
 The economic forecasting company also predicts housing prices will rise in metropolitan areas connected to a fifth of the competitive House seats identified by The Times. The forecasters project three-quarters of the competitive districts will experience employment growth in their corresponding metropolitan areas between the fourth quarter of 2009 and the fourth quarter of 2010. 
 The picture is grimmer for Democrats when it comes to the 17 Senate races that are expected to be in play. Only one state on the list, Connecticut, is projected to have experienced disposable income growth from 2009 to 2010. On the other hand, all but one state, Nevada, are predicted by Moody's to experience job gains between the fourth quarter of 2009 and the fourth quarter of 2010.
 Unfortunately for Democrats, important Senate battlegrounds like Nevada -- where the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, is fighting for his political life -- and Florida are predicted to be among the last to begin experiencing steady employment growth, with economists not forecasting consistent increases until late 2010 or early 2011. 
 Both states suffered the worst of the over-speculation on housing. Making matters worse for Democrats, both lived through a long, happy Sun Belt boom, so economic turmoil is a relatively new experience for residents -- and studies indicate it is such locales where economic anxiety is most likely to drive voters' decisions.
 Ohio promises to be an interesting laboratory. At least eight competitive House races are expected there, as well as a hard-fought Senate race. A struggling Rust Belt state, it gained more than 37,000 jobs in April, the largest increase for the state in years. But Ohio remains a long way from replacing the roughly 400,000 jobs it has lost since 2007. 
 ''The question is: how big are people's memories?'' said James Diffley, a managing director at IHS Global Insight. 
 Historically, political scientists have found that voters' memories tend to be short. Larry M. Bartels, a political scientist at Princeton, has studied the impact of economic conditions on presidential elections and found that it is the second and third quarters of the election year that matter most.
 In the end, however, the ultimate deciding factor will be voters' perceptions -- not how well the economy is actually doing, but how well voters believe it is doing. 
 With communities climbing from such dire straits, it remains to be seen whether modest economic gains will be enough.

HEADLINE: Dressed Up and Ready, Canada Town Is Stood Up

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

 BODY:
HUNTSVILLE, Ontario -- The community center here, home to the town's all-important ice rink, used to have the architectural charm of a machine shop. 
 But recently, its formerly bland facade was remade with stone and timber in a style that Canadians call Muskoka, after this tourist regiona couple of hours north of Toronto, but Americans might describe as Adirondack. Inside, through the center's new two-story atrium, sits the fulfillment of Huntsville's decades-old dream: a second, Olympic-size ice rink. 
 Out back, up through a rock cut that is part of a new $4.8 million road, a building that resembles a vastly oversized summer cottage now sits ready to serve as a satellite campus for the University of Waterloo. And the villages and other towns, which lie along the numerous lakes with rocky granite shorelines that are Muskoka's signature, now boast new public washrooms, statues, gazebos and flower boxes. 
 The source of the region's prosperous new look can be found in the community center's new name. Brass letters under its vast portico now declare it to be the Canada Summit Centre. 
 If only that were so. Two years ago, the Canadian government picked this town of 20,000 to host the Group of 8 summit meeting this weekend. That set off a spending spree that now totals nearly $48 million by the government's last estimate, or nearly $93 million by the calculations of the opposition Liberal Party. 
 But then the leaders of the world's wealthiest nations spoiled the fun. Last September, they decided that the Group of 20 meeting would replace the Group of 8 as their flagship economic summit meeting. And what was supposed to be Huntsville's moment of glory is increasingly becoming a minor national scandal.
 After the leaders first announced that Huntsville would take over the larger meeting, it became apparent to the government that the summer resort town was much too small to do the job. The Group of 20 meeting will now be in Toronto. 
 Huntsville's consolation prize is a brief meeting of the Group of 8 leaders at a resort here before they helicopter off for their real work in Toronto. So brief will the meeting be, however, that neither the Summit Centre nor the new University of Waterloo campus will apparently perform any summit-meeting functions that could even vaguely justify the cost. 
 Adding to the public disenchantment, a recently released security budget estimates that it will cost roughly $891 million to protect the leaders, partly because of the two locations. 
 But what seems to have particularly inflamed the Canadian public is the construction of a large wading pool in Toronto surrounded by walls of canoes and featuring a dock with Muskoka chairs, a video screen and recorded bird song. The ''fake lake,'' as it has come to be known, is intended to give visiting reporters, the vast majority of whom will not be allowed to travel to Huntsville for the Group of 8 sideshow, a feeling for the Muskoka experience that they will never have.
 The federal government's summit-meeting office did not respond to questions about the Huntsville facilities. Mayor Claude Doughty, said it appeared that the community center would now serve as a security check-in for employees of the lakeside resort hosting the meeting and would provide, as he put it, ''strategic logistics as it relates to security.'' Given that the police, military and intelligence services have built an instant village of 800 trailers in a quarry much closer to the Group of 20 meeting site, the rink is probably not a central component of their operations.
 And the building that will eventually be leased by the university? Mr. Doughty said it was supposed to house a youth summit meeting. That, however, was moved by the federal government to a resort elsewhere in Muskoka. The new building is likely to sit empty this weekend.
 The Liberal Party contends that most of the spending in Muskoka has less to do with the summit meeting than with the political needs of Tony Clement, the Conservative member of Parliament for the area. Mr. Clement was parachuted into Muskoka from Toronto by the Conservative Party as a candidate in 2006 and squeaked in with a margin of just 28 votes, although he was re-elected in 2008.
 While boasting about the town's improvements, Mr. Doughty made it clear that he and other municipal politicians in the region used Mr. Clement to get all they could out of the federal government. When asked why Parry Sound, a town well over an hour by car from Huntsville, received $1.25 million of federal money for new sidewalks and a fountain, Mr. Doughty chuckled and noted that Mr. Clement's electoral district was called Parry Sound-Muskoka. 
 Mr. Clement, whose office did not respond to an interview request, said his efforts to promote tourism and business in his district were ''valid and legitimate.'' The security budget, which follows a $1 billion security bill for the 2010 Winter Olympics, is substantially higher than those for other recent summit meetings. But Ward P. D. Elcock, the Canadian government's security coordinator for both meetings, defended the expenditures by suggesting that other nations simply understate their actual spending. 
 ''I think Canada is one of the rare countries that has actually been transparent about the security costs,'' he told CTV, a Canadian television network. The uproar over the spending for the summit meeting has prompted suggestions that the Group of 20 find a permanent, easily secured home rather than moving from country to country each year.
 Even Mr. Doughty, though delighted with the town's gains, acknowledged that there might be some merit in the idea.
 ''Most people think that with the security thing, we've just gone too far with those costs,'' he said. ''Is there a better way of doing it? That's a great question to ask. The whole format of how these things are run really gets expensive.''

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart Gains in Its Wooing of Chicago

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD; Emma Graves Fitzsimmons contributed reporting.

 BODY:
What would it take for urban areas to welcome Wal-Mart?
 The answer seems to be a terrible job market and stores that do not look much like traditional big boxes.
 The retailer, whose sales in the United States are weak, has almost exhausted growth possibilities in suburbs and small towns, and now is looking at urban neighborhoods. It is starting with Chicago, where on Thursday, the City Council zoning committee unanimously approved plans for a Wal-Mart on the city's South Side, an area where the company has been trying to build for about six years.
 If Wal-Mart can succeed in the urban market, that could mean several hundred stores just in major cities like New York, Chicago and Detroit, bringing several hundred million dollars in additional earnings, analysts said. 
 To fit into cities, Wal-Mart is proposing to make itself more trial-size. It would shrink its stores to as small as 8,000 square feet, about 4 percent of the size of an average supercenter. It is considering formats that are primarily groceries, stores where customers can order something online and pick it up, stores where local business owners can lease space, and even formats like bodegas.
 For the South Side store, the company, long a target of labor unions, has even agreed to pay entry-level workers 50 cents above the minimum wage, Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago said. Wal-Mart declined to confirm that figure, saying that it was only committing publicly to a ''competitive wage.'' 
 ''We have very small market share in the large cities within the United States, so we see a big opportunity for us to grow in those urban markets,'' said Hank Mullany, who runs Wal-Mart stores in the Midwest, Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions.
 The strategy, he said, would be to ''get our stores as close to our customers as possible, so in urban markets, we'll be doing that with multiple formats.''
 But while Wal-Mart seems to finally be moving forward in Chicago, politicians in other cities still oppose the retailer, saying that it hurts local businesses and does not pay fair wages.
 ''People don't have to think that the only place they can get low prices and jobs is through Wal-Mart,'' said New York City Councilman Charles Barron, of Brooklyn, who opposes efforts to bring a Wal-Mart store to East New York. ''They damage the economy of your community.''
 As the Chicago vote showed, economic concerns can change opinions. Many Chicago politicians objected when Wal-Mart first tried to open a South Side store several years ago. Wal-Mart's only Chicago store opened in 2006 on the West Side.
 In 2006, the City Council passed a measure requiring big-box stores like Wal-Mart to pay certain wages. But Mr. Daley vetoed the measure, his first veto as mayor. ''The shift has been the seriousness of the recession,'' he said in an interview Thursday. Wal-Mart publicly revived plans for a South Side store this year, when it said it wanted to move into a new development called Pullman Park. This time, although it still faced union opposition, it gained vocal support from some politicians and ministers from the area.
 ''We need jobs for our neighborhood, and Wal-Mart is willing to come, and they're willing to provide the jobs,'' said the Rev. Dr. D. Darrell Griffin, the pastor at Oakdale Covenant Church. 
 Politicians who supported the Wal-Mart store said they did so in part because of employment and revenue for the city. 
 ''There are major corporations willing to invest significant money within our communities, which has not been done, really, since the '60s, when a lot of the corporations left the communities after the riots,'' said Howard B. Brookins Jr., a member of the council. ''This is huge for us.''
 As Thursday's vote approached, Wal-Mart said it was planning several dozen stores in Chicago that would add 12,000 jobs over five years, and more than $500 million in sales taxes and property taxes for the city, according to the company's estimates. The South Side store would open in early 2012.
 In meetings with Wal-Mart, Chicago politicians won some concessions. For example, the Chicago stores will all be union-built, and Wal-Mart agreed to donate $20 million to neighborhood charities. Most significantly for a company that has been loath to strike deals on wages, Wal-Mart had agreed to an entry-level wage of $8.75 an hour, 50 cents higher than Chicago's minimum wage as of July 1, Mr. Daley said. 
 On Thursday, the zoning committee meeting was filled with about 200 onlookers wearing T-shirts with the Wal-Mart logo and slogans like, ''Our neighborhood. Our jobs. Our decision.'' 
 Before he asked for a simple yes or no vote, Daniel Solis, chairman of the zoning committee, told the crowd, ''We are now the model in this country.''
 After the unanimous vote -- which sends the proposal to the full City Council, where it is expected to pass next week -- the audience stood and cheered. 
 ''It's going to bring jobs and help the community,'' Shawn Polk, 20, a college student who lives near the proposed store, said afterward. 
 Analysts differed on whether approval of the proposal by the Chicago City Council would mean an easier time for Wal-Mart in other cities.
 Dorian T. Warren, a Columbia University professor who is writing a book on the anti-Wal-Mart movement, said New York, in particular, would be challenging.
 ''New York has so much more density of, especially, small businesses, and I think the City Council is much more unified ideologically against Wal-Mart than the Chicago City Council is,'' he said.
 But David Strasser, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott, said he expected the Chicago project would open the door for Wal-Mart to other cities. 
 ''On the corridor from Boston to D.C., Wal-Mart is so under-penetrated,'' he said. ''That opportunity is tremendous, and if you're seeing that mentality from the unions in Chicago, you're going to see that in the northeast corridor.''

HEADLINE: Bill on Jobless Benefits Stalls in Senate

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Legislation to extend unemployment subsidies for hundreds of thousands of Americans who have exhausted their jobless benefits teetered on the edge of collapse on Thursday, as Senate Democrats and Republicans traded bitter accusations about who was to blame for an eight-week impasse.
 Senate Republicans and a lone Democrat, Ben Nelson of Nebraska, joined forces to filibuster the bill in a procedural vote on Thursday. Visibly frustrated, the majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said he would move on to other business next week because he saw little chance of winning over any Republican votes. 
 The vote was 57 to 41, with the Democrats falling three short of the 60 votes needed to advance the measure. 
 ''You'll hear a lot of excuses,'' Mr. Reid said at a news conference. ''The bottom line is the minority just said no.'' 
 Trying to appeal to Republicans, Mr. Reid on Wednesday night introduced yet another version of the legislation, which also includes important tax changes. But even as he unveiled the new package, aides conceded he did not have the votes. 
 The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has insisted that the bill not add to the deficit. Democrats argued that they had found ways to cover the entire cost of the $112 billion measure, with the exception of the $35.5 billion extension of unemployment benefits, which some Republicans said they could accept. 
 But some Republicans who had been negotiating with Mr. Reid said they remained opposed to tax increases in the bill, and Mr. McConnell insisted that Republicans would not support any increase in the deficit. 
 To dramatize the point, after blocking the Democrats' bill, Mr. McConnell proposed a one-month extension of unemployment benefits and some other safety-net spending, to be paid for with about $10 billion in unspent money from last year's economic stimulus program. 
 Democrats had already proposed using some stimulus money to help pay for the bill, and Mr. McConnell said he was simply endorsing the same idea. 
 ''The only thing Republicans have opposed in this debate are job-killing taxes and adding to the national debt,'' Mr. McConnell said. Anticipating that Democrats would reject his proposal, he added, ''Their commitment to deficit spending trumps their desire to help the unemployed.'' 
 The Obama administration has not fought aggressively for the legislation but the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, issued a statement chastising Republicans for opposing the bill. 
 ''Republicans in the Senate obstructed a common-sense package that would save jobs, extend tax cuts for businesses and provide relief for American families,'' Mr. Gibbs said, adding, ''The president will continue to press Congress to pass this bill and bring this relief that's critical to our economic recovery.'' 
 Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Finance Committee, who is the primary sponsor of the legislation, said the bill had been cut back by about $100 billion in response to Republicans' demands for a smaller package. 
 In the latest version, the Democrats pared a provision to extend higher Medicaid reimbursement for the states, to $16 billion from $24 billion, and also found offsets in spending to cover the cost. 
 Democrats, citing data by the National Employment Law Project, say that without Congressional action, 1.2 million Americans will exhaust their jobless benefits by the end of the month. 
 The legislation would reinstate numerous expired tax breaks, as well as provide an array of safety-net spending. To help cover the cost, Democrats also proposed shifting some unspent money from last year's economic stimulus program, a move that prompted Republican cheers. 
 Even some Democrats have expressed deep reservations about adding to the nation's fast-growing deficit. Mr. Nelson and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, who caucuses with the Democrats, have joined with Republicans in opposing the bill. 
 House Democrats did not include the extra Medicaid money for states in its version of the bill out of concern for the cost.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Russia Focus on Trade, With Burgers on Side

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With recent accords on national security behind them, President Obama and President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia engaged in a bit of economic summitry on Thursday, with Mr. Obama pushing for more exports to Russia and Mr. Medvedev seeking more American business investment, especially in technology. 
 ''Twenty years after the end of the cold war, the U.S.-Russian relationship has to be about more than just security and arms control,'' Mr. Obama said at a joint news conference. ''It has to be about our shared prosperity, and what we can build together.'' 
 The actual achievements on the economic front were modest. The United States promised to redouble its efforts to help Russia join the World Trade Organization, agreeing to try to complete years of negotiations by September. Russia said it would lift barriers to the multibillion-dollar importation of American chicken. And they agreed to promote collaboration on clean-energy technologies. 
 More than anything, the events surrounding Mr. Medvedev's visit served to underscore both the personal rapport the two men have developed and, more broadly, the increased cooperation between the countries after years of tension that reached a low point in August 2008, when Russia went to war with Georgia, its smaller neighbor and an American ally.
 At the news conference in the ornate East Room of the White House, both presidents acknowledged that they had discussed their continuing differences over Georgia. Through an interpreter, Mr. Medvedev described the war as ''the conflict that was initiated by Georgia's leadership.''
 Mostly, however, they emphasized common ground, with Mr. Obama saying that he and Mr. Medvedev had had ''excellent discussions, discussions that would have been unlikely just 17 months ago,'' when the countries' relationship ''had drifted perhaps to its lowest point since the cold war.''
 After a morning of White House meetings, the presidents went to Ray's Hell Burger, a popular spot in a Virginia suburb for cheeseburgers and fries. They returned for the news conference, throughout which Mr. Medvedev smiled widely. He joked that the Americans' hospitality was so complete, ''even the weather is so warm.'' And he recalled a recent phone conversation with Mr. Obama that lasted an hour and 45 minutes, adding, ''The ear starts getting stiff.'' 
 Afterward, despite a temperature of 100 degrees, the two men slung their suit jackets over their shoulders and walked from the White House across Lafayette Park to the headquarters of the United States Chamber of Commerce. There, they attended a conference with American and Russian business leaders who are involved in major trade and investment deals in aerospace, automotives, finance and technology, among other fields. 
 The meeting was the presidents' seventh since Mr. Obama took office 17 months ago, and his invitation to Mr. Medvedev to come to the White House reciprocated for Mr. Obama's visit to Moscow last July.
 They initially met for nearly an hour on Thursday, joined by a few advisers from both sides, including Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. A meeting with an expanded group followed; it included Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; Gen. James L. Jones, Mr. Obama's national security adviser; and several economic advisers, including Lawrence H. Summers, the director of the White House National Economic Council; Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke; and Ron Kirk, the United States trade representative.
 The participation of each president's economic advisers reflected what Obama administration officials have called a new phase in the ''reset'' of the relationship between the United States and Russia that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton have sought since the strains of the Bush years. They seek to move beyond the national security issues that have defined relations between Washington and Moscow for decades, both as allies and antagonists, to expanding economic ties.
 Having made progress with Russia on a range of security issues in recent months -- including a new treaty that further reduces each country's nuclear arsenal, sanctions resolutions in the United Nations against Iran and North Korea and cooperation on counterterrorism efforts -- Mr. Obama is turning more fully to the issues of trade and business cooperation, which frustrated his recent predecessors. The previous efforts foundered in part as American businesses encountered corruption and other white-collar crime in Russia as well as the government's often arbitrary actions against businesses.
 As it happened, separately visiting the White House on Thursday morning was Robert Dudley, the BP executive now in charge of his company's response to the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Mr. Dudley was forced out of Russia in 2008 after a fight over control of a joint venture between BP and Russian oil moguls.
 Earlier this week, Mr. Medvedev stopped in California to lobby Silicon Valley technology companies to assist in a similar Russian innovation center outside Moscow. Mr. Obama called high-tech innovation ''a personal passion'' of Mr. Medvedev's. Before Mr. Medvedev left Russia, as part of his broader modernization initiative, he opened an economic forum in St. Petersburg, Russia, at which he announced lower capital gains taxes for investors, a greater focus on privatizing industries, a stronger rule of law and specifically new efforts against white-collar crime, plus liberalized access to tourist visas and work permits. 
 Klaus Kleinfeld, the chairman of Alcoa and of the U.S.-Russia Business Council, who was among the executives who met with the presidents at the Chamber of Commerce, hailed the opportunities for businesses in Russia. 
 ''There is always a skepticism when it comes to change,'' he said. ''At the same time, I think you have to give Russia the benefit of the doubt and also look at the actions that have been happening, particularly in the last year.''
 Mr. Kleinfeld cited ''a new quality in the relations, both in politics and business'' -- not least the relationship between Mr. Obama and Mr. Medvedev. ''The two leaders are really getting along very well; there's a lot of progress on the political front,'' he said, adding, ''Business will now follow.''

HEADLINE: The Immigration Reform Team

 BODY:
Mayor Michael Bloomberg, making good on an inaugural pledge, has stepped up to help lead the national battle for immigration reform. On Thursday, he announced a partnership of mayors and business leaders to make the economic case for reform, including mayors of Los Angeles, Philadelphia, San Antonio, Phoenix, and top executives of companies like Walt Disney, Hewlett-Packard, Boeing and the New York Mets. 
 Rupert Murdoch -- chairman of the News Corporation, naturalized citizen and member of the coalition -- stated its views succinctly: ''This country can and must enact new immigration policies that fulfill our employment needs, provide a careful pathway to legal status for undocumented residents, and end illegal immigration.'' 
 Mr. Bloomberg was even blunter in making the case for reforming immigration policy, in which restrictive laws, stifling bureaucracy and aggressive enforcement have closed the path to green cards or citizenship for millions of hopeful entrepreneurs, workers and other would-be Americans. He called it ''national suicide.'' 
 Theirs is the capsule version of the argument for comprehensive legislation that the country has needed for years but that has failed in Congress for years.
 Hopes for passage this year are quite dim, but the argument still needs to be made. If anyone can make it, it's the mayor of New York City, which is at the heart of America's immigrant story. 
 Mr. Bloomberg and his partners recognize that people who are dynamic, hard-working, entrepreneurial, innovative and creative are the kinds of people any city, or country, should want. More green cards mean more start-up companies and jobs. 
 (The mayor's strong case would be even stronger if he weren't trying to eliminate some legal services and English classes for immigrants. A tiny city program, Immigrant Opportunities Initiative, saw its budget halved to $5 million in fiscal 2010, and then zeroed out in the mayor's 2011 budget. He should find the money.)
 The unfortunate side of Mr. Bloomberg's welcome entry into the immigration debate is that it is necessary at all. The White House and Congress should be stepping up to the issue.

HEADLINE: Oliver Stone, Tour Guide

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
Political documentaries shadowed by paranoia and apocalyptic foreboding are so commonplace nowadays that ''South of the Border,''Oliver Stone's celebration of the leftward tilt of South American politics, comes as a cheerful surprise. As anyone who remembers ''JFK,'' his 1991 film about the Kennedy assassination, can attest, Mr. Stone has his own paranoid tendencies, but they are muted in this provocative, if shallow, exaltation of Latin American socialism. 
 During ''South of the Border'' Mr. Stone schmoozes with several left-wing political leaders, including his good buddy the Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez; he takes Mr. Stone to his childhood home, where Mr. Chavez mounts a children's bike that collapses under him. Mr. Chavez comes across as a rough-hewn but good-hearted man of the people whose bullheaded determination is softened by a sense of humor. At a corn-processing factory, he jokes: ''This is where we build the Iranian atomic bomb. A corn bomb.'' Ho, ho, ho. 
 Mr. Stone's visit with Mr. Chavez is the movie's longest interview with a Latin American statesman during what feels like a whirlwind tour of South American capitals. Instead of the saber-rattling, America-hating tyrants often depicted on American television (especially Fox News, several of whose extreme fulminations are excerpted for comic effect), Mr. Stone finds sensible, plain-spoken men (and one woman, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner). They are well aware of how power works in the global arena. Those who have it use it for their own advantage; it's the way of the world.
 The two demonic influences named in the movie are the American-controlled International Monetary Fund and the ''private media.'' Mrs. Kirchner recalls resisting pressure to keep borrowing from the fund rather than pay back what was owed. Mr. Chavez repeatedly triumphs despite the almost unanimous hostility of Venezuela's privately owned media.
 Other leaders interviewed include Mrs. Kirchner's husband, Nestor Kirchner, who preceded her as president, and the presidents of Bolivia (Evo Morales), Brazil (Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva), Paraguay (Fernando Lugo), Ecuador (Rafael Correa) and Cuba (Raul Castro). 
 The film's macrocosmic overview focuses on South America's leaders, not on the populace. Each country is given a brief, sketchy history. There are no serious interviews with the poor to determine how everyday lives have changed under these socialist governments, and there is no mention of the human rights abuses in Venezuela reported by Amnesty International. Mr. Chavez is looked on favorably by his left-wing neighbors.
 Mr. Chavez, who receives the most screen time, offers a grandiose historical worldview. In his rejection of American imperialism, he sees himself as a successor to Simon Bolivar, whose 19th-century revolution against the Spanish empire was interrupted when ''the American and British empires divided us in pieces.'' 
 ''We want to be ourselves,'' he declares. 
 The film is seasoned with unsettling tales of overbearing imperialist ways. Tariq Ali, the British-Pakistani historian who wrote the screenplay with Mark Weisbrot, describes what happened when the Bolivian government sold the water supply of Cochabamba to a consortium led by Bechtel, a United States corporation. When Bechtel, to protect its monopoly, persuaded the government to pass a law forbidding the poor to collect rainwater, the people rose up. 
 Mr. Kirchner recounts a conversation with George W. Bush about Argentina's financial crisis in which President Bush became irate at the suggestion that what the country needed was a Marshall Plan and insisted that the best way to revitalize an economy was through war.
 Mr. Correa tells of countering pressure from the United States to maintain a military base in Ecuador by agreeing to it only if the United States allowed Ecuador to establish one in Miami. 
 Because so little has been made in the United States about South America's leftward continental drift, ''South of the Border'' is a valuable, if naively idealistic, introductory tutorial on a significant international trend. It ultimately proffers the vision of a pan-South American union that is economically and politically strong enough to realize the Bolivarian dream.
 SOUTH OF THE BORDER

HEADLINE: Game, Set, and 3 Days Later, Match

BYLINE: By GREG BISHOP; Dave Seminara contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WIMBLEDON, England -- The final tally looked impossible, like a misprint or a joke. The numbers sat there on the scoreboard -- 6-4, 3-6, 6-7 (9), 7-6 (3), 70-68 -- daring those gathered around Court 18 at Wimbledon to believe they were authentic.
 No matter what John Isner, the winner, and Nicolas Mahut accomplish moving forward, no matter tournaments won, wives married or lives saved, they will be remembered more for one monumental match -- the longest recorded in professional tennis. One that started Tuesday, continued Wednesday, and ended Thursday after 183 games that lasted 11 hours 5 minutes.
''I got a little bit tired,'' Isner said afterward, his sense of humor firmly intact. 
 Minutes earlier, he had scratched out another match point, and fans who had staked out prime seats at Court 18 and those who were transfixed across the world held their collective breath. Isner spied an opening and shot a backhand screaming down the line.
 He fell backward as the ball bounced harmlessly out of reach, his 6-foot-9 frame wriggling on the lawn, like a giant child imprinting an angel in grass instead of snow. He stood slowly, gingerly, as if requiring a cane, then basked in the applause.
 Eventually, Isner lumbered toward the net, where he wrapped the distraught Mahut in an embrace equally tender and touching. The All England Club presented both players with crystal bowls and Champagne flutes, which seemed like a nice idea until the players held them awkwardly in tired arms.
 The match broke every conceivable length record in tennis, including longest match in time elapsed and number of games played. For comparison, it took Roger Federer 161 games to reach the final in 2006, while Jack Kramer needed a mere 167 games to capture the championship in 1947.
 Afterward, no one, not fellow players, not the commentators, not even the participants themselves believed a match like this one would be duplicated. While grass courts lend advantage to booming servers, while Wimbledon is never likely to institute tie breakers in the fifth set, 70-68 seemed too unfathomable, impossible even, to repeat.
 ''It will never, ever happen again,'' Andy Murray said. ''That's all you can say. What they did was incredible.''
 After deconstructing Jarkko Nieminen in front of Queen Elizabeth II on Centre Court, Murray saw Isner and Mahut in the locker room. Isner looked normal, Murray said. But it was Mahut who warmed up by running on a treadmill, as if the 118 games on Wednesday had not sapped his strength.
 ''The guy is an absolute warrior,'' Isner said of Mahut. ''This is something we'll share forever.''
 Isner skipped tournaments before Wimbledon, deciding instead to train in Tampa, Fla., for an additional eight days. Before he left, Isner said his coach joked that he would ''be able to play for 10 hours.'' Little did he know.
 The longest tennis match became international news long before it ended. Fans flocked to Court 18 and players gathered around televisions in the locker rooms.
 ''It's like that scene from the 'Gladiator,' '' said Justin Gimelstob, the retired pro. ''We salute you. It's one of the greatest examples of effort in sports of all time.''
 The players failed to finish the fifth set Wednesday, with the chair umpire, Mohamed Lahyani, suspending play for a second time after 7 hours 6 minutes at 59-59. On Thursday, Lahyani said he had nearly lost his voice the day before, but added: ''I travel economy. Seven hours sitting still on court is nothing.''
 Easy for him to say. Isner entered the locker room Wednesday night and collapsed into a chair. He said he felt delirious and remembered little after 25-25. His coach shoved a plate of pasta in front of him, but Isner could not eat. His fellow American Andy Roddick showed up later with takeout, three boxes of pizza, chicken, mashed potatoes.
 Isner slept four hours, waking with the sunrise. He said Mahut told him that he nodded off for only three.
 Play resumed at 10:42 a.m. Thursday, Eastern time. Isner promptly held serve. Mahut followed suit, and there it was, Groundhog Day on Court 18. It took 19 more games to settle matters.
 All around the tournament, fans whispered, debated and exulted about the first-round match that would not end. It overshadowed Federer's struggles in each of his first two matches and the dominance of the Williams sisters.
 Isner and Mahut even buried the queen's first appearance at this tournament since 1977 under an avalanche of aces. Rare is the day he steals the show from Federer, Isner deadpanned.
 In other Thursday matches, Murray and Robin Soderling, the fourth and sixth seeds, moved into the third round, while third-seeded Caroline Wozniacki and the former champions Maria Sharapova and Serena Williams advanced with ease. Rafael Nadal needed five sets, but he moved on as well.
 Not that anybody noticed.
 Reminded on court of his doubles match scheduled for later Thursday afternoon, Isner looked ill and called the question a ''sick joke.'' Mahut knew the feeling.
 ''At this moment, it's really painful,'' he said. ''We played the greatest match ever in the greatest place to play tennis.''
 Jean Hepner could sympathize. She lost what was once the longest tennis match to Vicki Nelson. She left tennis soon after.
 After watching Isner and Mahut, Hepner said it seemed like the worst part for the players was having to remain on the court for pictures immediately afterward. She said she would have felt like ''a fly being pinned.''
 ''Someone could really have a breakdown after a match like this,'' she said. ''It's going to be really hard for Mahut to get over this. Boy, I feel for him. Right now, reliving my epic match, my stomach is doing flip-flops.''
 Isner wore a Georgia Bulldogs T-shirt to his news conference, and his former teammate Jamie Hunt said Isner was known as the ''top competitor'' before he left for the pro ranks. Hunt added that anyone who believed Isner would automatically lose his second-round match, on Friday, would be mistaken.
 When Isner left Wednesday night, he said he felt as if the match had become a dream, and he expected to wake Thursday to reality. Instead, he resumed the longest match in tennis history, a dream in its own right, and won it.

HEADLINE: House Passes Plan to Stop Medicare Cuts to Doctors

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The House on Thursday approved a six-month plan to prevent a steep cut in doctors' fees paid by Medicare, agreeing to a short-term solution that Speaker Nancy Pelosi called ''totally inadequate'' but said the House had decided to adopt after concluding that the Senate was hopelessly gridlocked and could do no better. 
 The vote in the House was 417 to 1, with just one Democrat, Representative George Miller of California, in opposition. 
 The $6.4 billion measure reverses a 21 percent cut in physician payments that had raised the possibility that some doctors might begin to turn away those covered by Medicare. The measure is retroactive to June 1. 
 The legislation, known on Capitol Hill as the doc fix, was approved by the Senate last week without a roll-call vote after leaders of both parties agreed to separate it from a stalled package of tax changes and safety-net spending, including extended unemployment benefits. That bill remains stuck in the Senate. 
 Ms. Pelosi had initially said that the House would not approve the short-term doc fix. And at a news conference Thursday, she expressed frustration with the Senate, which has failed to act on more than 200 bills already approved by the House. 
 ''When they sent this very, very slim reed of a piece of legislation over to us, which wasn't even really that well written,'' Ms. Pelosi said, ''this was totally inadequate. Members said, 'No, we have to send something back that is bigger, but let's see what they can do on unemployment.' Well, it is clear they are not able to do anything this week.'' 
 She added, ''What we had hoped to do was send it back to them with unemployment insurance and the rest, but it is clear that at this time, they can't pass that.'' 
 Indeed, shortly after Ms. Pelosi's news conference, Senate Republicans and one Democrat, Ben Nelson of Nebraska, filibustered the bill to extend unemployment benefits. 
 To get the short-term doc fix through the Senate, the cost of the measure was offset by changes in Medicare billing regulations, antifraud provisions and the tightening of some pension rules, eliminating Republican objections that it would put the federal government deeper into debt. 
 Medicare officials had announced on Friday that they would begin processing claims for June at the lower rate, raising pressure on the House to accept the short-term adjustment.

HEADLINE: Raising Grades to Enhance Resumes

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''In Law Schools, Grades Go Up, Just Like That'' (front page, June 22):
 Raising the mandatory grading average is a disingenuous measure taken by law schools to appease students, many of whom are growing increasingly unhappy with the fact that they are graduating with crushing debt and meager job prospects.
 Raising grades does no more than slapping a Band-Aid on the sliced jugular of the grim employment situation. Class rank relative to other students remains the same, and employers need only ask for a student's class percentile to circumvent grade inflation. 
 If schools are sincerely concerned about the well-being of their graduates, perhaps they should devote more of their resources to assisting students with finding clerkships and jobs, and even subsidizing them, as mine does.
 At the very least, schools should address other factors within their control, like limiting the number of students enrolled so they can actually expect to find employment, or reining in skyrocketing law school tuition.
 Nathan Rogers Dallas, June 22, 2010
 The writer attends SMU Dedman School of Law. 
 To the Editor:
 As an undergraduate at Princeton, I currently experience the opposite of grade inflation -- grade deflation. While this system is highly unpopular with most students because of fears of graduate school and job market rejections, it encourages students to work harder. When a 4.0 or a 3.7 grade point average is an accomplishment, not a given, students will study more to earn it.
 Grade inflation promotes laziness and a sense of entitlement among students who feel that they should automatically get a good grade. Also, these grade-inflating schools are showing a sign of weakness by implying that the ''real'' grades certain students earn are too poor to get a job.
 Instead of rendering grades meaningless by continuing this G.P.A. arms race, schools should give good grades only to those who deserve them.
 Will Harrel Houston, June 22, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Do the law schools that practice grade inflation also teach a course in ethics?
 Pat Kovacs Scarsdale, N.Y., June 22, 2010
 To the Editor:
 The most important obligation of a teacher is to evaluate his or her students fairly. To do otherwise is a disservice to the students.
 Artificially raising the grades of students, or grading more leniently to help them get a job after school, is both failing to grade students fairly and a form of cheating.
 Law schools that knowingly inflate their students' grades demonstrate neither honesty nor integrity. Their actions are a disgrace to everyone involved.
 Samuel A. Oppenheim Franklin, Mass., June 22, 2010
 The writer is emeritus professor of history at California State University, Stanislaus.
 To the Editor:
 I am not pleased that law schools are inflating current students' grades to make them more competitive in the job market. I worked full time for four years while attending Georgetown Law's evening program, raised three children and commuted three hours round-trip daily. Unlike many of the single, childless, jobless full-time students I was being compared to, I earned a solid B average instead of a B-plus or A-minus.
 I have now been out of work for over a year. Can I have some bonus points for proving that I can handle an 80-hour-plus week? For balancing work and family? Where is my grade inflation? How is it fair to past graduates to change the curve, giving the new class something for nothing and making it even harder for those of us still searching for a job?
 Katherine Berland Columbia, Md., June 22, 2010
 To the Editor:
 My first thought after reading about grade inflation at our nation's law schools: Let's hope the medical schools don't follow suit.

HEADLINE: Computers That Listen to You Make Strides in Talking Back

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR and JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
''Hi, thanks for coming,'' the medical assistant says, greeting a mother with her 5-year-old son. ''Are you here for your child or yourself?''
 The boy, the mother replies. He has diarrhea.
 ''Oh no, sorry to hear that,'' she says, looking down at the boy.
 The assistant asks the mother about other symptoms, including fever (''slight'') and abdominal pain (''He hasn't been complaining'').
 She turns again to the boy. ''Has your tummy been hurting?'' Yes, he replies. 
 After a few more questions, the assistant declares herself ''not that concerned at this point.'' She schedules an appointment with a doctor in a couple of days. The mother leads her son from the room, holding his hand. But he keeps looking back at the assistant, fascinated, as if reluctant to leave.
 Maybe that is because the assistant is the disembodied likeness of a woman's face on a computer screen -- a no-frills avatar. Her words of sympathy are jerky, flat and mechanical. But she has the right stuff -- the ability to understand speech, recognize pediatric conditions and reason according to simple rules -- to make an initial diagnosis of a childhood ailment and its seriousness. And to win the trust of a little boy.
 ''Our young children and grandchildren will think it is completely natural to talk to machines that look at them and understand them,'' said Eric Horvitz, a computer scientist at Microsoft's research laboratory who led the medical avatar project, one of several intended to show how people and computers may communicate before long.
 For decades, computer scientists have been pursuing artificial intelligence -- the use of computers to simulate human thinking. But in recent years, rapid progress has been made in machines that can listen, speak, see, reason and learn, in their way. The prospect, according to scientists and economists, is not only that artificial intelligence will transform the way humans and machines communicate and collaborate, but will also eliminate millions of jobs, create many others and change the nature of work and daily routines.
 The artificial intelligence technology that has moved furthest into the mainstream is computer understanding of what humans are saying. People increasingly talk to their cellphones to find things, instead of typing. Both Google's and Microsoft's search services now respond to voice commands. More drivers are asking their cars to do things like find directions or play music.
 The number of American doctors using speech software to record and transcribe accounts of patient visits and treatments has more than tripled in the past three years to 150,000. The progress is striking. A few years ago, supraspinatus (a rotator cuff muscle) got translated as ''fish banana.'' Today, the software transcribes all kinds of medical terminology letter perfect, doctors say. It has more trouble with other words and grammar, requiring wording changes in about one of every four sentences, doctors say.
 ''It's unbelievably better than it was five years ago,'' said Dr. Michael A. Lee, a pediatrician in Norwood, Mass., who now routinely uses transcription software. ''But it struggles with 'she' and 'he,' for some reason. When I say 'she,' it writes 'he.' The technology is sexist. It likes to write 'he.' ''
 Meanwhile, translation software being tested by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is fast enough to keep up with some simple conversations. With some troops in Iraq, English is translated to Arabic and Arabic to English. But there is still a long way to go. When a soldier asked a civilian, ''What are you transporting in your truck?'' the Arabic reply was that the truck was ''carrying tomatoes.'' But the English translation became ''pregnant tomatoes.'' The speech software understood ''carrying,'' but not the context.
 Yet if far from perfect, speech recognition software is good enough to be useful in more ways all the time. Take call centers. Today, voice software enables many calls to be automated entirely. And more advanced systems can understand even a perplexed, rambling customer with a misbehaving product well enough to route the caller to someone trained in that product, saving time and frustration for the customer. They can detect anger in a caller's voice and respond accordingly -- usually by routing the call to a manager.
 So the outlook is uncertain for many of the estimated four million workers in American call centers or the nation's 100,000 medical transcriptionists, whose jobs were already threatened by outsourcing abroad. ''Basic work that can be automated is in the bull's-eye of both technology and globalization, and the rise of artificial intelligence just magnifies that reality,'' said Erik Brynjolfsson, an economist at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
 Still, Mr. Brynjolfsson says artificial intelligence will also spur innovation and create opportunities, both for individuals and entrepreneurial companies, just as the Internet has led to new businesses like Google and new forms of communication like blogs and social networking. Smart machines, experts predict, will someday tutor students, assist surgeons and safely drive cars.
 The Digital Assistant
 ''Hi, are you looking for Eric?'' asks the receptionist outside the office of Eric Horvitz at Microsoft.
 This assistant is an avatar, a time manager for office workers. Behind the female face on the screen is an arsenal of computing technology including speech understanding, image recognition and machine learning. The digital assistant taps databases that include the boss's calendar of meetings and appointments going back years, and his work patterns. Its software monitors his phone calls by length, person spoken to, time of day and day of the week. It also tracks his location and computer use by applications used -- e-mail, writing documents, browsing the Web -- for how long and time of day.
 When a colleague asks when Mr. Horvitz's meeting or phone call may be over, the avatar reviews that data looking for patterns -- for example, how long have calls to this person typically lasted, at similar times of day and days of the week, when Mr. Horvitz was also browsing the Web while talking? ''He should be free in five or six minutes,'' the avatar decides.
 The avatar has a database of all the boss's colleagues at work and relationships, from research team members to senior management, and it can schedule meetings. Mr. Horvitz has given the avatar rules for the kinds of meetings that are more and less interruptible. A session with a research peer, requiring deep concentration, may be scored as less interruptible than a meeting with a senior executive. ''It's O.K. to interrupt him,'' the assistant tells a visitor. ''Just go in.''
 As part of the project, the researchers plan to program the avatar to engage in ''work-related chitchat'' with colleagues who are waiting.
 The conversation could be about the boss's day: ''Eric's been in back-to-back meetings this afternoon. But he's looking forward to seeing you.'' Or work done with the boss: ''Yes, you were in the big quarterly review with Eric last month.'' Or even a local team: ''How about that Mariners game last night?''
 Mr. Horvitz shares a human administrative assistant with other senior scientists. The avatar's face is modeled after her. At Microsoft, workers typically handle their own calendars. So the main benefit of the personal assistant, Mr. Horvitz says, is to manage his time better and coordinate his work with colleagues'. ''I think of it as an extension of me,'' he said. ''The result is a broader, more effective Eric.''
 Computers with artificial intelligence can be thought of as the machine equivalent of idiot savants. They can be extremely good at skills that challenge the smartest humans, playing chess like a grandmaster or answering ''Jeopardy!'' questions like a champion. Yet those skills are in narrow domains of knowledge. What is far harder for a computer is common-sense skills like understanding the context of language and social situations when talking -- taking turns in conversation, for example.
 The scheduling assistant can plumb vast data vaults in a fraction of a second to find a pattern, but a few unfamiliar words leave it baffled. Jokes, irony and sarcasm do not compute.
 That brittleness can lead to mistakes. In the case of the office assistant, it might be a meeting missed or a scheduling mix-up. But the medical assistant could make more serious mistakes, like an incorrect diagnosis or a seriously ill child sent home.
 The Microsoft projects are only research initiatives, but they suggest where things are headed. And as speech recognition and other artificial intelligence technologies take on more tasks, there are concerns about the social impact of the technology and too little attention paid to its limitations.
 Smart machines, some warn, could be used as tools to isolate corporations, government and the affluent from the rest of society. Instead of people listening to restive customers and citizens, they say, it will be machines.
 ''Robot voices could be the perfect wall to protect institutions that don't want to deal with complaints,'' said Jaron Lanier, a computer scientist and author of ''You Are Not a Gadget'' (Knopf, 2010).
 Smarter Devices
 ''I'm looking for a reservation for two people tomorrow night at 8 at a romantic restaurant within walking distance.''
 That spoken request seems simple enough, but for a computer to respond intelligently requires a ballet of more than a dozen technologies.
 A host of companies -- AT&T, Microsoft, Google and startups -- are investing in services that hint at the concept of machines that can act on spoken commands. They go well beyond voice-enabled Internet search.
 Perhaps the furthest along is Siri, a Silicon Valley company offering a ''virtual personal assistant,'' a collection of software programs that can listen to a request, find information and take action.
 In this case, Siri, presented as an iPhone application, sends the spoken request for a romantic restaurant as an audio file to computers operated by Nuance Communications, the largest speech-recognition company, which convert it to text. The text is then returned to Siri's computers, which make educated guesses about the meaning.
 ''It's a bit like the task faced by a waiter for whom English is a second language in a noisy restaurant,'' said Tom Gruber, an artificial intelligence researcher and co-founder of Siri. ''It isn't perfect, but in context the waiter can usually figure out what you want.''
 The Siri system taps more data to decide if it is seeking a romantic restaurant or romantic comedy. It knows the location of the phone and has rules for the meaning of phrases like ''within walking distance.'' It scans online restaurant review services like Yelp and Gayot for ''romantic.''
 Siri takes the winnowed list of restaurants, contacts the online reservation service Open Table and gets matches for those with tables available at 8 the next day. Those restaurants are then displayed on the user's phone, and the reservation can be completed by tapping a button on the screen. The elaborate digital dance can be completed in a few seconds -- when it works.
 Apple is so impressed that it bought Siri in April in a private transaction estimated at more than $200 million.
 Nelson Walters, an MTV television producer in New York, is a Siri fan. It saves him time and impresses his girlfriend. ''I will no longer get lost in searching Yelp for restaurant recommendations,'' he said. But occasionally, Mr. Walters said, Siri stumbles. Recently, he asked Siri for the location of a sushi restaurant he knew. Siri replied with directions to an Asian escort service. ''I swear that's not what I was looking for,'' he said.
 Mr. Gruber said Siri had heard an unfamiliar Japanese word, but did not know the context and guessed wrong.
 In cars, too, speech recognition systems have vastly improved. In just three years, the Ford Motor Company, using Nuance software, has increased the number of speech commands its vehicles recognize from 100 words to 10,000 words and phrases.
 Systems like Ford's Sync are becoming popular options in new cars. They are also seen by some safety specialists as a defense, if imperfect, against the distracting array of small screens for GPS devices, smartphones and the like.
 Later this summer, a new model of the Ford Edge will recognize complete addresses, including city and state spoken in a single phrase, and respond by offering turn-by-turn directions.
 To the Customer's Rescue
 ''Please select one of the following products from our menu,'' the electronics giant Panasonic used to tell callers seeking help with products from power tools to plasma televisions.
 It was not working. Callers took an average of 2 1/2 minutes merely to wade through the menu, and 40 percent hung up in frustration. ''We were drowning in calls,'' recalled Donald Szczepaniak, vice president of customer service. Panasonic reached out to AT&T Labs in 2005 for help.
 The AT&T researchers worked with thousands of hours of recorded calls to the Panasonic center, in Chesapeake, Va., to build statistical models of words and phrases that callers used to describe products and problems, and to create a database that is constantly updated. ''It's a baby, and the more data you give it, the smarter it becomes,'' said Mazin Gilbert, a speech technology expert at AT&T Labs.
 The goal of the system is to identify key words -- among a person's spoken phrases and sentences -- so an automated assistant can intelligently reply.
 ''How may I help you?'' asked the automated female voice in one recording.
 ''I was watching 'American Idol' with my dog on Channel 5,'' a distraught woman on the line said recently, ''and suddenly my TV was stuck in Spanish.''
 ''What kind of TV?'' the automated assistant asked, suggesting choices that include plasma, LCD and others.
 ''LCD,'' replied the woman, and her call was sent to an agent trained in solving problems with LCD models.
 Simple problems -- like product registration or where to take a product for repairs -- can be resolved in the automated system alone. That technology has improved, but callers have also become more comfortable speaking to the system. A surprising number sign off by saying, ''Thank you.''
 Some callers, especially younger ones, also make things easier for the computer by uttering a key phrase like ''plasma help,'' Mr. Szczepaniak said. ''I call it the Google-ization of the customer,'' he said.
 Over all, half of the calls to Panasonic are handled in the automated system, up from 10 percent five years ago, estimated Lorraine Robbins, a manager.
 But the other half of calls are more complex problems -- like connecting a digital television to a cable box. In those cases, the speech recognition system quickly routes a call to an agent trained on the product, so far more problems are resolved with a single call. Today, Panasonic resolves one million more customer problems a year with 1.6 million fewer total calls than five years ago. The cost of resolving a customer issue has declined by 50 percent.
 The speech technology's automated problem sorting has enabled Panasonic to globalize its customer service, with inquiries about older and simpler products routed to its call centers in the Philippines and Jamaica. The Virginia center now focuses on high-end Panasonic products like plasma TVs and home theater equipment. And while the center's head count at 200 is the same as five years ago, the workers are more skilled these days. Those who have stayed have often been retrained.
 Antoine Andujar, a call center agent for more than five years, attended electronics courses taught at the call center by instructors from a local community college. He used to handle many products, but now specializes in issues with plasma and LCD televisions.
 Mr. Andujar completed his electronics certification program last year, and continues to study. ''You have to move up in skills,'' he said. ''At this point, you have to be certified in electronics to get in the door here as a Panasonic employee.''
 The Efficient Listener
 ''This call may be recorded for quality assurance purposes.''
 But at a growing number of consumer call centers, technical support desks and company hot lines, the listener is a computer. One that can recognize not only words but also emotions -- and listen for trends in customer complaints.
 In the telephone industry, for example, companies use speech recognition software to provide an early warning about changes in a competitor's calling plans. By detecting the frequent use of names like AT&T and other carriers, the software can alert the company to a rival that lowered prices, for example, far faster than would hundreds of customer service agents. The companies then have their customer agents make counteroffers to callers thinking of canceling service.
 Similar software, used by a customer of Verint Systems, began to notice the phrase ''cash for clunkers'' in hundreds of calls to its call center one weekend last year. It turned out that tens of thousands of car shoppers responding to the government incentive were calling for insurance quotes. Aetna created insurance offers for those particular callers and added workers to handle the volume.
 And as Apple's new smartphone surged in popularity several years ago, GoDaddy, an Internet services company, learned from its call-monitoring software that callers did not know how to use GoDaddy on their iPhones. The company rushed to retrain its agents to respond to the calls and pushed out an application allowing its users to control its service directly from the iPhone.
 Certain emotions are now routinely detected at many call centers, by recognizing specific words or phrases, or by detecting other attributes in conversations. Voicesense, an Israeli developer of speech analysis software, has algorithms that measure a dozen indicators, including breathing, conversation pace and tone, to warn agents and supervisors that callers have become upset or volatile.
 The real issue with artificial intelligence, as with any technology, is how it will be used. Automation is a remarkable tool of efficiency and convenience. Using an A.T.M. to make cash deposits and withdrawals beats standing in line to wait for a teller. If an automated voice system in a call center can answer a question, the machine is a better solution than lingering on hold for a customer service agent.
 Indeed, the increasing usefulness of artificial intelligence -- answering questions, completing simple tasks and assisting professionals -- means the technology will spread, despite the risks. It will be up to people to guide how it is used.
 ''It's not human intelligence, but it's getting to be very good machine intelligence,'' said Andries van Dam, a professor of computer science at Brown University. ''There are going to be all sorts of errors and problems, and you need human checks and balances, but having artificial intelligence is way better than not having it.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on June 25 about progress in speech recognition technology misidentified the company that used the technology to identify increased use of the phrase ''cash for clunkers.'' The company was a customer of Verint, which supplies speech analysis software to call centers; it was not Aetna Insurance. (Verint would not identify the customer.)

HEADLINE: Rich in Resources, Poor in Governance

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Curse of Plenty'' (Week in Review, June 20): 
 The discovery of vast mineral deposits in Afghanistan is far from good news for the people of Afghanistan. In addition to the challenges of extraction, security and economic stability, the Afghan people have to look forward to even more government corruption if the minerals under their feet are ever tapped.
 There is a link between rich natural resources and poor democratic governance. Strong democracies are built on a strong middle class, but natural resources tend to stratify an economy into lower-class laborers and upper-class owners. The exploitation industry does not have many positions for skilled and well-paid workers who would fill the middle class.
 In an economy based on natural resources, the wealth -- and power -- accrues to a small group who can push around politicians without reprisal from the hordes of impoverished workers. We can see this in Russia, where oil and gas barons gain special privileges from the Putinocracy as long as they adhere to the correct political alignments.
 Whatever the laws of a state, democracy will struggle when wealthy elites and government officials are cemented together in this self-supporting arrangement. And in Russia as elsewhere, the glue is made of natural resources.

HEADLINE: Weighing the Cost of Progress at a Failing School

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- As recently as 2008, Locke High School here was one of the nation's worst failing schools, and drew national attention for its hallway beatings, bathroom rapes and rooftop parties held by gangs. For every student who graduated, four others dropped out. 
 Now, two years after a charter school group took over, gang violence is sharply down, fewer students are dropping out, and test scores have inched upward. Newly planted olive trees in Locke's central plaza have helped transform the school's concrete quadrangle into a place where students congregate and do homework.
 ''It's changed a lot,'' said Leslie Maya, a senior. ''Before, kids were ditching school, you'd see constant fights, the lunches were nasty, the garden looked disgusting. Now there's security, the garden looks prettier, the teachers help us more.''
 Locke High represents both the opportunities and challenges of the Obama administration's $3.5 billion effort, financed largely by the economic stimulus bill, to overhaul thousands of the nation's failing schools. 
 The school has become a mecca for reformers, partly because the Department of Education Web site hails it as an exemplary turnaround effort.
 But progress is coming at considerable cost: an estimated $15 million over the planned four-year turnaround, largely financed by private foundations. That is more than twice the $6 million in federal turnaround money that the Department of Education has set as a cap for any single school. Skeptics say the Locke experience may be too costly to replicate.
 ''When people hear we spent $15 million, they say, 'You're insane,' '' said Marco Petruzzi, chief executive of Green Dot Public Schools, the nonprofit charter school group that has remade Locke. ''But when you look closely, you see it's not crazy.''
 Locke High, with 3,200 students, sprawls across six city blocks in south-central Los Angeles. The school's principal in 2007 complained publicly that the Los Angeles Unified School District had made it a dumping ground for problem teachers. 
 Kevin Rauda, a senior, recalled a teacher who read newspapers in class instead of teaching. In spring 2008, only 15 percent of students passed state math tests.
 Green Dot, which operates charter schools in Los Angeles and one in the Bronx, won control of Locke from the district in 2008 and began a turnaround effort. 
 In August 2008, Kevin King, a retired police lieutenant hired by Green Dot, toured Locke's campus and found broken windows, smashed lights, and security cameras that did not work. Teachers' cars were parked helter-skelter, including on some handball courts; gang members were selling drugs on others. 
 ''Kids couldn't even go to the bathroom without being pocket-checked or hassled,'' Mr. King said.
 He put together a new security force to expel the gangs. Green Dot fixed the lights and cameras, painted over graffiti, reorganized the parking, and hired bus companies to transport 500 students who previously walked dangerous streets to school.
 Green Dot divided Locke into small academies. Several, modeled on the charters it operates elsewhere, opened in fall 2008 with freshman classes of 100 to 150 students and are to reach full enrollment of 500 to 600 students by fall 2011.
 Other academies concentrate on remedial classes for older students, including some returning from jail. Another focuses on preparing students for careers in architecture.
 Green Dot required Locke's 120 teachers to reapply for their jobs. It rehired about 40, favoring teachers who showed enthusiasm and a belief that all Locke students could learn. The campus stays open each day until early evening for science tutoring, band and other activities. 
 Although state test scores administered in spring 2009, just months after the Green Dot makeover began, showed modest gains, Locke remained among California's lowest-performing schools. Still, a dozen students said in recent interviews that the school was safer and instruction had improved. 
 Hundreds of school districts across the nation will soon be trying makeovers, prodded by the Obama administration's push to remake the nation's 1,000 worst schools, and the availability of $3.5 billion in federal money.
 But if they rely on federal money alone, they will have to spend less than Green Dot. 
 Under rules set by Congress, districts can apply for up to $6 million for each failing school, to be spent over three years.
 During a Senate hearing in April, Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, congratulated Mr. Petruzzi on the Locke transformation, but also suggested its reliance on philanthropic donations would make it difficult to imitate.
 ''I'm thinking, how scalable is this?'' Mr. Franken said.
 In interviews, Mr. Petruzzi and other Green Dot officials offered a budget overview. Before and since Green Dot's takeover, tax dollars have financed Locke's annual operating budget of upward of $30 million, which during the four-year turnaround will total about $115 million, he said. 
 By then, expenditures will have exceeded that four-year, taxpayer-supported budget by about $15 million, with philanthropies making up most of the difference.
 Over the four years, Green Dot is set to spend about $2 million on increased security and busing. It spent about $700,000 to create a classroom for a new architecture academy. 
 Green Dot has also spent several million dollars for additional classroom space because hundreds of students who had cut school or dropped out now show up for class, Mr. Petruzzi said. 
 Dividing Locke into academies resulted in extra personnel costs, Mr. Petruzzi said, because each academy has its own principal and other staff members. 
 Another cost: the salaries of two psychologists and two social workers who help students endure hardships like losing a sibling to gang warfare, or being evicted. They have helped prevent several suicides this year, said Zeus Cubias, an assistant principal.
 Some new services for students have cost Green Dot nothing. Ms. Maya's grades have improved since a teacher noticed she could not see the blackboard. Her parents are unemployed, and she had no money for glasses. But she had her eyes tested at a mobile eye clinic that visited Locke in October, where Vision Service Plans, a nonprofit provider, donated eyeglasses to her and 200 other students.
 Experts are debating whether Locke is a good model for other turnarounds.
 Justin Cohen, a turnaround expert at MassInsight, a Massachusetts nonprofit organization, said most districts could expect to spend $2 million to $3 million over three years to overhaul a failing school. Costs often include teacher training and extending the school day, he said.
 ''I don't doubt they're putting all those resources to good use,'' Mr. Cohen said of Locke's $15 million costs. ''But that's high.''
 Tim Cawley, a managing director at the Academy for Urban School Leadership, a nonprofit group leading several turnaround efforts in Chicago, disagreed, arguing that even expenditures surpassing $15 million on a big school could be a smart national investment. 
 ''We're wasting billions every year by not fixing these schools,'' Mr. Cawley said, ''because the students they're not educating end up filling our prisons.''

HEADLINE: A Long, Hard Path To the Public

BYLINE: By SUSANNA G. KIM; Bettina Wassener contributed reporting.

 BODY:
In 2000, when three Yale undergraduates founded an online financial services company called Higher One Holdings, they had visions of rapid growth and successively bigger rounds of financing from investors. With any luck, momentum would build toward the ultimate dot-com dream: a stock listing on a major public exchange.
 Along the way, though, market forces placed obstacles in their path. First there was the collapse of the Internet bubble, followed by a drought in private equity activity.
 Then came a credit crisis that became a global banking crisis and, later, worries about European sovereign debt. As with so many other start-ups, Higher One's founders spent years building the company. 
 Finally, a decade after its founding, Higher One got its chance on June 17, raising nearly $35 million in an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares made their debut at $12 and closed on Thursday at $14.67, a slight rise from their first-day close.
 Many analysts view Higher One's success as a sign of a long-awaited thaw in the market for initial public offerings. About 62 companies have come to market this year in the United States, according to Thomson Reuters, outpacing the 61 that went public last year and the 34 that did so in 2008. An additional 125 companies have started the process in hopes of soon going public.
 The rise is being watched closely by venture capitalists and private equity investors who have been waiting years to cash out of their holdings in companies like Higher One.
 But the offerings are not without risk. Stock prices have been unusually volatile this year, with indexes soaring 10 percent from February to April, only to give back those gains and then some by June. A poorly timed initial offering can be disastrous for a company, for reasons having nothing to do with its own performance or prospects.
 ''Are things better today? Yes,'' said Mark G. Heesen, president of the National Venture Capital Association, adding that many venture firms had been waiting for the exit market to improve before raising money for new funds. ''But as I have said in the past, we've gone from a D+ to a C-.''
 That is one reason 21 companies have withdrawn or postponed their offerings this year, according to Renaissance Capital, among them Solyndra, a maker of solar panels. And a Bloomberg News report, citing unnamed sources, said the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts had postponed its plans to raise additional capital.
 ''It's a tough I.P.O. environment, but the best companies can get through the window,'' said Stewart Gross, a managing director at Lightyear Capital, a private equity firm that invested in Higher One in 2008 and helped guide it through the public offering process.
 Higher One was one of six companies that went public last week; they raised a total of $1.2 billion, the most in any week this year. Higher One initially set a share price range of $15 to $17, but lowered the target to $12 before the opening.
 On June 17, its first day of trading, Casey McGuane, Higher One's chief service officer, rang the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange. By day's end, the company's shares had risen 19 percent, to close at $14.27.
 How have this year's stock openings performed? Six priced above their filing ranges, 28 priced within their ranges and 32 priced below, according to Dealogic, which counts 66 offerings so far this year. The tepid results have companies that are considering public offerings closely watching the public markets.
 New stock listings are receiving attention not only for their swelling numbers but also for their size and brand-name appeal. Companies that have announced initial offering plans include Toys ''R'' Us, which is seeking to raise $800 million; the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton ($300 million); Tesla Motors, a maker of high-performance electric cars ($178 million); and Zipcar, the car-sharing service ($75 million).
 Also in the pipeline are larger deals like HCA, the hospital chain ($4.6 billion) and Nielsen Holdings ($1.75 billion).
 The largest initial offering this year could be that of Agricultural Bank of China, which is preparing a dual listing in Hong Kong and Shanghai for next month that could raise as much as $25 billion. The bank, which has about 24,000 branches with a focus on rural areas of China, started marketing its stock listing on Thursday.
 At Higher One's headquarters in New Haven, Conn., not far from Yale, Mark Volchek, one of the company's founders and now its chief financial officer, said he was always confident about the offering despite the unpredictable state of the markets.
 ''Everyone wishes the market was better,'' Mr. Volchek said. But unlike so many technology start-ups that went public a decade ago with virtually no revenue or track record, he added, ''we were a strong, profitable company.''
 According to its regulatory filings, Higher One had net income of $14.2 million on revenue of $75.5 million in 2009.
 Higher One is like an online alternative to the college bursar's office; it provides electronic payment and disbursement services for universities. It distributes financial aid and other money to students and provides banking services, including debit cards, online billing and a service that lets parents easily deposit money in student accounts.
 The company's founders initially wanted to expand the use of college ID cards for financial services. Sean Glass, who left Higher One in 2008 to start another company, said he had discussed the idea on his 20th birthday while driving with Mr. Volchek and Miles Lasater to an event for aspiring entrepreneurs in Boston in 1999.
 ''There were so many businesses formed in 1999 and 2000 which people had no idea would make any money,'' he said. ''We could see this was a service that was going to generate revenue.''
 Mr. Volchek recalled the difficulty they had in attracting a first round of investment, though they managed to raise $650,000 to get off the ground. By 2004, they had raised about $16 million and landed their first customer, the University of Houston.
 In August 2008, they raised $75 million from Lightyear Capital to finance growth and to distribute proceeds to early investors. The stake also set Higher One on a path to the initial stock offering, and valued the company at more than $800 million.
 Mr. Gross said Lightyear Capital always thought Higher One was a company whose business model, growth prospects and management team pointed toward a public offering.
 ''We just didn't know how long that might take,'' he said.
 Mr. Volchek said ringing the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange felt like the culmination of six months of diligent preparation. ''It's the beginning of a new phase for the company,'' he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 28, 2010

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about indications of a revival in initial public offerings misstated the intentions of the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts regarding moving its listing to New York from Amsterdam. The company had set no timetable for that move; thus, it did not postpone it. The article also misstated the year that Sean Glass, one of the founders of Higher One Holdings, which recently held an I.P.O., first discussed the idea for the company with two friends. It was 1999, not 2000.

HEADLINE: Politics and Money? Shocking. Shocking.

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN

 BODY:
It's too bad that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; Representative John A. Boehner, the United States House minority leader; and other big-time politicians couldn't find time on Monday to show up at the Dirksen Federal Building while they were in Chicago.
 But as hard as it might be to fathom, these other politicians were out raising money. Would you believe it? Raising money. 
Of course, that's what early testimony in the Rod R. Blagojevich trial suggests that the former governor was always busy doing. His hyperactive fund-raising apparently impinged on the modest and erratic hours he expended on state business during his impeachment-shortened tenure. 
 What many observers at the time sensed to be his indifference toward actual administration-type tasks meant that one former top aide, Bradley Tusk, found himself signing some bills in the governor's stead, according to Mr. Tusk's testimony.
 The drip, drip, drip of evidence against Mr. Blagojevich included the possibly hurtful testimony of John Johnston, a second-generation racetrack executive who oversees Maywood Park in Melrose Park and Balmoral Park in Crete.
 State legislation is important to his industry, so it's no surprise that Mr. Johnston was an active participant in the Wild West no-contributions-limit reality of Illinois politics, at least before a Jan. 1, 2009, law changed the rules. He testified that from 2002 to 2007, his various corporate entities contributed $320,000 to Mr. Blagojevich.
 In 2008, the racing industry was lobbying to extend a 2006 law that helped it out via a tax on competing riverboat casinos. It meant $1.5 million a year for three years to each of Mr. Johnston's tracks, which had been hurt by the recession and by a decline in patronage. And while he realized that Mr. Blagojevich was a lame duck, and thus he had no interest in contributing to a campaign fund, Mr. Johnston did hire Lon Monk, another former top Blagojevich aide, as a lobbyist at $150,000 a year. 
 Previous testimony showed that Mr. Monk parlayed his Blagojevich connections into a seven-figure sinecure. But Mr. Johnston did wonder for whom Mr. Monk was laboring when Mr. Monk tried to get him to contribute to Mr. Blagojevich. The implication, Mr. Johnston testified, was that he had best contribute or face a delay in the signing of the tax-extension bill, which had by then passed the legislature.
 Apparently unaware of MapQuest, Mr. Monk telephoned Mr. Johnston from the Blagojevich campaign headquarters and sought directions to Maywood Park. Mr. Johnston, suspecting what might be happening, made sure to have his ornery father, Billy, at the meeting, knowing that Mr. Monk would feel ''uncomfortable'' discussing contributions in the dad's presence.
 That apparently was the case. But Mr. Monk followed the younger Mr. Johnston out of the meeting and, cornering him alone in a stairwell, told him that there was concern that if the governor signed the bill right then, a Johnston contribution would not be forthcoming.
 Mr. Johnston, who was chagrined because Mr. Monk ''was supposed to be working on my behalf,'' sensed a quid pro quo at play.
 ''I felt the two were starting to be linked,'' Mr. Johnston said in his testimony.
 And he indicated, he said, that a combination of a bill signing and a campaign contribution ''would look wrong.''
 Since one doesn't reflexively associate participants in the racetrack business with moral purity, there was a certain damning implication in such hesitance. This wasn't a parish priest voicing ethical ambiguity. 
 Sam Adam, Mr. Blagojevich's savvy defense lawyer, did get Mr. Johnston to concede that the worst that might have happened with the bill was a 60-day delay. The governor could not totally get rid of it. Still, Mr. Johnston noted that such a delay would have cost his two tracks a total of $540,000.
 Again, it's too bad that spectators in the courtroom didn't include Mr. Biden and Mr. Boehner; Representatives Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin and Eric Cantor of Virginia, both Republicans; and Alexi Giannoulias, the Democratic candidate for the United States Senate in Illinois, and Dan Seals, the Democratic candidate in the state's 10th Congressional District.
 They were busy at four separate Chicago fund-raisers on Monday. So much of their lives, like Blago's back then, is about money. And, yes, the donors may have motives, too.

HEADLINE: Seeking Answers on Oil Spill as Questions Mount

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES. 
Reported by Felicity Barringer, John M. Broder, Robbie Brown, Damien Cave, Henry Fountain, Justin Gillis, Leslie Kaufman, Clifford Krauss, John Leland, Campbell Robertson, Elisabeth Rosenthal, John Schwartz and Tom Zeller Jr.

 BODY:
Since the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico in April, killing 11 and setting off the biggest maritime oil spill in the nation's history, questions about the potential dimensions of the disaster have only multiplied from week to week. Readers have been asking whether the oil can be contained, how serious the damage will be and what they can do to help. Following is a primer on the spill.
 Q. How far has the oil advanced along the Gulf Coast? How far could it travel, and what variables are at play? Have any communities been bypassed and spared?
A. So far, oil has made landfall along hundreds of miles of the Gulf Coast, from Freshwater Bayou in the middle of Louisiana's coastline, all the way to the Florida panhandle to just outside Panama City. The impact has not been uniform; some areas have been greatly affected, while others have been spared. For example, Mississippi's mainland coast, excepting its barrier islands, has been largely untouched by heavy oil, though that appears likely to change in the next few days. 
 The oil, either in the form of tar balls, sheen or heavier ''mousse,'' is brought near the coast by currents, but the wind is usually responsible for the final push, bringing streams of oil onshore. Coast Guard officials frequently describe the oil as a series of spills rather than one big slick, and that is reflected in the impact: oil is heading in all directions at the same time. 
 Shoreline trajectories, based on currents and wind patterns, are only dependable for roughly 72 hours. But scientists using computer models at the National Center for Atmospheric Research have suggested that the oil reaching the loop current in the Gulf of Mexico could come around Florida's southern tip within weeks. 
 After that, the modeling indicates, it would travel up the Atlantic Seaboard to North Carolina's Outer Banks, before joining the Gulf Stream and heading east across the Atlantic toward Europe. They caution, however, that this is not a forecast but merely a possibility, and that it is unclear how much the oil would dissipate as it traveled in these currents
 Q. How much oil has spilled so far?
 A. The exact rate at which oil is leaking from the well is not known. Although estimates of the flow rate have changed drastically -- to 35,000 to 60,000 barrels a day now, from 1,000 barrels a day originally -- it is also not known if the actual rate has changed in the two months since the gusher began.
 Calculating the spill to date using the current estimate, and factoring in the approximately 365,000 barrels collected so far from the wellhead, results in a total of about 1.9 million to 3.5 million barrels, or about 80 million to 150 million gallons since the rig exploded on April 20.
 By contrast, the Exxon Valdez spill off Alaska in 1989 released an estimated 10.8 million gallons of oil.
 Q. How might BP plug the leak?
 A. BP has tried a lot of methods to seal the well or contain the leak and until recently did not have much success. On June 3, however, technicians succeeded in cutting the riser -- the large pipe that connected the well at the seafloor to the drilling rig and that collapsed when the rig sank -- and two days later lowered a containment cap on it. 
 Although the cap did not make a perfect seal, it collected about 15,000 barrels of oil a day.
 In normal operation, the oil collected by the cap travels up a pipe to a drill ship, the Discoverer Enterprise, where it is stored and later loaded onto a tanker before heading to a refinery. Natural gas is separated from the oil and burned on a long boom extending from ships.
 On June 16, a second system began operating, in which oil is collected through a pipe at the base of the blowout preventer, the stack of safety valves at the top of the well on the seafloor. The oil flows up to a drill rig, the Q4000, where both the oil and the gas it contains are burned using special equipment that produces far less soot than open-air burning of oil.
 Q. Is there a sure long-term fix for the spill? When could that happen, best case and worst case? 
 A. Drilling experts say that two relief wells being drilled near the site of the blowout are the ultimate solution to stopping the gusher. Relief wells have been used to ''kill'' runaway wells in the past, and the basic procedure is straightforward.
 The relief well is drilled at an angle to intersect the damaged well just above the oil reservoir -- in this case, about 18,000 feet below sea level. Then heavy drilling mud is pumped down the relief well into the runaway well. As more and more mud is pumped in, it builds up a column of mud that produces enough downward force to counteract the upward pressure of the gas and oil, stopping the leak. Cement is then pumped into the well to entomb it permanently.
 Only one relief well should be needed, but BP is drilling a second in case anything goes wrong with the first. Both wells should be completed by late July or August, although they could be delayed. The wells have to find a seven-inch steel pipe that forms part of the runaway well, and although they have plenty of high-tech tools and data-gathering equipment to do that, there is no guarantee they will succeed on the first try.
 Mechanical problems or bad weather could also delay the work. A hurricane or other severe storm could also push back completion dates by a week or more, as the drilling rigs would have to shut down and move to a safe location. Bad weather would also affect the containment operation, as all the other vessels at the site of the blowout would have to depart and the well would be left uncapped until the storm had passed.
 Q. Doomsday scenarios described online suggest that the pipe that lines the well is deteriorating, or that there may be other problems with the well that may cause it to fail completely, leaving an utterly uncontrolled gusher that could prove difficult or impossible to control. Is this true?
 A. There is a lot of speculation about the condition of the well, but it is not really possible to know what kind of shape it is in. BP suggested that one reason that a procedure called the ''top kill'' failed was because there may have been damage to the well lining about 1,000 feet down. But no one knows for sure. 
 What does seem clear is that there is enough concern about not making the situation worse that BP is now pursuing only the containment option at the top of the well. They have abandoned efforts to permanently plug the well from the top because that would build up pressure that might cause damage. The well will be permanently sealed starting from the bottom, using one or both relief wells.
 Q. Who is in charge of stopping the oil that is already spilled from spreading and reaching the gulf shoreline?
 A. The Coast Guard, led by Adm. Thad W. Allen, has been designated the lead agency. In practice, day-to-day decisions are made jointly by Coast Guard personnel and their BP counterparts. At the spill response center in Venice, La., BP officials or contractors in charge of a certain task -- setting cleanup priorities, for instance, or allocating resources like containment boom -- are matched with Coast Guard officials with the same responsibility. One Coast Guard petty officer described the division of authority in percentage terms: ''It's 51-49, and we're the 51.'' 
 A unified command center has opened in New Orleans and incident command posts operate in Houma, La., Mobile, Ala., and Miami. Satellite posts exist elsewhere along the coast in places like Port Fourchon, La. and Venice, La.
 Q. How many people are working on the response, and what are they doing?
 A. Some 36,000 people are involved, according to the Deepwater Horizon Response Web site overseen by BP. A BP official said that included 1,185 Coast Guard personnel, 1,282 National Guardsmen and 667 BP officials. But the bulk of the personnel -- a total of nearly 31,000 -- work for contractors hired by BP, ranging from United States Environmental Services, based in New Orleans, to O'Brien's Response Management in Houston. 
 Out on the waters around the broken well, some 27 vessels with 230 crew members and support personnel are burning oil. Some 14,500 people are serving as mariners, crew members or captains on 2,680 ''vessels of opportunity'' recruited for the cleanup. Some are skimming oil -- either at sea, from specialized skimming vessels, or closer to shore with so-called ''drum'' skimmers, cylinders with surfaces that attract oil, which is then squeegeed off as the drum spins. 
 Others are laying ''hard'' vinyl boom and soft absorbent boom -- more than 475 miles of it -- to protect the marshes and beaches.
 The State of Louisiana has enlisted National Guardsmen to install 1.6 miles of welded-mesh steel barriers on one coastline; the goal is to cover eight miles. The guardsmen are also deploying cylindrical ''tiger dams'' on Grand Isle.
 The state-sponsored construction of sand berms was started in two places off Louisiana's fragile barrier islands and wetlands to keep the oil at bay, state officials say. But a dispute between state and federal authorities over where it is safe to dredge halted one project this week after 690,000 cubic yards of dredged material had been made available for berms. 
 In addition to the engineers and cleanup workers, more than 500 federal and state wildlife specialists are working on rescuing oiled animals and oiled habitat, said a BP spokesman, John Curry. That does not include an undetermined number of staff members and wildlife experts from nonprofit organizations and advocacy groups.
 Q. How are vessels assigned to work in various areas of the spill?
 A. The captains of these so-called vessels of opportunity register with the joint command and are assigned to work in a lottery, with the number picked on any given day based on regional need, said Michael R. Abendhoff, BP's director of government and public affairs. ''We're focusing on getting fishermen to work in an area they know,'' he said.
 Q. Is BP using anything to break up the oil? 
 A. BP has used large amounts of chemical dispersant in an attempt to reduce the damage caused by oil coming from the broken well. To date, it has sprayed 977,000 gallons of dispersant on the gulf's surface as well as applied 501,000 gallons to the leak, the company says. It is the largest volume of dispersants ever applied to a spill in United States waters. 
 Dispersants are detergent-like compounds that cause the oil to break up into tiny droplets, which sink below the surface and can be ''dispersed'' by sea currents. Until now, dispersants were always applied to oil on the surface; the deepwater application is a first. 
 Q. Could the chemicals themselves pose any environmental risks?
 A. Although concentrated dispersant is mildly to moderately toxic, the notion is that the diluted dispersant is less toxic than the concentrated oil it treats. And it is far less toxic when diluted in the vast volume of the seas. 
 But the use of such large volumes of dispersant, and its application in a novel setting like the wellhead, constitute an experiment of epic proportions. So far, officials from the Environmental Protection Agency say they have seen no ill effect from the chemicals.
 BP has used dispersants from the Corexit line of products, a source of some controversy; their use has been banned in Britain because of risks they pose to marine life along rocky coasts. Weeks ago, the E.P.A.instructed BP to identify and start using a newer, less toxic dispersant. BP did not do so, arguing that Corexit products were the best available and that there was no gold standard for evaluating the toxicity of dispersants. 
 Dispersant use peaked in late May. On May 26, the E.P.A. and Coast Guard instructed BP to significantly reduce the amount of dispersant it was applying to the Gulf, and it has since done so. 
 Q. Has wildlife taken a hard hit? How many animals have been killed?
 A. Oil is toxic to many forms of wildlife, and the spill is surely killing or harming untold numbers of creatures at sea and on land. That said, calculating the number of fatalities specifically attributed to the oil may be nigh impossible. Every day, federal officials release a count of dead and impaired animals that they have found along the gulf beaches since the spill began. Nearly 2,000 birds, 550 sea turtles and dozens of marine mammals have been counted.
 But that tally is far from a reliable measure. For starters, it is not clear that most of those animals were killed by oil. In fact, many of the dead animals were not even visibly oiled. And many were so decomposed by the time they were spotted that postmortems will never be done.
 But if the count is way off, it is probably an undercount. Most animals, particularly sea creatures, live far from where humans spot them. For every bird found covered by petroleum muck on a beach, there are untold others who simply die on an secluded beach. For every dolphin that washes ashore, there is another that sinks at sea, and so on.
 It is also virtually certain that fish larvae, which are exquisitely sensitive to oil, are dying by the millions as well. 
 Q. Have any endangered species been put at risk?
 A. Yes, the gulf is home to many animals officially listed as endangered, the highest level of vulnerability, under the federal Endangered Species Act. The largest among the permanent marine residents are sperm whales, which like to feed right at the mouth of the Mississippi and have been spotted in the slick. Numerous endangered species of sea turtles, including Kemp ridleys, live almost entirely within the Gulf of Mexico, as does the bulbous West Indian manatee. On land, the federal Department of Fish and Wildlife lists 17 endangered species on the beaches of Florida alone, including four different species of beach mice. Some of these species you have probably never heard of, like the Florida perforate cladonia, a type of lichen, but others are quite well known, like the majestic whooping crane, only hundreds of which are thought to survive in the wild.
 Q. Are coral reefs in the gulf and in the Florida Keys in danger? 
 A. Scientists are definitely worried about the reefs, but the ones at greatest risk appear to be deep reefs relatively near the gushing well. Because the well is so deep, some toxins that would rise to the surface and evaporate in a shallow oil spill are instead dissolving into the water. The worry is that they may kill or weaken deepwater marine organisms. But even relatively near the well, the concentrations of these toxins in deep water are relatively low, so there is reason to hope for the best. 
 As for risk to the coral reefs in the Florida Keys, scientific opinion is not unanimous, but most researchers have said that if any oil gets pulled into currents that take it past the Keys, it would probably be so diluted by then that it would pose little risk to organisms.
 Q. Has the damage to Louisiana's marshes and estuaries been severe?
 A. Obviously, if you talk to locals, they will give you an earful about the oil that has seeped into their local marshes and how the government is not doing nearly enough to protect this delicate resource.
 However, as ugly as any oil spill is, it is unclear at this point just how deep into the marshes the worst of the oil has penetrated. As this changes on an almost daily basis, firsthand observation is the best source of information. For an overview, check out the interactive map at www.geoplatform.gov/gulfresponse. 
 Of course, the wild card here is a hurricane. A large surge of water could carry the water deep into the inner marshes, which for wildlife could mean an even nastier game change.
 Q. What will the economic impact of the spill be?
 A. The final costs of the spill are difficult to predict. For now, as images of oil-coated wildlife on Louisiana's islands fill the news, most parts of coastal Mississippi and Alabama have seen only intermittent tar balls, but the states are suffering the same blows to their fishing and tourism industries. 
 In May, Nathaniel Karp, chief economist for the Alabama bank BBVA Compass, projected eventual losses for the four gulf states at $4.3 billion, including $191 million in losses to Alabama. This month he raised that projection to $11.5 billion. 
 In Louisiana, seafood and tourism generate $2.4 billion a year and $8.3 billion, respectively, according to officials associated with the two industries. 
 The moratorium that President Obama imposed on offshore oil drilling could also have a big economic impact and has been fought fiercely by political figures at every level in Louisiana. They argue that it would essentially be another economic hit to the state, already reeling from the fishing closures and other economic dislocation related to the spill. (A federal judge in New Orleans this week agreed with their argument and struck down the administration's moratorium; the administration said it would appeal.)
 The ban would take 33 floating rigs out of commission for six months; like many rigs in the gulf, all of these employ workers from Louisiana and are supplied by companies from Louisiana. The Louisiana State University Center for Energy Studies calculated that the moratorium would result directly in the loss of 3,339 jobs, and another 7,656 indirectly. 
 State officials are concerned about the ripple effects throughout the economy, including lost tax revenue. They are also worried about how long it would take for drilling to resume after the end of the moratorium. 
 Louisianans of all political stripes are generally advocates of offshore drilling, even after this disastrous spill. But many feel that the state should reap more of the benefits, whether by taking a percentage of the royalties that the oil companies pay to the federal government or receiving money from the companies outright to rebuild and restore the state's coastal wetlands.
 In Alabama and Mississippi, many beaches remain open, and the oil for the moment seems to be moving east, away from them. On good days it is difficult to see any evidence of the spill -- except for the empty beaches, the idle fishermen and seafood processors, and the worry and anger on the brows here. 
 But tourist bookings in Alabama and Mississippi are down 40 to 75 percent, with cancellations accelerating as the summer begins, say hotels, condominium owners and real estate agents. Researchers at the University of Southern Mississippi estimated the state's tourism losses at $119 million for May through August. 
 With federal and some state fishing waters closed, a seafood business that had hoped to recover this season from a series of cold years and the lingering effects of Hurricane Katrina has been brought to its knees. In Bayou la Batre, the center of Alabama's seafood industry, a food bank has been giving out 10,000 pounds of food a week -- a grim anomaly in a town where residents had always counted on the sea to feed them. 
 Florida looks especially vulnerable -- partly because it is such a large state with an economy as tied its coastline as Detroit's is to automobiles. Tourism is Florida's biggest industry, generating about $60 billion a year, and the Gulf Coast counties alone stand to lose $11 billion and 200,000 jobs if visitor numbers decline 50 percent, according to a recent study from the University of South Florida. 
 But that might be a conservative estimate. Even without oil on beaches in South Florida, hotels in Miami are reporting that bookings are down as families cancel trips because of uncertainty about where the spill will show up. Charter fishermen from Panama City to the Keys are already reporting that advance bookings are nonexistent, and as long as the spill churns in the gulf, this will be the case. Who wants to book a vacation when the loop current in the gulf could shift direction and send oil around Florida and up the East Coast?
 And that's just tourism. Since the 1950s, Florida's population has become increasingly concentrated by the coast. Millions of homes and condos already devalued by the recession and foreclosure crisis could face further downward pressure on prices because of the spill. State and local budgets that depend on the sales tax -- Florida has no state income tax -- may have to be cut even further, adding to an unemployment rate that already hovers around 12 percent. 
 But here's the comparison that really scares Floridians: Moody'srecently found the spill could do more damage to the state's economy than the 2004 hurricane season -- when four large storms slammed the state -- and more damage than the global recession, which has already brought Florida to its knees. 
 Q. Is anyone investigating what caused the spill? Is there any mechanism for prosecution, should wrongdoing be discovered?
 A. This accident will be the most closely studied domestic event since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. A formal Marine Board investigation has been under way since shortly after the April 20 explosion, jointly conducted by the United States Coast Guard and the Interior Department's Minerals Management Service, the agency responsible for policing offshore drilling. 
 President Obama has appointed a seven-member commission to study the accident and make recommendations on strengthening regulation, led by William K. Reilly, a former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and Bob Graham, a former governor and senator from Florida. 
 Many congressional committees are looking into various aspects of the explosion and leak; among the most aggressive are the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the House Natural Resources Committee and the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. The Justice Department has dispatched civil and criminal investigators to the Gulf Coast to determine whether damage suits or criminal charges can be brought. 
 The National Academy of Engineering is looking into the technical failures that contributed to the disaster. BP is carrying out an internal investigation into the causes of the blast. The American Petroleum Institute and other industry groups are conducting their own inquiries to determine whether BP followed accepted industry practices, or if those practices need to be changed.
 Q. Will the spill help generate support for energy and climate legislation now before the Senate? (Will promoters of renewable energy like wind and solar benefit from this new evidence of the dangers of fossil fuels?)
 A. President Obama and some Democratic leaders hope that the gulf disaster will build public and political support for a bill to tighten oil drilling regulations, reduce dependence on imported oil and limit emissions of gases contributing to global warming. There is likely to be a debate in the Senate in July on some new oil drilling rules and incentives for energy conservation. There may be movement toward new subsidies for clean energy sources like wind, solar and biofuels. 
 But there is little evidence of growing support for a more ambitious effort to address climate change by putting a price on carbon dioxide emissions or creating a cap-and-trade style market for pollution permits. Deep divisions remain within the Democratic Party over climate change, and they are unlikely to be bridged in the busy weeks that Congress has left before breaking for the fall election season. 
 Q. What federal agencies have regulatory oversight over offshore drilling? Will any heads roll at a cabinet or agency level because of the spill?
 A. In some respects, offshore work has been overseen by a patchwork of federal bodies, including the Coast Guard, which regulates the seaworthiness of oceangoing rigs, and the Environmental Protection Agency, which reviews drilling plans for the potential impact on marine life and the surrounding ecosystem.
 But the principal agency charged with oversight of offshore drilling is -- or was -- the Minerals Management Service, a division of the Interior Department formed in 1982. Among other responsibilities, the agency was charged with leasing oil and gas players in the Gulf of Mexico, approving driller permits and plans, monitoring the safety of offshore drilling operations and -- in what quickly drew allegations of conflict of interest after the Deepwater Horizon explosion -- collecting royalties from oil companies doing work in federal waters.
 Since the accident, the downside of vesting one regulatory division with all of those disparate responsibilities has been brought into stark relief.
 Documents have revealed, for example, that the agency sidestepped rules requiring it to obtain other federal permits before allowing BP -- and dozens of other oil companies -- to drill in areas that might harm endangered species or other marine mammals. Current and former scientists of the agency have also stated that they were routinely overruled when they raised concerns about the safety and environmental impact of certain drilling proposals. 
 And investigators have also charged that the minerals service was lax in approving drilling proposals -- including those developed by BP for the Deepwater Horizon -- despite lacking any realistic plan to respond to a blowout of the magnitude now polluting the gulf.
 Of course, the precise combination of factors leading to the unchecked gusher is still being sorted out -- including what measure of blame will be assigned to BP, to human error and to a failure of federal oversight. 
 Nonetheless, in an effort to dissolve a relationship between industry and regulators that many critics say had become far too cozy and permissive, the Obama administration announced plans to break up the Minerals Management Service on May 11. The idea is to divide the agency into three parts -- one responsible for leasing, another for fee collections and a separate division for environmental oversight.
 The agency also gets a new name: the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement. Michael R. Bromwich, a former Justice Department inspector general under the Clinton administration, was named last week to head it up. 
 He succeeds the most prominent official to depart in connection with the gulf disaster: S. Elizabeth Birnbaum, the former director of the minerals service, who resigned on May 27. Mr. Obama suggested that Ms. Birnbaum had failed to change her troubled agency with ''sufficient urgency.''
 Mr. Bromwich told a Senate panel on Wednesday that he would create an investigative unit to root out corruption and speed reorganization of the office.
 Q. Who is legally liable for the effects of the oil spill? 
 A. Under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, BP, the owner of the well, has been named the ''responsible party'' and bears the brunt of liability for the spill. That means the company must foot the bill for the cleanup efforts and pay claims for economic damage, as well as penalties under the law. Other companies involved with the well could find themselves drawn into litigation.
 Q. Has BP paid out any claims to people who have suffered from the spill? How much so far?
 A. From the beginning of the disaster, BP has said it will pay all ''legitimate claims'' of economic loss related to the spill and so far has paid out more than $100 million. It has issued more than 31,000 checks since the accident to residents along the Gulf Coast. It has received 64,000 claims and says it has a claims team of 1,000 working on claims at 33 field offices.
 Q. Is there any law limiting the damages paid out by an oil company?
 A. The Oil Pollution Act sets the liability limit for economic damage claims at $75 million, but BP blew past that number long ago and has said it will pay all legitimate claims. Last week, BP and the White House announced that the company was creating a $20 billion fund to take over payment of economic damage claims. The fund will be run independently by Kenneth R. Feinberg, who also administered the settlement fund for 9/11 victims and others.
 Q. Have any lawsuits been filed against BP or other parties?
 A. More than 200 lawsuits have been filed against BP and other companies -- and some of those suits are class actions involving hundreds and even thousands of plaintiffs. Commercial fishermen, shrimpers, vacation home rental agents, dive shop owners, seafood processors, state and local agencies and anyone whose income could be affected by the spill are weighing in. 
 Whether they continue to pursue their claims in court or opt for the more predictable settlement from Mr. Feinberg's fund is one of the issues we will all be watching.
 Q. How in the world will the courts deal with all of those lawsuits?
 A. The suits are likely to be consolidated by the federal courts through a process called multidistrict litigation. A seven-judge panel appointed by the chief justice of the Supreme Court of the United States meets regularly to determine which cases should be consolidated and how. 
 The industry has asked that the cases be consolidated in Houston; the companies' headquarters are there, and, not coincidentally, it might be a relatively friendly environment. The various lawyers for the plaintiffs have requested that the cases be consolidated across the Gulf Coast, with the Louisiana trial bar pushing hard for New Orleans -- not coincidentally, a place where anger over the spill runs high.
 Q. Is BP wealthy enough to pay for the economic and environmental costs of the spill? Or is the company at risk financially?
 A. The price of BP stock has plummeted by more than 50 percent since the April 20 accident, from just over $60 a share to below $30. But BP remains a very wealthy company; last year alone it earned $17 billion, and it ended the year with more than $8 billion in cash. It has operations all over the world that generate income, and with oil at over $75 a barrel, the prospects for revenues remain strong. 
 Most experts believe the company will survive, despite anticipated losses from penalties and claims mounting to tens of billions of dollars. 
 Still, uncertainties remain, especially if the runaway well is not plugged by the two relief wells now being drilled, which was expected to be completed by late August. That could mean months more of heavy damages, and more and more claims.
 Q. Who owns BP stock? Mostly Britons? 
 A. BP is owned by investors all over the world. BP estimates that about 40 percent of their shares are owned by British investors, and nearly as much by American investors. Another 10 percent are owned by other Europeans, and the remaining 10 percent by investors from other countries outside Europe. Since much of the stock is owned by mutual funds, it is not easy to determine the exact percentages of the nationalities of its owners. Suffice it to say, many Americans and Britons depend on BP dividends. 
 Q. Are lots of ordinary people whose mutual or pension funds are invested in BP going to be adversely affected? Or are most such funds widely diversified? 
 A. There are certainly some mutual funds and pension funds that will be affected on both sides of the Atlantic. Nebraska's retirement fund, for instance, reportedly will lose $1.3 million each quarter that BP suspends its dividend. The erasure of about $100 billion in BP stock value has translated into big losses for several funds. The California Public Employees' Retirement system has lost more than $284 million in value, Bloomberg News reported.
 Q. Will other oil companies benefit from BP's woes, or will they all be negatively affected?
 A. Some companies may benefit in the future. When companies decide to invest in big projects, they often look for partners to share risks and expenses. BP may be seen now as less reliable, giving a new competitive edge to Exxon Mobil and Chevron, for instance, when smaller companies like Anadarko are looking for a partner with deep pockets. 
 But at the moment BP's woes are shared widely, especially among companies that would like to drill more in the Gulf of Mexico. The current drilling moratorium will hurt the majors and service companies. Oil companies will almost certainly face more regulatory hurdles and safety expenses in the future.
 Q. Will the spill or the offshore drilling moratorium affect oil or gas prices?
 A. The moratorium on drilling in the gulf should not have an impact on oil or gasoline prices over the short term. For one thing, a well that is being drilled is not a producing well; each drilling operation takes a year or more before production commences. For another, oil production is still high in the gulf by historical standards as a result of a wave of drilling in recent years. 
 Oil is a world commodity, and its price is affected by many factors including the strength of the world economy, which drives demand. However, if the moratorium were to go on for years, it would eventually have an impact on oil supplies as older wells became less productive. That could affect prices, unless lost production is replaced by new production somewhere else. 
 Q. Is gulf seafood safe to eat?
 A. Yes, experts say. Health scientists and politicians have been hammering home this message since the spill, all the way up to President Obama, who ate local crab cakes and shrimp salad sandwiches on television during a trip to Gulfport, Miss. The federal government says the seafood is being tested for dangerous chemicals by federal scientists from the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Food and Drug Administration. 
 Mainly they are looking for a chemical called a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, which is a leading indicator of oil contamination. So far, all levels are safe. This is largely because the federal government closed large swaths of the gulf to fishers, shrimpers and oystermen. 
 Not that much seafood, speaking relatively, comes from there anyway: The gulf supplies only 2 percent of the nation's seafood, while 83 percent is imported. Still, wary seafood eaters aren't taking any chances, causing prices across the country to rise for fish and shrimp. So, the real thing to avoid, experts say, is an overpriced meal.
 Q. Is any organization coordinating charitable donations?
 A. Several Web sites are compiling places to donate money, time and resources. The Greater New Orleans Foundation is focused on charities that help fishermen and their families in Louisiana. The National Wildlife Foundation and the Humane Society of the United States are taking donations to help wildlife on the coast.
 Q. Is this the nation's worst oil disaster ever? Its worst environmental disaster ever?
 A. It is probably neither. If your criterion for the worst oil disaster is the greatest volume of oil leaked, then the Lakeview Gusher of 1910 released at least twice as much oil into a semi-desert area of California as this leak has released so far. This leak is without question the worst oil disaster at sea in United States history, but it does not yet match the volume of an Mexican oil-well blowout known as Ixtoc 1, also in the gulf, in 1979-80. 
 As for worst environmental disaster ever, this one so far does not come close to matching the human impact of the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, which prompted one of the largest mass migrations in American history, with perhaps a half-million people abandoning the Plains. But that said, the damage is accumulating as the spill drags on. It seems likely to wind up as one of the worst American environmental disasters, if not the worst.
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: India Cuts Subsidies For Fuels

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
MUMBAI, India -- The Indian government on Friday reduced popular fuel subsidies, a long-delayed change that will help policy makers reduce a big budget deficit but one that will also worsen already high inflation. 
 Policy makers said the government would stop subsidizing gasoline. Diesel, kerosene and natural gas would continue to receive support at a slightly lower level. India spent about $5.6 billion to subsidize fuel in the last fiscal year, which ended in March. State-owned energy companies added the equivalent of an additional $4.4 billion by selling fuel below its cost. 
 India and other big countries committed to eliminating energy subsidies at a Group of 20 meeting last year, but policy makers here had repeatedly put off the politically difficult change. 
 Heavily subsidized fuels like kerosene, for instance, are used by many poor Indians for lighting and cooking. Moreover, opposition politicians have criticized the government for not doing enough to bring down escalating prices, especially for food. Consumer prices jumped 14.4 percent in April from a year earlier. 
 The opposition Communist Party of India (Marxist) called the subsidy cuts a ''cruel blow against the people who are already suffering.'' 
 The G-20 meeting in Toronto this weekend might have played into the timing of the decision. But the reductions in subsidies also signals that Indian leaders have become more confident about their political mandate a year after they won a new five-year term in office. The Congress Party-led government also appears to have gotten more serious about reducing the federal deficit, which is estimated to be 5.5 percent of the country's gross domestic product. 
 Still, policy makers are moving cautiously. Prices for diesel, kerosene and natural gas, which are the most heavily subsidized fuels, will increase only moderately and remain under government control for the time being. 
 By comparison, gasoline is not subsidized as much, and its retail price is already much higher than in the United States because of high taxes. Prices for it will increase 3.5 rupees a liter, or 29 cents a gallon, to about 55.7 rupees a liter, or $4.58 a gallon. 
 The increase in gasoline prices should bolster the profits of state-owned oil companies, which were not being fully compensated by the government for the subsidies. It should also help private energy companies like Reliance and Essar that sharply scaled back their fuel retailing businesses in recent years because they could not compete against the subsidized fuel sold by state-owned companies. 
 Even after the increase, analysts at Citigroup estimate that the government and state-owned oil companies will spend about $11.5 billion on fuel subsidies this fiscal year, down from a previous estimate of $16.7 billion. 
 Reliance Natural Resources, owned by Anil Ambani, has revised a purchase agreement for natural gas with Reliance Industries, Bloomberg News reported Friday from New Delhi. 
 Reliance Industries, controlled by Mukesh Ambani, Anil's brother, won a favorable ruling from the top Indian court in May on natural gas sales from the country's biggest field, which holds $38 billion worth of reserves. The estranged brothers subsequently scrapped agreements that prevented them from competing with each other in business.

HEADLINE: Moratorium Won't Reduce Drilling Risks

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
''This case asks whether the federal government's imposition of a general moratorium on deepwater drilling for oil in the Gulf of Mexico was imposed contrary to law. Before the Court is the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction. For the following reasons, the motion is GRANTED.''
 So began a stinging 22-page decision, issued this week by a Federal District Court judge, Martin L. C. Feldman. He was rejecting, pretty much out of hand, the Obama administration's plan to place a six-month moratorium on all drilling projects in the Gulf of Mexico. It would have amounted to a shutdown of 33 deepwater rigs, the kind that can drill the deepest and are the most complex to operate -- and the kind that can cost well over $500,000 a day even when they're just sitting idle.
 The plaintiffs consisted of a group of companies that make their money servicing gulf drilling operations; they were led by a shipping company, Hornbeck Offshore Services, which employs 1,300 and has spent nearly $700 million in the last five years building a new generation of ships for use in the gulf. ''We saw this as putting our Gulf of Mexico business model at risk,'' said Samuel Giberga, the company's general counsel. 
 But he also believed that the administration's edict violated the law. The secretary of the interior, Ken Salazar, had failed to take into account the enormous economic pain that would be inflicted on the gulf region by such a moratorium, as he was required to under the law, Hornbeck argued. The administration was punishing deepwater drillers that had complied with all the regulations surrounding deepwater drilling -- and had gotten their permits fair and square. Right after the spill, Mr. Giberga told me, a government SWAT team had inspected all the other rigs -- and found them to be safe. The Deepwater Horizon disaster notwithstanding, the federal government had failed to articulate any good reason why all the other rigs in the gulf had to be stopped as well.
 And Judge Feldman agreed with Hornbeck on every count. Concluding that the decision to impose the moratorium was ''arbitrary and capricious,'' he wrote, ''An invalid agency decision to suspend drilling of wells in depths of over 500 feet simply cannot justify the immeasurable effect on the plaintiffs, the local economy, the gulf region, and the critical present-day aspect of the availability of domestic energy in this country.''
 Over the next few days, three things happened, all of them completely predicable. The Interior Department vowed to appeal. Gulf state politicians, starting with Bobby Jindal, the governor of Louisiana -- whose state has suffered tremendously as a result of the BP accident -- pleaded with the federal government to drop the appeal and allow drilling to continue. And environmentalists derided Judge Feldman's decision.
 Noting that Judge Feldman's district is in the Fifth Circuit for appeals ''which is the go-to court for the oil and gas industry,'' Elgie Holstein, the oil spill response coordinator for the Environmental Defense Fund said: ''I fully expect it to be overturned on appeal.''
 Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the president of Waterkeeper Alliance, told The Mobile Press-Register that drilling deepwater wells right now, ''when we don't even know what caused this accident, seems insane.'' He added, ''I don't think anybody responsible would advocate more drilling right now.'' And so on.
 A simple six-month drilling moratorium. It sounds like such a sensible, obvious, uncontroversial thing to do in the wake of the worst environmental disaster in this nation's history, doesn't it? Turns out, it's anything but.
 As a percentage of the world's oil production -- some 84.5 million barrels a day -- the 1.75 million barrels a day that is extracted from the Gulf of Mexico is not a huge number. (That's why oil prices haven't risen as a result of the Deepwater Horizon disaster.) But in terms of the country's domestic production, it is extremely important. According to Gibson Consulting, a third of all United States oil production comes from the Gulf of Mexico.
 What's more, virtually every new well being drilled in the gulf is a deepwater well -- because, after all, that's where the oil is. ''Oil from shallow waters peaked in the 1990s,'' said Cutler Cleveland, a professor of geography and environment at Boston University. ''And deepwater peaked five or six years ago. So now we are moving into ultra deepwater -- over 5,000 feet.'' And, he adds, 80 percent of the reserves that remain in the gulf are either in deep or ultra deepwater.
 So the first point is: Until that glorious day comes that our cars are fueled by batteries and our homes are heated by solar power, we need as much domestic oil as we can get our hands on, oil that exists in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Shutting down drilling in the gulf -- even temporarily -- means we'll be importing even more oil from other countries than we already do.
 Nor is it clear, if the moratorium went into effect, the pullback would be all that temporary. For one thing, the moratorium is contingent on a special commission making yet more safety recommendations in six months, but there is no guarantee they'll be done by then. Meanwhile, there are only so many floating rigs in the world, and Brazil, for instance, has just embarked on a $200 billion drilling program. (You read that right: $200 billion.) It takes a month to move an idle rig from the Gulf of Mexico to Brazil, where it will likely stay for years. So a six-month moratorium would quite likely have far greater effect on American oil production that it would seem at first glance.
 Which also leads to a great irony: importing more oil via tankers will actually create more risk, not less. Between 1964 and the Deepwater Horizon accident, a grand total of 1,800 barrels of oil were lost from rig accidents -- an average of 45 barrels a year. That is an astonishing record. Ken Arnold, an expert who consulted with the Interior Department right after the BP spill -- and a big critic of the moratorium -- told me that much more oil is spilled in tanker accidents annually than from drilling rig accidents.
 What's more, he added: ''The oil in those tankers was produced somewhere -- somewhere that most likely has less regulation and less oversight than we have. We are not lessening the chance of a spill; we're just transferring that risk to Nigeria and Brazil. We are not helping the world. We are just saying, 'Brazil, we prefer to despoil your beaches, but not ours.' ''
 Then there are the battered gulf economies. It is easy enough, sitting here in New York, to argue that we should shut down oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico for as long as it takes, to be absolutely sure we'll never have another accident like the one we've just had. I hear Rachel Maddow making that point most every night these days.
 But a shutdown doesn't really affect our daily lives up here on the East Coast. In the gulf, one mainstay of the economy -- fishing -- has already been devastated. Do we really want to finish off the rest of the Gulf Coast economy by sidelining its other pillar, oil drilling? There is a reason politicians like Mr. Jindal are pleading for drilling to continue, despite the spill's terrible effect on his state. They're desperate. When an airplane crashes, and several hundred people die, the government doesn't ground every airplane until it is sure all airplanes are safe. It would be too disruptive to the economy. Shouldn't the same logic apply here?
 What has become obvious in the aftermath of the accident is not so much that offshore drilling -- even deepwater offshore drilling -- is inherently unsafe. It is, certainly, risky, but so are many activities, like mining or flying an airplane. One reason there have been so few accidents over the years is that the incentive for doing things safely is enormous: mistakes can lead to death.
 None of which is to say that the Deepwater Horizon disaster hasn't pointed to problems with drilling, or that new safety measures don't need to be added. Most of all, it shows the utter inadequacy on the part of both industry and government in containing accidents when they do happen. Precisely because of the industry's incredible safety record over the years, everyone got complacent. But a six-month moratorium isn't going to fix that either. What are needed are new ideas that can be debated and then enacted into regulation. One appealing idea I've heard is that deepwater rigs should be required to drill a relief well at the same time the exploratory well is being drilled. But that would also, of course, increase the cost of drilling for oil in the gulf.
 In the end, the real problem with the six-month moratorium is that it allows us to continue to kid ourselves. It helps us create the illusion that, by regulatory fiat, we can make the extraction of fossil fuels a riskless endeavor. But that can never be true. Six months from now, whether or not the Interior Department succeeds getting Judge Feldman's decision overturned on appeal, deepwater drilling will still be risky. Drilling thousands of feet into water, searching for dangerous natural gas and oil, contained in the earth under immense pressure, is inherently risky.
 We would all be better off facing that fact squarely, instead of wishing it away under the guise of a moratorium.

CORRECTION-DATE:  July 1, 2010, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
The Talking Business column on Saturday, about the effect of a moratorium on deepwater drilling for oil in the Gulf of Mexico, misstated the record of oil spills in the Outer Continental Shelf. From 1964 to 2009, 532,000 barrels of oil were lost as a result of spills, not 1,800 barrels. (The lower figure refers to oil lost as a result of blowouts from 1971 to 2009, not to the overall amount of oil lost in accidents.) The article also misidentified the court with jurisdiction in appeals from the Federal District Court of Judge Martin L. C. Feldman, who issued a preliminary injunction against the moratorium. It is the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, not the Ninth Circuit.

HEADLINE: The Pill, Over the Counter?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Let the Pill Go Free,'' by Kelly Blanchard (Op-Ed, June 22): 
 As the program coordinator of a psycho-educational program for pregnant teenagers, I am a strong proponent of ready access to birth control. At the same time, quite a few of my program participants were on the pill and became pregnant because they were not taking it according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
 While the pill will prevent pregnancy in 98 to 99 percent of women taking it according to the guidelines, those rates drop when we look at typical use. If the true rates of effectiveness are lower than ideal already, what would happen if women had no contact at all with a physician, and received no counseling whatsoever as to how to take it effectively? I'd rather not have the business.
 Sara Diament Bergenfield, N.J., June 23, 2010
 To the Editor:
 I agree wholeheartedly with Kelly Blanchard that it only makes sense to allow the pill to be available over the counter. I continually found myself frustrated that my insurance company would allow me to buy only three months of birth control at a time. It makes absolutely no sense either from a medical or an economical standpoint.
 What's more, I was always astonished that my insurer was not more interested in keeping me on birth control, especially when you compare the costs of the pill to the cost of giving birth in a hospital.
 They should be dropping the stuff from airplanes.

HEADLINE: China Lets Its Currency Hit a New High Against the Dollar Just Ahead of a G-20 Meeting

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- As global leaders assembled for a meeting in Canada over the weekend, China allowed its currency to close Friday at the strongest level against the dollar since currency policies were overhauled in 2005. 
 The Chinese central bank set its key daily reference rate for its currency, the renminbi, at 6.7896 per dollar on the fifth trading day since Beijing pledged greater currency flexibility last weekend. The renminbi ended the day at almost exactly that level, having made a total gain against the dollar of 0.5 percent in the last week. 
 Small as that may seem, the rate changes have been highly significant. Beijing has faced mounting pressure from abroad to let the renminbi strengthen against the dollar, and its decision to begin at least a small rise could take some of the sting out of the contentious currency issue as leaders of the Group of 20 meet in Toronto. 
 Before China pledged to promote currency flexibility, the issue was expected to dominate the talks. Now, the leaders are expected to focus on the debt crisis in Europe and financial regulation. 
 So far, the Chinese policy shift has earned guarded praise. President Obama said Thursday that decision represented progress but that it was too early to tell whether the eventual rise in the renminbi would be enough to help rebalance the global economy. 
 Many economists and American politicians have argued that the renminbi's value -- which was held steady by the Chinese authorities over the last two years to bolster the national economy during the global downturn -- is artificially low, and that this gives Chinese exporters an unfair advantage over manufacturers in the United States. 
 Beijing has long signaled that any appreciation will be gradual and will come on its own terms, rather than in response to international pressure. 
 Its careful messages in the last week -- conveyed in part through the levels of the daily reference rate -- appeared to underline this point. 
 ''The emphasis is on stability,'' Glenn Maguire, Asia economist at Societe Generale, said Friday at a media briefing in Hong Kong. ''They are having to stage a very fine balancing act: On the one hand, they want to be seen to be doing something. On the other, they want to prevent any speculative inflows of capital that would come with any sharper appreciation.'' 
 The Societe Generale team expects the renminbi to end 2010 3 to 5 percent stronger against the dollar, as most analysts forecast. 
 By July 2011, Societe Generale expects the renminbi to have risen nearly 10 percent. 
 Bill Belchere, global economist at Mirae Asset in Hong Kong, wrote in a note Friday that frictions over the currency issue were unlikely to dissipate. 
 ''Unless China allows the renminbi to move much more aggressively than we anticipate, global trade imbalances, which are already re-emerging, will continue to worsen,'' Mr. Belchere wrote. ''This will heighten trade tensions and intensify volatility in global debt and foreign exchange markets.''

HEADLINE: Cabaret: Precarious But Resilient

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
Stability is a word not often used to describe New York City's fragile cabaret world, where only a few can make a full-time living, and the clubs themselves ride an economic seesaw from week to week. But because Manhattan's three major supper clubs -- the Cafe Carlyle, the Oak Room and Feinstein's at Loews Regency -- are attached to hotels, their survival is not solely dependent on the box office.
 That is a stability of sorts. And as the 2009-10 season draws to a close, all three clubs seem to have successfully weathered the economic downturn, at least for now. One sign of precariousness, however, was the shrinking of the Cabaret Convention, an annual clearinghouse for talent at Rose Hall. 
 Artistically, at least, cabaret is reasonably healthy; an optimist might even say flourishing, as younger singers like Kelli O'Hara, Maude Maggart, Nellie McKay, Johnny Rodgers and Sutton Foster have established themselves as acts that blend singing and patter into intimate, sophisticated entertainments that can't be found anywhere else.
 This year the quality of the dozen best cabaret acts far surpassed that of Broadway's new musicals, which were so weak that ''Memphis,'' a flimsy, grossly inauthentic re-creation of the moment in the 1950s when rhythm & blues went mainstream, won the Tony Award for best musical. 
 Authenticity is a hallmark of cabaret; without it the genre would quickly wither. This is the one arena in which a beloved performer can develop into a musical sage without an expiration date. The songs of Stephen Sondheim, who turned 80 this year, almost require performers with mileage for their insights to be revealed. 
 Elaine Stritch and Barbara Carroll, both in their 80s, located the essences of songs like ''Every Day a Little Death'' (recited by Ms. Stritch in her brilliant Sondheim show at the Cafe Carlyle), and ''With So Little to Be Sure Of'' (sung by Ms. Carroll at the Oak Room, where it was part of a Sondheim suite for voice and piano). 
 Among the numerous tributes to the songwriter Johnny Mercer, whose centennial was celebrated last November, the most stirring was a marathon pop-jazz anthology of his songs by Marilyn Maye, now 82, at the Metropolitan Room, the best of New York's smaller clubs. 
 If the new blood arriving in cabaret suggests that the genre has secured its future, there is no guarantee. Whether performers like Ms. O'Hara, Ms. Foster, Ms. McKay and Mr. Rodgers will become perennials is anyone's guess. Right now Ms. O'Hara, with her wholesome good looks and operatically flexible soprano, and the zany, more down-home Ms. Foster, whose debut engagement at Cafe Carlyle ends this Saturday, are cabaret versions of America's sweetheart. 
 Because they don't need nightclub acclaim as a springboard to the Broadway stardom they have already attained, their commitment to the genre is uncertain. Ms. McKay is a downtown bohemian version of the same thing, a contemporary Doris Day with a feisty political attitude. 
 Only Ms. Maggart, a Los Angeles protegee of Michael Feinstein and Andrea Marcovicci, has systematically built a cabaret career similar to her mentors', in which she embodies a genre-hopping 21st-century film noir woman of mystery. Mr. Rodgers, who leads his own band, suggests a cross between a grown-up Andy Hardy and the young Peter Allen. 
 Because Mr. Feinstein has his own club in which he regularly performs, he is cabaret's unofficial godfather. He has developed from an intimate singing pianist into a dynamic standup entertainer who swings like a polite Sinatra and is an outspoken true believer in the superiority of the prerock canon, about which he knows more than almost anyone. 
 In the last two years he has gone out of his way to form musical partnerships. ''The Power of Two,'' his duet show with the Broadway heartthrob Cheyenne Jackson last June, injected a note of gay pride into a cabaret world that, despite its sizable gay audience, is reticent about sexuality, at least in its upper echelon. His duet shows with Christine Ebersole and Barbara Cook (with whom he is returning for a month of performances in September) and David Hyde Pierce, set a standard of grownup entertainment that has been almost completely abandoned by a mainstream pop culture in thrall to perpetual adolescence. 
 This kind of teamwork can be found in other musical partnerships, including those of Sandy Stewart and Bill Charlap, K T Sullivan and Mark Nadler, Victoria Clark and Ted Sperling, Eric Comstock and Barbara Fasano, and most of all John Pizzarelli and Jessica Molaskey. In wit and musical savvy, nothing matches their smart conceptual shows, in which Mr. Pizzarelli's jazz guitar and crooning and Ms. Molaskey's theatrical jazz singing fuse into something that's greater than its parts. 
 Their Cafe Carlyle show last fall, ''Lost and Found,'' which included renditions of everyone from Duke Ellington to Joni Mitchell, was the season's finest, caviar in a world of canned tuna. Once you've acquired the taste, there is no substitute.

HEADLINE: Bank Stocks Rise as Fears Ease Over Regulations in Finance Bill

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Nasdaq and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose modestly on Friday on relief that the financial regulation bill would not crimp Wall Street profits as badly as feared. Strong results from Oracle also revived hopes about business spending.
 Despite the rally, the main stock indexes fell for the week after two consecutive weeks of gains and recorded their weakest performance in five weeks. 
 Bank shares climbed after lawmakers agreed on rules that did not make drastic changes to derivatives and proprietary trading, two highly profitable businesses that had been in lawmakers' cross hairs. The bill still requires approval by both chambers of Congress before it can be signed into law.
 JPMorgan Chase rose 3.7 percent, to $39.44, while Bank of America gained 2.7 percent, to $15.42.
 The S.& P. financial sector, which is down 8.4 percent over the last quarter, rose 2.8 percent.
 ''Regulation is less onerous than people's fears, so you're seeing a bit of a relief rally in the financials today, which obviously is helping,'' Michael James, senior trader at Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles, said.
 Oracle gained 1.7 percent, to $22.60, a day after it posted a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit on solid sales of new software.
 ''This could be a sign of a pick-up in tech spending, which may mean other tech firms are going to report strong numbers,'' Andy Fitzpatrick, director of investments at Hinsdale Associates in Hinsdale, Ill., said.
 The Dow Jones industrial average was down 8.99 points, or 0.09 percent, at 10,143.81. The S.& P. index was up 3.07 points, or 0.29 percent, at 1,076.76. The Nasdaq composite index was up 6.06 points, or 0.27 percent, at 2,223.48.
 The Dow fell 2.9 percent for the week, the S.& P. 500 was off 3.6 percent and the Nasdaq composite fell 3.7 percent.
 The Dow edged lower on Wal-Mart, which fell 2.5 percent, to $48.80.
 The week's high and low points covered a wider span than last week's. Closing below the previous week's low in an ''outside week'' is seen as a technical bearish signal.
 ''It looks like we're stuck in this trading range, with the downside around 1,040 to 1,050 and upside capped by the 50-day moving average, which right now is around 1,127,'' Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at RDM Financial in Westport, Conn., said.
 In economic news, a survey showed that consumer sentiment rose more than expected, while a government report showed that first-quarter growth in the gross domestic product was less than had previously been estimated.
 ''The market was already worried about a downturn, and the G.D.P. data will highlight the idea that we should be concerned about a slowdown,'' Chip Hanlon, president at Delta Global Advisors in Huntington Beach, Calif., said.
 Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 8/32, to 103 10/32, and the yield fell to 3.11 percent, from 3.14 percent late Thursday.
 Crude oil rose 2.35 percent to $78.86 a barrel on concerns that a tropical disturbance in the Caribbean might develop into a storm and threaten Gulf of Mexico production.
 At the same time, BP tumbled to a 14-year low as it continued to struggle to contain its oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and the storm threatened to disrupt the effort.
 Some major companies announced disappointing earnings. The BlackBerry maker Research In Motion was the biggest drag on the Nasdaq 100, down 11 percent to $52.23 a day after reporting weaker-than-expected shipments and subscribers.
 KB Home slumped 9 percent to $11.12 after the home builder reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss.

HEADLINE: A Building Brings Haves And Have-Somes Together

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

 BODY:
The Kalahari condominium building drummed up a predictable mix of hope and skepticism when it rose along a scraggly stretch of West 116th Street in Harlem. At 249 units, it dwarfed its tenement neighbors. Its zigzagging brickwork, inspired by sub-Saharan tribes, was deemed compelling by fans and an aesthetic fright by detractors.
 Impossible to ignore, the place became a magnet for expectations. Nearby shopkeepers figured it would bring in more business. Residents of public housing towers to the south hoped it would help clean up the streets. Some working-class and poor residents in the area took a dimmer view: the building seemed too expensive, too sleek -- yet another Trojan horse smuggling gentrification into Harlem.
 But the Kalahari has turned out to be not as homogenous as its imposing edifice might suggest. It is one of the city's dozens of mixed-income condo buildings, making it a social engineering construct of sorts. 
 About half of its apartments were subsidized and sold to lower-income tenants at below market rates, giving the building a roughly equal balance of the haves and the have-somes. The economic mixing has created a building described by some tenants as one of the more demographically varied places they have ever lived in. There are no figures tracking the building's racial composition, but residents guessed that half the tenants were white, and the remainder black, Hispanic and Asian.
 Nana Roper, a tax director at a hedge fund who moved from the Upper East Side into a market-rate unit, said her ''only hesitation was that Harlem had a negative mark.'' Ms. Roper initially wondered what her affordable-unit neighbors might be like, and ended up being pleased.
 ''There were a lot of teachers, cops, people with secure jobs who weren't making the New York City salary range,'' said Ms. Roper, 35, who is Korean-American.
 Erecting mixed-income homeownership buildings in Harlem became possible only in recent years, city officials said. By the 1980s, the neighborhood was ravaged, and the city owned roughly 60 percent of its buildings and vacant lots, Rafael Cestero, the city's housing commissioner, said.
 But as the city's fortunes rose and real estate boomed, the lots grew more attractive to developers, and the city took advantage. Instead of using the land solely for low-income housing, the city sold lots at discounted prices to developers with the stipulation that they build both market-rate and affordable units. The affordable units, available by lottery, had to be comparable in size and mixed in with their market-rate counterparts.
 But while the city could stipulate who was eligible for buildings based on income levels, it could not predict how or if the tenants would get along. Would the market-rate residents look down on the lottery winners? Would the market-rate tenants resent having paid more money for essentially the same units? Would the affordable residents envy their market-rate counterparts?
 ''That was one of the concerns, seeing how it works,'' said Robert Ezrapour, who has built several mixed-income buildings in Harlem (the Kalahari was built by L+M Development Partners and Full Spectrum NY). ''How was the banker paying this much going to react to the subway conductor paying much less? But it's been surprisingly smooth.''
 The Kalahari's 120 affordable units ranged from $125,000 to $485,000 and were eligible to households with ''moderate'' incomes, up to 185 percent of the median income for the New York region, about $130,000 for a family of four. Four thousand people applied.
 The lottery winners marveled at their luck. ''The truth is, I couldn't have rented an apartment like this,'' said Jeremy Kottkamp, 33, who teaches disabled students in the Bronx and bought a two-bedroom apartment (he rents out the second bedroom) for $300,000. ''To have ownership -- I never thought that would be possible in the city. And it kept me in the city.''
 There were a few differences that residents noticed. While the affordable and market-rate units were roughly the same size, the finishes were different. The market-rate units, priced from $505,000 to $1.65 million, had smooth bamboo flooring, while the affordable units had grayish-white carpeting. The most controversial difference was the affordable units' popcorn ceilings: the market-rate units' ceilings were, enviably, flat. (Popcorn finishes are sprayed on and are often cheaper than a paint job.)
 A flurry of anti-popcorn-ceiling meetings were held, and there was talk of hiring a lawyer, but the issue eventually died. Meanwhile, a few market-rate residents, jittery about the neighborhood, pressed for more security cameras (the developer, having already installed 20, agreed to add 4 more) and the addition of a doorman (which did not happen).
 Margi Briggs-Lofton, a condo board member and market-rate resident, said that over all, the market-rate buyers drawn to the Kalahari and to Harlem tended to be a self-selecting bunch. She and her husband, Michael, moved there from the Upper West Side, craving a more varied neighborhood. ''I wanted to be in a building we can believe in,'' she said.
 Many residents said there were no evident schisms between market-rate and affordable-rate residents. ''I don't know that there's much of that kind of teaming going on,'' said Raymond Daniel Medina, 36, a parks project manager who spent $300,000 for a two-bedroom.
 Still, a few residents admitted peeking at people's doorsteps as they walked by, to see if the flooring was carpet or bamboo.
 For those near the building, the changes that the Kalahari was expected to bring to the area have been slow in coming.
 Oumou Sy, a Senegalese hair braider, said disappointingly few Kalahari residents had come into her shop, Hair Design by Oumou, just half a block from the building. And several Kalahari residents yearned for the fancy coffee shops, bistros and gourmet grocery shops that now dot Frederick Douglass Boulevard a few avenues away, relying instead on Fresh Direct. Among them is Paquita Friday, 42, an accounting professor and consultant, who is set to soon buy the penthouse she currently rents.
 Ms. Friday, who is black, said she reveled in the Kalahari. She and her 5-year-old son moved to the building from a mostly white mixed-income rental building in Clinton last year. ''It just felt strange, being in New York, being inside my home, being one of a few, whereas in the rest of the city, I don't stand out,'' Ms. Friday said. ''At the Kalahari, I don't stand out.''

HEADLINE: High-Risk Insurance Pools To Begin Next Month

BYLINE: By WALECIA KONRAD

 BODY:
IF you have any kind of chronic medical condition and you've been shopping for health insurance, you know how insanely difficult it is to find an insurer that will cover you at all, let alone at an affordable rate. 
 For some people, relief may be on the way starting July 1. That is the day when the federal government will start paying for new insurance programs aimed at providing relatively affordable coverage for uninsured people with pre-existing conditions. 
 Under the new health care law, the government has earmarked $5 billion for states to set up high-risk pools, as the programs are called, for people who have been uninsured for six months or longer. The pools are to provide a bridge for people most in need of coverage until the insurance exchanges begin operating in 2014. The pools will have no restrictions based on pre-existing conditions; coverage starts immediately and comes with no annual or lifetime limits. Deductibles and co-payments will be kept low. 
 Bekky Jones-Ludwick, 51, a manager for a marine supply store in Waynesboro, Va., is hoping the new system will help her and her husband, Tracy Ludwick. Both work for the same small business, and their employer had provided health insurance coverage for the couple until March 2009. 
 The company canceled insurance for employees just after Ms. Jones-Ludwick, who suffers from asthma, learned she had breast cancer and underwent a mastectomy. The couple switched to a more expensive health policy purchased on their own.
 Then, in May 2009, Ms. Jones-Ludwick's husband needed emergency gall bladder surgery. The new policy covered only $1,000 a day for any type of hospitalization. As a result, the couple was left to pay $20,000 in medical bills. 
 The new policy was canceled, too, and now the couple is completely without insurance.
 ''I can't pay off the debt, pay for my medicine and pay insurance premiums,'' said Ms. Jones-Ludwick. ''I owe more in medical bills than I make in a year's salary.'' 
 Ms. Jones-Ludwick is hoping insurance in the new high-risk pools not only will have premiums affordable enough that she can resume coverage but also will help eliminate out-of-pocket expenses for asthma medication, regular mammograms and other health care costs. 
 Even as the deadline for their debut approaches, however, questions remain about the new risk pools. 
 The law mandates that premiums for the new coverage must be the same as the standard rate for a healthy adult in that state. (Currently insurance for someone with a pre-existing condition, when available at all, can cost as much as 200 percent of the standard rate.) 
 That sounds reasonable, but it's not necessarily affordable. Depending on where you live, premiums could still be several hundred dollars a month. 
 In addition, many experts worry that the $5 billion won't be enough to last until 2014. The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has estimated that the $5 billion will last for only two years. 
 ''We just don't know how many people will sign up for the new pools,'' said Deborah J. Chollet, a senior fellow at Mathematica Policy Research, a public policy research company, who has studied existing state risk pools and the new plan. ''Until we see what happens, there's no way to know how long the money will last.''
 Another concern is that only people who have been uninsured for six months or longer are eligible for the new pools. That means the newly unemployed or those paying exorbitant premiums because of a pre-existing condition -- perhaps in their state's existing high-risk pool -- cannot simply switch to the more affordable high-risk pools. 
 The idea was to provide the stopgap measure for the neediest until 2014. If everyone took advantage of the new pools, it was feared, the government would have even more trouble financing the program. 
 ''There's an inherent unfairness there that's going to be difficult to explain to consumers,'' said Sandy Praeger, state insurance commissioner of Kansas. 
 But for those who may, at long last, have a chance to get decent coverage for a relatively good rate, one question is more pressing than any other: How do I sign up? Here's information on how the new risk pools are expected to work and what you should do if you think you might benefit from this new coverage. 
 WHO'S IN CHARGE? Under the new law, each state can decide whether it wants to run the new high-risk pool or have the federal government run the program instead. At last count, about 30 states have opted to run their own programs. 
 Those states have filed a proposal with the government outlining a list of pre-existing conditions that will help define who is eligible for each pool. Many states already have high-risk pools that provide an infrastructure; nevertheless, the existing risk pools will be run independently of the new ones. 
 Most states are waiting for approval of these guidelines from the federal Department of Health and Human Services, which is administering most of the health law changes. 
 About 18 states have opted for the federal government to run the high-risk programs instead. The department has not yet provided details about how these pools will work. 
 GET THE PLAN DETAILS Even with so few details, it's not too early to contact your state insurance department for information on your state's proposed plan. Some states may be taking applications as soon as July 1, although many are expected to miss that deadline and begin taking applications in August or even in the fall. 
 The Web site of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, www.naic.org, has a directory of state insurance departments under ''States and Jurisdictions Map.'' Even states that are opting for the federally run pools are expected to post information on their insurance department Web sites to help consumers apply, said Ms. Praeger.
 Also on July 1, the Department of Health and Human Services is expected to introduce an online portal at www.hhs.gov that will include information on available health insurance in each state, including coverage provided by high-risk pools, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. 
 GATHER YOUR RECORDS While you are waiting for the deadlines to kick in, get copies of your medical records, advised Cheryl Fish-Parcham, director of health policy at Families USA, a consumer advocacy group. You may need them to show that you have a pre-existing condition and are therefore eligible for the pool. 
 APPLY EARLY Each state has been allocated a portion of the $5 billion, but just about everyone agrees that the money will not be enough to last until 2014. Down the road, Congress may appropriate more money for the program, said Ms. Praeger -- but there's no guarantee. As a result, if some states receive a deluge of applicants, they may establish waiting lists until they determine they have enough funding. That is why it is important to sign up as soon as your state or the federal program allows. 
 CONSIDER AN ALTERNATIVE If you have recently lost your job, your Cobra coverage has run out or you're without health insurance for any other reason, waiting six months until you are eligible for the new risk pools may not be your best option. 
 Under a federal law known as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, your health cannot be taken into account if you are moving from one qualified insurance plan to another, as long as you have no more than a 62-day gap in coverage. 
 The new premiums may be higher, but many people would be better off finding another policy before that 62-day deadline passes than they would continuing without coverage for a full six months.

HEADLINE: A Villain, Younger but Already Formed

BYLINE: By ANITA GATES

 BODY:
If you've ever seen a production of ''The Little Foxes'' or the 1941 movie version with Bette Davis and wondered how her character, the monstrous Regina Giddens, got that way, ''Another Part of the Forest'' will answer that question. But you won't see the process. 
 In the Peccadillo Theater Company's intense, highly enjoyable production of ''Another Part of the Forest,'' at the Theater at St. Clement's, the 20-year-old Regina (Stephanie Wright Thompson) is already a fully formed villain. Meeting her father, Marcus Hubbard (Sherman Howard), and her brothers as young men, however, explains a lot. The play also convincingly reveals just why Regina went on to marry a man she never loved.
 Lillian Hellman fans may already know that a revival of ''The Little Foxes'' is coming to New York Theater Workshop in September. ''Another Part of the Forest'' was Hellman's follow-up to that play and, in modern terms, a prequel. It takes place in Alabama 20 years earlier, in 1880, when the Civil War was still a painfully fresh memory. The Hubbards were only as far away from it as we are from 1995, the year of the Oklahoma City bombing.
 Marcus is a hated man because he got rich from doing business with the enemy, but he was more in league with the Union Army than anyone knows. The Hubbards' neighbor Birdie Bagtry (Kendall Rileigh) and her family desperately need a loan because the plantation economy isn't what it used to be. Birdie's brother, John (Christopher Kelly), loved his battlefield experiences so much that he won't be happy until he finds another war to fight in. 
 Meanwhile, Regina wants to marry John. Her mother, Lavinia (Elizabeth Norment), callously ignored by her husband, appears to have gone off the deep end mentally. The older son, Benjamin (Matthew Floyd Miller), thinks he can trick his father out of $5,000. And the younger son, Oscar (Ben Curtis), is in love with a whore. 
 Dan Wackerman takes a couple of directorial missteps but only a couple. Most of the performances are impeccably forceful, and in terms of demeanor, Ms. Thompson could be Bette Davis's little sister. 
 ''Another Part of the Forest'' continues through next Saturday at the Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton; (212) 352-3101, thepeccadillo.com.

HEADLINE: More Nurses for Fewer Patients?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Is There a Nurse in the House?,'' by Theresa Brown (Op-Ed, June 19):
 As a staff registered nurse on a busy medical telemetry floor in a Midwestern hospital, I can certainly sympathize with Ms. Brown's assertion that mandatory nurse-patient staffing ratios can improve patient care and save lives. But I disagree with legislative action to accomplish this end.
 Patient acuity and staffing, as Ms. Brown well knows, are complex and individual issues that require thought and attention rather than bureaucracy. Nurses are not warm bodies with a nursing license. Nursing excellence and better patient outcomes can be achieved only with a well-educated, properly trained nursing staff dedicated to our profession. 
 Mandating staffing ratios will further destroy the idea that nurses can speak for themselves. Our voices are already a dim whisper in a discordant health care debate. The fragmentation of our care, increased patient complexity and the existing nursing shortage compound our difficulties in providing safe care, but one arbitrary staffing law will not fix this.
 As an R.N., I've safely cared for seven surgical patients at night, and have had days when three acutely ill patients seemed too many. Our professional judgment as nurses is sophisticated enough to determine our staffing needs, and a well-run hospital will support quality care at every level, especially nurse-patient ratios. Let us not as nurses turn over yet another decision to someone else, especially legislators.
 Jennifer Abraham Normal, Ill., June 20, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Theresa Brown describes the direct relationship between nurse staffing levels and patient safety. She could have added other examples of the effects of hospital cutbacks in recent years: resources pulled from discharge planning; system redundancies (safety checks) that have been eliminated; and clerical cutbacks that significantly impede communication among hospital departments.
 All of these patient-safety rollbacks are a direct result of a market-driven health care system that spins increasingly out of control. When almost a third of our health care dollars go to private insurance profit and overhead, these dollars are taken away from direct care.
 As Ms. Brown so clearly demonstrates, this is not merely a matter of academic debate.
 Federal standards for nurse-patient ratios are a start, but hospitals will end up robbing Peter to pay Paul. Until we transition to a Medicare-for-all, single-payer approach that eliminates the central role of private insurance in our system, we will not be able to afford consistently safe hospital care.

 To the Editor:
 Theresa Brown's article is right on target, but there is one important point that should be added and emphasized.
 The acuity of illness of many hospital inpatients is considerably higher today than formerly, since so much routine patient care is currently delivered on an outpatient basis. In many instances, only the sickest patients are admitted to the hospital. Therefore, it is increasingly important to mandate adequate patient-staff ratios in all inpatient settings.
 Dorothy C. Donahue Shinnecock Hills, N.Y., June 21, 2010
 The writer is a retired nurse.
 To the Editor:
 Theresa Brown's sentiments are in the right place, but I take issue with her conclusion. A significant component of today's fiscal health care debacle stems from prescriptive regulations by government on the platform of a cost-based reimbursement system.
 That led to a bloated regulatory environment that promulgated rules without any realistic regard for cost or basis in fact. Today's environment is moving toward a system where outcomes are reimbursed, not adherence to specious and multiple rules.
 Good care and patient satisfaction are outcomes we are all striving for, and there may be more than one way to get there. To mandate a process will only stymie the creative approaches to achieve better outcomes, within a new market-based health care economy that cannot afford or tolerate bloat.
 Robert Detor Port Washington, N.Y., June 19, 2010
 The writer is chief executive of the Long Island Home, a nonprofit organization that operates South Oaks Psychiatric Hospital and Broadlawn Manor Nursing and Rehabilitation Program, located in Amityville, N.Y.
 To the Editor:
 There was a nurse in the house for me not once but twice. First time: Just out of surgery and groggy, I dimly noticed a nurse sitting at the foot of my bed. I wondered what she was doing there. I dozed off but came awake with a start: the nurse was now in motion, calling out to others.
 I remember signaling with both thumbs pointing back at myself: ''Is this about me?'' It was. I had developed a cardiac arrhythmia. The nurse at the foot of the bed fixed it.
 Second time: While I was hospitalized for pneumonia, a nurse awakened me in the middle of the night to check my oxygen level. I had no symptoms and wanted to go back to sleep. Instead, I was treated for the fluid that had begun to fill my lungs.
 I owe my life to those two smart nurses and a hospital that does maintain the staffing ratios referred to in Theresa Brown's article.

HEADLINE: ACCORD REACHED FOR AN OVERHAUL OF FINANCE RULES

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Raymond Hernandez and Binyamin Appelbaum contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- An overhaul of the nation's financial regulatory system, reached after an all-night Congressional horse-trading session, will vastly expand the authority of the federal government over Wall Street in a bid to curb the free-wheeling culture that led to the near collapse of the world economy in 2008. 
 The deal between House and Senate negotiators, sealed just before sunrise on Friday, imposes new rules on some of the riskiest business practices and exotic investment instruments. It also levies hefty fees on the financial services industry, essentially forcing big banks and hedge funds to pay the projected $20 billion, five-year cost of the new oversight that they will face. And it empowers regulators to liquidate failing financial companies, fundamentally altering the balance between government and industry. 
 But after weeks of intense lobbying and months of debate, Congress in the end stopped short of prohibiting some of the practices that led to the crisis two years ago, betting instead that a newly empowered regulatory regime can rein in the big financial players without shackling the markets and drying up the flow of credit to businesses. 
 ''We are poised to pass the toughest financial reform since the ones we created in the aftermath of the Great Depression,'' President Obama said on the South Lawn of the White House, before leaving for the Group of 20 meeting in Toronto, where he was expected to press other nations to tighten their financial rules. 
 Democrats predicted that the full Congress would approve the legislation next week and that they would meet their goal of sending the bill to Mr. Obama for his signature by the Fourth of July. 
 The financial industry won some important victories, even if they face significantly heightened regulation. They fought off some of the toughest restrictions on their ability to invest their own funds. Most significantly, they thwarted an attempt to make them give up their highly profitable derivatives trading desks. And big lobbying fights remain in the future, when regulators begin the nitty-gritty task of turning complex, sometimes vague laws into real-world rules for these businesses to follow.
 Industry analysts predicted that banks would most likely adapt easily to the new regulatory framework and thrive. As a result, bank stocks were mostly higher Friday, prompting some skeptics to question if the legislation, in fact, would be tough enough to rein in the industry and prevent future shocks to the economy as a result of bad gambling. 
 Even architects of the bill acknowledged that it might take the next financial crisis to truly determine the effectiveness of the changes.
 On Friday morning, after a 20-hour final negotiating session, lawmakers, Congressional aides, lobbyists and the banking industry were still sorting through the legislative rubble of a frantic night of deal-making, edits and adjustments that left even some of those who worked most closely on the bill confused about exactly how some of the final details turned out. At points in the debates, lawmakers seemed to have trouble following their own deliberations.
 ''Can somebody explain to me what's in Tier 1 capital?'' Representative Melvin L. Watt, Democrat of North Carolina, pleaded, referring to the core measure of a bank's financial strength. ''I just don't have enough knowledge in this area.'' 
 The White House's desire to get a bill before the Fourth of July break drove the day. At 11 p.m. Thursday, Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the Financial Services Committee who presided over the conference proceedings, began to show signs of impatience. When the senior Republican on the committee, Representative Spencer Bachus of Alabama, asked for another minute to finish a statement, Mr. Frank cut him off. ''I would object to that,'' he snapped. ''Not at 11 o'clock at night.'' 
 As midnight turned to early morning, lawmakers cast rapid-fire votes on amendments hastily scrawled in the margins of rejected proposals. With C-Span carrying the proceedings live, the last half-hour of the session featured sometimes confused lawmakers repeatedly asking about what happened to various proposed amendments. 
 While the televised proceedings at times provided a remarkable window into the minutiae of legislating, many of the deals to complete the bill were cut outside the conference room, in private discussions between Democratic lawmakers and the Obama administration, with some of Washington's most influential lobbyists trying to weigh in as best they could. 
 One major bank on Friday scrambled to figure out what happened to six words that to its surprise and dismay were apparently cut from an amendment on proprietary trading, potentially posing a threat to its business. 
 The final bill vastly expands the regulatory powers of the Federal Reserve and establishes a systemic risk council of high-ranking officials, led by the Treasury secretary, to detect potential threats to the overall financial system. It creates a new consumer financial protection bureau, and widens the purview of the Securities and Exchange Commission to broaden regulation of hedge funds and credit rating agencies. 
 The measure restricts the ability of banks to invest and trade for their own accounts -- a provision known as the Volcker Rule, for its chief proponent, Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman -- and creates a tight new regulatory framework for derivatives, the complex financial instruments that were at the heart of the 2008 crisis. 
 But in a late-hour compromise, the bill does not include the tough restrictions on derivatives trading championed by Senator Blanche L. Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas, which would have forced banks to jettison their most lucrative dealings in this area. 
 Instead, in a deal negotiated between Mrs. Lincoln and a bloc of House members called the New Democrat Coalition, banks will be required to segregate their dealings only in the riskiest categories of derivatives, including the highly structured products like credit-default swaps based on bundles of mortgage loans, and in certain types of derivatives that are based on commodities that banks are already prohibited from investing in, like precious metals, agricultural products and energy. 
 But derivatives that have clear business purposes like helping manufacturing companies to hedge against the cost of raw materials or swings in foreign exchange rates would continue to be allowed. And nonfinancial corporations would be allowed to set up their own financial affiliates to create and trade derivatives related to their businesses. 
 The derivatives deal also headed off a last-minute rebellion by some New York lawmakers concerned about the effect of Mrs. Lincoln's proposal on Wall Street businesses. 
 ''We wanted to make sure we didn't drive all the derivative business out of New York,'' said Representative Gregory W. Meeks, a Democrat from Queens, who served on the conference committee. 
 The bill also does not include some of the more draconian proposals debated in recent months, including re-establishing a firewall between commercial and investment banking. And the nation's auto dealers won exemption from oversight by the new consumer protection bureau, which will regulate most consumer lending.
 Some business groups angrily denounced the final product, saying it was ill-conceived and would have unintended consequences harmful to the economy. 
 ''Far from effective reform, this legislation includes provisions totally unrelated to the financial crisis which may disrupt America's fragile economic recovery and increase instability and risk,'' said John J. Castellani, president of the Business Roundtable, which represents chief executives of top American companies.
 The conference report approved Friday is subject to approval by both chambers of Congress, a process that is expected to begin on Tuesday with action by the House and then by the Senate -- where 60 votes will be required to end debate. 
 The vote in the conference committee was on party lines, with Democrats in favor and Republicans opposed. House conferees voted 20 to 11 to approve the bill and Senate conferees voted 7 to 5. 
 Republicans repeatedly complained that the bill would do nothing to tighten regulation of the government-sponsored mortgage companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were at the heart of much of the housing crisis.
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the banking committee who with Mr. Frank led the negotiations, said the bill would prevent the corporate bailouts required in 2008 and allow the United States to become a global leader in financial regulation, potentially providing decades of stability. 
 ''Never again will we face the kind of bailout situation as we did in the fall of 2008 where a $700 billion check will have to be written,'' Mr. Dodd said in an interview. But he acknowledged that the effectiveness of the legislation would be learned only over time. 
 ''I don't have the kind of ego that would tell you we have absolutely solved these problems,'' he said. ''We won't know until we face the next economic crisis.'' 
 Republicans, however, warned that the bill would extend the reach of government too far. 
 At one point during debate over whether banks should be allowed to trade for their own profit, Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, asked what the issue had to do with the financial crisis. ''How much riskier is proprietary trading than investment in certain forms of residential real estate?'' Mr. Hensarling asked. 
 ''If we're not going to bail them out with taxpayer money, what they do with their money is their business.'' 
 He said, adding: ''This is one more occasion where we see something in the bill that did not have a causal role in the crisis.''
 While regulatory bills often get watered down as they grind through the legislative process and interest groups and industry press for changes, the financial bill mostly gained strength as the debate lengthened and lawmakers seized on public frustration that rich financial institutions, recently bailed out by taxpayers, showed no signs of curtailing their risky practices or their outsize pay packages.

HEADLINE: What the Gulf Can't Afford

 BODY:
In late May, with a broken pipe spewing tens of thousands of barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico, President Obama imposed a six-month moratorium on new deep-water drilling in the gulf and suspended operations at 33 exploratory deep-water wells. These were common-sense moves -- a timeout while a presidential commission figured out why the disaster occurred and recommended ways to prevent future calamities. 
 Responding to industry complaints, Martin Feldman, a United States District Court judge in New Orleans, overturned the order. The judge, who owns stock in oil-related companies, described oil and gas drilling as ''elemental'' to gulf communities and said he was certain a higher court would find the moratorium ''arbitrary and capricious.'' 
 The White House has promised a quick appeal, and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar has offered to provide additional information to show why the moratorium is necessary. The justification should be self-evident. One calamity at a time is more than enough. 
 Until the Deepwater Horizon accident, industry insisted that the chances of a big blowout were vanishingly small and that, if one did happen, it could quickly respond. We now know that this was flatly untrue; even BP has since conceded that it did not have the ''tool kit'' to stop the spill or even contain it. 
 Sadly enough, there were plenty of reasons to worry even before the spill. As an investigation in The Times made clear, the device the industry called its last line of defense -- the blowout preventer -- had failed before, and had never been rigorously tested in deep, cold water. 
 The report from the presidential commission may not be ready until the end of the year. But William K. Reilly, one of the two chairmen of the commission, said this week that he would not recommend lifting the moratorium until he was satisfied that the industry had agreed to adopt safer drilling techniques and that the administration had reformed and strengthened the federal agencies charged with policing offshore drilling. 
 On Wednesday, the Interior Department established a new investigative unit to examine conflicts of interest within the oil industry's chief regulator, the Minerals Management Service (recently renamed the Bureau of Ocean Energy). The service has been too chummy with industry, and its lax regulation may have contributed to the Deepwater Horizon spill. 
 The Times investigation added chilling new details on its failure to do its job. Agency officials ignored their own studies about the perils of deep-water drilling, and in some cases their own rules, by giving BP drilling permits without insisting on proof that its backup systems would work at 5,000-foot depths. 
 The pressure to resume deep-water drilling is not going away, even if Judge Feldman's ruling is overturned on appeal. It must be resisted. BP's $20 billion escrow fund -- plus a special $100 million account designed specifically to help oil workers -- should relieve some of the region's economic stress. But if there is one lesson above all from this disaster, it is that business cannot continue as usual. The economic interests of the oil industry cannot be allowed to trump the long-term health of the gulf and the jobs and the lives that depend on it.

HEADLINE: Worse Than A Nightmare

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
President Obama can be applauded for his decisiveness in dispatching the chronically insubordinate Stanley McChrystal, but we are still left with a disaster of a war in Afghanistan that cannot be won and that the country as a whole will not support.
 No one in official Washington is leveling with the public about what is really going on. We hear a lot about counterinsurgency, the latest hot cocktail-hour topic among the BlackBerry-thumbing crowd. But there is no evidence at all that counterinsurgency will work in Afghanistan. It's not working now. And even if we managed to put all the proper pieces together, the fiercest counterinsurgency advocates in the military will tell you that something on the order of 10 to 15 years of hard effort would be required for this strategy to bear significant fruit. 
 We've been in Afghanistan for nearly a decade already. It's one of the most corrupt places on the planet and the epicenter of global opium production. Our ostensible ally, President Hamid Karzai, is convinced that the U.S. cannot prevail in the war and is in hot pursuit of his own deal with the enemy Taliban. The American public gave up on the war long ago, and it is not at all clear that President Obama's heart is really in it.
 For us to even consider several more years of fighting and dying in Afghanistan -- at a cost of heaven knows how many more billions of American taxpayer dollars -- is demented.
 Those who are so fascinated with counterinsurgency, from its chief advocate, Gen. David Petraeus, all the way down to the cocktail-hour kibitzers inside the Beltway, seem to have lost sight of a fundamental aspect of warfare: You don't go to war half-stepping. You go to war to crush the enemy. You do this ferociously and as quickly as possible. If you don't want to do it, if you have qualms about it, or don't know how to do it, don't go to war.
 The men who stormed the beaches at Normandy weren't trying to win the hearts and minds of anyone. 
 In Afghanistan, we are playing a dangerous, half-hearted game in which President Obama tells the America people that this is a war of necessity and that he will do whatever is necessary to succeed. Then, with the very next breath, he soothingly assures us that the withdrawal of U.S. troops will begin on schedule, like a Greyhound leaving the terminal, a year from now.
 Both cannot be true.
 What is true is that we aren't even fighting as hard as we can right now. The counterinsurgency crowd doesn't want to whack the enemy too hard because of an understandable fear that too many civilian casualties will undermine the ''hearts and minds'' and nation-building components of the strategy. Among the downsides of this battlefield caution is a disturbing unwillingness to give our own combat troops the supportive airstrikes and artillery cover that they feel is needed.
 In an article this week, The Times quoted a U.S. Army sergeant in southern Afghanistan who was unhappy with the real-world effects of counterinsurgency. ''I wish we had generals who remembered what it was like when they were down in a platoon,'' he said. ''Either they never have been in real fighting, or they forgot what it's like.''
 In the Rolling Stone article that led to General McChrystal's ouster, reporter Michael Hastings wrote about the backlash that counterinsurgency restraints had provoked among the general's own troops. Many feel that ''being told to hold their fire'' increases their vulnerability. A former Special Forces operator, a veteran of both Iraq and Afghanistan, said of General McChrystal, according to Mr. Hastings, ''His rules of engagement put soldiers' lives in even greater danger. Every real soldier will tell you the same thing.''
 We are sinking more and more deeply into the fetid quagmire of Afghanistan and neither the president nor General Petraeus nor anyone else has the slightest clue about how to get out. The counterinsurgency zealots in the military want more troops sent to Afghanistan, and they want the president to completely scrap his already shaky July 2011 timetable for the beginning of a withdrawal.
 We're like a compulsive gambler plunging ever more deeply into debt in order to wager on a rigged game. There is no victory to be had in Afghanistan, only grief. We're bulldozing Detroit while at the same time trying to establish model metropolises in Kabul and Kandahar. We're spending endless billions on this wretched war but can't extend the unemployment benefits of Americans suffering from the wretched economy here at home.
 The difference between this and a nightmare is that when you wake up from a nightmare it's over. This is all too tragically real.

HEADLINE: Oliver Stone's Latin America

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
In feature films about John F. Kennedy, Richard M. Nixon and George W. Bush, Oliver Stone gave free rein to his imagination and was often criticized for doing so. Now, in ''South of the Border,'' which opened on Friday, he has turned to Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's controversial populist president, and his reformist allies in South America. 
 ''People who are often demonized, like Nixon and Bush and Chavez and Castro, fascinate me,'' Mr. Stone said in an interview this week during a tour to promote the film, which portrays Mr. Chavez as a benevolent, generous, tolerant and courageous leader who has been unjustly maligned. ''It's a recurring thing,'' he added, that may suggest ''a psychological attachment to the underdog'' on his part.
 Unlike his movies about American presidents, the 78-minute ''South of the Border'' is meant to be a documentary, and therefore to be held to different standards. But it is plagued by the same issues of accuracy that critics have raised about his movies, dating back to ''JFK.'' Taken together, the mistakes, misstatements and missing details could undermine Mr. Stone's glowing portrait of Mr. Chavez. 
 Mr. Stone's problems in the film begin early on, with his account of Mr. Chavez's rise. As ''South of the Border'' portrays it, Mr. Chavez's main opponent in his initial run for president in 1998 was ''a 6-foot-1-inch blond former Miss Universe'' named Irene Saez, and thus ''the contest becomes known as the Beauty and the Beast'' election.
 But Mr. Chavez's main opponent then was not Ms. Saez, who finished third, with less than 3 percent of the vote. It was Henrique Salas Romer, a bland former state governor who won 40 percent of the vote.
 When this and several other discrepancies were pointed out to Mr. Stone in the interview, his attitudes varied. ''I'm sorry about that, and I apologize,'' he said about the 1998 election. But he also complained of ''nitpicking'' and ''splitting hairs'' and said that it was not his intention to make either a program for C-Span or engage in what he called ''a cruel and brutal'' Mike Wallace-style interrogation of Mr. Chavez that the BBC broadcast this month. 
 ''We are dealing with a big picture, and we don't stop to go into a lot of the criticism and details of each country,'' he said. ''It's a 101 introduction to a situation in South America that most Americans and Europeans don't know about,'' he added, because of ''years and years of blighted journalism.'' 
 ''I think there has been so much unbalance that we are definitely a counter to that,'' he also said. 
 Tariq Ali, the British-Pakistani historian and commentator who helped write the screenplay, added: ''It's hardly a secret that we support the other side. It's an opinionated documentary.''
 Initial reviews of ''South of the Border'' have been tepid. Stephen Holden in The New York Times called it a ''provocative, if shallow, exaltation of Latin American socialism,'' while Entertainment Weekly described it as ''rose-colored agitprop.'' 
 Some of the misinformation that Mr. Stone, who consistently mispronounces Mr. Chavez's name as Sha-VEZ instead of CHA-vez, inserts into ''South of the Border'' is relatively benign. A flight from Caracas to La Paz, Bolivia, flies mostly over the Amazon, not the Andes, and the United States does not ''import more oil from Venezuela than any other OPEC nation,'' a distinction that has belonged to Saudi Arabia during the period 2004-10.
 But other questionable assertions relate to fundamental issues, including Mr. Stone's contention that human rights, a concern in Latin America since the Jimmy Carter era, is ''a new buzz phrase,'' used mainly to clobber Mr. Chavez. Mr. Stone argues in the film that Colombia, which ''has a far worse human rights record than Venezuela,'' gets ''a pass in the media that Chavez doesn't'' because of his hostility to the United States. 
 As Mr. Stone begins to speak, the logo of Human Rights Watch, which closely monitors the situation in both Colombia and Venezuela and has issued tough reports on both, appears on the screen. That would seem to imply that the organization is part of the ''political double standard'' of which Mr. Stone complains. 
 ''It's true that many of Chavez's fiercest critics in Washington have turned a blind eye to Colombia's appalling human rights record,'' said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the group's Americas division. ''But that's no reason to ignore the serious damage that Chavez has done to human rights and the rule of law in Venezuela,'' which includes summarily expelling Mr. Vivanco and an associate, in violation of Venezuelan law, after Human Rights Watch issued a critical report in 2008.
 A similarly tendentious attitude pervades Mr. Stone's treatment of the April 2002 coup that briefly toppled Mr. Chavez. One of the key events in that crisis, perhaps its instigation, was the ''Llaguno Bridge Massacre,'' in which 19 people were shot to death in circumstances that remain murky, with Chavez supporters blaming the opposition, and vice versa. 
 Mr. Stone's film includes some new footage from the confrontation at the bridge, but its basic argument hews closely to that of ''The Revolution Will Not Be Televised,'' a film the Chavez camp has endorsed. That documentary, however, has been subject to rebuttal by another, called ''X-Ray of a Lie,'' and by Brian A. Nelson's book ''The Silence and the Scorpion: The Coup Against Chavez and the Making of Modern Venezuela'' (Nation Books), neither of which Mr. Stone mentions. 
 Instead Mr. Stone relies heavily on the account of Gregory Wilpert, who witnessed some of the exchange of gunfire and is described as an American academic. But Mr. Wilpert is also the husband of Mr. Chavez's consul-general in New York, Carol Delgado, and a longtime editor and president of the board of a Web site, Venezuelanalysis.com, set up with donations from the Venezuelan government, affiliations that Mr. Stone does not disclose.
 Like Mr. Stone's take on the Kennedy assassination, this section of ''South of the Border'' hinges on the identity of a sniper or snipers who may or may not have been part of a larger conspiracy. As Mr. Stone puts it in the film, ''Shots were fired from the rooftops of buildings, and members from both sides were hit in the head.''
 In a telephone interview this week, Mr. Wilpert acknowledged that the first shots seem to have been fired from a building known as La Nacional, which housed the administrative offices of Freddy Bernal, the pro-Chavez mayor of central Caracas. In a congressional investigation following the coup, Mr. Bernal, who led an elite police squadron before taking office, was questioned about a military officer's testimony that the Defense Ministry had ordered Mr. Bernal to fire on opposition demonstrators. Mr. Bernal described that charge as ''totally false.'' 
 ''I did not know about that, I didn't even know it was a Chavista building,'' Mr. Stone said initially, before retreating to his original position. ''Show me some Zapruder footage, and it might be different,'' he said.
 The second half of ''South of the Border'' is a road movie in which Mr. Stone, sometimes accompanied by Mr. Chavez, meets with leaders of Bolivia, Argentina, Paraguay, Brazil, Ecuador and Cuba. But here, too, he bends facts and omits information that might undermine his thesis of a continent-wide ''Bolivarian revolution,'' with Mr. Chavez in the forefront.
 Visiting Argentina, for example, he accurately describes the economic collapse of 2001. But then he jumps to Nestor Kirchner's election to the presidency in May 2003 and lets Mr. Kirchner and his successor -- and wife -- Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner claim that ''we began a different policy than before.'' 
 In reality, Mr. Kirchner's presidential predecessor, Eduardo Duhalde, and Mr. Duhalde's finance minister, Roberto Lavagna, were the architects of that policy shift and the subsequent economic recovery, which began while Mr. Kirchner was still the obscure governor of a small province in Patagonia. Mr. Kirchner was originally a protege of Mr. Duhalde's, but the two men are now political enemies, which explains the Kirchners' desire to write him out of their version of history.
 Trying to explain the rise of Evo Morales, the president of Bolivia who is a Chavez acolyte, Mr. Ali refers to a controversial and botched water privatization in the city of Cochabamba. 
 ''The government decided to sell the water supply of Cochabamba to Bechtel, a U.S. corporation,'' he says, ''and this corporation, one of the things it got the government to do was to pass a law saying that from now on it was illegal for poor people to go out onto the roofs and collect rainwater in receptacles.''
 In reality, the government did not sell the water supply: it granted a consortium that included Bechtel a 40-year management concession in return for injections of capital to expand and improve water service and construction of a dam for electricity and irrigation. Nor is the issue of water collection by the poor exactly as Mr. Ali presents it. 
 ''The rainwater permit issue always comes up,'' Jim Shultz, a water privatization critic and co-editor of ''Dignity and Defiance: Stories of Bolivia's Challenge to Globalization'' (University of California Press), said in an e-mail message. ''What I can say is that the privatization of the public water system was accompanied by a government plan to require permits in order to dig wells and such, and that it could have potentially granted management concessions to Bechtel or others.'' 
 But ''it never got that far,'' he added, and ''it remains unclear to me to this day what type of water collection systems would have been included.'' He concluded: ''Many believed that would have included some rain collection systems. That could also easily be hype.''
 Asked about the discrepancy, Mr. Ali replied that ''we can talk about all this endlessly,'' but ''the aim of our film is very clear and basic.'' In ''South of the Border,'' he added: ''We were not writing a book, or having an academic debate. It was to have a sympathetic view of these governments.''

HEADLINE: They're Supposed to Lead

 BODY:
When the global financial system was teetering on the brink, the world's leading economies worked together to head off the worst. In coordinated moves, they pumped capital into their banks, guaranteed loans and set up emergency financing for countries sideswiped by the crisis. A few months later, they committed to spend whatever was needed to avoid a global depression. 
 The mood will be very different when the leaders of the Group of 8 and Group of 20 richest nations meet in Canada this weekend. The sense of fear has waned, and many politicians -- and voters -- have decided that it is time to cut deficits. That may sound good, but it isn't. 
 If everyone slashes budgets at once, it could well tip the world back into a deep recession. If everybody tries to export their way out of their internal slumps, it could compound that problem by unleashing a damaging new round of trade protectionism. The recession already has become an excuse to shirk promises made to the poor. Five years ago, leaders of the G-8 and other wealthy nations promised to increase aid by $50 billion in five years. They are $18 billion short. That isn't just a failure of generosity. Alleviating poverty promotes stability, weakens the appeal of terrorism and helps growth. 
 The biggest risk is the scramble by so many governments to unwind fiscal stimulus in favor of deficit reduction. Spain and Greece may have little choice if they hope to draw back panicked investors. Even countries with strong economies, like Germany, are determined to slash spending. Britain's new government has just pledged to cut its deficit from around 10 percent to about 1 percent of gross national product over five years. That is too soon and too fast and risks worsening and prolonging the country's economic slump. 
 The United States is barely doing better. President Obama is expected to press other countries with the wherewithal to keep spending until their economies, and the global economy, are stronger. Back in Washington, however, he hasn't been able to persuade Congress to move ahead with his own modest stimulus agenda. This week, the Senate failed again to extend unemployment insurance for hundreds of thousands of workers. 
 President Obama needs to issue a clear warning at this weekend's meetings: The crisis isn't over, and the world's economies need to keep working together. He will have a lot more credibility if he pledges to fight harder for his own stimulus policies when he gets home.

HEADLINE: In Bridgeport, 'Deep Sigh Of Relief' After Tornado

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS; Robert Davey contributed reporting.. 
Robert Davey contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Residents of Connecticut's largest city expressed relief on Friday that no one was killed a day earlier by a tornado that shredded trees and roofs, tore down power lines, crushed buildings and even swept through a museum dedicated to the flamboyant showman P. T. Barnum.
 More than 30 people were treated at hospitals, most of them for minor injuries. 
 ''The tornado touched down for just a short period of time, but it will take several weeks, perhaps months, to put so many lives and livelihoods back together,'' said Gov. M. Jodi Rell of Connecticut, who inspected the damage. Governor Rell said the state would seek federal assistance.
 Mayor Bill Finch of Bridgeport estimated that damage was in the millions of dollars.
 ''I think everybody just breathed a deep sigh of relief,'' Mr. Finch said.
 It was the latest blow to the city, a former industrial and manufacturing center of about 135,000 that has struggled to cope with poverty, crime and a history of political corruption even as it made some progress with sports stadiums and downtown developments.
 Officials at the National Weather Service confirmed that the storm was a tornado. It hit an area about 100 yards wide and a quarter-mile long with winds of at least 100 miles per hour.
 Remarkably, there were few injuries. Officials at St. Vincent's Medical Center said Friday they had admitted only two people.
 Hundreds of bricks shook loose from buildings, trees split in half and crushed cars, and a billboard hung precariously several stories up over Main Street.
 Nine buildings were partially or fully collapsed, including at least three that crumbled to their foundations. Rescuers searched the rubble to ensure no one was trapped inside.
 A Catholic high school, a museum dedicated to Barnum and several other buildings also had roof and window damage. Mr. Finch said 20 to 30 buildings would have to be inspected.
 The tornado also toppled trees in Washington Park, a historic square east of downtown that Barnum gave to the city.
 The wreckage ''looked like a jungle,'' said Eddie Reyes, a restaurant owner who lost about $15,000 worth of food and ice cream after power went out.
 ''Fifty years,'' he continued, ''I have never seen anything like this.''
 Eric Boykin, 42, a tenant on East Main Street who was sweeping up in his front yard on Friday, was philosophical about the damage.
 ''It wasn't that bad,'' he said, expressing hope that he would ''get a couple of dollars to get my car back on the road,'' nodding toward a green Honda Accord half covered by roofing material.
 ''That's my neighbor's roof -- it flipped over and landed on my car,'' Mr. Boykin said, adding that he was waiting for an insurance adjuster before taking action.
 Another resident walking by said she could not wait to repair the damage to her house nearby. ''The roof came off in front of my house,'' Lizzette Alvarez, 41, said. ''We picked it up.''
 At the Beardsley Zoo, employees were relieved that the storm had inflicted no serious damage.
 ''It frightened some of the animals,'' said Tedor Whitman, 42, curator of education. Surprisingly perhaps, the tigers were spooked. ''You don't see tigers get scared too often.'' he said.
 In an unusual episode stemming from the damage, the mayor's 28-year-old son, Peter Finch, was charged with stealing a street sign after the police said he stopped to ''get a souvenir,'' then entered a bar after a citywide curfew -- imposed by his father. The curfew was widely ignored.
 Mr. Finch called his arrest ''silly'' and said his only intention was to take the sign to his father.

HEADLINE: Federal Aid States Were Counting On May Be Lost After Jobs Bill Stalls

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO and SARAH WHEATON; Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting from Washington, and Jennifer Steinhauer from Los Angeles.

 BODY:
Financially struggling states, already facing record budget shortfalls, are now confronting the possibility of losing out on billions of dollars in federal aid that they had been counting on, if Congress does not revive a jobs bill that stalled in the Senate this week.
 The result, governors and state budget officers are warning, could be hundreds of thousands of layoffs at the state and local levels, as well as draconian spending cuts. 
 ''It's a bloodletting,'' said Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania, a Democrat.
 But Mr. Rendell and other state leaders are running up against Senate Republicans and at least one Democrat concerned about the spiraling federal deficit. 
 ''What we're not willing to do, is use worthwhile programs as an excuse to burden our children and our grandchildren with an even bigger national debt,'' the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, said in a statement Thursday. 
 At issue is money from the federal government to help states foot the bill for Medicaid, the health care program for the poor, which had been part of last year's federal stimulus package. 
 The enhanced financing for Medicaid was set to expire at the end of the year, but most states had been counting on at least six more months of aid that was to have been part of a legislative package that included an extension of unemployment benefits for the long-term unemployed.
 That measure, however, stalled in the Senate on Thursday, with Republicans and a lone Democrat, Ben Nelson of Nebraska, combining to block a procedural vote needed to allow the bill to proceed.
 It was a setback for Senate Democrats and the Obama administration. A White House official said Friday that the administration would continue to push the bill, but it was unclear where the votes would come from.
 A total of 30 states had already factored the additional Medicaid money into their budgets, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Only nine states have come up with contingency plans. Most states begin their fiscal years on July 1.
 The additional federal aid for Medicaid was initially supposed to be $24 billion but was later scaled back to $16 billion in the bill that stalled on Thursday.
 Making the situation more difficult for states, the recent passage of the federal health care overhaul bars them from rolling back eligibility on Medicaid, so the cuts would have to come from elsewhere in their budgets -- and would likely include layoffs from different parts of the state governments, many of which have already seen big cuts -- or by slashing things like payments to Medicaid providers.
 ''If they don't fund this, it's an unfunded mandate on the states,'' said Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm of Michigan. 
 Making up for the missing federal aid would add another half billion dollars to Michigan's existing $1.5 billion budget shortfall, Ms. Granholm said on a conference call with reporters Friday. 
 Ms. Granholm said Michigan lawmakers would be forced to make ''ugly cuts,'' one of which would probably be a 35 percent cut in payments to Medicaid providers, which she said would harm medical access for patients.
 ''These are cuts that we have not even dared to put on the table'' in the past, she said. ''We don't have too many choices here.''
 Most states have already been through two or three rounds of budget cuts since the recession began, said Brian Sigritz, an official with the National Association of State Budget Officers.
 State revenues are expected to be up slightly in the coming fiscal year compared with the last, but are still expected to be down about $54 billion since the recession began, said Mr. Sigritz.
 Normally, he said, it takes five years for revenues to return to where they were before a recession. 
 ''We saw this money as bridge money,'' said Raymond C. Scheppach, executive director of the National Governors Association. ''Our hope is we're not in a double-dip, and we're actually going to see some moderate revenue growth. We felt by 2012 it would be a bit better.''
 Most states are legally or constitutionally required to balance their budgets, so the sudden shortfall puts them in an immediate bind. States already grappling with mammoth budget gaps would be in the most trouble.
 In Pennsylvania, which is confronting a $1.6 billion revenue shortfall, the elimination of the additional Medicaid financing would mean having to come up with $850 million, Mr. Rendell said.
 Because the state has already made more than $2.5 billion in cuts since the fall of 2008, when the economy went into a freefall, Mr. Rendell said layoffs were inevitable, not just at the state level but the local level.
 ''It's going to be huge teacher layoffs, money to our universities, money to the counties and cities, municipal workers, firemen,'' he said. ''It would be enormously destructive.''
 Mr. Rendell fretted that the resulting fallout from the loss of federal money would bring a halt to three straight months of job gains for the state. 
 ''I know everyone cares about the deficit, and so do I,'' he said. ''But they care about the deficit until the cuts hit home.''
 Mr. Rendell was conferring with other governors Friday about going to Washington to lobby for the measure. 
 Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, which would lose out on $1.8 billion in financing, said Friday that the failure of the bill was ''disappointing'' but added, ''it's not over yet.''

HEADLINE: Candidate Shrugs Off History's Lure

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. -- Tim Scott seemed unburdened by history.
 He is poised to become the first black Republican elected to Congress from the Deep South in more than a century, having trounced former Senator Strom Thurmond's son in Tuesday's Republican primary for South Carolina's First Congressional District.
 And yet when a voter, Carol Kinsman, a retired nurse who is white, greeted him here the other day, saying, ''We're going to make history,'' Mr. Scott gently suggested that the color of his skin was not important. 
 ''Our people are more concerned about the issues than anything else,'' he told her. Then he quickly turned the subject to economic development and the need to expand the local Interstate. 
 Mr. Scott, 44, spent 13 years in county government and is in his second year in the South Carolina Legislature. But the national spotlight seemed to find him only Tuesday night. If elected in November -- which is likely, given that his Democratic opponent, Ben Frasier, who is also black, is a perennial who has yet to bloom -- he will become the only black Republican on Capitol Hill and the first since Representative J. C. Watts of Oklahoma retired in 2003.
 ''The historic part of this is nice to have -- maybe,'' he said of winning the Republican nomination, but he said it was also ''a distraction.''
 It is not hard to see what he means. This heavily Republican district stretches along the seacoast from here to Charleston, taking in many former plantations and including what was the main port of entry for tens of thousands of African slaves. The district is three-fourths white, and voted overwhelmingly for John McCain over Barack Obama in 2008.
 But Mr. Scott, a staunch conservative, is a true reflection of its politics.
 He believes that President Obama is driving the country toward bankruptcy and socialism. And he has some regard for Mr. Thurmond, at one time a leading segregationist and warrior against civil rights. When Mr. Scott was first elected to the Charleston County Council in 1995, Mr. Thurmond sent him a handwritten note welcoming him to the party. A year later, Mr. Scott became the statewide co-chairman of Mr. Thurmond's Senate campaign, his last before he retired in 2003 and died the same year at 100.
 How could a black man support someone with such a racist past?
 ''The Strom Thurmond I knew had nothing to do with that,'' Mr. Scott said. ''I don't spend much time on history,'' he added, noting that Mr. Thurmond had ''evolved'' by the time Mr. Scott was born, and had become better known, locally anyway, for his extraordinary level of constituent service. Mr. Scott said he hoped to emulate Mr. Thurmond's attention to constituents, though not his longevity in Washington.
 His goals are to shrink government, repeal the new federal health care law and eliminate earmarks, even those that would help his state. In the state legislature, he has co-sponsored an Arizona-style immigration bill, earning him the endorsement of the Minutemen. 
 In the primary runoff, Paul Thurmond, his opponent, branded him a career politician and an ineffective one at that.
 ''My opponent has run for four offices in three years,'' Mr. Thurmond said during a debate. ''He's the epitome of politics as usual.'' He added: ''You wonder why he hasn't gotten anything done in the House. He's introduced five bills and hasn't passed a single one. Within six months of moving into the House, he was running for a different race -- that is not commitment.''
 Mr. Scott was embraced by some leaders of the Republican establishment, including Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, and some Republicans with Tea Party backing, including former Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska (on Facebook), leading some to refer to a ''black tea'' movement, which is eager to shed any racial overtones. 
 He also received big donations from the Club for Growth, bringing his total amount raised to an impressive $600,000. Mr. Scott said that if elected, he would limit himself to four terms in Congress, in part because he is a man with a plan -- a rather detailed one -- that grew out of his troubled youth.
 Mr. Scott's parents were divorced when he was 7. His mother, a nurse at a hospital in Charleston, raised him and his older brother, who is now in the Army in Germany, by herself, often working 16-hour days to keep them off welfare.
 Now a business executive, Mr. Scott said he never used drugs and worked since he was 13, wiping windshields at a gas station and serving popcorn at a movie theater. But he acted up in class to seek attention, he said, and by ninth grade, he was failing several courses, including civics, English and Spanish. 
 He was rescued by a man named John Moniz, who ran the Chick-fil-A next to the movie theater. Mr. Moniz became his mentor, imbuing him with his conservative, Christian philosophy and, as a graduate of the Citadel, teaching him the importance of structure and discipline. He also introduced him to the self-help views of the motivational Christian author Zig Ziglar.
 ''To know my story is to understand that there were people who had no reason to step up to the plate and help me, but who did,'' Mr. Scott said. ''I want to serve the community because the community helped me.'' 
 Mr. Moniz died of a heart attack at 38, when Mr. Scott was 17. That prompted Mr. Scott to write down a ''mission statement'' for his life: to have a positive effect on the lives of one billion people before he dies.
 From there he developed what he calls a ''life matrix,'' a script for living, which is a blueprint for his future, blocked out in five-year segments. Getting elected to Congress, he said, is ''helpful'' to his life plan, but his goals are laid out in terms of how much he can help other people.
 ''I have financial goals, the number of lives I want to impact, the number of speeches to give to nonprofits and to faith community organizations, the number of dollars to invest back into the community, the number of speeches to kids like me in high school who are dropping out,'' he said.
 He has already helped develop a ''healthy heart'' program at the hospital where his mother still works. (He has lost 30 pounds in the last two years.)
 ''If you really believe in something and that the government shouldn't do it, you better be busy,'' he said.
 Government, he said, allows too many people to be unaccountable, while individuals can achieve great things.
 ''That's why I need to invest my time, my talent and my treasure in getting things done,'' like helping people develop self-discipline and financial security, he said. ''That's my ambition.''

HEADLINE: In the Oval Office, Command and Control

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
After two months in which an oil gusher seemed to underscore the limits of his powers, President Obama spent the last week trying to reassert control over a triumvirate of forces that almost always test a new president's authority: the military, the markets and the lobbyists.
 Mr. Obama's much-needed victories, nearly a year and a half into a presidency that was saddled from the start by two wars and a terrifying financial plunge, may not prove to be lasting. 
 His firing of Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal for what appeared to be an attitude of disrespect and disdain for the civilian chain of command does not make success in Afghanistan any more likely. The financial regulatory bill that was agreed upon in Congress on Friday reverses two decades of increasingly blind faith in the ability of financial markets to regulate themselves, but few think it will stop Wall Street's constant effort to route around Washington in pursuit of profits.
 Still, add those together with the use of raw presidential power to force BP to set up a $20 billion fund for victims of the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, and the conclusion is unmistakable. George Bush and Dick Cheney may have left the White House, but the argument for an extraordinarily strong executive lives on. 
 ''This is a clear respite from the theme that Obama had lost control,'' said David Rothkopf, a former Clinton administration official who wrote the definitive history of the National Security Council, the organization American presidents have used for 60 years to assert authority around the country and the world. ''He sent a loud and clear message to the generals about who is in charge. And he has engineered a pivot-point in U.S. economic history, an end, or at least a big change, to the 'leave it to the markets' era.''
 The White House certainly has an enormous interest in portraying Mr. Obama as a president who has grown comfortable with his powers and is unafraid to exercise them. They conceded that Mr. Obama had no legal basis to force BP to create the $20 billion fund; they said he was making a moral argument, and used the jawboning power of the presidential pulpit to push the company.
 One top national security aide noted to a reporter on Wednesday that the decision to oust General McChrystal and replace him with Gen. David A. Petraeus was ''considered, decided and executed in less than 36 hours'' and sent a message that the president would not tolerate what he called ''division'' in the ranks of his team after he had set strategy. 
 And the financial regulatory bill, they argued, got stronger in the last few weeks, leading Mr. Obama to boast at the White House that it was ''the toughest financial reform since the one we created in the aftermath of the Great Depression.'' 
 He can rightly claim that the bill actually got stronger as it worked its way through Congress rather than having the legislation eroded as one lobbyist after another found a way to carve exceptions. (The exception to that rule was the handling of derivatives, a business the banks get to keep, even if they have to operate under new restrictions.) 
 ''I think we used this week or so not only for a reassertion of executive authority, but as an demonstration that, when presidential power is judiciously applied, you can get a lot done,'' said Rahm Emanuel, the president's chief of staff, who argued for a more confrontational approach to BP and for General McChrystal's ouster. He described financial reform legislation as one of five pillars of ''a new foundation'' for the economy, after the stimulus package, the health care overhaul and the re-engineering of college aid. (The fifth, an energy bill, may prove the hardest.)
 Yet Mr. Rothkopf and even some of the president's aides caution against confusing short-term reassertion of authority with a long-term ability to shape events. Wars and markets have a curious way of taking on a momentum of their own. With his victories this week, Mr. Obama owns, even more than before, America's future in Afghanistan and the government's running war to rein in big market players without squashing innovation or growth.
 The messy encounter with General McChrystal forced Mr. Obama to reassert his faith in a strategy in Afghanistan (a troop surge, a counterinsurgency strategy that exposes American forces to significant danger, and the eventual transfer of recaptured territory to Afghan government hands) that so far has shown little signs of working. The left remains deeply apprehensive about his growing commitment to the war; the right argues that his 18-month deadline to begin withdrawing troops is a sign of absence of commitment. 
 When Mr. Obama declared, ''I welcome debate, but I won't tolerate division,'' it amounted to an unspoken acknowledgment that his national security team remained split, and never really ended the argument over whether the current approach to the war was the right one. Even without General McChrystal, the argument seems bound to flare again in December, when it is up for a major review.
 The financial reform bill was a different expression of presidential influence and power and a bill Mr. Obama clearly wanted in his pocket before he left Friday for Canada and his third meeting of the Group of 20 nations, the organization that has risen in power largely because of the financial crisis.
 At the first G-20 in his presidency in London last year, Mr. Obama got an earful about how lax American regulation was responsible for the huge lapses in judgment and the greed that prompted the crisis. He promised changes that would directly address the causes of the 2008 collapse, but when the health care debate diverted Congress, many foreign officials said during visits to Washington that they feared the reforms would wither, just as they had in past crises.
 Mr. Obama insisted on a series of consumer protections that would assure government regulation of, say, subprime mortgages even if the loans were not issued by a bank. (Countrywide Financial, one of the biggest offenders in the subprime market, was not a bank and thus not subject to the usual rules.) 
 He got that, but the regulatory powers do not rest with the president himself. The bill relies more on the powers of the Fed and independent boards, insulating Mr. Obama a bit from the argument that he has centered more regulatory power in the White House. 
 Mr. Obama must now make the argument that he is serious about enforcement and that if regulations are to work in a global economy, banks around the globe will have to adhere to the same regulations. Otherwise, evading the new American rules will pose little challenge to financial institutions that have learned long ago the art of crossing borders to take new risks.

HEADLINE: G-20 Talks Will Test Leaders' United Stance

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN and JACKIE CALMES; David Leonhardt contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
TORONTO -- Hours after Congress reached agreement on a plan to restructure the American financial system, President Obama began meeting with world leaders on Friday counting on the deal to give momentum to his administration's efforts to forge a consensus on restoring global economic growth.
 As leaders of the world's biggest economies settled in for meetings at a lakeside resort in Ontario, American and European officials played down talk of a growing rift between them on the scope and timing of fiscal belt-tightening. 
 A senior official in the Obama administration said on Friday that the leaders of the Group of 8 countries had expressed a ''broad consensus'' on the need to balance deficit and debt reduction with continued support for economies still suffering from high unemployment. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, who has been the strongest proponent of austerity measures, echoed that description of the talks.
 The administration cited Congress's deal on financial restructuring as evidence of its commitment to solving thorny economic problems. The White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, told reporters that ''now we lead the world in financial reform.'' Canada's prime minister, Stephen Harper, said, ''The progress that the United States has made will be important in driving the world not just to agreements here, but to conclusions on financial regulation within the timeframe we've been looking at.'' 
 Even so, the effort to present a unified stance will be tested here in subsequent meetings among the larger Group of 20 countries on Saturday and Sunday. This is the fourth G-20 summit gathering since the financial crisis reached its height in 2008. 
 One of the issues dividing the G-20 members is a proposal for a tax on banks, intended in part to help pay for the financial crisis. Japan's new government indicated on Friday that it might not be opposed to such a tax. The United States, Britain, France and Germany support such a tax, while Canada, Australia and most of the big emerging economies oppose the proposal.
 Also unclear is whether the G-20 countries will meet a self-imposed deadline -- their next gathering in November, in Seoul, South Korea -- for a deal on higher capital and liquidity requirements for the world's giant banks. For weeks now, there has been speculation that the G-20 countries would delay a timetable for enacting those requirements by 2012. 
 But perhaps the biggest area of potential disagreement remained how, and when, indebted countries, including the United States, should pull back the extraordinary spending programs they undertook to help their economies.
 In an essay published Friday in The Globe and Mail, Britain's new prime minister, David Cameron, suggested that budget cutting was a prerequisite for jump-starting economic growth. ''Of course, there must be the flexibility for countries to act, taking account of their own national circumstances,'' he wrote. ''But I believe we must each start by setting out plans for getting our national finances under control.'' 
 That view seemed to be in tension with the stance of President Obama, who cautioned in a letter last week that countries should not move too quickly to cut their stimulus efforts. He warned of past episodes ''when stimulus was too quickly withdrawn and resulted in renewed economic hardships and recession.'' 
 Days later, Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, and Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, argued in their own letter that heavily indebted countries needed to move swiftly to consolidate their balance sheets. Daniel Schwanen, an economist with the Center for International Governance Innovation, a research organization based in Waterloo, Ontario, warned that ''mud-slinging risks getting worse as countries seek to implement 'exit strategies' from the recent extraordinary fiscal and monetary stimulus.''
 But Angel Gurria, secretary-general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, called the choice between stimulus spending and deficit reduction ''a false dilemma,'' saying that both were necessary.
 Mr. Obama called on the other G-20 leaders to maintain the unity they showed in summit meetings in London and Pittsburgh last year. 
 ''We need to act in concert for a simple reason: This crisis proved, and events continue to affirm, that our national economies are inextricably linked,'' Mr. Obama said on the White House lawn before leaving for Toronto. Upon landing, he quickly boarded helicopter for the Muskoka region of Ontario, where the G-8 leaders met at a resort in Huntsville, a bucolic village. 
 Although the G-8 has been effectively replaced by the G-20, the smaller group's members remain the biggest sources of aid for poor countries. The issue of lagging aid to these countries was one of the primary topics of discussion Friday.
 The Obama administration has pressed the other G-8 countries to follow up on the group's past promises. Most notably, the G-8 has not fulfilled a pledge it made in 2005 to increase development aid by about $50 billion by 2010.
 Mr. Harper, the Canadian prime minister, on Friday pledged 1.1 billion Canadian dollars in new spending to improve global maternal and child health. The Obama administration made a two-year, $1.3 billion pledge for this initiative, but it is subject to Congressional approval.
 Partly as an effort to maintain its relevance, the G-8 has tried to shed its reputation as a club of rich countries. In Huntsville, about 140 miles north of Toronto, the G-8 leaders met with leaders of seven African countries and with the leaders of Colombia, Haiti and Jamaica.
 Naoto Kan, the new prime minister of Japan, encountered Mr. Obama for the first time since assuming the position, as did Mr. Cameron, Britain's new leader. 
 Mr. Obama was scheduled to have at least six one-on-one meetings with world leaders during his stay in Canada. 
 But except for Mr. Cameron, all of the confirmed bilateral meetings were with Asian leaders, in a reflection of Asia's role in leading the global economic recovery.

 BODY:
This was the week that Democrats cried and Republicans cackled.
 An NBC News/Wall Street Journal Survey released this week was chock-full of bad news for the left. More people disapproved of President Obama's job performance than approved of it. And the percentage of Americans who thought that the country was headed in the wrong direction topped 60 percent for the first time since the Bush years. 
 According to a Gallup poll released on Friday, the percentage of Americans who identified themselves as conservatives rose to 42 percent. As the report noted, ''Should that figure hold for all of 2010, it would represent the highest annual percentage identifying as conservative in Gallup's history of measuring ideology with this wording, dating to 1992.'' For the record, the percentage identifying as liberals fell to 20 percent.
 There are many factors contributing to these polls. 
 From the very beginning, the far right assailed this president with calumnious attacks. He was both a craven defender of the country and its borders and a crazed tax-and-spend liberal hell-bent on growing the government and destroying our democracy, one death panel at a time. It seems to have stuck.
 At the same time, Republican lawmakers latched on to the word ''no'' like temperamental 2-year-olds. Their strategy: dictate by stalemate. It worked.
 Add to that a laundry list of other factors: Obama has been an abysmal salesman; Americans' patience has the lifespan of a fruit fly; we are still mired in two intractable wars; the economy has yet to turn the corner; anxiety is mounting over ballooning deficits; and oil is still gushing into the gulf. 
 Taken together, you get a growing sense that things are falling apart on the Democrats' watch.
 That's the short-term view. Now consider the long view: This is in large part a frightened, angry reflex, fed by a devastating recession. But like the recession, it's also temporary. When conditions improve, Republicans will still have to face an underlying reality: that this is the twilight of their rigid, empty ideology, particularly as it relates to social issues. They must change or wither. 
 A new paper entitled ''Demographic Change and the Future of the Parties,'' by Ruy Teixeira of the Center for American Progress Action Fund, a progressive think tank, lays bare the long-term problems facing the Republican Party. In short, the country is becoming more diverse, more educated and less religious -- all bad news for Republicans. And at a time when they should be moving closer to the middle, the Tea Party is dragging them farther right and over a cliff.
 Regardless of the current disenchantment and the venting we're likely to see in November, the larger trends look ominous for the right, not the left. The right knows it, too. In fact, if you listen closely, between the ''hell no's'' and ''you lie's,'' you can hear the pall of despair falling over them.

HEADLINE: Wave of New Rules to Protect Consumers

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER and TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
The financial overhaul bill that has taken final shape would give the government a larger role in guarding the wallets of consumers -- many of whom, it became clear in the financial crisis, did not always understand what they were signing up for. 
 Until now, the power to watch over consumers' interests has been scattered across an array of agencies, which is why a centerpiece of the bill is the creation of a central Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The bureau's sole responsibility would be to look out for consumers. 
 The bureau was conceived and championed by Elizabeth Warren, the vocal consumer advocate and head of Congressional oversight for the Troubled Asset Relief Program. She said in a statement on Friday that the new bureau would represent a victory for consumers. 
 ''They created a strong, independent consumer agency that will have the tools to rein in industry tricks and traps and to cut out the fine print,'' Ms. Warren said. ''For the first time, there will be a financial regulator in Washington watching out for families instead of banks.'' 
 Time will tell how sharp the agency's teeth will be. Meanwhile, investors and those who advocate on their behalf did not get everything they wanted in the bill. Auto dealers would not be subject to the new bureau's oversight, for instance. And stockbrokers and annuity peddlers are still not required to act in their customers' best interest, at least not initially. But mortgage shoppers stand to gain under the new rules, and millions of people will now have access to a free credit score.
 Here is a roundup of some of the biggest consumer issues that members of Congress addressed and where they ended up:
 CONSUMER BUREAU The bureau would be housed within the Federal Reserve, and headed by a director appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. 
 The new bureau would write and enforce rules for most banks, mortgage lenders, credit card and private student loan companies, and payday lenders. Smaller banks and credit unions, or those with less than $10 billion in assets, would have to obey the consumer bureau's rules. But the smaller institutions' enforcement and supervision would remain with their current regulators, said Travis Plunkett, legislative director for the Consumer Federation of America. 
 Auto dealers, while exempt from the bureau's reach, would face stronger oversight from the Federal Trade Commission, said Ed Mierzwinski, consumer program director at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. 
 The legislation includes a provision that consumer advocates had opposed -- to require the new bureau to convene a panel of small-business representatives, chosen by the bureau, to make sure any new rule wouldn't have unintended consequences, like tightening small businesses' access to credit. Consumer groups said they worry that the bureau would be required to seek input from industries -- like payday lending -- that it's supposed to oversee.
 CREDIT SCORES Each year, you can get one free copy of your credit report at AnnualCreditReport.com from each of the three big credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. The credit report contains information that banks and others send in about how much you owe and whether you pay on time. 
 But consumers generally do not get free copies of their credit scores, which are numerical snapshots derived from your credit report. 
 Let's say a mortgage lender, credit card issuer, insurance company or landlord quotes you a more expensive interest rate or premium price or refuses to rent you an apartment because of your credit score. If that happens, the bill requires the company or individual to provide you, free of charge, the score (probably a FICO score) that caused a snag. 
 Keep in mind that nothing is stopping you from asking for the score, even if you like the rate or result of your application. 
 MORTGAGES The bill offers a number of new protections, many of which are a bit like closing the barn door after all of the animals escaped. Lenders, for instance, will have to check borrowers' income and assets. Most lenders have learned that lesson by now or have ceased to exist.
 Other rules include a ban on prepayment penalties for people with adjustable-rate and other more complex types of mortgages. Mortgage brokers and bank employees will no longer be able to earn bonuses based on the type of loan they put you in. That will presumably eliminate any incentive to push high-interest loans on borrowers (who might otherwise qualify for a better deal) to inflate bank profits. 
 Julia R. Gordon, senior policy counsel for the Center for Responsible Lending, said there would now be a cap limiting mortgage origination fees to 3 percent of the loan. There are exceptions for required upfront mortgage insurance premiums, say for a Federal Housing Administration loan, and for points that borrowers elect to pay to lower the mortgage interest rate.
 The bill would also provide bridge loans for unemployed homeowners to help them pay their mortgages, according to the National Consumer Law Center. 
 CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS Hate those merchants that won't let you use your credit card unless you spend more than a certain amount? Well, now they have Congress's blessing, as long as the minimum is not higher than $10. The Federal Reserve can increase the minimum if it chooses. As for maximums, only the federal government and colleges and universities can limit what people spend. So if you are paying tuition on a credit card and earning a couple of free plane tickets each year, that fun may soon end. 
 Merchants can also offer discounts to people who pay cash instead of using cards, or use debit instead of credit cards. They will not, however, be able to charge one price for people using American Express cards and a lower price for people using Visa and MasterCard credit cards. 
 Merchants would also not be allowed to give discounts based on which bank issued your debit or credit card. 
 FIDUCIARY DUTY The Securities and Exchange Commission, which is headed by Mary L. Schapiro, was given the authority to create a rule for brokers that would require them to put their clients' interests first. But that won't happen right away. 
 Consumer advocates wanted the so-called fiduciary standard in the new law, and it appeared in the House's original proposal. But ultimately, negotiators compromised and agreed to have the commission first conduct a six-month study of the brokerage industry, looking at, among other things, whether there are any regulatory gaps or overlaps in regulation of brokers and investment advisers. 
 Advisers are already required to put their clients' interests ahead of their own, while brokers must only recommend investments that are deemed ''suitable,'' based on factors like their clients' financial goals and tolerance for risk. ''It is now going to be incumbent on Chairman Shapiro to stay on top of this,'' said Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America, ''to ensure that this is an unbiased study and that any rules that are proposed are strong.''
 But there are no guarantees.
 EQUITY-INDEXED ANNUITIES These annuities are complex financial products that promise a minimum return on your investment. But they often require you to tie up your money for long periods and charge hefty surrender fees if you need to pull out money early. Some people selling these collect lucrative commissions and have used deceptive marketing techniques to sell these products to elderly individuals, which is why sales of these annuities have been the subject of many lawsuits.
 But a provision in the legislation would prevent the S.E.C. from regulating them, a step backward, consumer advocates and the commission have argued, from what is now the case. The S.E.C. had adopted a rule to regulate these annuities as securities, but the rule had not yet been enacted. Now, the annuities would be treated as insurance products, which means they would be overseen by state insurance regulators.
 ''That means no securities antifraud authority, no rules against excessive compensation, and no securities regulators to help police the market for these abuses,'' Ms. Roper said. ''And there are no guarantees that the people who sell them know any more about the securities markets these products are based on than the people who buy them.''
 Consumer advocates also said the amendment language is broadly written, which could allow products similar to equity-indexed annuities -- or those that have characteristics of both investments and insurance -- to skirt S.E.C. regulation as well.
 What will be the unintended consequences of the financial regulation bill -- and will they be good or bad for consumers? Leave a comment at nytimes.com/bucks.

HEADLINE: Banks Likely to Offset Impact of New Law, Analysts Say

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Graham Bowley, Eric Dash, Andrew Martin, Cyrus Sanati, Louise Story and Edward Wyatt contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Banks are expected to find ways to offset the impact of the new financial regulations on their earnings, though they face a potentially complex process of adapting to the new requirements, analysts said on Friday.
 The share prices of some of the biggest United States banks, including Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, were higher in afternoon trading, hours after a House-Senate conference committee completed work on a bill that would toughen financial regulations.
 Analysts pored over the specifics of the deal as they emerged on Friday and expressed a wide array of views about the impact it would have. Some saw the bill as more of a political statement than a practical measure that could prevent another financial meltdown. Others said banks' costs would increase, but banks would pass the increased costs along to consumers.
 ''They have got their work cut out for them, absolutely,'' said William Fitzpatrick, an equities analyst who focuses on banks for Optique Capital Management 
 ''The terms of this regulation appear to be extremely onerous on the large banks,'' he said. ''It is indeed a tough bill, and you are going to see several measures that are going to weigh on the profitability of the large banks.''
 ''I suspect they are going to have a hard time offsetting the increased regulations,'' said Mr. Fitzpatrick. 
 Richard Bove, a banking analyst with Rochdale Securities, said the bill would not severely curtail banks' operations.
 ''I don't see there being a tremendous clampdown on the ability of banks to make money,'' he said.
 ''The banks will have numerous methods of getting around the most onerous provisions in this bill to maintain their earnings growth,'' he added. ''But the things they will do will increase the cost of banking to everybody in this country.''
 For instance, Mr. Bove pointed to last year's credit card bill, which led banks to push up rates pre-emptively or reduce customers' credit limits.
 ''You're going to get a letter from your bank saying you now have to pay $1 to $15 a month to pay for this bill,'' he said. ''The banks are going to get the money back because the consumer is going to pay for the bill, and that's the killer for the consumer.''
 John McDonald, a financial services analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein in New York, said there should be relief among investors, but the implementation would usher in a new phase of uncertainty.
 ''There is still a long way to go in terms of getting clarity on the key issues that investors are focused on, like required capital,'' Mr. McDonald said.
 Just take an issue like derivatives. It is still not clear what activities the banks will need to cordon off in a separate holding tank. Nor is it clear how much capital they will need, which is a major factor affecting the profitability of the business, he said.
 One part of the legislation known as the Lincoln Amendment, for example, would demand the banks hold more capital. At the same time, another part that drives derivatives trading onto clearinghouses and exchanges could lessen, in aggregate, the amount of capital that banks must hold. ''There are a lot of variables in the air,'' Mr. McDonald noted. 
 Mr. Fitzpatrick said he expected the restrictions on overdraft fees, less proprietary trading and the alteration of the banks' swaps desks to have an impact on earnings.
 ''All these things, in addition to higher capital requirements, will weigh on the bottom line of the large banks,'' he said.
 Cornelius Hurley, a professor at the Boston University School of Law and a former counsel to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, saw deficiencies.
 ''They missed the crisis,'' he said. ''The crisis they're dealing with now is the November elections. This is a bill, despite its length and complexity, that's more geared to the elections than the financial system.'' He said that the bill would inevitably be revised and that ''in no way does it address the too-big-to-fail issue.''
 ''The credit ratings agencies keep rating the too-big-to-fail banks higher than everybody else, and they say it's because of the implicit government support,'' he added.
 ''There will be a lot of regulatory costs,'' Mr. Hurley said. ''There will be a lot of motion, smoke -- but not fire -- as we go through the regulatory process. There's going to be ton of activity, but at its core we're going to be back where we were the day that Lehman failed.''
 Several of the larger banks said that they were still studying the bill.
 ''Although there are aspects of the legislation which are different from what we would have preferred, we will be able to conduct a fuller assessment of its impact after the regulators issue new rules,'' said Vikram Pandit, the chief executive officer for Citigroup.
 A spokesman for Goldman Sachs said: ''We are studying the bill and are mindful that it still has to go through the House and the Senate. We're also mindful of the fact that much interpretation responsibility lies with regulators, so we think it is too early to be able to express an informed view.''
 But it is apparent already that banks will have to adapt the way they currently do business with their subsidiaries.
 ''As they wind down and spin off these more market-oriented derivatives businesses, that is going to be a challenge for them in part because of the complexity of the business,'' said Jim Eckenrode, a banking analyst at TowerGroup, a financial services consulting firm.
 But some analysts noted that the overhaul served an important purpose in improving confidence and providing transparency as a response to the challenges posed to the American financial system.
 ''My first line of thinking is that obviously there was a lack of systemic oversight in some of the businesses that were generating a lot of profits for the industry,'' said Mr. Eckenrode.
 ''Trying to harmonize the regulatory environment I think makes a lot of sense. I do think that generally the banks should be pleased that it was not worse than it was,'' he said.
 For example, creating a resolution fund addressing the financial crisis, Mr. Eckenrode said, ''certainly has been reduced quite a bit.''
 The chief executive of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, Tim Ryan, said in a statement that the new law should bolster confidence.
 ''Much of this new law should help to restore and maintain confidence in U.S. financial markets, including several important provisions such as the establishment of a systemic risk regulator, resolution authority and a new federal fiduciary standard for retail investors,'' he said. 
 ''But this is a tough law that will also have profound effects on the operations and cost structure of most financial services companies and financial markets,'' Mr. Ryan added.
 Joshua Steiner, a managing director who covers the financial sector for Hedgeye Risk Management, said he was still examining the legislation but said the new regulations could potentially weigh on earnings.
 ''One of the issues is really going to be going forward trying to understand how this is actually going to affect earnings, because the banks have been very cagey on how much of their earnings generally come from proprietary trading and private equity and hedge fund investing,'' he said. 
 ''So I think net-net over time this will come to represent essentially a tax on the industry for all intents and purposes,'' Mr. Steiner said. ''It will be a long-term depressant on earnings.''
 He added: ''Constraints will force them to re-allocate their capital elsewhere.''
 The approvals on Friday cleared the way for both houses of Congress to vote on the full financial regulatory bill next week.
 One lawmaker was quick with criticism of the bill. Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire and a member of the Senate Banking Committee, said: ''In an effort that should be geared toward correcting deficiencies in our regulatory structure, and during a time when we should be focused on economic recovery, this legislation is a failure on both counts. It will not encourage much-needed stability and confidence in our financial markets. It will not significantly reduce systemic risk in our financial sector.''
 But Ed Mierzwinski, consumer program director for the Federation of State Public Interest Research Groups, saw some positives for consumers and described the bill as ''landmark legislation.'' 
 He noted that the idea for creating a new consumer financial protection agency was proposed just three years ago. Despite intense efforts by the banking industry to water down the agency or kill it outright, Mr. Mierzwinski said the agency survived with broad authority, a strong financing stream and an independent director.

HEADLINE: Bucking a Trend in New Haven

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
NEW HAVEN
 JIM LEVINSOHN and his wife, Kirsten, made their first offer on a house near the Yale University campus here without ever having visited it. This was last year, and they were living temporarily in Cape Town, South Africa. They sized up the spacious colonial via a virtual tour recorded by friends. Their resulting offer was generous enough that they figured a deal was in the offing.
 They were wrong. 
 ''We were kind of amazed to put an offer in a little bit above asking price and not get it,'' said Mr. Levinsohn, a professor of economics who recently left the University of Michigan to become director of the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs at Yale. ''In the market I was coming from -- Ann Arbor -- that was unheard of.''
 The house had been thoroughly updated, and its location a few blocks from downtown, in the leafy East Rock neighborhood, heightened its appeal. Within seven days of coming on the market, it drew three cash offers, none of which had any contingencies, according to Mary Jane Burt, the listing agent, of H. Pearce Real Estate Company. Listed for $890,000, it sold for $945,000.
 Last year was one of the worst of the decade for high-end home sales in surrounding communities. Nevertheless, the market in New Haven's most expensive neighborhoods -- the East Rock/St. Ronan sections north of downtown -- has remained remarkably stable. Buyers are putting up with the city's property tax rate of $42 per $1,000 of assessed value in order to live close to both work and play.
 ''When the shoreline market fell off, and the suburban market fell off, our New Haven office kept chugging along,'' said Barbara L. Pearce, the president of the Pearce agency, which also operates offices in several shoreline towns. ''There's heavy demand for properties that are expensive.''
 Betsy Grauer, the owner of Betsy Grauer Realty in New Haven, also said she had done well with higher-end New Haven. ''Prices have held beautifully,'' she said. ''There's still very limited inventory, and that helps keep things consistent.''
 From 2005 to 2007, the median sale price for East Rock-area homes priced above $500,000 was $730,000; from 2009 to June 16 of this year, the median was $749,000, according to data compiled by Wojtek Borowski, a Pearce agent.
 Houses priced from $300,000 to $500,000 in the East Rock area have fared less well. The median price in this category has fallen by about 9 percent since 2007, to $376,000.
 East Rock is known for its rich variety of late 19th- and early 20th-century houses, some quite modest in size and others built to impress. Styles run the gamut: brick Georgians, compact Federal-style colonials, grand Victorians, stucco Mediterraneans. Prices top out at about $2 million.
 These areas, within walking or biking distance of the campus and downtown, have long been populated by Yale faculty members and administrators, as well as other professionals. But an additional factor in their favor is the city's emerging reputation as a cultural center, a lure to empty-nesters and families from outside the Yale community, said David I. Newton, a real estate management consultant who has lived in several different parts of New Haven since 1973.
 ''The restaurants, culture, the arts have really become a force drawing people back into town,'' Mr. Newton said. ''There are signs of confidence all around the city.''
 Since Richard Levin took over as president of Yale in 1993, the university has worked closely with the city to shore up residential neighborhoods and redevelop the once-dying downtown. The university, the city's largest employer, has also expanded its facilities. The $467 million Smilow Cancer Center, an affiliate of Yale-New Haven Hospital, opened this year. The university is now pursuing approvals for a new School of Management facility on Whitney Avenue.
 Off campus, highly visible redevelopment projects, including the new Gateway Community College campus and a 500-unit green apartment tower, have enhanced the city's reputation for vibrancy while improving its image for safety.
 Natalie Adsuar, an obstetrician-gynecologist in private practice who has owned a two-bedroom condo in downtown New Haven for four years, describes the city as ''safe, vivacious and intellectually stimulating.'' She is now looking for a house in East Rock -- a plan that won out over the briefly considered idea of moving to the shoreline and commuting to work.
 ''New Haven keeps drawing me back,'' she said. ''It really does have a community feel.'' And the arts offerings are so numerous, she added, ''I don't think I've been home a single night in two weeks.''
 The Levinsohns felt similarly. They considered suburban options, but liked the idea of being able to walk or bike to work and restaurants. After their offer on the first house fell through, and once they had returned from Cape Town, they found a house they liked even better. They closed in January.
 Their agent, Mr. Borowski, extols the brick colonial's high-ceilinged interiors and its elegant porte-cochere. Mr. Levinsohn, less schooled in architecture than global economics, goes in for simpler language: ''It's 100 years old, and we're quite fond of it.''

HEADLINE: Cooking With Dexter: Steak Sale

BYLINE: By PETE WELLS

 BODY:
''Where can we get the wood?''
 This has been the sound of my mornings in the late spring and early summer of 2010: Dexter wakes up around 7 and starts asking where we're going to get the raw material for the artisanal-charcoal business he means to operate out of our backyard.
Like most children, Dexter has an entrepreneurial impulse that surfaced early, around the time my wife and I made it clear that simply asking us for a dollar bill wasn't working anymore. At first, there was lemonade: squeezed by hand (my hands) and ''offered'' to neighbors in our building. That evolved into an Italian-ice start-up, with fruit syrup poured over ice crushed by hand (same hands). As he grew, the ideas became more elaborate. The most recent was a working farm in our backyard, where we grow a few strawberries, lettuce, peppers, tomatoes and herbs. After I told him we probably didn't qualify for a Greenmarket stall, we came up with a subscription system, like community-supported agriculture. That idea was abandoned when Dexter and his younger brother ate all five strawberries. 
 For his latest venture, he is in charge of packaging (brown lunch bags), marketing (labels on the bags describing how he makes the charcoal) and managing the only employee (me).
 I am in charge of anything involving very high heat. I am also supposed to solve the problem of where a 5-year-old Brooklyn boy can source a steady supply of hardwood for little or no money. This is not easy to work out, and that is why Dexter keeps asking.
 ''Well, Dex, we could drive to Home Depot. They've got lots of scraps in their lumber department. The only problem is. . . .''
 ''What? What's the problem?''
 ''It's going to be pine, and pine doesn't make good charcoal.''
 ''So where can we get the right kind of wood?''
 We had been grilling pompano together in Florida this spring when Dexter asked how we could make charcoal. Unlike some of his ideas (''Daddy, how can we make diamonds?''), this one seemed to have a reasonable chance of success. We needed a device to make wood very hot while cutting off its oxygen so it would smolder without catching fire. The answer was wrapping wood in aluminum foil pierced with pinholes, to let smoke escape, and laying the bundle near a heat source. Tucked against the coals -- too close and the wood incinerates, too far and it never blackens -- the shiny packet produces smooth, hard lumps of carbon that look just like the stuff that scents bluefish and sears carne asada.
 Like many new businesses, Dexter's charcoal concern will face challenges if he tries to scale up. One of these, as will be evident to any first-year economics student, is that in order to make a small amount of charcoal, we have to burn even more charcoal. At the moment, charcoal-making is just something that happens while dinner is on the grill, but if the company ever grows, we'll need a cheaper fuel source. 
 ''Daddy, where can we get the wood?''
 ''Maybe we could get it from other people's backyards.''
 Brooklyn is full of trees. But the borough's backyards are not Eden, for trees often get themselves into trouble. They send droopy, groping branches into the neighbors' yards. They come crashing down in northeasters, ice storms, hurricanes and tornadoes. (Yes, tornadoes.) Even a minor gust of wind can send a bough torpedoing into a fence or deck, potentially exposing the tree's owner to all kinds of nasty litigation. Even if, by some chance, none of these things happen, the tree is still going to die. And when it does, clean-up can cost as much as a month's mortgage payment. 
 That's just where Dexter's Tree Huggers Limb and Stump Carting Company comes in. We'll undercut the competition remorselessly. Dexter's Tree Huggers can afford to lose money hauling away your dead 150-year-old Norway maple because we're going to turn it into charcoal: handmade charcoal from genuine hardwood grown in Brooklyn.
 Dexter's handwritten labels could even argue plausibly that his charcoal is sustainable. Right-thinking urbanites will pay top dollar for Tree Huggers Environmentally Friendly, Locally Harvested, Small-Batch Charcoal. We could get $20 a bag, and because we'll be paid to take away the raw material in the first place, the business is almost all profit. 
 It would be perfect, except for the pesky issue of labor. Dexter is tall for his age, but he may not be ready to handle a chainsaw until he turns 6. Even the work of hauling downed wood out to our waiting station wagon would probably tax his endurance after an hour or two. Hiring help would cut into our margins. So the literal heavy lifting is going to fall to Tree Huggers' sole employee. 
 This is the problem with small businesses and with careers in general: success inevitably takes us away from doing the very thing we liked about our jobs in the first place. If you love baking cupcakes and customers love eating those cupcakes, your days will eventually be spent tracking order fulfillment and managing invoices. Helping Dexter set up his artisanal-charcoal business would mean hours clambering up trees in spiked shoes and breathing sawdust. It's a long way from standing around the grill with my son, which is how I got into this mess in the first place. 
 To help him focus on the food, not the fuel, I asked him to grill rib-eye steak with me. Our starting point was bulgogi, strips of soy-soaked beef that react to five minutes over hot coals by turning into meat candy. I messed around with the ingredients, marinating the beef slices in dark beer instead of rice wine and leaving out the sesame oil, which Dexter can't eat. By the time I was done, our bulgogi were about a quarter Korean, like Dexter himself. But we served them in the traditional way, wrapped up with steamed rice inside lettuce from our backyard. He was an adept roller of those leafy packets and surprised me by swabbing the rice with chili sauce. We all went to bed with that satisfaction that comes from preparing dinner under the sky. 
 When he woke up the next day, he had one question for me. 
 ''So where can we get the wood?''

HEADLINE: Urban Lands Of Opportunity

BYLINE: By RICHARD FLORIDA. 
Richard Florida is director of the Martin Prosperity Institute at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management. He is author of the ''The Great Reset: How New Ways of Living and Working Drive Post-Crash Prosperity.''

 BODY:
WHEN I was growing up, there was a strict line between work and life. Every morning, my dad downed a bowl of cereal and a cup of coffee and drove his Chevy Impala from our home in North Arlington, N.J., to the eyeglass factory in the Ironbound section of Newark, where he worked.
 Until 4:30 p.m., when he headed home, he never set foot outside of Victory Optical's premises -- not to run an errand or grab lunch with friends, and certainly not to take a walk or to work out at the gym. 
 Over the past couple of decades, a new way of working and a new kind of workplace have evolved. It began in Silicon Valley, where companies ceded a certain degree of autonomy to knowledge workers, recognizing that too much rigidity could stifle creative output. Khakis and shirtsleeves replaced gray flannel suits. And 9 to 5 sometimes became 9 to 9 or 11 to 1 in the morning. But the time was broken up by espresso runs and bike rides, or ultimate Frisbee games during lunch.
 The trend has spread to the point that our lifestyles and our work styles are becoming increasingly blurred. Though my factory-worker father might not have believed it, those people you see hunched over their laptops in coffee shops and thumbing instant messages on their BlackBerrys as they walk through the park are actually working. 
 This new way of work has given rise to what the sociologist Ray Oldenburg calls ''third places'' -- the Starbucks where we go not just to drink coffee but also to send an e-mail; the hotel lobby where we take a meeting; or the local library where we write a report, edit a document or revise a business plan.
 Increasingly, places are supplanting plants -- corporate headquarters and factories -- as the principal social and economic organizing units of our time. There are several reasons for this. 
 People used to follow the jobs; they moved where the company sent them. But today, people often pick a place to live first and then look for work. Today, it may be where we live, rather than who's employing us at the moment, that attaches us to our work and careers. 
 There used to be a saying in Silicon Valley that you could change jobs without having to change your parking lot. Urban workers today simply switch subway stops or take a different bike path when they get a new job. Especially in tough times, it makes more sense to choose a big city, with its thick labor markets and greater economic opportunities, over a single company.
 Certain cities offer specialized career opportunities: Silicon Valley is the place to be if you're a techie, Los Angeles if you're an aspiring actor or director, Nashville for music. Other cities are more diverse and offer a wide range of vocations to try out. 
 One young man told me he moved to Washington after college because he wanted to explore as many of his interests as he could before committing himself to just one. In Washington, he could work for a research organization or a journal, a nonprofit or an N.G.O., or perhaps for the State Department. Or he could go to graduate school. 
 As it happened, this man's indie rock band took off. Washington's club scene, filled with young people with disposable income, provided the perfect launching pad for a career in music. 
 Despite the hits that Wall Street and the news media have taken, New York remains the center of a diverse and entrepreneurial economy. And regional hubs like Chicago have been sucking up a huge share of the talent and opportunities that were once dispersed throughout surrounding cities and towns.
 The metabolic rate of living organisms tends to slow as they increase in size. But cities can achieve a faster rate of ''urban metabolism'' as they grow, leading to more innovation, economic growth and improved living standards.
 Clearly, major cities have a great advantage as this new way of working takes hold. So what can smaller cities and towns do to retain their viability? 
 All successful revitalization efforts focus on upgrading existing local assets -- developing better ties among colleges, universities and communities, strengthening business districts, upgrading parks and open spaces, preserving and reusing old buildings and supporting local art and music.
 SUCH communities are rich in resources for working, learning and simply enjoying life. They are places where people can prosper in their careers while achieving higher levels of well-being. 
 Mass migration from farms to urban centers generated new prosperity after the Long Depression of 1873-79. The expanding suburbs underpinned the great economic boom of the 1950s and 60s. We are now at the cusp of another such far-reaching movement -- with the magnetic pull of urban centers strengthening our economy and leading to a more seamless blending of work and life.

HEADLINE: Bring On the Bedrooms

BYLINE: By VIVIAN S. TOY

 BODY:
EVEN in today's uncertain real estate market, family-size apartments are having something of a baby boom in New York City.
 Sales of three- and four-bedroom apartments swelled last year, even as sales of smaller places declined, and the trend has since persisted. The increased sales are another sign that New York City has become a more appealing place for families. In addition, prices for these apartments have decreased more significantly than those for smaller units, and so are now more affordable for more people.
 Large family apartments have always been a small segment of the housing market, but the number has grown as developers have started to build more of them. Within the last year, developers of several new projects have responded to the demand by combining units to produce as many as seven bedrooms, seven and a half bathrooms and close to 6,000 square feet.
 In response to buyer requests at Manhattan House, a condo conversion on East 66th Street, the developer recently created five new layouts for three to five bedrooms, said Anne Young, the building's senior sales manager. ''Last year people wanted studios and one-bedrooms,'' she said, ''but the buyer for big apartments has definitely come back to the marketplace.'' 
 Brokers and marketing agents say that these new buildings are attractive to families who want a suburban floor plan within the confines of a Manhattan apartment. New construction is often a better option than classic prewar co-ops, which can be difficult to reconfigure with a spacious family kitchen or a rambling master suite.
 The buyers of these apartments, which range in price from $2.5 million to $7 million, are not typically people with five or six children; they tend to have two to four. But they want a bedroom for each child as well as a guest room, a family room or a home office. Maintenance or common charges for these larger apartments range from about $3,000 a month, for a three-bedroom, to $6,500 a month for a seven-bedroom.
 Empty nesters moving to the city from the suburbs form another category of large-apartment buyers. Unwilling to give up the space they're used to, they want room for visiting children or grandchildren.
 They, too, are finding that since median prices for larger apartments have dropped by as much as 34 percent, they need not squeeze into a one- or two-bedroom. The median for three-bedroom apartments was $3.79 million at the market's height in 2008, and dropped to $2.515 million in April and May, according to market data provided by Prudential Douglas Elliman.
 ''The new Bergen County or Westchester County is now the West Village and the Upper West or Upper East Sides,'' said Darren Sukenik, a managing director at Prudential Douglas Elliman who sold about a dozen large apartments at Superior Ink, a luxury development in the West Village. ''Big families are back, and nobody wants to move to suburbia,'' he said. ''It's the antithesis of what our parents did.''
 His empty-nest clients, he said, are relocating ''because 60 is the new 40, and when their kids are grown, they don't want to be stuck in the suburbs with nothing to do.''
 Last summer Irene and Oleg Davie moved into a five-bedroom apartment at 255 East 74th Street with their son, now 11; their infant daughter; two Havanese dogs; a live-in nanny; and a live-in housekeeper. ''It's an amazing thing to have an apartment big enough for all of that,'' Ms. Davie said. They paid just under $7 million.
 Their apartment's most appealing feature is its 1,000-square-foot kitchen. ''Not even many houses have kitchens that big,'' Ms. Davie said. ''The kitchen is a very important room for the family. When I'm making dinner, we have homework going on, building blocks, the dogs -- everything is in that space.''
 The Davies' broker, Victoria Shtainer, a senior vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that while sales for larger apartments slowed in early 2009, open-house traffic and apartment sales picked up last summer and have held steady this year. Other brokers report the same thing.
 When sales started at the Davies' building in early 2008, it was marketed as a ''Manhattan residence building that will redefine family living.'' Seventy percent of its apartments were to have three or more bedrooms, but as sales began, the percentage grew to 75.
 ''We had a hunch from the beginning that this neighborhood would have a strong demand for family-size units,'' said Richard Lebow, the marketing and sales director for the developer, the World Wide Group.
 As with many new developments in late 2008 and early 2009 when the recession took hold, sales there froze and some buyers pulled out. But there was a thaw a year ago and now the building is nearly sold out, Mr. Lebow said. ''Our prices, at $1,800 to $2,000 per square foot, tell me there's still a shortage of large apartments,'' he said.
 More than 1,200 three- and four-bedroom units sold in 2009, nearly double the 670 that sold in 2008 and significantly more than the 830 that sold in 2007.
 The market for two-bedrooms has suffered as a result. They usually make up 40 percent of all apartments sold, but late last year their market share dropped as low as 25 percent.
 Meanwhile, the market share for three- and four-bedrooms rose from 10 percent to a high of 19 percent in the third quarter of 2009 and is now at 18 percent, according to Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel and the author of Elliman's market reports.
 Many growing families want more space so that each of the children can have a bedroom, said Louise Phillips Forbes, an executive vice president of Halstead Property. ''People feel their children need to have space to go to where they can close their door and do their work undisturbed.''
 Families are also looking ahead. Instead of finding an apartment that will suit them for four or five years, they want a place that will suffice for 10 years or more, she said.
 Two years ago Ms. Forbes and her husband, Christopher, created a four-bedroom duplex in a prewar building on the Upper West Side. She said that this was where they intended to raise their two sons, now 6 and 4.
 ''I want my children to have the cultural diversity that the city offers and the ability to go downstairs for a play date in their pajamas when they want,'' she said. ''And I'm grateful to have that quality of life while still having the house feeling that I grew up with.''
 The Related Companies, which built Superior Ink, initially underestimated the demand for large apartments in the West Village, and also on the Upper East Side at the Brompton, its 22-story building on 85th Street, and the Upper West Side at the Harrison, on 76th Street. In all three buildings, Related ended up combining apartments to create more family-size units.
 At the Brompton, the number of apartments fell to 163 from 193; one unit grew to six bedrooms and 5,800 square feet. Many of the buyers were young families capable of paying $2 million to $5 million, said Susan M. de Franca, the president of Related Sales. ''When you go into the building now, you feel a real sense of community, with young families that are socializing together and nannies who hang out together, as if they're living in a suburban cul-de-sac.''
 Tim and Marla Brown considered prewar co-ops and new condos on the Upper East Side before buying the three-bedroom three-bath unit that they moved into last week at the Brompton.
 ''The prewar co-ops were significantly cheaper per square foot than new construction,'' said Mr. Brown, a financial trader. But the Browns, who have children aged 2, 5, and 7, had just moved from Los Angeles, where they lived in a new house. ''So moving into something that was pristine and new was important to us.''
 Related created their apartment by combining a two-bedroom with a studio, giving them not only three bedrooms, but also a home office and an enormous walk-in closet that Mr. Brown calls ''our New York City garage.''
 While combinations at the Brompton were designed to accommodate families, the demographic at Superior Ink is more diverse and has included celebrities like the actress Hilary Swank and the designer Marc Jacobs, and high-powered businessmen like Matthew Blank, the chairman of Showtime Networks. The number of units there has shrunk to 53 from a planned 74.
 One Superior Ink buyer, Ms. de Franca said, was ''a young single gentleman'' who combined three apartments to create a 4,900-square-foot pied-a-terre. She said the place had ''an incredible 2,800 square feet of outdoor space, and he plans to do a lot of entertaining there.''
 Gary Barnett, the president of Extell Development, said large apartments in his buildings were also selling to individuals. ''It's not just families,'' he said, ''but also wealthy buyers who have good net worth.''
 Mr. Barnett has combined apartments at two new buildings, the Rushmore, at Riverside Boulevard and 64th Street, and the Lucida, at Lexington and 85th. With two-bedrooms selling for $2.5 million and three-bedrooms for $4 million, Mr. Barnett said, ''these are not inexpensive apartments, and people at that range want to live graciously.''
 To that end, extra bedrooms have been turned into offices or media rooms, or combined to create luxurious master suites.
 Mr. Miller, the appraiser, said that the number of families opting to stay in the city had been growing since 2000, despite the economic woes brought about by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.
 ''What wasn't anticipated,'' he said, ''was that post-Lehman we would be having a conversation now about increased demand for luxury properties, given all the problems with jumbo mortgages and economy-induced austerity.''
 Julie Friedman, an executive vice president of Bellmarc Realty, says that many people can now buy what was unattainable three years ago. One of her clients held back on buying a large pied-a-terre for several years because he thought prices were high. Then, last summer, he bought a three-bedroom in an Art Deco building for $3.2 million, significantly less than the 2008 asking price of $4.995 million. ''It was as if someone had handed him a 'Buy Now' card from the heavens,'' she said.
 The large-apartment market is made up of ''very prudent buyers,'' said Tristan Harper, a senior vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman. ''Most of them are confident they can get financing, or they'll pay cash to get an apartment and then finance later on down the road.''
 His clients Debra and Jason Heller live with their two children in a four-bedroom in a postwar building on the Upper West Side. Armed with a budget of almost $4 million, they are looking for more space and more charm. Apartments in most new developments are out of their price range, but many prewar apartments don't quite suit their needs, either.
 ''I've seen these grand and gorgeous foyers and beautiful formal dining rooms,'' Ms. Heller said, ''but from a practical I-have-a-young-family-in-New-York-City perspective, what's going to happen in these spaces?''
 What they would like is a place with a large kitchen and a great room. ''When you have young kids, it's great to have space for everyone,'' she said. ''But you want to be near them, too, when you're cooking dinner.''
 They're hopeful of finding this suburban sensibility in New York.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Sunday about the market for large apartments in New York City misstated the street number for the building on East 74th Street where Irene and Oleg Davie recently bought a five-bedroom apartment. It is at 255 East 74th -- not 225.

HEADLINE: When Capitalism Meets Cannabis

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL

 BODY:
BOULDER, Colo.
 ANYONE who thinks it would be easy to get rich selling marijuana in a state where it's legal should spend an hour with Ravi Respeto, manager of the Farmacy, an upscale dispensary here that offers Strawberry Haze, Hawaiian Skunk and other strains of Cannabis sativa at up to $16 a gram.
 She will harsh your mellow.
 ''No M.B.A. program could have prepared me for this experience,'' she says, wearing a cream-colored smock made of hemp. ''People have this misconception that you just jump into it and start making money hand over fist, and that is not the case.'' 
 Since this place opened in January, it's been one nerve-fraying problem after another. Pot growers, used to cash-only transactions, are shocked to be paid with checks and asked for receipts. And there are a lot of unhappy surprises, like one not long ago when the Farmacy learned that its line of pot-infused beverages could not be sold nearby in Denver. Officials there had decided that any marijuana-tinged consumables had to be produced in a kitchen in the city.
 ''You'd never see a law that says, 'If you want to sell Nike shoes in San Francisco, the shoes have to be made in San Francisco,' '' says Ms. Respeto, sitting in a tiny office on the second floor of the Farmacy. ''But in this industry you get stuff like that all the time.''
 One of the odder experiments in the recent history of American capitalism is unfolding here in the Rockies: the country's first attempt at fully regulating, licensing and taxing a for-profit marijuana trade. In California, medical marijuana dispensary owners work in nonprofit collectives, but the cannabis pioneers of Colorado are free to pocket as much as they can -- as long as they stay within the rules.
 The catch is that there are a ton of rules, and more are coming in the next few months. The authorities here were initially caught off guard when dispensary mania began last year, after President Obama announced that federal law enforcement officials wouldn't trouble users and suppliers as long as they complied with state law. In Colorado, where a constitutional amendment legalizing medical marijuana was passed in 2000, hundreds of dispensaries popped up and a startling number of residents turned out to be in ''severe pain,'' the most popular of eight conditions that can be treated legally with the once-demonized weed.
 More than 80,000 people here now have medical marijuana certificates, which are essentially prescriptions, and for months new enrollees have signed up at a rate of roughly 1,000 a day.
 As supply met demand, politicians decided that a body of regulations was overdue. The state's Department of Revenue has spent months conceiving rules for this new industry, ending the reefer-madness phase here in favor of buzz-killing specifics about cultivation, distribution, storage and every other part of the business.
 Whether and how this works will be carefully watched far beyond Colorado. The rules here could be a blueprint for the 13 states, as well as the District of Columbia, that have medical marijuana laws. That is particularly the case in Rhode Island, New Jersey, the District of Columbia and Maine, which are poised to roll out programs of their own.
 Americans spend roughly $25 billion a year on marijuana, according to the Harvard economist Jeffrey Miron, which gives some idea of the popularity of this drug. Eventually, we might be talking about a sizable sum of tax revenue from its sales as medicine, not to mention private investment and employment. A spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws says hedge fund investors and an assortment of financial service firms are starting to call around to sniff out opportunities.
 ''We're past the days when people call here to ask if marijuana will give men breasts,'' says Allen St. Pierre, the executive director of NORML. ''Now, the calls are from angel investors, or REITs -- people who are looking for ways to invest or offer their services.''
 What happens when pot goes legit? How does the government establish rules that allow the industry to flourish, but not run rampant? And given that this is all about medicine, what about doctors, some of whom have turned medical marijuana consultations into a highly lucrative specialty?
 These and dozens of other questions are now being answered in cities like Boulder, an affluent, whole-grain kind of college town where the number of dispensaries -- anywhere from 50 to 100, depending on whom you ask -- is larger than the number of Starbucks and liquor stores combined. During a recent visit, it was clear that for every marijuana seller and physician who thinks that the rules are too strict, murky or fluid, there are others who can hardly wipe the smile off their faces.
 ''When I visited in September, I looked around and saw that there were only four dispensaries in Boulder, and they were all right on campus,'' says Bradley Melshenker, co-owner of the Greenest Green and formerly a medical marijuana seller in Los Angeles. ''We went into one and saw like 30 kids in the waiting room, and I thought: 'This is crazy. We've got to come.' ''
 YOUR first foray into a medical marijuana center is slightly disorienting, like breathing underwater during your maiden scuba dive, or watching the Red Sox win the 2004 World Series. Everything in your past tells you that the experience is impossible, but at the same time, you know it is happening.
 Forget the furtive transactions that have defined American pot dealing since the dawn of the dime bag. The best of Boulder's dispensaries display their product in the sort of glass cases found in jewelry stores or high-end bakeries.
 The people behind those cases, known as ''budtenders,'' like to think of themselves as sommeliers, although the names of the strains for sale will never be confused with chardonnay: Bubble Gum, Sour Kush, God's Gift, Grand Daddy Purp and Blue Skunk.
 ''This will throw you for a loop,'' says Michael Bellingham, owner of the Boulder Medical Marijuana Dispensary, who is holding a jar of Jack the Ripper, one of more than a dozen strains he sells. ''It's very serious, very strong; it goes right to your brain.''
 With a couple of exceptions -- Mr. Bellingham among them -- interviewing pot sellers is unlike interviewing anyone else in business. Simple yes-or-no questions yield 10-minute soliloquies. Words are coined on the spot, like ''refudiate,'' and regular words are used in ways that make sense only in context. One guy kept saying ''rue'' as though it meant ''reluctant,'' as in ''I think the state was rue to act.''
 Many have a long history with marijuana, and they remain -- let's just run with it -- rue to share their names. One dispensary employee swears that his hippie parents christened him Onefree, but he prefers to be called Dave and everyone calls him Van.
 A few dispensary owners declined to be interviewed; many are still wrapping their heads around the idea that what they do is legal. And none of the owners offered a look at their ''grow,'' as indoor, hydroponic crops are known. On that subject, everyone became bashful. There are strict rules about the size of grows and, of course, at the federal level, marijuana remains a ''Schedule I Controlled Substance,'' alongside heroin and L.S.D.
 Most owners, though, were happy to show off their wares at retail, and it's stuff that has little in common with the Cheech-and-Chong era of this drug. State-of-the-art pot is dense and loamy and comes in exotic shades of green and lavender -- like shag carpeting made in a jungle. Most customers buy a gram or two at a time, and a lot of dispensaries offer loyalty cards -- buy a lot, get some free. If smoking doesn't appeal, there are lots of pot edibles, like cookies, fudge, butter, candy bars, muffins, coffee and ice cream.
 ''We had a milkshake night here a few weeks ago,'' says Lauren Meisels of the Greenest Green. ''The place was packed.''
 The marijuana merchants in Colorado, like trailblazers in any business, had to make a lot of basic decisions when they started. Among them: What should a for-profit medical marijuana dispensary look like, anyway? State law says that the cannabis has to be in ''limited access areas,'' but as far as interior decorating mandates go, that's it.
 So there's variety. The Greenest Green looks like a bar in Amsterdam, with a chalkboard announcing the day's offerings in colors reminiscent of Starburst Fruit Chews, as well as a stereo playing reggae. Until a new law went into effect, patients could ''medicate'' on the premises, with options that included a $5 hit of hash oil from an elaborate bonglike device called a skillet.
 The Green Room has a Pottery Barn in Bohemia feel, with an espresso bar and a separate room for a massage therapist. Another, Dr. Reefer -- it's the name of the dispensary and the trade name of the owner -- is proudly ramshackle, in part because it hasn't been thoroughly renovated since a restaurant moved off the premises.
 ''This used to be a hot dog place called What's Up Dog and my place was in the basement,'' says Pierre Werner, Dr. Reefer himself. ''When What's Up Dog closed, I moved in the very next day, and I've been open every day since.''
 Mr. Werner, for the record, is not actually a doctor. Rather, as he puts it with a note of pride and defiance, he's a ''three-time convicted felon for possession of marijuana with intent to sell.'' That history, as well as his habit of standing near the side of the road and waving a huge Dr. Reefer sign at passing cars while shouting ''come get your meds,'' makes other dispensary owners, not to mention some local politicians, wince.
 After all, they're trying to create respectability -- maybe even some class -- and Dr. Reefer's not helping.
 If there is a historical precedent for what's now happening in Colorado, it could be the 1920s and the era of Prohibition. During America's dry age, the federal alcohol ban carved out an exemption for medicinal use, and doctors nationwide suddenly discovered they could bolster their incomes by writing liquor prescriptions.
 Pharmacies, which filled those prescriptions, and were one of the few places whiskey could be bought legally, raked it in. Through the 1920s, the number of Walgreens stores soared from 20 to nearly 400.
 Prohibition also enriched adventurous sorts at every level of booze production and consumption, from grape farmers and distillers to the owners of speakeasies. Many of them went on to earn legitimate fortunes once Prohibition was repealed.
 More than a few in the marijuana business say they believe they are early entrants in a market that could be huge, as laws and public attitudes shift in their favor. But a lot depends on what restrictions are placed on sales, as Colorado's example suggests.
 SELLERS here will tell you that to succeed in this business, you need to keep two essentials in mind.
 First is the importance of nabbing a lot of ''caregiver rights,'' which every person with a medical marijuana certificate can assign to a seller of choice. The caregiver rights of each patient, as customers are universally known, allow a dispensary to sell the marijuana of six plants, though the pot can be sold to anyone with a certificate. So the more caregiver rights a dispensary collects, the more pot it can sell.
 The second essential: grow your own. A pound of marijuana can be sold at retail for somewhere between $5,500 and $7,500. To buy that quantity wholesale will cost about $4,000. Grow it yourself and the same pound will cost just $750 to $1,000.
 ''It's like any retail environment,'' says Sean Fey, a co-owner of the Green Room. ''Given overhead expenses, you're not going to make a lot of money if your margins are 40 or 50 percent, which is what you'll earn if you don't grow your own marijuana. But you'll get 70 to 80 percent margins if you do.''
 Pot sales so far are expected to generate about $2.7 million in license fees, in addition to the more than $681,000 in sales tax collected from July 2009 to February 2010. These figures seem a decent-enough start, but are far less than the $15 million in annual taxes predicted by some of the state's more optimistic lawmakers.
 A batch of regulations known as Amendment 1284, signed by the governor on June 7, is expected to put many dispensaries out of business, eliminating the amateurs and semipros who jumped in because there was nothing to stop them, but greatly strengthening those who have the wherewithal to remain standing.
 At least that is the hope of Matt Cook, the senior director of enforcement at the state's Department of Revenue and the man behind Colorado's pot regulation system.
 ''I've been coming up with regulations for different industries for 30 years,'' he says. ''Alcohol, tobacco, car dealerships. I just took the best practices from those businesses, and I was allowed input of my own.''
 The new rules, many of which will take effect over coming months, treat dispensaries a bit like pharmacies and a bit like casinos. Felons will soon be prohibited from owning dispensaries. (Mr. Werner is selling the Dr. Reefer store.) Twenty-four-hour Webcams will be trained on every growing facility and dispensary in the state. There are restrictions on hours, new rules for licensing, labeling and on and on.
 Dispensary owners, generally speaking, aren't complaining. The more regulated the business becomes, the easier it will be to operate, says Ms. Respeto of the Farmacy. The company, which was co-founded by her father, has big ambitions: to become a medical marijuana dispensary franchise and do for Super Silver Haze what Rite Aid did for pills. The store in Boulder is actually the company's fifth; there are three in California and one in Denver.
 ''I used to manage Whole Foods stores on the East Coast,'' she says. ''And that was a lot easier. Because in the food industry, you know what the standards are.''
 Ms. Respeto exudes a kind of soccer-mom normality, which dovetails neatly with a core element of the Farmacy's marketing plan. The company would like to purge the business of its counterculture, glazed-and-confused image and turn it into something mainstream.
 ''What you hear about is a bunch of 18-year-olds who just want to get high,'' she says. ''You'll see little of that in our establishment. What you'll see instead is the 50-year-old woman who suffers from arthritis and this is her choice of pain medication.''
 The medical dimensions of this industry seem in perpetual tension with its stoner roots. All dispensary workers sound utterly sincere about the health benefits of marijuana, and each has a story about an elderly man whose chronic back pain vanished when he was introduced to the healing powers of Sour Diesel.
 These are true stories, and there's no doubting that pot helps a lot of people who are in genuine pain.
 But when was the last time your pharmacy had a milkshake night? Selling ''dosage controlled'' scoops of chocolate peanut butter ice cream?
 Judging from three days of visits to a dozen places, the sweet spot of the dispensary demographic seems to be 20- to 30-year-olds, all of whom, when asked, say they have an ailment -- insomnia, menstrual cramps or an assortment of painful-sounding bone problems.
 ''I fractured a vertebra in my back,'' says Keith Aten, who has just swung by the Green Room to buy a medicated cookie and a caramel. ''It hurts if I'm having a heavy walking day.''
 Mr. Aten is a tall 21-year-old wearing a T-shirt with a zombiefied version of the Scarecrow from the Wizard of Oz, lurching down the Yellow Brick Road yelling ''Brains!'' Like every patient, Mr. Aten is assiduously courted with freebies by dispensaries who covet his caregiver rights.
 ''My guy used to give me a free half-ounce every month, but he just dropped it to a free quarter-ounce,'' he said. ''So I'm looking around to see who has a better deal. I've visited about 30 places so far.''
 To acquire this V.I.P. status, Mr. Aten first needed to pass a medical exam certifying that marijuana is appropriate medicine for him. And that exam, surprisingly enough, might be the easiest money in this aromatic field.
 TO see why, visit the office of Dr. James Boland, about nine miles outside of Boulder, in a strip mall in Broomfield. The place is a marvel of work-flow efficiency. In a matter of minutes, patients are greeted by a secretary, have their papers notarized by a notary public and are escorted to a waiting room -- which on this day has a TV playing an instructional video on making your own hash.
 ''Today, I saw about 40 patients, but sometimes we'll have 100 patients come through here,'' Dr. Boland says, sitting in his small examination room.
 He is dressed in dark green scrubs, like a man on a work break from a MASH unit. Until last year, he earned a modest income handling worker's comp claims for a local furniture manufacturer.
 Then he decided to enter medical marijuana full time, and he opened this place, which technically isn't a doctor's office, but a ''managing/marketing firm'' called Relaxed Clarity. His employees are allowed to do what he can't -- show up in dispensaries to pitch his services.
 And when patients arrive, they find a highly streamlined operation. Each examination lasts three to five minutes.
 ''All you're doing is answering the narrow question: does this person have a condition that qualifies them?'' says Dr. Boland. ''And do they have anything else that would place them at risk for an adverse outcome if they use medical marijuana?''
 Yes to the first question, no to the second -- those are the answers about 90 percent of the time, he says. And he stands by every one of those decisions.
 BY the standards of a workaday medical practice, this is simple and headache-free work, according to Dr. Boland, unless you count the hidden-camera TV journalists who have dropped by hoping to find misconduct, or the lingering fears that if you're too liberal with your signature, the state's medical board might discipline you. A very small number of doctors approves a majority of certificates, and Dr. Boland is one of the most prolific of them all.
 In one year alone, working just three days a week at Relaxed Clarity, he's seen 7,000 patients, each paying an average of $150 for a visit. He takes out a calculator and does some quick arithmetic. That's more than $1 million, grossed in 12 months.
 ''There's no waiting for an insurance company to pay you a fraction of what you billed,'' Dr. Boland says. ''It's just boom, you know, cash on the spot. So you can make a significant amount of money doing this.''
 Like the Farmacy, Dr. Boland hopes to take his medical marijuana business national, opening Relaxed Clarity offices in other states. The difference is that he is profitable, while the Boulder outpost of the Farmacy, at least for now, is not.
 The lack of profits has been a source of stress for Ms. Respeto. Maybe as the industry matures, it will become more predictable and easier to navigate, less given to panicky phone calls about unforeseen U-turns. Until then, the good news is that she is surrounded, day in and day out, by one of the best-known relaxants on earth. The bad news is that she is one of the very few people in this business who does not smoke pot.
 ''I go home at night,'' she sighs, ''and have a glass of wine.''

HEADLINE: Dividends Are Rising. Will Stocks Follow?

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE headlines about stock dividends have been remarkably bleak. 
 Earlier this month, for example, BP announced that it would suspend its large dividend payments to deal with costs of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, becoming the latest cautionary tale of the risks of staking one's fortune on a single stock. And dozens of banks and brokerage firms cut or eliminated payouts during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009. 
 Look more closely at the category, though, and dividend-paying stocks are much more appealing. A widespread recovery is under way among companies that throw off cash to shareholders. 
 Since January, 136 companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index have either increased their payouts or initiated new dividends, collectively bolstering payments by $11 billion this year. The list includes companies in a broad array of industries, like Starbucks, which initiated its first dividend; Marriott International, which reinstated its cash dividend; and Travelers, which raised its dividend.
 At the same time, only two companies in the S.& P. 500 have decreased or suspended dividends since January.
 The recent trend is a big improvement from 2009, when there were 157 dividend increases and initiations versus 78 decreases or suspensions. Over all, those actions collectively cut payments to shareholders by $37 billion, a record.
 To be sure, this year's moves have put only a ''dent into last year's devastation,'' noted Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S.& P., in a recent report. He added that it might take years for the market to fully recover from the dividend damage.
 But over all, the resumption of dividend payments can be seen as a sign of improved financial strength and confidence. ''Usually, boards of directors won't declare dividends or certainly won't increase them if they feel that the companies need those resources for other purposes,'' said Robert Zagunis, chairman of the investment committee at Jensen Investment Management in Lake Oswego, Ore.
 As corporations have tried to cut debt and improve their finances, they have been amassing a mountain of cash. A recent S.&P. report showed that nonfinancial companies in the S.& P. 1500 index -- which includes large-, midsize and small-company stocks in the United States -- have more than $1 trillion sitting in cash and short-term investments on their balance sheets. 
 David R. Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors in Sarasota, Fla., said that despite this seemingly good news, investors might be reluctant to embrace this group of stocks. Many people, he said, were hurt by financial companies' dividend reductions during the recent credit crisis -- and by the poor performance of those shares in the recent bear market.
 Dividend-paying stocks lost more than the broad market in the bear market of October 2007 to March 2009, even though investors typically expect these stocks to hold up better in a downturn because of their yields.
 But the picture is more complex than this. ''If you take the financial stocks out of the equation, and look at the rest of the market -- the dividend record has been relatively good,'' Mr. Kotok said.
 Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer, added that after periods when dividend payments hit a trough -- as they did at the end of 2009 -- the broad market has historically rallied. Since 1970, the S.& P. 500 has returned an average 9.7 percent annually during periods of dividend recoveries.
 What's more, those rallies tend to last several years. Over the last 40 years, in the first year after dividend recoveries, stocks have returned 10.6 percent, on average, Mr. Belski said. The second years of such rallies have had smaller gains, of 3.4 percent on average, followed by gains of 10.8 percent in the third year and 20.1 percent in the fourth. 
 ARE there signs that dividend-paying shares are starting to rally?
 Yes. While dividend payers started the year running about neck and neck with the broad market, they've held up better in recent weeks as global markets have become volatile because of the European debt crisis.
 So far this year, the Dow Jones Select U.S. Dividend index is up 1.9 percent, while the S.& P. 500 is down 2.5 percent, including dividends. 
 And this is before the market enters the third and fourth quarters, periods when shares of companies with rising dividends tend to perform better than in the first half of the year, according to Oppenheimer research.
 ''The past is never a perfect predictor of the future, but this portends a potential upside for the market,'' Mr. Belski said. ''More than anything, it's a sign that the economy and the markets are in a sustainable recovery mode.''

HEADLINE: Tiny but Tough: The Newly Empowered Petites

BYLINE: By MARIA RICAPITO

 BODY:
PLUS-SIZE actresses like Mo'Nique and Gabourey Sidibe have recently been receiving a big helping of attention, but the petite section of our pop culture has also been seeing some serious action of late. 
 In books, movies and TV shows, tiny women are shattering stereotypes and appearing as aggressive characters spoiling for a fight. It's an easy visual joke, albeit a cartoonish one: the little girl may look like a pussycat, but just wait until she slugs the evil goon -- blammo!
 On ''Burn Notice'' on the USA Network, Gabrielle Anwar plays Fiona Glenanne, a former bomber for the Irish Republican Army who wears miniskirts around Miami while she picks locks, shoots guns and disables cars with plastic explosives. HBO gives us ''True Blood,'' where Anna Paquin plays a perky barmaid named Sookie Stackhouse who beats up all kinds of people -- kidnappers and serial killers, for instance, but also supernatural creatures. 
 Hollywood, too, has given us gun-toting heroines who look like they shop at Gap Kids in their time off. In the movie ''Kick-Ass,'' a 13-year-old actress named Chloe Grace Moretz (who was 11 when she made the film) plays a blond-pigtailed girl named Mindy Macready. Her scary alter ego is Hit-Girl, a foulmouthed tween who wears superhero gear while shooting up bad men's brains. Cue the propriety police!
 The violent femme, of course, is an enduring male fantasy, a Lolita who just can't help herself around a gun. She also does double duty as a symbol of Grrrl power, particularly when she appears in the form of cute-as-a-button crime fighters like the PowerPuff Girls (cartoon kindergartners whose motto was ''Saving the world before bedtime'').
 According to ''The Petite Handbook,'' a fashion guide by Kim Williams Dahlman, to be certifiably petite, a woman has to be 5 feet 4 inches or under, though in the current crop of heroines, many are petite -- and young -- in spirit only. ''Petite women are all too often viewed as weak, fragile, delicate, even childlike,'' Ms. Dahlman wrote in an e-mail interview. Because muscle and aggression are viewed as masculine traits, ''it is unexpected to find great strength and ferocity in a small, petite frame,'' she noted.
 These days (in pop culture, at least) it's becoming more common. The ultimate pixie with attitude may be Lisbeth Salander, the goth heroine of the Stieg Larsson book thrill-ogy. Often described as waiflike, she is constantly reducing thugs to a bloody mess.
 In the third book in the series, ''The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest,'' Lisbeth is described as ''all alone, five feet tall, thin as a stick'' before taking out a brute in ''a brief orgy of violence.'' In the Swedish version of the films, Lisbeth is played by Noomi Rapace, a Swedish actress; in the forthcoming American version of ''The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,'' the role is reportedly going to Carey Mulligan, who played a teenage ingenue in ''An Education.''
 It's anybody's guess why these anti-archetypes are striking a chord. Perhaps Americans feel powerless in an era of gushing oil, ongoing wars and a slippery economy, and want to believe that the little people can vanquish the big bad guys. If so, it might be a good sign for the small-stature Elena Kagan, who is, after all, said to wield a mean gavel.

HEADLINE: Both Sides in California's Gay Marriage Fight See a Long Court Battle Ahead

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Just hours after Judge Vaughn R. Walker banged the final gavel in the trial of Proposition 8 -- California's same-sex marriage ban -- the two top lawyers challenging the law, David Boies and Theodore Olson, were holding court again: this time at a small private dinner with donors in San Francisco. 
 The meal, with a handful of people who have given money to the group challenging the ban, could well be seen as the opening maneuver in the second act of the saga of Proposition 8, which both sides expect to wind its way up the federal judicial food chain, most likely all the way to the Supreme Court. 
 ''We would immediately appeal,'' Andrew Pugno, a lawyer for the proponents of Proposition 8, said when asked if his side were to lose in Judge Walker's court. 
 The plaintiffs agree. 
 ''This is in fact just the beginning,'' said Chad Griffin, a Los Angeles-based political consultant who is also the board president of the American Foundation for Equal Rights, which backed the Proposition 8 challenge. 
 Such legal wanderings, of course, are not cheap, and so it is that Mr. Griffin has already begun fund-raising for the next step. ''It's going to take resources,'' said Mr. Griffin, who added that he intended to tap ''major donors around the country, as well as grass roots and online.'' 
 And whether the case is argued in front of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit or the Supreme Court, one thing is also certain: What the next round of judges hears will be very similar to what Judge Walker did. 
 ''We actually believe that the arguments have been as refined as they possibly can be,'' said Mr. Pugno, part of a defense that offered only two witnesses. ''So you will hear largely the same arguments on appeal as you will in this court. It will just be a different forum.''
 Ditto for the plaintiffs. 
 ''I rest with, frankly, confidence, regardless of how this turns out,'' Mr. Griffin said. ''I don't think there's a single thing we would have done different.'' 
 What also seems certain is that the court case may take a while to settle. Judge Walker has no set timetable for issuing a decision. While that waiting game plays out, however, there is also the possibility of another ballot measure to overturn Proposition 8, which passed in 2008 with 52 percent of the vote. That could come as soon as 2012. 
 In the meantime, Mr. Griffin said his group had been signing up about 2,000 people a day to an e-mail list that will alert followers the moment Judge Walker's decision is filed. One of those signed up is Cynthia Laird, the editor of The Bay Area Reporter, a local gay newspaper, who said that the certainty of an appeal had subdued the sense of anticipation for some. 
 ''While we're hopeful for a positive ruling from the judge, one that strikes down Prop 8, it won't be the last word,'' Ms. Laird said in an e-mail message. 
 Mr. Griffin himself is not so cool. 
 ''I think I provide new meaning to CrackBerry,'' he said. ''It would be fair to say my BlackBerry does not often leave my hand or bedside.''
 Mr. Pugno, who is running as a Republican for a seat representing several Sacramento-area communities in the California Legislature, seemed considerably more sanguine. 
 ''Actually, there's a certain -- oh, what's the word? -- there's a certain calmness that comes with knowing you have the law on your side,'' Mr. Pugno said. ''You sit back and you realize that the great weight of law is on our side, and no matter what happens here, we have confidence that the people's right to vote will ultimately prevail.'' 
 Mr. Pugno said that his defense of Proposition 8 rarely came up on the campaign trail in California, where unemployment is more than 12 percent and the budget has a $19 billion gap.
 ''People are most concerned with tackling two things: state spending and the jobs environment,'' Mr. Pugno said. ''Voters are not focused on social issues.''
 But he did admit to being riveted as final arguments were heard June 16. 
 ''I think the point came into focus when Charles Cooper,'' the lead defense lawyer, ''said that to overturn this law, the court would have to essentially accuse seven million voters of ill intent,'' Mr. Pugno recalled. ''That really stands out.''
 Once again, the plaintiffs agree that the closing arguments were exciting, just not who was exciting. 
 ''I thought that the last 30 minutes of Ted's rebuttal was the best 30 minutes I've seen in five decades of practicing law,'' Mr. Boies said of Mr. Olson, his opponent in Bush v. Gore, the 2000 Supreme Court battle over the presidency.
 He also admitted to being moved by testimony by his clients, two gay couples seeking to invalidate Proposition 8. 
 ''I think when they were asked 'Why do you want to get married?' I think even the defense was affected by that,'' he said. ''I still get emotional remembering those answers.'' 
 Mr. Cooper, who declined to answer questions after his closing argument, did not respond to an e-mail request for his recollections of the trial, which began in January. 
 As for the plaintiffs' lawyers, Mr. Olson and Mr. Boies were apparently happy with their performance; after the private dinner, they ''went out and had some drinks and more food, which we really didn't need,'' Mr. Boies said. 
 Joining them, he said, were some lawyers from their team, who had worked for a year on the case. No lawyers from the defense were there, though Mr. Boies said that after such a hard-fought battle, Mr. Cooper and his team would have been welcome.
 ''Clearly,'' Mr. Boies said, ''we would have invited him.''

HEADLINE: Losing the Owl, Saving the Forest

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABAN. 
Jonathan Raban is the author of the forthcoming ''Driving Home: An American Scrapbook.''

 BODY:
Seattle
 MET in person, the northern spotted owl seems an unlikely casus belli. Last Friday, the Woodland Park Zoo here allowed me a private audience with its three captive owls, a mating pair and a lone elderly female, each of whom resembled a miniature, flecked-brown overcoat of Harris tweed. Their eyes -- unlike the eyes of most owls, which are bright yellow -- were the color of dark chocolate. Blinking slowly, rooted to their perches, they looked more wistful than wise, dreaming, perhaps, of flying squirrels, on which they like to dine in the wild, or of extinction, which still appears their likeliest fate. 
 The fast-disappearing owl was listed as ''threatened'' under the Endangered Species Act 20 years ago last week. At the time, it was the ideal ''indicator species'' of the health of Northwest old-growth forest habitat -- the squelchy, dank-smelling, multistory ecosystem, where the ground is strewn with rotting ancient trees, called ''snags'' and ''nurse logs,'' and the jungled undergrowth of ferns, vines, berries, moss and fungi shelters a great multitude of creatures, from bears and cougars to newts and banana slugs. It was this irreplaceable ecosystem, centuries in the making, that environmentalists were really trying to protect under the terms of the act (whose first declared purpose is to conserve the ecosystems upon which endangered and threatened species depend); and the owl was their best available legal tool. 
 Environmentalists saw the land as a sacred space, to be venerated and conserved in honor of what Emerson called ''the occult relation between man and the vegetable.'' But for the timber industry, long accustomed to clear-cutting in federal forests, it was a commodity, a renewable resource to be cut down, regrown and cut down again. There was no reconciling the two philosophies. On one side, the forest primeval, the murmuring pines and the hemlocks, the inviolate wilderness; on the other, people and their histories and traditions, jobs, communities, an economy based entirely on timber.
 When the owl was listed, the timber industry in the Pacific Northwest was already facing difficulties for economic reasons, but in the ailing milling and logging towns, the hapless owl was seized on as the scapegoat. In January 1991, an Olympic National Park ranger found a spotted owl nailed to a sign by the road to the visitor center, a red-tipped kitchen match protruding from its breast, and a typewritten note attached to the corpse. ''If you think your parks and wilderness don't have enough of these suckers, plant this one,'' it read. ''They talk of social unrest. The match has yet to be struck.'' 
 The author left no doubt as to whom he meant by ''you'': park visitors from the city, the well-heeled fleece and Birkenstock crowd, with new S.U.V.'s and an unforgivable air of entitlement to the countryside (''your parks and wilderness,'' as the author jeered). The listing of the spotted owl opened a new front in this old class war, in which each side painted an equally contemptuous caricature of the other, as if pitting Emerson (that effete, granola-eating, over-educated New Englander) against Paul Bunyan (that unthinking and rapacious Western tough). 
 In 1993, Bill Clinton presided over the ''timber summit'' in Portland, Ore., where both sides laid out their grievances -- loggers fearful of losing their jobs to the owl, environmentalists equally fearful of losing the owl's unique habitat to the chainsaw. A year later, the Northwest Forest Plan came into effect, protecting around 20 million acres of federal land from logging, and offering financial compensation and job retraining to the timber towns. As mill after mill closed, the stench of steam and pulp vanished from the Northwestern air; trucks carrying massive tree trunks, which used to cause mile-long tailbacks on the Olympic Peninsula, became rarities; and the ubiquitous slow-moving tugboats, dragging rafts of freshly felled firs, gradually faded from view on Puget Sound. 
 But none of this helped the spotted owls. The decline in their numbers grew steeper. Field biologists counted ever fewer calls (an unmelodious, four-note woo-woo-woo-woo, that one might mimic with short blasts on a World Cup vuvuzela), and found more and more deserted nests.
 The main cause of their dwindling population from 1994 to now has been not human activity but pale-faced barred owls -- the spotted owls' bigger and more adaptable close cousins, who have been migrating into Northwestern forests and driving their smaller relatives from their ancestral territory. Not for the first time, Northwestern natives found themselves muscled off their home turf by more aggressive, resourceful and versatile newcomers from back East.
 When barred owls meet spotted owls, sometimes they kill and eat them; more uncommonly, they mate. The lighter male spotted owl climbs aboard the female barred owl, and they exchange a vent-to-vent ''cloacal kiss'' lasting a few seconds. The rare offspring from such unions, called sparred owls, are diluting what is left of the spotted owl gene pool, even as the great horned owl feeds greedily on spotted owl chicks. 
 But although the spotted owl is more seriously endangered now than it was in 1990, its old-growth forest habitat is safer, healthier and larger than it was then. So after all, the endangered species listing of the owl has done the job for which it was primarily designed. This isn't, as it might seem at first glance, a Pyrrhic victory, but a real success story -- at least from one side's point of view. 
 The battle over the owl has been just one engagement in the war over nature in the Northwest, whose present main theater of operations is a Portland courtroom in which the interminable case of the Endangered Salmon v. Four Hydroelectric Dams on the Snake River is being acrimoniously fought along the same lines. The struggle has set class against class and countryside against city, and turned lifelong rural Democrats into staunch Republicans. 
 In the old timber towns, many people still echo the August 1994 speech by Slade Gorton, Republican of Washington, to the Senate on the human cost of the spotted owl listing: ''The U.S. government, driven by sophisticated, well-financed national environmental organizations and supported by the media and urban opinion leaders, has betrayed rural communities and destroyed -- yes, destroyed -- the lives and careers of tens of thousands of honest working families in the Pacific Northwest.'' Or, as the city attorney for Forks, Wash., (once a roaring town that declared itself the Logging Capital of the World) said when I called to remind him of last week's anniversary: ''That's not a day we celebrate. At any time.''
 Yet I've met others in Forks who say that the listing of the spotted owl is, unexpectedly, turning out to be a blessing, bringing more retirees to live there, more visiting hikers, hunters, surfers, birders and fly fishermen, and their money. The forest's recovery is not without economic benefit to the people who live on its edges. For all that the timber communities have lost, there are signs that the hated environmentalists (''Are you an environmentalist? Or do you work for a living?'' as the bumper stickers said) may have helped regenerate the very places they were once said to have ruined.

HEADLINE: Open Secrets

BYLINE: By ROB WALKER

 BODY:
Armed with our laptopsand smartphones, our apps and Twitter accounts, consumers enjoy previously unimaginable access to marketplace information and sometimes even power. The Web crackles with peer reviews; with the right mobile device we can scan a bar code of something at the mall and compare the price with far-flung retail rivals. And we can vent and maybe achieve some satisfaction. Remember the online video of the slumbering Comcast repairman? Remember when the consultant and writer Jeff Jarvis blogged his unhappy laptop experiences into what became the ''Dell Hell'' public-relations nightmare? Add it all up, and it's a significant shift, a ''transparency triumph,'' as Trendwatching.com put it not long ago. 
 On the other hand, every so often there's a stark reminder of how opaque the relationship between us and our many purchases remains. You might own a device made by Dell, Hewlett-Packard or Apple, for instance, but had you heard of Foxconn Technology before multiple suicides by workers became a big news story? Foxconn's factories in Shenzhen, China, with an estimated 400,000 employees, manufacture products for all three of those familiar tech names; the company has also reportedly made devices, equipment or components for Nintendo, Amazon, Cisco and others. It's surprising enough, perhaps, that objects from such distinct brands are all produced by a single company. And as I read the stories speculating about whether working conditions played some role in the bizarre rash of suicides, I considered my own ever-proliferating gadget cache, wondering if any of my electronics came from a Foxconn facility.
I still don't really know, because as far as I can tell, there's no app for that. It's not hard to find big-picture (and ideologically charged) assessments of global manufacturing, but when I asked the executive director of China Labor Watch if there was an easy way for a typical consumer to find out whether a specific device had, for instance, come from a Foxconn facility, he said no. I was reminded of the massive pet-food recall three years ago: while it involved dozens of brands, much of the food came from one low-profile Canadian manufacturer. (The problem was eventually linked to tainted wheat gluten, leading to the indictment of two Chinese companies and an American importer.) We're accustomed to finding what we want with a simple click, but a lot remains murky until bad news pushes it into the open. 
 The point here is not to demonize foreign manufacturing in general or Foxconn in particular, but to ask some questions: What if finding out where and how our stuff was made was as easy as finding the lowest price or peer opinions? What impact would it have on consumer choices? Wouldn't that be a more meaningful form of transparency in a global economy? 
 There are some efforts to offer consumers information beyond the familiar best deals. At ProjectLabel.org, you can type in the name of a company and receive numerical scores on matters like ''worker treatment'' and ''waste management,'' based on a combination of published reports and user votes. GoodGuide.com offers health, environment and ''society'' scores, based on its own database, for 65,000 products -- even accessible with a bar-code-scanning iPhone app. And some companies offer their own information. The Gap, for example, publishes a lengthy report with summary assessments in various categories of its roughly 1,500 production sites in more than 50 countries. On one level it's admirable that the company discloses, for instance, that as of 2008, 11.8 percent of its Southeast Asia factories received a ''needs improvement'' rating. But as a practical matter, how does that relate to your specific T-shirt or the khakis you're considering?
 In fairness, the supply chain for global companies that make electronics or apparel or furniture can be surrealistically complex. Yet when something exceptional like a recall or labor scandal happens, the connections to familiar brands are made pretty quickly. China Labor Watch, which was critical of Foxconn in the past, promptly encouraged consumers to write to the manufacturer's famous-name clients urging that they ''take immediate steps'' to push their supplier to make life better for its workers. Following the unwanted attention, Foxconn raised worker salaries, among other measures, so maybe a peek into the normally opaque systems that manufacture the wares of well-known brands does make a difference.
 If so, I suspect it's the specificity that matters; knowing something about a particular laptop or pair of sneakers or pet food resonates with consumers more than an aggregate score or a big-picture summary. Imagine an open-source effort emerging to make that brand/production relationship much less opaque than it is. I don't expect that most consumers would actually turn every impulse buy into a research project, but I bet it would change the way brands scrutinize their supply chains if they knew that every thing we buy was really, truly transparent.

HEADLINE: Tuna's End

BYLINE: By PAUL GREENBERG. 
Paul Greenberg is a frequent contributor to the magazine. This article is adapted from his book ''Four Fish: The Future of the Last Wild Food,'' which will be published next month by Penguin Press.

 BODY:
In the international waters south of Malta, the Greenpeace vessels Rainbow Warrior and Arctic Sunrise deployed eight inflatable Zodiacs and skiffs into the azure surface of the Mediterranean. Protesters aboard donned helmets and took up DayGlo flags and plywood shields. With the organization's observation helicopter hovering above, the pilots of the tiny boats hit their throttles, hurtling the fleet forward to stop what they viewed as an egregious environmental crime. It was a high-octane updating of a familiar tableau, one that anyone who has followed Greenpeace's Save the Whales adventures of the last 35 years would have recognized. But in the waters off Malta there was not a whale to be seen. 
 What was in the water that day was a congregation of Atlantic bluefin tuna, a fish that when prepared as sushi is one of the most valuable forms of seafood in the world. It's also a fish that regularly journeys between America and Europe and whose two populations, or ''stocks,'' have both been catastrophically overexploited. The BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, one of only two known Atlantic bluefin spawning grounds, has only intensified the crisis. By some estimates, there may be only 9,000 of the most ecologically vital megabreeders left in the fish's North American stock, enough for the entire population of New York to have a final bite (or two) of high-grade otoro sushi. The Mediterranean stock of bluefin, historically a larger population than the North American one, has declined drastically as well. Indeed, most Mediterranean bluefin fishing consists of netting or ''seining'' young wild fish for ''outgrowing'' on tuna ''ranches.'' Which was why the Greenpeace craft had just deployed off Malta: a French fishing boat was about to legally catch an entire school of tuna, many of them undoubtedly juveniles.
 Oliver Knowles, a 34-year-old Briton who was coordinating the intervention, had told me a few days earlier via telephone what the strategy was going to be. ''These fishing operations consist of a huge purse-seining vessel and a small skiff that's quite fast,'' Knowles said. A ''purse seine'' is a type of net used by industrial fishing fleets, called this because of the way it draws closed around a school of fish in the manner of an old-fashioned purse cinching up around a pile of coins. ''The skiff takes one end of the net around the tuna and sort of closes the circle on them,'' Knowles explained. ''That's the key intervention point. That's where we have the strong moral mandate.''
 But as the Zodiacs approached the French tuna-fishing boat Jean-Marie Christian VI, confusion engulfed the scene. As anticipated, the French seiner launched its skiffs and started to draw a net closed around the tuna school. Upon seeing the Greenpeace Zodiacs zooming in, the captain of the Jean-Marie Christian VI issued a call. ''Mayday!'' he shouted over the radio. ''Pirate attack!'' Other tuna boats responded to the alert and arrived to help. The Greenpeace activists identified themselves over the VHF, announcing they were staging a ''peaceful action.''
 Aboard one Zodiac, Frank Hewetson, a 20-year Greenpeace veteran who in his salad days as a protester scaled the first BP deepwater oil rigs off Scotland, tried to direct his pilot toward the net so that he could throw a daisy chain of sandbags over its floating edge and allow the bluefin to escape. But before Hewetson could deploy his gear, a French fishing skiff rammed his Zodiac. A moment later Hewetson was dragged by the leg toward the bow. ''At first I thought I'd been lassoed,'' Hewetson later told me from his hospital bed in London. ''But then I looked down. '' A fisherman trying to puncture the Zodiac had swung a three-pronged grappling hook attached to a rope into the boat and snagged Hewetson clean through his leg between the bone and the calf muscle. (Using the old language of whale protests, Greenpeace would later report to Agence France-Presse that Hewetson had been ''harpooned.'')
 ''Ma jambe! Ma jambe!'' Hewetson cried out in French, trying to signal to the fisherman to slack off on the rope. The fisherman, according to Hewetson, first loosened it and then reconsidered and pulled it tight again. Eventually Hewetson was able to get enough give in the rope to yank the hook free. Elsewhere, fishermen armed with gaffs and sticks sank another Zodiac and, according to Greenpeace's Knowles, fired a flare at the observation helicopter. At a certain point, the protesters made the decision to break off the engagement. ''We have currently pulled back from the seining fleet,'' Knowles e-mailed me shortly afterward, ''to regroup and develop next steps.'' Bertrand Wendling, the executive director of the tuna-fishing cooperative of which the Jean-Marie Christian VI was a part, called the Greenpeace protest ''without doubt an act of provocation'' in which ''valuable work tools'' were damaged.
 But the main damage that took place that day was indisputably to the bluefin. After the encounter, the fishermen aboard the Jean-Marie Christian VI transferred the fish alive into a holding cage and slowly towed them away. Soon those tuna would be brought to feeding pens where they will spend at least several months putting on weight. Afterward, they will be slaughtered and sent to Japan, where 80 percent of the world's Atlantic bluefin tuna are eaten with oblivion.
 THERE ARE TWOreasons that a mere fish should have inspired such a high-strung confrontation reminiscent of Greenpeace's early days as a defender of whales. The first stems from fish enthusiasts who have for many years recognized the particular qualities of bluefin tuna -- qualities that were they land-based creatures would establish them indisputably as ''wildlife'' and not just another ''seafood'' we eat without remorse. Not only is the bluefin's dense, distinctly beefy musculature supremely appropriate for traversing the ocean's breadth, but the animal also has attributes that make its evolutionary appearance seem almost deus ex machina, or rather machina ex deo -- a machine from God. How else could a fish develop a sextantlike ''pineal window'' in the top of its head that scientists say enables it to navigate over thousands of miles? How else could a fish develop a propulsion system whereby a whip-thin crescent tail vibrates at fantastic speeds, shooting the bluefin forward at speeds that can reach 40 miles an hour? And how else would a fish appear within a mostly coldblooded phylum that can use its metabolic heat to raise its body temperature far above that of the surrounding water, allowing it to traverse the frigid seas of the subarctic?
 Yes, bluefin tuna are warmblooded.
 That bluefin can be huge -- 10 feet and more than a thousand pounds -- is a side note. For those of us who have seen their football silhouettes arise and vanish in less than a blink of an eye or held them alive, their hard-shell skins barely containing the surging muscle tissue within, they are something bigger than the space they occupy. All fish change color when they die. But with tuna the death shift feels more profound. Fresh from the water, their backs pulsing neon blue, their bellies gleaming silver-pink iridescence, they seem like the ocean itself.
 And in a way they are, which explains the second reason bluefin have come to possess such totemic power. For bluefin tuna and all species of tuna are the living representation of the very limits of the ocean. Their global decline is a warning that we just might destroy our last wild food.
 In prehistoric times, the hunting of fish began close by, in freshwater rivers and lakes and coastal ocean waters. But as human populations grew, easily accessed grounds fell short of demand. By the late Middle Ages, European stocks of freshwater fish and near-shore ocean species proved insufficient. By then, Basque and Viking fisherman had already moved on to the continental shelves off Canada, ushering in the Age of Cod -- an age that escalated until the late 20th century, when some of the largest fishing vessels ever built devastated the once-two-billion-strong stock of cod on the Canadian Grand Banks. But there were still new places to fish. In the 1980s and '90s, virgin fishing grounds were found in the Southern Hemisphere, and supplies of replacement fish like New Zealand hoki and Chilean sea bass helped seafood supplies keep pace with demand.
 But appetites continued to outstrip supply. Global seafood consumption has increased consistently to the point where we now remove more wild fish and shellfish from the oceans every year than the weight of the human population of China. This latest surge has taken us past the Age of Cod and landed us squarely in the Age of Tuna. Fishing has expanded over the continental shelves into the international no-man's territory known as the high seas -- the ocean territory that begins outside of national ''exclusive economic zones,'' or E.E.Z.'s, usually 200 nautical miles out from a country's coast, and continues until it hits the E.E.Z. of another country. The high seas are owned by no one and governed by largely feeble multinational agreements. According to the Sea Around Us project of the University of British Columbia's Fisheries Center, catches from the high seas have risen by 700 percent in the last half-century, and much of that increase is tuna. Moreover, because tuna cross so many boundaries, even when tuna do leave the high seas and tarry in any one nation's territorial waters (as Atlantic bluefin usually do), they remain under the foggy international jurisdiction of poorly enforced tuna treaties.
 The essentially ownerless nature of tuna has led to the last great wild-fish gold rush the world may ever see. The most noticeable result of this has been the decline of the giant Atlantic bluefin tuna. But the Atlantic bluefin is just a symptom of a metastasizing tuna disease. The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization reports that 7 of the 23 commercially fished tuna stocksare overfished or depleted. An additional nine stocks are also threatened. The Pew Environment Group's tuna campaign asserts that ''the boats seeking these tuna are responsible for more hooks and nets in the water than any other fishery.''
 Tuna then are both a real thing and a metaphor. Literally they are one of the last big public supplies of wild fish left in the world. Metaphorically they are the terminus of an idea: that the ocean is an endless resource where new fish can always be found. In the years to come we can treat tuna as a mile marker to zoom past on our way toward annihilating the wild ocean or as a stop sign that compels us to turn back and radically reconsider.
 ''WE FIND OURSELVESin a precarious situation.'' So wrote Ritchie Notar, a co-owner of the internationally acclaimed Nobu restaurant chain, to Greenpeace U.K. back in 2008 after Greenpeace intensified its tuna-defense efforts and put forward the idea that bluefin should no longer be served at Nobu's establishments. ''We are dealing with thousands of years of cultural customs,'' Notar continued in correspondence Greenpeace forwarded to me. ''The Japanese have relied on tuna and the bounties of the sea as part of their culture and history for centuries. We are absolutely appreciative of your goals and efforts within your cause, but it goes far beyond just saying that we can just take what has now all of a sudden been declared an 'endangered' species off the menu. It has to do with custom, heritage and behavior.''
 Many nations have contributed to the Atlantic bluefin's destruction. Europeans and North Africans do most of the catching and ranching of the fish in the world today. The United States continues to allow bluefin fishing in its waters even though the Gulf of Mexico-spawned stock is considered by many scientists to have entered into full-scale collapse. But it is Japan, the world's largest bluefin importer, that has taken perhaps the most aggressive pro-tuna-fishing position, sometimes assisted by Westerners like Ritchie Notar, who declaim the country's long tuna-eating tradition. But history shows that Japan's stake in tuna fishing is recent and, more important, part of the same endgame that has dragged all of humanity into the Age of Tuna. Before 1800, Japanese tuna sushi didn't even exist.
 Trevor Corson is an East Asia scholar turned popular nonfiction writer and author of the 2007 book ''The Story of Sushi,'' and for select groups he will act as a ''sushi concierge,'' hosting dinners often at the Jewel Bako Japanese restaurant in Manhattan's East Village, one of which I attended this past winter. A Corson-guided meal aims to reveal the historical truth of tuna and to represent the very different fish that were the staples of sushi in earlier times. Plate by plate I watched as Corson walked a group of Manhattan professionals through a traditional Edo-period meal of snappers, jacks and other white-fleshed, smaller fish that most definitely did not include ''red'' tuna. Afterward, Corson sent me an excerpt from a 1999 Japanese anthology titled ''Fish Experts Teach the Secrets of the Deliciousness of Fish'' to further underline his point. ''Originally, fish with red flesh were looked down on in Japan as a low-class food, and white fish were much preferred,'' one of the book's contributors, Michiyo Murata, writes. ''Fish with red flesh tended to spoil quickly and develop a noticeable stench, so in the days before refrigeration the Japanese aristocracy despised them, and this attitude was adopted by the citizens of Edo [old Tokyo].'' Other Japanese scholars like the sushi historian Masuo Yoshino confirm this. Murata, meanwhile, goes on to note that tuna were introduced into sushi only 170 years ago, when a large catch came into Edo one season. On that day a local sushi chef marinated a few pieces of tuna in soy sauce and served it as ''nigiri sushi.'' The practice caught on. Occasionally a big bluefin became sushi, but Corson notes these fish were nicknamed shibi -- ''four days'' -- because chefs would bury them for four days to mellow their bloody taste.
 By the 1930s, tuna sushi was commonplace in Japan, but demand could be met by local supplies of tuna, including the Pacific bluefin species, which dwells in Japan's coastal waters. It was World War II that took tuna fishing to the next level. ''To recover from the devastation of the war,'' Ziro Suzuki, formerly of the Japanese Far Seas Research Laboratory, wrote me, ''Japanese fishermen needed more tunas to secure food for domestic demand and also to earn more money by exporting tunas for canning industries in Europe and the U.S. Those needs urged the expansion of fishing grounds outside of the historic grounds of the western Pacific.'' But this next fishing expansion was technological as well as territorial. Throughout the postwar period, the Japanese perfected industrial long-lining, a practice that employs thousands of baited hooks. In the 1970s Japanese manufacturers developed lightweight, high-strength polymers that were in turn spun into extensive drift nets that could be many miles long. Though drift nets were banned in the high seas by the early '90s, in the 1970s hundreds of miles of them were often deployed in a single night. When drift nets and long lines were coupled with at-sea freezing technology invented around the same time, Japanese fishermen were able to fish the farthest reaches of the oceans while keeping their frozen tuna sushi-ready for as long as a year.
 A major yield of all of this Japanese fishing effort was yellowfin tuna. Though they ate bluefin, Japanese did not hold them in high regard before the 1960s, and it took a confluence of socioeconomic factors in both Japan and the West to bring bluefin to the fore. By the late 1960s, sportfishing for giant bluefin tuna was starting in earnest off Nova Scotia, New England and Long Island. Like the Japanese at the time, North Americans had little regard for bluefin on the plate, usually discarding them after capture.
 Bluefin sportfishing's rise, however, coincided with Japan's export boom. In the 1960s and '70s, Japanese planes stuffed with electronics unloaded in the U.S. and returned empty -- a huge waste of fuel. But when a Japanese entrepreneur realized he could buy New England and Canadian bluefin for a song, he started filling up all those empty cargo holds with tuna. Exposure to beef and other fatty meats during the U.S. occupation had already drawn the Japanese to appreciate bluefin's fatty belly (otoro, in sushi terms). The Atlantic bluefin, the biggest bluefin, became the most favored of all. This appreciation boomeranged stateside when Americans started to develop their own raw-fish habit in the late 1970s.
 Added to the already significant fishing pressure from the tuna canning industry, Japan's and now the West's sushi jones has come to stress populations of large tuna around the world, starting with the most environmentally sensitive Atlantic bluefin but with the risk of spreading to other species. In fact, one subpopulation of Atlantic bluefin has already vanished after heavy fishing by Japanese long-liners: The bluefin that used to congregate off Brazil disappeared in the early bluefin boom of the 1970s. The remaining Atlantic bluefin stocks are trending similarly, and the two other species of bluefin -- the Pacific, which ranges between California and Japan, and the southern bluefin, which plies the waters around Australia -- are not far behind. In the United States, the direct fishing pressure on bluefin continues -- but perhaps a larger problem is that a large quantity of North American bluefin are caught accidentally as ''by-catch'' when industrial long-liners deploy their legions of hooks in search of yellowfin tuna over the bluefin's spawning grounds in the Gulf of Mexico. By law, nearly all bluefin caught as by-catch must be dumped back into the sea. Usually by that point they are already dead.
 All of this has led the bluefin to become a cause celebre among conservation groups and the target of several organized ''save the bluefin'' campaigns. None of them have influenced Japanese consumers. In the case of Nobu, after numerous exchanges with Greenpeace, the sushi restaurant's owners remained unpersuaded of the need to stop serving the fish. Their only concession was a haiku-esque warning on the menus of its London eateries:
 ''Bluefin tuna
 Is an environmentally threatened species
 Please ask your server for an alternative.''
 Willie Mackenzie of Greenpeace U.K. responded angrily in a note to Ritchie Notar: ''Despite the assurances that you take these issues seriously and that you want Nobu to be a leader in this field, you have essentially tried to abdicate responsibility by suggesting that it is down to your customers to decide if they want to eat an endangered species.''
 AWAY FROM RESTAURANT menus and the entree preferences of individual consumers, more far-ranging choices are presenting themselves to humanity than picking a California roll or a sliver of otoro. These are choices that will shape the fate of not just Atlantic bluefin tuna, not just all tunas, but all the great sea creatures -- sharks, swordfish, marlin, even whales. For every one of these animals is highly migratory and roams the high seas, the vast, ownerless seascape that makes up some 60 percent of the oceans.
 Until the 1970s, fishing in the high seas tended to be based on the principles of Hugo Grotius's 1609 treatise ''Mare Liberum'' -- a document that advocated free use of the oceans by all. But in the last 40 years, Grotius's ''free sea'' has grown progressively more circumscribed. Today, high-seas and highly migratory fish are overseen by 18 regional fisheries-management organizations. These ''consensus-oriented'' institutions, in which each member nation has equal status, can be guided more by political horse-trading than by sound science. A former chairman of the scientific committee of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (or Iccat), the body responsible for Atlantic bluefin, told me, ''Even though scientific advice says you should stick to a specific catch number, in order to negotiate a deal they tend to nudge that number over a little bit.'' That little nudge can be enough to put a population of tuna in jeopardy.
 In 2008 Iccat set Atlantic bluefin catch limits that were nearly double what its own scientists recommended. Conservationists howled, and the quotas were reduced sharply. But by the time Iccat met again, in November 2009, environmentalists had come to home in on the historic mismanagement of Atlantic bluefin, many of them arguing that a simple reduction in catch quotas for the coming fishing season was not enough -- that in fact a zero-catch quota was the only thing that would stave off the fish's extinction. Iccat rejected the zero-quota idea. This in turn forced a much more high-pitched confrontation this spring between parties like Japan, which seems to feel that fishery-management problems can be resolved within the status quo, and those who are looking to take the high seas in a profoundly different direction.
 The debate was joined when delegates gathered this past March in Doha, Qatar, for a meeting of the United Nations Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Flora and Fauna, or Cites (pronounced SY-tees). It was a meeting that, for fish, could have been as important as the 1982 meeting of the International Whaling Commission that voted to establish a moratorium on commercial whaling worldwide. For if conservationists got their way, Atlantic bluefin would be included in the Cites treaty's Appendix One -- a result that would ban the international trade of the tuna and put them under the jurisdiction of the same U.N. body that oversees tigers, white rhinos and giant pandas. It would be the beginning of a process that would transition Atlantic bluefin tuna from seafood to wildlife.
 It is precisely this kind of recasting that happened with whales in the 1980s, and Japan was intent on avoiding a similar recategorization with Atlantic bluefin tuna. As Masanori Miyahara, the director of the Fisheries Agency of Japan, put it to me: ''Cites Appendix One is too inflexible . . . once a species is listed in a Cites appendix, it will never be delisted or down-listed as the history of Cites clearly shows.'' In other words, once a fish becomes wildlife, it will stay wildlife. A Cites treaty would also allow those countries that happen to have bluefin in their territorial waters to continue to catch them for their own market while excluding all the other treaty member nations -- a result that Masanori would surely find not only unfair but also capable of leading to further overfishing. (The European Union has indicated it will continue to catch its allowable quota even if a Cites resolution is passed.)
 Japan's touchiness about fairness on the high seas is understandable given its dependence on seafood. Its per capita seafood consumption is among the highest of any industrialized country. And Japan has not been blind to the problems that come with overfishing and excessively large fishing fleets. Indeed, in the last few years it has tried to rein in its industrial fishing effort, decommissioning vessels, literally pulling hooks out of the water. But this has failed to resolve another problem of the Age of Tuna. Just as the industrialized countries are starting to realize the need for more sensible management of the high seas, developing countries are heading in the opposite direction. ''Developing countries firmly believe they have a right to expand their fisheries and that developed countries should reduce their fishing effort to compensate,'' Ziro Suzuki wrote me. ''In the process of trying to resolve the conflict of interest, the stocks become overfished, and overall fishing effort grows to an unacceptable level. . . . It's really just another example of the North-South problem, just like CO2 emissions.''
 The conflict between the developing and developed world plays an increasingly greater role in tuna negotiations, and at a certain point it is hard to figure out who is manipulating whom in an intrigue involving 175 countries, each trying to game the system. Representatives from both the WWF and the Pew Environment Group told me of a curious imbroglio as the Qatar Cites meeting neared its vote on bluefin. Japanese delegation members supposedly told African representatives that European bluefin fleets would relocate to the coast of Africa and catch African yellowfin tuna if the Cites bluefin motion passed. This despite the fact that European vessels are geared up specifically for bluefin fishing and lack the capacity to pursue yellowfin. Masanori Miyahara of the Fisheries Agency of Japan dismissed this claim as ''completely wrong and unfounded. We never told such a thing to anybody. We even haven't thought such an idea, ever.''
 True or not, African nations lined up with Japan. After Libya and Sudan forced a vote, the Atlantic bluefin's Cites Appendix One listing was rejected by a large majority.
 Delegates flew away from Qatar with the status quo in place. The monthlong bluefin purse-seining season set earlier by Iccat for the Mediterranean would stand as it was with quotas above what many scientists had recommended. A month after the Cites meeting, BP's Horizon Deepwater oil rig collapsed into the sea and spewed oil into the only bluefin spawning ground in the Americas just as the few remaining North American stock giant bluefin were preparing to mate in the Gulf of Mexico. Though the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service has been deeply critical of the Mediterranean bluefin catch -- in 2007, it went so far as to call for a moratorium -- it has been noncommittal about the American fishery. When I asked the Fisheries Service if it would consider closing the bluefin season on the heels of the BP spill, I was offered a statement, part of which, recast in verse form, has an almost Nobu-type haiku quality:
 ''N.O.A.A. Fisheries is carefully monitoring
 The spawning of bluefin tuna in the Gulf of Mexico
 By collecting larval samples and analyzing reports from scientific observers.''
 It seems then that no single nation is ready to commit to a sustainable future for the fish. Some would argue that extirpation might just have to be the bluefin's fate. Other, smaller tuna might be better suited to industrial exploitation. The bigeye and yellowfin tuna generally grow faster and spawn earlier. And indeed these lesser tuna are already starting to fill in for the bluefin's absence. In the United States most Americans usuallyend up eating bigeye when they order otoro -- the fatty zebra-striped flesh that fetches the highest price on most sushi menus nowadays. But major populations of bigeye tuna are also declining. Should they go away, it's hard to say what would come next.
 we get ourselves out of the Age of Tuna with our moral center and our food supply intact? Can we develop a civilized hunter-gatherer relationship with tuna and indeed with all other fish and reach a point of equilibrium with our last wild food? Can the management bodies that have overseen the collapse of the most magnificent food fish we've ever known be trusted to manage what is left in its wake?
 The answer depends on where you fall on the fairly broad political spectrum of the world's different tuna watchers. The Fisheries Agency of Japan maintains that ''Japan is committed to ensure the recovery'' of the Atlantic bluefin and has stipulated it will support a complete shutdown of the bluefin fishery at next fall's Iccat meeting, should the scientific committee recommend it. Greenpeace meanwhile has punted on the bluefin political process. ''Others have failed our oceans,'' Oliver Knowles told the press as he prepared his mini armada off Malta, ''so Greenpeace will act.'' Greenpeace is calling for a radical realignment of the high seas, to take stewardship away from regional fisheries-management organizations and establish 40 percent of the world's ocean territory as a marine reserve, a kind of Antarctica-style agreement with shades of whale, where nations, instead of bargaining over quotas, would simply not be able to do any fishing at all in large areas of the oceans. Most other environmental organizations are behind the marine-reserve idea, but they vary in opinion on how big those reserves should be. The Blue Ocean Institute calls for a five-year moratorium on Atlantic bluefin fishing everywhere. TheWWF further advocates that the industrial fishing methods that spread during the Age of Tuna -- the drift nets, long lines, purse seines and spotter planes -- be done away with. In their view, the ''artisanal'' single-hook-and-line fishing practices of old are the only way to sustainably hunt big and naturally scarce predators like bluefin.
 But if we are to embark on a global project of ramping down tuna fishing, what are we to eat?
 Until the modern era, the response to wild-game decline has been a primitive one: widespread destruction of the animals that can't stand up to our hunting followed by the selection of a handful of ones that we can tame. Out of the many mammals that our forebears ate before the last ice age, humans selected four -- cows, pigs, sheep and goats -- to be their principal meats. Out of all the many birds that darkened the primeval skies, humans chose four -- chickens, turkeys, ducks and geese -- to be their poultry.
 And indeed, this is a process that is taking shape rapidly with fish. Atlantic salmon are now commercially extinct throughout almost the entirety of their range but have become one of the most widely farmed fish in the world.
 But while leaps have been made in taming marine fish, tuna, particularly bluefin tuna, may not make very much sense for the farm. Bluefin ranching as it is practiced in the Mediterranean, and with the Pacific bluefin in Japan and the southern bluefin in Australia, rightly faces strong environmental criticisms since it relies on catching juveniles from the wild and denies those baby bluefin a chance to reach adulthood and breed. Now, however, the final steps of fully taming or ''closing the life cycle'' of bluefin tuna are under way, which will make it possible for bluefin to be grown from an egg in a laboratory to a full-size adult. In such a system, an isolated ''domestic'' family of bluefin can be established that need not have any interaction with the wild at all. For several years Japan has been producing small amounts of closed-life-cycle Pacific bluefin (known as Kindai tuna in the market). In Europe and Australia, scientists have used light-manipulation technology as well as time-release hormone implants invented by the Israeli endocrinologist Yonathan Zohar to bring about the first large-scale captive spawning of Atlantic and southern bluefin.
 But there are considerable complications ahead. As Richard Smullen, an Australia-based feed-company specialist working to come up with a suitable diet for farmed bluefin, explained: ''The thing is the metabolic rate of these fish is very high compared to other fish; they swim fast, they heat their brains and vital organs and are warmer than the surrounding water, so this is energetically expensive. An analogy is like trying to feed an ultramarathon runner -- they have the potential to eat a lot and not put on any weight.'' Though Smullen says that it is possible to bring feed-conversion ratios for bluefin down, currently it may take 15 pounds of feed to produce a single pound of tuna, roughly 10 times as much as is needed for farmed salmon.
 As fisheries decline globally, more and more countries are trying to replace their wild fish with farmed ones. Today 30 million tons of small forage fish are removed from the oceans yearly, with the majority of it going to feed farmed fish. If we end up farming bluefin on the same scale as we now farm salmon, the tuna, with its poor feed-conversion rate, may end up taking the food of the remaining wild fish that we haven't yet got around to catching.
 In addition there is little evidence to suggest that taming a species saves its wild forebear. Tiger farms in China have not halted tiger declines in the wild. Hundreds of millions of farmed Atlantic salmon have not stanched wild Atlantic salmon's continued decline. Just because we can tame something doesn't mean we should. The example of whales again rises. As the science historian D. Graham Burnett points out in a coming book on the Save the Whales movement, collaborations between American nuclear scientists and marine biologists were once proposed in the 1960s whereby tropical atolls, leveled by nuclear testing, could be used as giant corrals for the commercial farming of cetaceans. But fortunately for the whale -- and I think for us too -- we have come to see the whale not as something we fish for, not as something we farm, but as something we appreciate and maybe empathize with. Instead of expanding our stomachs or our wallets, whales have expanded our consciousness, our very humanity. So we have to ask ourselves, is there any rational argument for humans to eat bluefin tuna, wild, ranched or farmed? Is the fish really so special that no substitute will do? If the Japanese adapted to a higher-fat diet in half a century, could they and all sushi lovers not shift gears again and adapt to a sustainable diet?
 It was in answer to these questions that I went looking for a farmed fish that could satisfy tuna-eaters at the sushi bar. A fish that had the dense ''bite'' of tuna but with a smaller ecological footprint -- a Volkswagen instead of a Hummer.
 My search led me to the coast of the Big Island of Hawaii, where I motored with a tall, optimistic Australian named Neil Anthony Sims. As we donned wetsuits, fins and scuba tanks, Sims rejoiced in telling me tales of his adopted land. Eventually we spat in our masks, adjusted our regulators and dived into the water above Sims's farm -- a huge underwater ziggurat that is the center of his company, Kona Blue Water Farms.
 Until recently, most of the fish we've chosen to domesticate have been accidents. Salmon, striped bass, trout -- we have chosen those species because we knew them as wild game. We seldom considered their biological profiles or whether they jibed well with the ecological limitations of a crowded planet.
 But Neil Sims was a fisheries biologist before he was a fish farmer. And it was his direct personal experience with the limitations of fisheries management that persuaded him that fish farming, done right, was a better choice than fish catching.
 Sims began his career in the remote Cook Islands of the South Pacific. There he was responsible for managing a giant snail called a trochus that produces an attractive pearly shell, valuable to native jewelers. Over half a decade, he implemented numerous management strategies. Nothing worked -- not even shortening the harvest season drastically. The day after one season ended, he came across a bare-chested Polynesian elder who had pulled his dugout canoe onto the beach. Sims looked inside the boat and saw it filled with trochus.
 ''I yelled at him,'' Sims remembers. ''Then he yelled at me. He started to cry. Then I started to cry, and then the old bugger finally says: 'Why? Why did you close the season? There are still some left!' '' This moment prompted him to look beyond fishing, to an entirely different approach.
 Sims was drawn to Hawaii, with its deep near-shore waters and strong currents -- attributes favorable to aquaculture that he believed could make ocean farming sustainable. But the fish farming he found on arrival in Hawaii didn't impress him. ''People were trying milkfish and mullet,'' Sims recalled. ''They start with the letter 'm' and they're all really kind of hmmmmm in the mouth, if you know what I mean.'' Sims found the fish too bony and small, with loose, mushy flesh. This was important. Sims's long-standing beat in the South Pacific had persuaded him that ''there was an opportunity for a high-value, sushi-quality fish,'' a fish that could fit into the dense-flesh category that the Age of Tuna had cultivated in Japan and indeed throughout the developed world.
 After parsing many species he came across Seriola rivoliana. Known in Hawaiias kahala, it is a speedy, firm-fleshed animal of the same family as yellowtail and amberjack. They are only very distantly related to tuna and do not have tuna's ruby red color, but they still have dense flesh and could easily pass for white albacore sushi. The fat content in Sims's farmed kahala is around 30 percent, and indeed it is the presence of fat that accounts for much of a sushi fish's tunalike flavor.
 Sims was further intrigued when he found that kahala had barely been fished commercially. In their wild form kahala can carry ciguatera poison -- a toxin sometimes deadly to humans that kahala ingest when they feed around coral reefs. But when kahala are isolated away from reefs and fed a traditional aquaculture diet of soy and fishmeal, they are ciguatera-free. (Sims asserts that ciguatera has never been detected in the flesh of his fish.) Since they have not been fished commercially, wild kahala populations are large and unlikely to be severely damaged through interaction with farmed fish. Moreover, kahala are much more ''feed efficient'' than tuna. The amount of fish required to produce a pound of kahala ranges from 1.6 pounds to 2 pounds, an order of magnitude better than bluefin. And Sims recently began feed trials using diets that contain no directly harvested forage fish. Lastly, unlike tuna, which require a tremendous investment in spawning technology, kahala are naturally fecund: they breed frequently, at least weekly, throughout the year.
 THERE ARE, OF COURSE, those who would disagree with Sims's approach. When I asked Casson Trenor, author of the 2009 book ''Sustainable Sushi,'' for his impression of the kahala as a farmed fish, he responded that the farming of any carnivore is ''fighting the current.'' ''You may have a farm that has a more efficient protein ratio,'' Trenor wrote me, ''but produces more waste streams. Perhaps you have a feed pellet that knocks your feed conversion ratio down to 1 to 1, but you continue to host a rampant parasite infestation. . . . We need to identify fish that through their physiology and life history actually lend themselves to clean farming operations.'' Trenor's own compromise is to serve wild ''small format'' tuna like skipjack or albacore, fish that he feels can embrace the ''principles of seasonality, local awareness and sustainability'' that sushi originally expressed before it was ''transformed through cultural misinterpretation and overzealous globalization into exactly the opposite.''
 But as I plunged into the calm blue waters off Kona and inflated my diving vest to gain equilibrium in the water column, I couldn't help thinking that in a world of environmental evils prosecuted against fish, the farming of a more efficient carnivore than a bluefin under the stewardship of a knowledgeable, environmentally conscious biologist was a good deal better than the rapacious industrial harvesting of ''large format'' tuna. Looking down at this ''cathedral'' of fish, as Sims called it, the possibility of a certain balance presented itself. Using technology developed over the last 10 years, Kona Blue has constructed diamond-shape cages that can be moored in the open ocean away from sensitive coastal areas. As I glided down, past the fish swimming in unison in their net pen, I felt a cautious optimism. The site of these pens had been carefully chosen; the swift currents meant that nutrientsdid not accumulate below the pens. And regular monitoring has found the fish to have no internal parasites, unlike the wild kahala. Sims's commitment to transparency is also encouraging. He regularly posts water-quality reports on his Web site and presumably will do the same as the operation expands.
 Sims waved me over to the side of the net pen. I floated above him, close enough to see that the fish actually seemed to recognize him. In what he would later describe to me as the ''rock-star effect,'' the fish crowded to be close to him. Sims spread his arms out wide and seemed to take in their adulation.
 Sims has trademarked his kahala with the name Kona Kampachi -- ''Kona'' for its point of origin, ''Kampachi'' for the similaranimal in Japan. They retail for $18 to $20 a pound in fillet form and to date have a tenuous foot in the market. Production reached more than a million pounds in 2008, about a third of the amount of bluefin caught in American waters that year. After a hiatus during most of 2009 and the first part of 2010 while Sims reconfigured his cages, the product will be reintroduced this July with even more capacity. Kona Kampachi may not have the rich ruby color of tuna (a color that is often enhanced artificially by ''gassing'' with carbon monoxide), but it is an extremely pleasant sushi experience. It satisfies the sashimi yen that has been created over the last 30 years -- the yen for the firm, energy-rich musculature of a fast-swimming open-ocean fish.
 Can we embrace a new set of species that we don't know intimately in their wild form? Can we come to an understanding of which fish work for us as ''seafood'' and which fish don't? I would hope so. The survival of the wild ocean could very well depend on it. I took one more look at Neil Sims floating with arms outstretched, his kahala finning in the current, each one mutely appraising this conductor of a silent concert. The only sound was the whir of bubbles rising by my ears.
 SEAFOOD. HOW MANY species suffer those two mean English syllables? Other languages are no kinder. Romance European cultures use the expression ''sea fruit,'' while Slavs say ''sea gifts.'' So-called vegetarians rue the killing of farmed terrestrial animals but regularly eat wild fish. Kosher laws mandating merciful animal slaughter don't apply to fish.
 These thoughts were in my head recently when I got perhaps my last look at a wild bluefin tuna, just a month before the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and collapsed into the Gulf of Mexico. I was 20-odd miles off the coast of Cape Hatteras, N.C., aboard the Sensation, a vessel chartered by the Tag-a-Giant Foundation, a nonprofit organization trying to decode the complex migration patterns of the bluefin and help lay the scientific foundation for the fish's protection. Tag-a-Giant had been fishing for a couple days, and many people had sat in the fighting chair I now occupied, reeling in tuna after tuna. But for me this was a first. I had never caught a bluefin before.
 In the past I would have wanted to savor the fight, to do battle with the fish with lighter, more ''sporting'' tackle. But considering everything I'd learned about tuna, humans and the chances of the great fish's survival, it suddenly seemed infinitely more appropriate to fight this tuna with the full expression of humanity's power. For in the end tuna are no match for us. We have in this final phase of exploitation achieved dominion over the entirety of the watery world, from inland lakes and rivers to the littoral zone to the continental shelf out to the abyssof the high seas. Sitting in the huge fighting chair with the huge rod and reel, in the well of the huge sportfishing vessel, it was inescapably apparent who had the edge.
 As my bluefin breached, one of the scientists opened a door at the stern of the boat. A blue vinyl mat was laid down on the deck. The fish came through the door, still ''hot,'' banging its tail excitedly. But in an instant a biologist named Andre Boustany placed a moist cover over the tuna's giant eye and a hydration hose in its mouth. The tuna motor mellowed, and at last the fish was beatifically still.
 ''Do you want to tag him?'' Boustany asked me.
 I took the sharp four-inch needle from his hand and positioned it just behind the fish's dorsal fin. Pricking the skin slightly I started to pull my hand away.
 ''No,'' Boustany said, ''you gotta really stick it in there.''
 Applying more pressure, I felt the needle slide into the flank, felt the resistance of the dense sushi flesh, raw and red and most certainly delicious. But for the first time in my life I felt tuna flesh for what it was: a living, perfect expression of a miraculous adaptation. An adaptation that allows bluefin to cross oceans at the speed of a battleship. An adaptation that should be savored in its own right as the most miraculous engine of a most miraculous animal, not as food.
 Perhaps people will never come to feel about a tuna the way they have come to feel about whales. Whales are, after all, mammals: they have large brains; they nurse their young and breed slowly. All of that ensconces them in a kind of empathic cocoon, the warmth of which even the warmest-blooded tuna may never occupy. But what we can perhaps be persuaded to feel, viscerally, is that industrial fishing as it is practiced today against the bluefin and indeed against all the world's great fish, the very tigers and lions of our era, is an act unbefitting our sentience. An act as pointless, small-minded and shortsighted as launching a harpoon into the flank of a whale.

HEADLINE: Sex And the Single Drug

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

 BODY:
THERE'S been a lot of hype lately about an experimental drug to treat sexual disinterest in women, a difficulty formerly known as the ''Not tonight, Honey, I have a headache'' problem.
 It turns out to be a polarizing issue.
 In a Viagra-flooded culture, where men have access to little blue pills to quell performance anxiety, isn't it only fair that women should have a sex-enhancement drug of their own? Or, is a woman's desire so much more complicated and contextual than a man's that it cannot be localized to a single anatomical deficiency suitable to pharmaceutical remedy? And, by the way, some women's health advocates ask, why are we seeking to ''fix'' women when a lack of desire is often a side effect of another malady: the ''men don't know how to please their partners'' disease? (There's no pill for that.)
 Right now, there isn't a federally approved drug in the United States to treat female libido difficulties. But a novel female desire drug, called flibanserin, now under review by the Food and Drug Administration, has stirred up both proponents and detractors. (My colleague Duff Wilson has written in detail about the debate over the drug.) 
 Clinical trials sponsored by the drug's maker, Boehringer Ingelheim, reported that pre-menopausal women on flibanserin experienced a small increase in satisfying sexual activity, compared with women taking a placebo. But a panel of independent medical experts, convened by the F.D.A. to vet the drug, voted that its small effect in heightening libido did not outweigh side effects like dizziness and nausea. Boehringer Ingelheim said in a statement that it was disappointed with the panel's recommendations and would work with the F.D.A. to address the group's questions.
 In the meantime, the parabola of hype and deflation over the so-called pink Viagra illustrates the challenges that drug makers are likely to face as they expand further into quality-of-life issues like sex from more familiar and saturated chronic-problem categories like high cholesterol.
 The market potential for quality-of-life issues seems enormous. A 2005 article in the journal Nature Reviews Drugs Discovery, for example, predicted that revenue for female sexual dysfunction treatments in the United States could exceed $4 billion annually ''with only 15 percent of patients captured on therapy.'' 
 All of this carries caveats, of course. Regulators and doctors tend to be less tolerant of side effects in quality-of-life drugs than they are in medicines intended to mitigate life-and-death diseases. Some industry critics, meanwhile, contend that in the quest to find new and treatable quality-of-life problems, drug makers are not so much identifying unmet needs as they are stoking existing social anxieties to weld to their medicines.
 The hunt for the first medical boost for female desire or arousal offers an interesting case study.
 Women naturally experience fluctuating levels of desire over the course of their lives. Lessened libido can be prompted by issues like depression, abuse, bad relationships or stress. In a subset of women, doctors say, sexual disinterest can cause significant personal distress, clinically classified as ''hypoactive sexual desire disorder.'' The question is whether its antidote is therapy, patience, relationship changes, pharmacology or a combination thereof.
 Pharmaceutical companies once hoped that Viagra, or other impotence drugs that men take on an occasional basis to increase blood flow to the penis, would similarly bolster arousal in women. 
 ''That didn't go anywhere,'' says Dr. R. Taylor Segraves, a professor of psychiatry at the School of Medicine at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, who specializes in sexual disorders. Unlike men, says Dr. Segraves, who is a consultant and investigator for Boehringer Ingelheim, women with difficulties in desire or arousal rarely complain of physical malfunctions.
 ''I think it was rather naive on the part of pharmaceutical companies,'' he says, ''to think that sexuality in females is the same as in males.''
 Next, some drug companies turned to hormones as a potential treatment. But in 2004, when an F.D.A. panel met to consider a testosterone patch to treat libido difficulties in women who had had their ovaries removed, the experts said they were concerned that the product might increase the risk of cancer and heart attacks.
 Dr. Segraves says that in the absence of an F.D.A.-approved testosterone patch for female desire, some doctors prescribe male testosterone drugs in low doses for women. ''How safe that is, I don't think we have good long-term data,'' he says.
 The latest attempt, flibanserin, offers a third way to treat the female libido: brain chemicals. The drug was first developed as an antidepressant. The pills didn't do much to combat depression, Dr. Segraves says, but Boehringer Ingelheim repurposed the product after women in depression studies reported experiencing increased sexual interest.
 In North American studies of the drug in premenopausal women, patients using flibanserin reported an average of nearly one more satisfying sexual event per month -- oral sex, say, or intercourse -- than women taking a daily sugar pill. 
 Leonore Tiefer, a psychotherapist in Manhattan who specializes in sexual disorders, jokes that the pill's apparently meager benefit amounts to an additional ''three-quarters of an orgasm'' a month.
 But for women who previously had no satisfying sex at all, even a small increase might be significant.
 The fact that drug makers have taken three different medical routes -- the circulatory system, the endocrine system and the nervous system -- may indicate that female desire is so complicated that an even more novel approach is required: treatment with multiple therapies.
 Or it may indicate that some drug makers are simply trying to tailor a sexual difficulty to mesh well with how some of their drugs operate in the body, says Ray Moynihan, a frequent contributor to BMJ, formerly the British Medical Journal, and co-author of a forthcoming book called ''Sex, Lies and Pharmaceuticals.''
 ''The disease seems designed to fit whatever pharmaceutical solution exists at the time,'' says Mr. Moynihan. ''If it is a disease.''
 BUT the hurdles for a female libido drug may be getting higher. 
 The next edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, a psychiatry reference book, proposes to do away with the old diagnosis of hypoactive sexual desire disorder. In its stead, a new diagnosis would more narrowly define reduced libido as a lack of sexual interest over at least six months, as well as other criteria -- a potential change that could create a higher threshold for prescribing drug therapy.
 ''I think it should be fairly tough to make that diagnosis because, if we have a drug, people are going to be throwing it around right and left,'' says Dr. Nada L. Stotland, a psychiatry professor at Rush Medical College in Chicago. ''I think it deserves considerably more investigation.''

PERSON: Richard B. Sellars 

HEADLINE: Richard B. Sellars, 94, Former Chief of Johnson & Johnson

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
Richard B. Sellars, a former chairman and chief executive of Johnson & Johnson who resisted abandoning the company's hometown in New Jersey and then helped revitalize its downtown, died on Friday at his home in Osterville, Mass. He was 94. 
 His death was confirmed by his son, Richard Jr. Joining the company in 1939 as a junior salesman for its new Ortho Pharmaceutical division, Mr. Sellars worked for Johnson & Johnson for 40 years. He became the company's chairman and chief executive in 1973, the second person outside of the founding Johnson family to head the health care conglomerate. 
 Mr. Sellars is credited with persuading Johnson & Johnson to keep its headquarters in New Brunswick, N.J., despite the city's decline. Although the company was founded in the city, in 1886, some executives discussed relocating, but Mr. Sellars was instrumental in convincing the board to stay. 
 ''It was apparent even then that we had a commitment to New Brunswick that we couldn't run away from,'' Mr. Sellars said in a 1984 interview. ''The survival of our country depends on the survival of its cities, so we'd all better get involved in cleaning them up.''
 Mr. Sellars became active in developing plans to revitalize the city's downtown. He chaired the New Brunswick Development Corporation, a tax-exempt organization, and helped to recruit the architecture firm of I. M. Pei to redesign the business district. The same firm would later design the Johnson & Johnson corporate headquarters building. 
 ''He was so committed to the needs of the city,'' said John Heldrich, a former executive at Johnson & Johnson who worked with Mr. Sellars. 
 Mr. Sellars was also active in state and national politics, serving as a treasurer of the Republican National Committee. 
 Richard Beverland Sellars was born on Sept. 9, 1915, one of four children, and raised in Worcester, Mass. He attended American International College and Maryville College. At 23, he joined the sales force of Ortho Pharmaceutical, where he became a vice president in 1948. A year later, he joined Ethicon, the company's suture business. He was named president of Johnson & Johnson International in 1970. 
 After stepping down as chairman and chief executive in 1976, Mr. Sellars was chairman of the company's finance committee until he retired in 1979. In 1981, he was named a trustee of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the health care foundation created by Robert Wood Johnson II, the last member of the family to run the company. He was a trustee for 15 years. 
 Beside his son Richard, of Arnold, Md., Mr. Sellars is survived by his wife of 70 years, the former Doris Sophia Johnson (no relation to the company's founders); another son, Peter, of Sandwich, Mass.; two daughters, Christine S. Cotton of Osterville, and Carolyn M. Sellars of Williamsport, Pa.; nine grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: The Suit Stays on the Hanger

BYLINE: By CATHY HORYN

 BODY:
Paris
 IN a haze of soot and postwar austerity, Robert Frank's 1950s photographs of London bankers released a torrent of feeling. Here was elegance, superiority, order after chaos, black-white, clean lines, and it was all expressed by impeccable tailoring.
 Present conditions (war, political confusion, corruption, environmental catastrophes) again seem to argue for such authority, but unfortunately, as we know, the suit doesn't do the trick anymore. It's not that the suit is an object of suspicion -- not entirely, not if thousands of men coming through Grand Central every morning are still in suits. Nor is it simply the case that many workplaces have relaxed dress codes. 
 Rather, the problem is that a suit, the silhouette of a suit, doesn't visually engage us at the moment. It has to compete with many more exciting aesthetical forms, from the latest iPhone to new architecture. Certainly a virtue of those things is that they embrace not only design and function but also experimentation. And they expand, in apps and types of living spaces, the choices that people want. Truly relevant fashion reflects those considerations.
 Some of the most interesting clothes to come out of the Milan spring men's shows, and now Paris, try to elongate the silhouette and, at the same time, to use fairly standard uniform styles and materials, especially cotton. I am thinking of Prada and Alexander McQueen and the American maverick Rick Owens, who on Thursday showed long, chaste, stripped-down coats in black or white with pronounced shoulders, drainpipe sleeves and a bit of flare in the back.
 Mr. Owens likes the odd couture flourish, as well as the quasi-religious symbol. The collection also has that fearsome Owens aspect -- black leather vests with collars seeming to slash the face, cool white anoraks that border on germ-phobe gear, huge spatted black boots that suggest amphibian relatives -- but the long line of the coats, with their nod to dress in Africa and the Middle East, feels experimental.
 Romanticism is a refuge for fashion, and it's the basis of many design visions, but the approach is much less satisfying now. We know more, for one thing. We're aware of the powerful economies of former colonies, the complexities and hardships of others. We've seen enough interpretations of the '60s in Marrakesh, and we certainly don't want to see what amounts to a waiter's uniform at a spa.
 That's why Jean Paul Gaultier's show, based on the Turkish bath, worked so well. It had the right balance of humor, awareness and up-to-date fashion. Quite a few of the clothes were black and white, and included both tailoring and caftans. But, in fact, Mr. Gaultier seemed to be saying, it's a many-shaded world. Many of the models were brown-skinned.
 I also liked that he took the iconography of Yves Saint Laurent and Betty Catroux (as a pale, sandy-haired model in black-frame glasses and a lace-up beige knit) in their chic late-'60s mode and surrounded it with a tough cast of men into their own pleasures. The clothes conveyed that confidence and sexual tension, and for kooky fun, Mr. Gaultier had 3-D prints, as bathing suits, T-shirts and loose coats. He supplied the glasses.
 Dries Van Noten is a romantic designer, and that may be why the collection he showed on Thursday evening near a concrete underpass seemed to struggle. There were familiar elements of tailoring and a new version of overly bleached jeans, as well as paint-splattered separates, but the punk edge felt off the mark. With so many of these kinds of clothes widely available, you expect a more specific statement from Mr. Van Noten.
 Paul Helbers, the director of the men's studio at Louis Vuitton, did a convincing job with a travel theme. That doesn't sound like much of a challenge, but Mr. Helbers has a knack for creating surprising pieces from everyday life. So mixed in with cool khaki shorts, parachute jackets and a beautiful white linen suit were digitalized LV monogram florals and muted prints based on Chinese zodiac animals and tattoos. Those patterns were also repeated on the models' necks and arms by the Scott Campbell, a New York tattoo artist.
 Adam Kimmel typical looks to the style of a musician or artist, and then builds a new collection around that individual's personality. This season it was Snoop Dogg, with a customized vintage Lincoln Continental as part of the scene on Thursday night in the Marais. The clothes are friendly and real, but the method -- after 14 seasons in business -- raises the questions: Who's Adam Kimmel? What's his style?
 Yohji Yamamoto had fun exploring 18th- and 19th-century masculine styles, complete with appropriate facial hair. The collection was actually more contemporary than that might sound, with loose frock coats, muted floral jacquard shorts, and cool, extra-long polo shirts. More of a man dress, really.
 In one way or another, Junya Watanabe tackles male obsessions, and not complicated ones, either. For his spring collection, on Friday, it was sailing. That meant fresh variations on windbreakers, faded reds and blues, stripes and terrific boat shoes. But ultimately, the dude is a style maven, and a double-breasted jacket in faded denim blue with white cotton pants and bucks hedges the suit question, for now.

HEADLINE: Stanley Chera

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Mr. Chera, 67, is a founder of Crown Acquisitions, which has an ownership interest in dozens of retail and office properties throughout North America, including trophy buildings in Manhattan like the Fred F. French Building at 551 Fifth Avenue and the retail space at 666 Fifth and the St. Regis Hotel.
 Q How's business? 
 A Great.
 Q Better than last year? 
 A Last year wasn't a bad year for me, either.
 Q What deals are you working on right now? 
 A We're just closing the Knickerbocker Hotel at 42nd and Broadway. This property comprises the old Knickerbocker Hotel, which will be converted to office space and which we're going to restore to its original charm, and an adjacent property that we bought in the package. We're going to build a brand-new 400-room hotel/retail complex. In 24 to 30 months we'll have everything done.
 Q Which retailers will be brought in? 
 A The Gap has an option, and we're talking to several other major retailers who want to be there.
 Q You also just finalized a deal on a building on Fulton Street in Brooklyn, which will house Long Island University students. 
 A It will have dorms on the top three floors and retail.
 Q Your family roots are on Fulton Street, no? 
 A We started in downtown Brooklyn around 1947. I had a retail store. I was paying $2,000 a month rent and I was doing business up to the sky. I said, what am I doing? The building next door came up for sale, so I purchased it and started accumulating properties in the city.
 It's a great opportunity now to redevelop downtown Brooklyn, and we're attracting some major chains, like H & M. We're going to try to make it a 24-hour street -- a small Times Square. It's the sixth-largest shopping street in the city -- 100,000 shoppers a day.
 Q What's your occupancy rate portfoliowide? 
 A No vacancies. There's maybe 2,000 feet left at 666.
 Q Uniqlo of Japan recently leased 90,000 square feet on the ground floor of 666 Fifth Avenue. Was that a difficult deal?
 A My middle son did that deal. It took him a very short time, and I'll tell you why: Uniqlo was looking at the Coca-Cola building on Fifth Avenue, and we knew it was too small. We cold-called them, and supposedly the other deal was done, but it wasn't. We made a presentation to deliver all this space to them and worked through every detail.
 Q How much is the rent?
 A The main floor is $2,000 a foot.
 Q Do you offer concessions?
 A We don't discount. Fifth Avenue has been very strong, because there's nothing available.
 Q What are your rental rates?
 A Thirty-fourth Street is around $600 a foot downstairs; Fifth Avenue, from 51st to 57th Street, is $2,000 a foot; downtown Brooklyn, about $200 a foot; lower Broadway the rents are $600 up.
 Q Are you satisfied with the debt level at Crown Acquisitions?
 A We're very underleveraged. We borrow maybe 35 percent; on some properties it's 25 percent.
 The secret is to stay underleveraged and you can own something forever. I have 100 pieces of property, say, but I could have 1,000 leveraged. I'm very comfortable with having what I have.
 Q What's your involvement with the World Trade Center?
 A I'm just an investor.
 Q Do you have a vision for the neighborhood?
 A It's probably going to be the No. 1 tourist attraction in the world. I think it also could be one of the greatest shopping malls. But this thing should have been up a long time ago. So, that being said, who would want to move there now? It's just one big construction zone. But it's cheap down there. If you're a developer and you have deep pockets, you could buy any of these office buildings in Lower Manhattan today and in three to five years you'll make a fortune.
 Q Any other emerging area?
 A Red Hook is going to be a new frontier in Brooklyn. We accumulated a lot of land there along the waterways, and you'll see development in a few years. We could do some student housing, some theaters, lots of restaurants.
 Q Are you disappointed about having lost out on the chance to buy Filene's Basement?
 A Very. It was a great asset. We were going to grow the brand. The guy who was going to run it for me -- Joel Feigenbaum -- was hired away to run it for Syms, with my blessing.
 Q Do you like to shop?
 A No. I could go buy 10 suits -- in 15 minutes.

HEADLINE: In Bank Reform, the U.S. Leads by a Goal

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY

 BODY:
Last week in Washington, the House and Senate reached agreement on a sweeping overhaul of the nation's architecture of financial regulation.
 For anyone eager for change after the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, the reform may have seemed a long time coming.
 After seemingly endless sessions of tortuous deal-making, lawmakers agreed on important measures like improving consumer protection, restricting speculative investment by banks with their own money and establishing federal oversight of derivatives. 
 Though it may have taken an age, the breakthrough means that reform in the United States has moved faster and further than it has in the rest of the world. There, especially in Europe, the financial crisis was perceived as a problem made in America and had to be fixed in America.
 Now, the agreement in Washington, if it gains final passage, could change that dynamic, and other countries may feel compelled to catch up. Since the United States narrowly sidestepped total financial collapse in 2008, Europe has itself been nearly overwhelmed by a crisis of its own -- caused by sovereign rather than personal indebtedness -- and the United States economy has begun growing again, albeit uncertainly.
 ''Two years ago, there was a lot of Schadenfreude, and for many Europeans the U.S. economic model was discredited -- that Americans were living beyond their means,'' said Stewart Patrick, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington. ''Now the shoe is on the other foot.''
 The paradox in Europe is that while the anti-bank rhetoric has been even fiercer than it has been in the United States -- if you think Goldman Sachs is pilloried in the American media, bankers are really vilified in Europe -- the action taken to reform the financial system has been more muted.
 One reason for this is the political sway banks hold in Europe, where they account for a larger share of the economy and where some are owned at least in part by the state. This means that, perhaps surprisingly for Americans familiar with the lobbying powers of institutions like Goldman Sachs, the biggest European banks pack even greater clout in their own countries.
 Daniel Gros, director of the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels, said: In Europe, ''the lobby of the banks is even stronger. Not so much in the sense that lobbying activities finance political careers, but rather in the sense that in many countries banking and politics is intertwined.'' That power and importance may be a big reason Europe still has not taken the step the United States took more than a year ago to end chronic market uncertainty about the state of its financial institutions by undertaking full-blown stress tests of its troubled banks.
 Such an exercise in Europe, some analysts fear, could reveal the woeful nature of many European banks' balance sheets and kick off another round of the continent's sovereign debt crisis -- which would be another worry, to say the least, for President Obama.
 ''The U.S. process may be more political, but the European process is much more bureaucratic and slow,'' said Nicolas Veron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a policy research organization based in Brussels. ''So far, the European system has been unable to make the drastic change of stance required by the changed circumstances.''
 The Volcker rule, one of the major American reforms, restricts proprietary trading by banks. It is an acknowledgment that not all Wall Street business can be done under one roof, a reversal of banking practices of the past decade.
 But according to Douglas J. Elliott of the Brookings Institution in Washington, most of the changes in the package of American reforms are still based on the idea that ''the financial markets and the existing financial institutions can usefully play the role they did before,'' he said.
 Mr. Elliott calls this an ''American approach'' to reform -- ''free-market capitalism works; it just needs to be run better.''
 By contrast, although Europe is not about to dive back toward heavy-state socialism, Germany has already initiated a partial ban on naked short-selling, and the European Union is formulating a much tougher crackdown than the United States on hedge funds and private equity firms, possibly even down to stipulating in precise terms how much leverage they can take on. It is also designing an ambitious pan-European financial supervisory authority that would create a common rule book for national banking supervisors but whose powers could also supersede them in some areas.
 Kay Swinburne, a member of the European Parliament, said this step is ''more dramatic'' than the American supervisory reform, which foresees a council of regulators to watch for systemic risks, though oversight will continue to be divided between regulators.
 Still, while in some specific areas Europe may be going beyond the United States, in broader areas European leaders are favoring much more limited action. There is likely to be no widespread European version of the Volcker rule, for example, according to Agnes Benassy-Quere, an economist and the director of Cepii, a research group in Paris -- mainly because of the conviction that the cause of the financial crisis was risky trading by American institutions. In European eyes, European banks did not discredit themselves and so should not be meddled with.
 For that same reason, while the United States favors requiring banks to set aside significantly more capital as a cushion against future losses, some European countries are fighting this. The move would be expensive, and German leaders, in particular, feel this would unfairly punish their banks for a problem caused by American banks -- despite much evidence, according to analysts, that the European institutions, too, were involved in the free-wheeling culture that got the world economy into so much trouble.
 ''European policymakers are being slow, almost unforgivably slow, in making changes because of the belief that Americans were almost exclusively to blame for the crisis,'' said Simon Tilford, an economist at the Center for European Reform in London. But, he said, ''they also engaged in similar banking practices -- there was a similar property boom here, similar excessive mortgage lending.''

HEADLINE: Death By Gadget

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
''Blood diamonds'' have faded away, but we may now be carrying ''blood phones.''
 An ugly paradox of the 21st century is that some of our elegant symbols of modernity -- smartphones, laptops and digital cameras -- are built from minerals that seem to be fueling mass slaughter and rape in Congo. With throngs waiting in lines in the last few days to buy the latest iPhone, I'm thinking: What if we could harness that desperation for new technologies to the desperate need to curb the killing in central Africa?
 I've never reported on a war more barbaric than Congo's, and it haunts me. In Congo, I've seen women who have been mutilated, children who have been forced to eat their parents' flesh, girls who have been subjected to rapes that destroyed their insides. Warlords finance their predations in part through the sale of mineral ore containing tantalum, tungsten, tin and gold. For example, tantalum from Congo is used to make electrical capacitors that go into phones, computers and gaming devices. 
 Electronics manufacturers have tried to hush all this up. They want you to look at a gadget and think ''sleek,'' not ''blood.'' 
 Yet now there's a grass-roots movement pressuring companies to keep these ''conflict minerals'' out of high-tech supply chains. Using Facebook and YouTube, activists are harassing companies like Apple, Intel and Research in Motion (which makes the BlackBerry) to get them to lean on their suppliers and ensure the use of, say, Australian tantalum rather than tantalum peddled by a Congolese militia.
 A humorous new video taunting Apple and PC computers alike goes online this weekend on YouTube, with hopes that it will go viral. Put together by a group of Hollywood actors, it's a spoof on the famous ''I'm a Mac''/''I'm a PC'' ad and suggests that both are sometimes built from conflict minerals.
 ''Guess we have some things in common after all,'' Mac admits. 
 Protesters demonstrated outside the grand opening of Apple's new store in Washington, demanding that the company commit to using only clean minerals. Last month, activists blanketed Intel's Facebook page with calls to support tough legislation to curb trade in conflict minerals. For a time, Intel disabled comments -- creating a stink that called more attention to blood minerals than human rights campaigners ever could.
 Partly as a result, requirements that companies report on their use of conflict minerals were accepted as an amendment to financial reform legislation. 
 A word of background: Eastern Congo is the site of the most lethal conflict since World War II, and is widely described as the rape capital of the world. The war had claimed 5.4 million deaths as of April 2007, with the toll mounting by 45,000 a month, according to a study by the International Rescue Committee.
 It's not that American tech companies are responsible for the slaughter, or that eliminating conflict minerals from Americans' phones will immediately end the war. Even the Enough Project, an anti-genocide organization that has been a leading force in the current campaign, estimates that only one-fifth of the world's tantalum comes from Congo. 
 ''There's no magic-bullet solution to peace in Congo,'' notes David Sullivan of the Enough Project, ''but this is one of the drivers of the conflict.'' The economics of the war should be addressed to resolve it.
 The Obama administration also should put more pressure on Rwanda to play a constructive role next door in Congo (it has, inexcusably, backed one militia and bolstered others by dealing extensively in the conflict minerals trade). Impeding trade in conflict minerals is also a piece of the Congo puzzle, and because of public pressure, a group of companies led by Intel and Motorola is now developing a process to audit origins of tantalum in supply chains.
 Manufacturers previously settled for statements from suppliers that they do not source in eastern Congo, with no verification. Auditing the supply chains at smelters to determine whether minerals are clean or bloody would add about a penny to the price of a cellphone, according to the Enough Project, which says the figure originated with the industry.
 ''Apple is claiming that their products don't contain conflict minerals because their suppliers say so,'' said Jonathan Hutson, of the Enough Project. ''People are saying that answer is not good enough. That's why there's this grass-roots movement, so that we as consumers can choose to buy conflict free.'' Some ideas about what consumers can do are at raisehopeforCongo.org -- starting with spreading the word.
 We may be able to undercut some of the world's most brutal militias simply by making it clear to electronics manufacturers that we don't want our beloved gadgets to enrich sadistic gunmen. No phone or tablet computer can be considered ''cool'' if it may be helping perpetuate one of the most brutal wars on the planet.

HEADLINE: Financial Regulation

 BODY:
There is much to applaud in the financial regulatory reform bill announced last Friday by House and Senate negotiators. It would limit some of the riskiest activities of banks and regulate the multitrillion-dollar market in over-the-counter derivatives. It would give federal regulators the tools, if they need them, to shut failing large banks and financial firms instead of bailing them out. 
 In significant ways, the bill would also protect Americans directly. Consumers would be shielded from many forms of abusive and predatory lending, and investors could be empowered to influence corporate boards that have long been impervious to shareholder concerns. 
 The bill is a considerable accomplishment. It is the final version. Congress should pass it quickly.
 At the same time -- and in the months and years ahead -- lawmakers must acknowledge the bill's shortcomings and be prepared to take corrective action. Many of the bill's provisions come with exceptions or exemptions that could, in practice, swallow the new rules. 
 The reforms are also vulnerable to being weakened in the painstaking process of translating new law into actual regulations and procedures. Special interests -- think Wall Street -- have the resources and time to monitor and influence that process. The public does not. Lawmakers have to ensure the carrying out of the rules does not veer widely from what Congress has promised. 
 Take for example, the so-called Volcker rule, intended to reduce risk and speculation in the financial system. The Obama administration proposed banning banks from using their capital to invest in hedge funds and private equity funds. The final bill would let banks invest up to 3 percent of their high-quality capital in such funds, a big exception. Congress has to be prepared to reduce the percentage to control risks in the system.
 Derivatives regulation also bears watching. The bill would require most transactions to occur on regulated exchanges, rather than as private contracts. Regulators and lawmakers must strictly monitor derivatives that trade off-exchange and stop that market from growing ever larger.
 For all of the specific reforms, the legislation leaves intact a handful of behemoth, multitasking banks whose size and scope would make them difficult to dismantle in a crisis, even under a new law. 
 Congress is gambling that the reforms, taken together, will sufficiently reduce the banks' riskiness. That could happen, but if it does, the banks will make considerably less money and will want relief from what they are sure to call overly burdensome regulation. When that happens -- and if the reforms work, it will -- lawmakers will have to stand firm, even though it means imposing pain on the banks. Equally important, if the big banks grow larger and riskier despite the new rules, will lawmakers impose stronger restraints? If they do not, it is only a matter of time before the next calamity. 
 Americans have paid for the financial crisis with their jobs, incomes, savings, investments and home equity, and with their faith in markets and in the government to protect them from harm. The new bill is a step toward redressing those losses and restoring that faith. Congress should pass it, and then do what must be done to ensure that it performs as advertised.

HEADLINE: The Minivan, Once a Star Player, Now Sits on Sidelines

BYLINE: By CHERYL JENSEN

 BODY:
MAYBE it was an image problem, or soccer-mom backlash. Or perhaps the minivan was a victim of bullying by those big bad S.U.V.'s. But for whatever reason, the family-van market is a shadow of its former self. 
 In 2000, automakers sold a total of 1.25 million minivans in the United States. By last year, sales had plunged to 415,000, according to J. D. Power & Associates, the market research company.
 Chrysler is credited with bringing out the first of the modern minivans in 1983. Over the two decades that followed, every full-line automaker offered at least one minivan. Remember the Chevrolet Lumina APV, the Oldsmobile Silhouette, the Pontiac Trans Sport? These were among the so-called Dustbuster vans from General Motors with front ends that looked like Black and Decker's hand-held vacuums.
 ''From that point forward, things went south,'' said Jeff Schuster, executive director of forecasting for J. D. Power & Associates.
 Ford jettisoned its minivans in 2006, G.M. followed in 2008 and Hyundai dropped its Entourage in 2009.
 In the minivan's peak year, 2000, the segment accounted for 7.2 percent of the industry's sales. By 2009, that share had fallen to 4 percent, and Mr. Schuster is projecting a drop to 3.8 percent this year.
 Still, the companies that remain in the market can do well: there is less competition.
 In addition to the new Sienna, a new Honda Odyssey comes out this fall, and Nissan promises a new Quest early next year. Chrysler has promised ''significant changes'' to its minivans -- the Town & Country and Dodge Grand Caravan -- later this year.
 In addition, Volkswagen sells a Chrysler-based van, the Routan, and Kia offers the Sedona. Mazda no longer sells a full-size minivan, but its Mazda 5 is a smaller van of the type popular in Europe.
 Currently, Chrysler and Dodge account for 42 percent of sales, Honda about 24 percent and Toyota 20 percent.
 Toyota's attempt to increase that share includes the latest in several industry efforts to make minivans seem hip. The company has posted a series of videos on the Internet in which members of the prototypical ''Sienna family'' rap -- with tongues presumably in cheek -- about ''rollin' in my swagger wagon.''

DOUBLE HAPPINESS
 Stories
 By Mary-Beth Hughes
 201 pp. Black Cat/Grove/Atlantic. Paper, $14
 It may be that the hallmark of the modern moment is a certain demi-pleasurable drift -- the timeless unspooling of information and entertainment on the Internet, Twittering, partial employment, life spans getting longer (even as the economy shrinks), no end to the reproductive years, midlife reinventions, TiVo-ing everything, four-day-week job furloughs -- accompanied by a free-floating melancholy. If the last century crashed into the forces of urbanization, fragmentation and world war, this one seems to be on an endless, murmuring skid. Things are . . . O.K. You know. They're O.K. Click, click. There's so much time, at least for some people, but it's filled with doubts about what, exactly, to do. We can often be a bit frictionless, here at the end of the first decade of the new century. When we're not feeling postapocalyptic, we hover, paralyzed by choice and what can seem a lack of final consequences. 
 Mary-Beth Hughes's ''Double Happiness'' is a collection of stories that take place in that hover zone. ''I was the kind of 30-year-old who had only recently left adolescence behind. I was mostly a modern dancer,'' begins ''Pelican Song,'' one of the finest offerings in this delicate, tender array. The story's narrator -- a ''Rubenesque'' woman who works a day job at the concession stand of an art-movie theater in New York and has a boyfriend who's a sickly, slender freshman at Cooper Union -- is also a writer, kind of. She's burdened both by unreliable finances and by a smoldering contempt for ''my mother's smug friends' children,'' who ''were busy working out plans for third babies and second homes.'' 
 Other characters in these stories design hypermodern furniture that looks like ''a tossed handkerchief suspended forever just before descent''; work away for years on books about Basquiat; are oddly sexually disaffected; sometimes move to France; become fathers at 45 (and still feel it's too soon); publish in very small journals with names like Heron's Flap Quarterly; and so on. How are they? They're O.K. You've no doubt seen them, or been them, in the aisles of Whole Foods, choosing among various chutneys. ''At the art-movie theater in the West Village,'' says the mostly modern dancer, ''we took failure for granted.'' But these failures are never especially devastating, never the last word. Both the good and the bad news is that, as in Chekhov's stories, these characters just . . . go on. 
 Hughes is a quietly gorgeous writer, lavishing startling metaphors on her half-lost souls. The eyebrows of a stranger glimpsed on the subway are ''two tiny boomerangs'' fixed ''midflight, above her startled eyes.'' A mother in an ''ivory coat and off-white stretch pants'' looks to her daughter like ''a big wishbone strained to the limit.'' A man's younger mistress is described as having a ''come-hither-no-prisoners face.'' Hughes's tone is often hushed, lending the collection a discreet, old-fashioned quality reminiscent of a restrained writer like Mavis Gallant. 
 Hughes is a master of the elliptical bank shot of information delivery. In the title story, she writes of a group of people who have just lost loved ones in the Sept. 11 attacks and are anxiously awaiting any scrap of news: ''They all knew about the stairwells now.'' Her stories begin like a train already in motion; the reader must trot to get a handhold and swing up. The elegant phrasing, the general hush, the condensation -- all this contributes to a satisfying sense of intimacy. Hughes is incisive, but never contemptuous or dismissive; often her characters stand at the edge of chaos -- a revolution, a scene of violence, the pit where the twin towers used to be -- uncertain of their responsibility but never inured to the pain of others. Rarely is this chaos exactly their fault; but rarely are they able to turn away from it. They're anxious witnesses, never altogether convinced of their own goodness.
 This uneasy, teetering moral quality is what saves the collection from succumbing to the drift in which the characters themselves are engulfed. ''Double Happiness'' is a quiet book, but never a twee one. Hughes likes to juxtapose her characters' relative passivity with the knife edge of evil, either within or, more often, outside them. (She also used this technique, to very good effect, in ''Wavemaker II,'' an intricate psychological novel that featured Roy Cohn as a major character.) The Rubenesque dancer discovers that her mother, a gentle and artsy woman, is probably being beaten by her equally artsy husband, an aspiring writer whose rejection slips translate into bruises on his wife's body. Children become aware of their parents' gluttonous adulteries. Self-satisfied men covertly ruin their mistresses' lives in order to preserve their own deceptive images of themselves. 
 The dirty work gets done, pushing Hughes's characters very close to the point of uncomfortable realizations. ''The Aces,'' about a well-heeled pair whose co-dependent loathsomeness is revealed carefully and subtly, sickens the reader bit by bit with their ever-increasing self-justification -- which culminates, perfectly, in the grift of a first-class airplane seat. We all drift, Hughes demonstrates, over one or another variety of toxic spill. It's up to us whether we look down or not.
 There are a few misses in ''Double Happiness.'' In an already slender collection, several of the stories seem like doodles: an account of a man and woman waiting for their troubled daughter to arrive on a train; a young woman fleeing her ruined parents for an unlikely sojourn in Israel. And one, about a Danish model who finds herself kidnapped during a revolution in Jakarta, is very wide of the mark. Hughes is too intelligent herself to pull off the spectacularly shallow voice of the model, a shiny, pop-culture figure quite unlike the shaggier, far more reserved, ambivalent characters with whom Hughes seems most at home. Screwball tragicomedy isn't her metier. And yet even her less successful stories feature some excellent lines. ''His wife, though her face was stricken on one side, had delighted eyes,'' the captive model remarks, ''even cast down, even shooing me into a corner to wait for the gunfire to die down so we could all crawl out a dirt tunnel to the relative safety of the airport.''
 That almost absurd pause to notice the extraordinary even in an atmosphere of filth and great danger is pure Hughes. One senses that for her, worldly failure is less of a soul-killer than failure to find grace, whenever and wherever it might occur. Hovering in a twittery state of doubt may be part of the modern condition, but overlooking or abandoning even the most fleeting beauty is an especially pernicious modern crime. To fail to be moved is failure indeed. On this point, and on many others, Hughes is compellingly, elegantly, idiosyncratically right.

HEADLINE: A Pendulum Swing Toward Austerity

BYLINE: By TYLER COWEN. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University.

 BODY:
''THE ROAD TO SERFDOM,'' the critique of socialism written 65 years ago by the Nobel laureate economist Friedrich von Hayek, was recently No. 1 in nonfiction sales at Amazon.com. 
 Many people, including the Fox News commentator Glenn Beck, have contended that growth of government power has, indeed, set us on such a road today. But the reality looks different. In many respects, the expansionary phase of big government is coming to an end, and quickly.
 In the last few years, we have seen -- for better or worse -- huge financial bailouts, a $787 billion stimulus plan and legislation for near-universal health insurance coverage. But the policy mood in Washington is now much more modest: no second major stimulus is forthcoming and, in the environmental arena, a cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gas emissions is unlikely to move forward. 
 The financial regulation bill will most likely pass, but it won't fundamentally restructure the American economy. For instance, there is no longer talk of breaking up the big financial institutions, and Simon Johnson, the M.I.T. economist, has described the legislation as a failure. 
 To the extent that the bill limits proprietary trading by American banks -- through the so-called Volcker amendment, named for the former Federal Reserve chairman -- loopholes may enable banks to keep trading through asset management companies.
 The most extreme outcome would be that more financial market trading is pushed out of banks and into hedge funds and other bank competitors. That would matter a lot for bank profits, but American capital markets would perform essentially the same functions as before. The bill we're getting may be a mere hodgepodge, and that is after the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression.
 If any financial policy idea is taking a major place on the American and global stages, it is fiscal austerity. It is not that fiscal conservatives have won a grand battle of ideas, but rather that governments realize that the bills are coming due. In the United States, we face rising health care costs and pension problems in state governments, with no clear long-run solution for bringing the books into balance. 
 That makes responsible politicians reluctant to undertake major new commitments. At the very least, they embrace the rhetoric of fiscal conservatism, even when actual progress toward the ideal is slow. 
 In short, it's not that ideas of government interventionism and free markets are fighting a titanic intellectual struggle. The reality is more mundane. The ascendancy of one view often creates the conditions for an economic counterreaction.
 We've seen such cyclical trends before. During the 1980s and 1990s, history seemed to be on the side of freer markets. Communism staged a mass retreat, China and India embraced economic growth and a wide range of governments adopted privatization. The United States cut marginal tax rates and the Clinton administration promoted free trade and welfare reform. 
 Eventually, things started to go wrong, in part because investors developed too much self-confidence and became complacent about systemic risk. Early cracks in the edifice appeared in the 1990s, during the Mexican and Asian financial crises, but the bigger, broader explosion of 2007 revealed a badly overextended world economy, which led to bailouts. The weak economy brought victory for the Democrats in 2008, which in turn enabled passage of a health care overhaul. 
 Now the pendulum is swinging back. The economy will now likely make Congress much more Republican, as voters overreact to whatever is not working at the moment. 
 The unfolding of the financial crisis has also changed the public's sense of where change is needed, both in the United States and Europe. The tragedies of 2008 were represented by Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers -- both private-sector institutions. In 2010, the financial crisis has spread to sovereign debt, with Greece as the most obvious example. 
 All of these developments are part of one broader story of overreach and complacency. Yet the 2008 crises were attached more directly to market institutions, while the 2010 crises are more closely linked to governments. Because politicians and voters are more influenced by the latest developments than by news from two or three years earlier, a cautious attitude toward public-sector spending has been further cemented. 
 While we can expect a larger public sector in America, the cause is mainly the aging of the population, and it will play itself out over the next 30 years with an increase in government transfer payments, mostly through Medicare. Furthermore, even Professor Hayek favored welfare spending and social insurance, so those programs will not alone bring us to serfdom. 
 DEMOCRACIES, like markets, have some self-correcting mechanisms, and we are now seeing those at work in the United States and many European countries. (Spain and Britain, for example, are pursuing fiscal austerity aggressively.)
 The lessons are straightforward. First, to paraphrase the French moralist La Rochefoucauld, things are never as good, or as bad, as they seem. Second, the Obama reforms, like the Reagan revolution, are turning out to be radically incomplete, which should come as no surprise. 
 Finally, effective political ideas are those that can still do good in half-baked form. We have neglected this insight in designing financial reform, and it remains to be seen if we can apply it successfully to climate change. 
 And when it comes to the budget? Even if our real fiscal problems lie in the more distant future, it's important to start worrying about them now, because we cannot count on a grand plan later to save the day.

HEADLINE: Leader of the Opposition

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SOLOMON

 BODY:
The Israeli security cabinet just voted to ease the three-year blockade on Gaza, in the wake of the tragic naval attack on the Mavi Marmara by Israeli commandos. What does that mean in practical terms? I've heard that the cabinet changed the list to allow more goods to enter. There shouldn't be any limitations on food, but things that can be used for terror cannot be permitted. The reason for the blockade on Gaza was not to punish the Palestinians but to continue to delegitimize Hamas. There is no hope for peace with Hamas, and we need to continue the peace process with the legitimate Palestinian government.
 Many Americans agree Hamas is a disaster, but might Israel do more to show concern for the Palestinian people and the problems they face? I know that there is no humanitarian crisis. 
 Why do you say that? The crossings are open for humanitarian needs. I suggested in the past to put cameras online, on the Internet, for the world to see all the goods entering Gaza Strip. This was my suggestion when I was foreign minister.
 You're the leader of the centrist Kadima Party, which is an opposition party. Yet you don't sound very opposed to the views of the ruling party. On the right of Israel to exist and to defend itself, there is no opposition in Israel.
 Have you met frequently with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the leader of the right-wing Likud party? Netanyahu is my next meeting.
 When does his term expire? About three years from now.
 Do you think he will be pushed out before his term ends, as often happens in Israeli politics? If he does the right thing, he has a future, but in order to do the right thing, he needs to make new decisions, new policy and a completely different coalition. Otherwise the Israelis are going to change the government.
 By ''right thing,'' do you mean he needs to move beyond his longstanding aversion to atwo-state solution? Yes, he said a few months ago that he supported this idea of two nation-states, and now we are at the beginning of the proximity talks. This is going to be tested by decisions, not by words. It's going to be tested in the near future.
 You lost to him in the race for prime minister last year. Will you run again? I will be prime minister. It's about the future of my state.
 Your parents were among the country's founders. They were the first couple to marry in Israel, the very first. Both of them were in the Irgun. They were freedom fighters, and they met while boarding a British train. When the British Mandate was here, they robbed a train to get the money in order to buy weapons.
 It was a more romantic era. Is your mom still alive? No. She died two years ago. A few years ago, when I was interviewed on Israeli television, I said I support the idea of two nation-states. I was afraid that my mother was listening and hoped that she didn't open the TV when I was speaking. But then one day she called me and said: ''Listen, Tzipi. I hear you. It gives me pain. But you need to make decisions about the future of Israel. We didn't establish this state for having just old people living here.''
 That could be a good slogan. Isn't your husband in advertising? My husband is in branding. He brands places -- cities, institutions.
 Do you ever talk to him about improving Israel's image? Yes, of course. I believe Israel needs branding. I want that the word ''Israel'' will relate not just to an Israeli soldier or a camel, but Israel as an advanced liberal society with a strong economy and great people.
 Do your children agree with your politics? They know that what I'm doing is for the sake of their own future. I want to know that when I die I leave them something more than a bank account -- a state to live in, to be proud of.
 Are you dying? It's not part of my plan for now.
 Interview has been condensed and edited.

HEADLINE: Soccer Fever in the City's Immigrant Enclaves

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

 BODY:
On June 11, play began in that international ritual of soccer, barstool debate and workplace underproductivity known as the World Cup. While much of America views the event with faint curiosity, its immigrants follow it with microscopic attention. Below, excerpts of World Cup articles from local ethnic newspapers. KIRK SEMPLE 
 Africa, the World Cup 
 and Heartache 
 The Odabro Restaurant, at 236 South Essex Street in Orange, N.J., is a watering hole for Africans. ...
 According to the proprietor, Mr. Andrew Onyenwenyi, ''I love the fact that the World Cup is being played in Africa. But as a businessman, I want to know what kind of profit is going to be generated for Africa for hosting the World Cup. It is not just having the fame; it is what do we get in return. As for the African teams, I am highly disappointed, except, of course, with Ghana.'' 
 In seeking the answer to what the World Cup really meant for Africa and Africans, it was Mr. Kofi Boateng, the C.O.O. of the World Trade Association, who provided the answer. ''The 2008 Olympic Games,'' said Mr. Boateng, ''was the moment for China to make the official announcement that they have arrived on the world scene, and so it is that the 2010 World Cup is Africa's moment to announce that we have arrived on the world scene as equal partners.''
 CHIKA A. 
 ONYEANI, June 21
 The African Sun Times is a pan-African weekly with a circulation of 45,600, and is published in East Orange, N.J.
 Waiting for Italy 
 ''We believe in them.''
 This was the chant at the Van Westerhout Cittadini Molesi Social Club (447 Court Street in Brooklyn) about the possibility of two World Cup victories by the Azzurri coached by Lippi. The members of this club, which in October will celebrate its 50th anniversary, seem united by an unshakeable trust that this could happen. ... 
 ''To follow the national team together in our circle is a ritual that our Italianness almost demands of us,'' said the treasurer, Giuseppi De Mattia. ''All the complaints that we have sitting at the bar become irrelevant when we sit in front of the TV.''...
 Maybe the average Italian can transcend a feeling of national identity, said Allegrino Sale, the president of the Van Westerhout club, but ''for us emigrants, we are instinctively transported from the moment we are far away. We are proud of our citizenship, rooted in tradition, and our belief is more intense.''
 GIANLUCA 
 TARCAMELIA, June 14
 America Oggi is an Italian-American daily published in Norwood, N.J. It has a circulation of 32,000.
 Making Profits 
 Some Mexican vendors in New York are recording an increase in sales now that many countrymen are acquiring shirts, flags and soccer balls as part of the celebrations of the highly anticipated inaugural game between Mexico and South Africa.
 Anselmo Canedo, owner of a sports clothing and equipment store in Upper Manhattan, said his weekly profits were rising 40 percent compared with recent months now that Mexican fans are so ''excited'' that they ''spare no expense'' in welcoming the World Cup. ...
 ''My workers and I are happy because we are recovering from a difficult economic situation. In the winter we sold almost nothing and often thought about closing the store,'' he said.
 ZAIRA CORTES, June 11
 El Diario de Mexico, which is based in Murray Hill and publishes five days a week, has a circulation of 15,000 in the New York area.

HEADLINE: Amid a Wealth of Farmers' Markets, Marketing

BYLINE: By JAN ELLEN SPIEGEL

 BODY:
COVENTRY
 A half-hour after the Coventry Regional Farmers' Market opened for the season on June 6, the place was packed. Despite a tornado watch and gusty foreboding winds, hundreds if not thousands of shoppers were swarming the dozens of booths at the Nathan Hale Homestead here. And at the organizers' tent near the entrance, a steady stream of people were handing over $25 checks in exchange for colorful heart-shaped pins emblazoned with a cow's hindquarters and the words ''Friend of the Market 2010.''
 The pins entitle the shoppers to discounts or other perks at every market booth all season -- from 50 cents off a quart of strawberries to a free packet of sunflower seeds on this particular day. They also bring the organizers of the Coventry market some semblance of stability: $5,000 in membership fees last summer and loyal customers for the season.
 Innovations like this have become increasingly important in Connecticut, where farmers' markets may have reached their saturation point, vendor fees are maxed out and traditional financing sources like grants and corporate donations have declined. 
 ''It takes kind of that two-by-four over the head,'' said Winter Caplanson, who helped found the Coventry market seven years ago and remains on its working committee. ''We're not getting the same kind of money we were.''
 So Ms. Caplanson came up with Friends of the Market and a business partnership program, both in their third year. Under the partnership, which earned the market $2,000 last year, local businesses pay $100 in exchange for sponsorship recognition on signs and the market's Web site.
 ''As a small businessperson in town, I understand the struggles and how hard it is to get things done,'' said Diane Parsons, a photographer based in Coventry who has been shopping at the market for years, and signed up for the business partnership this year. ''You do need co-marketing with other businesses.''
 This year, the Coventry market is expanding its cooperative marketing efforts with a monthly insider tour. The June tour, on farming without chemicals, was conducted by the executive director of the Connecticut chapter of the Northeast Organic Farming Association. On July 11, Scott Miller, executive chef of Max's Oyster Bar in West Hartford, will explore local cheeses. Heirloom tomatoes will be the subject on Aug. 29.
 The insider's tour is not about direct funding; it's more about good will and loyalty. These are critical components in keeping markets alive, if not flourishing, given their inconvenient hours -- they're usually open only one day a week -- and their prices, which are generally higher than those at farm stands and Community Supported Agriculture programs.
 ''As consumers seek things that are good and authentic and local, it's the back story,'' Ms. Caplanson said. ''Fall in love with the story, fall in love with the product.''
 ''There's a lot more to this,'' she added. ''In the same way people who buy a C.S.A. share say, 'That's my farm; that's the guy who grows my vegetables.' ''
 That sense of ownership is crucial, especially this year, said Rick Macsuga, a marketing representative for the Connecticut Department of Agriculture who oversees farmers' markets. For the first time since the state's local food movement exploded, about six years ago, the number of markets has decreased: There are about 115 this year, down from more than 125 last year. It was a winnowing that Mr. Macsuga had been expecting.
 Markets have run short of vendors as farmers opt for easier economic models like community-supported agriculture, in which they are paid up front, or farm stands right on their property. Some markets have failed after situating themselves too close to one another.
 Market organizers have had to be creative. To boost interest, Coventry allows nonagricultural craft booths, a policy that few other markets embrace, though many hire musicians for entertainment or provide chef demonstrations and other educational perks.
 ''There are well-established areas with successful markets, but they still have to reinvent themselves,'' said Mr. Macsuga, noting that market masters are turning to extensive e-mailing, opening earlier in the year and closing later. To succeed, he said, markets need a diverse selection of high-quality products at competitive prices in a convenient location. And, he said, the farmer had better be there to answer questions from customers.
 He said he thought programs like Friends of the Market would be important sustaining tools. ''It keeps your customer base very loyal,'' he said. ''And membership has its privileges.''
 When and Where
 The Hill-Stead Museum's farmers' market in Farmington, in its second year without the advantage of its opening year grant, opted for Coventry's model for Friends of the Market. Peggy Hall, the market manger, is trying to attract sponsors as well, especially restaurants, and has decided to make last season's ''Dinner on the Hill'' -- an al fresco feast of local food -- an annual fund-raising event; it will be held this year on Sept. 19.
 CitySeed, the nonprofit group that runs four farmers' markets in New Haven, has added a Friends of the Market pilot project to one market this year. And the farmers' market in Lebanon, unusual in that it charges no vendor fees and has a grant from the state agriculture department, has added a $5 V.I.P. program, similar to Friends.
 The Westport market also went with the Coventry model, along with a two-tier business sponsorship program. Lori Cochran Dougall, Westport's new market manager, said her goal was to ''have enough in the bank account to have market start-up money next year.''
 But at the Litchfield Hills Farm-Fresh Market, also part of a nonprofit group, Kay Carroll, lead market master, is not convinced the Coventry model is the way to go. ''Our customers are happy, our vendors are happy,'' she said, noting that her market had many educational components and was always looking for ways to improve.
 ''Bigger isn't necessarily better,'' said Ms. Carroll, who worries that a Friends of the Market-style program might create too much work for vendors. And being busy has its challenges, as Coventry customers found out on opening day.
 ''I'm here for Bridgid's Abbey,'' said Annie Perkins of Mansfield as she arrived at the Cato Corner Cheese booth with her Friends pin and pointed out the posted special: $1 off a pound of Bridgid's Abbey cheese.
 ''We just sold out,'' said Chris Batt, who admitted that it had really taken only 20 minutes.
 ''I don't care,'' Ms. Perkins said with a laugh. ''I'm here because I love this farmers' market. I'm really not here for the deal.'' Still, she had managed several: a free six-pack of marigolds, a free bag of chips from a salsa seller, and $1 off pesto from Bear Pond Farm.
 Less than halfway through the three-hour market, Paul Desrochers, owner of 18th Century Purity Farm in Moosup and Plainfield, was down to 4 quarts of strawberries. He had brought 250 with him (Friends of the Market got a discount).
 ''Friends of the Market is a good deal for the customer,'' Mr. Desrochers said. ''What it does for the market, it gives us a really good amount of cash to do things that we really need to do without charging the vendors for it.''
 Carole Miller of Topmost Herb Farm in Coventry was giving primrose plants to Friends of the Market members. ''I don't think it's about the stuff,'' she said. ''I think it's about talking to the vendors, hearing the stories.''
 Laura Stone of Coventry agreed. ''I guess I could just go and patronize the booths and not give it a further thought,'' she said. ''But there's something about the sense of community, and with community comes participation.''

HEADLINE: After the Storm, a Calm Refuge

BYLINE: By CHERYL JENSEN

 BODY:
CLEVELAND
 AFTER months of bad publicity and a drumbeat of negative news -- including millions of recalled vehicles, investigations of unintended acceleration, embarrassing Congressional hearings and a $16.4 million federal fine for foot-dragging on required safety reports -- Toyota is eager to change the conversation.
 Conveniently, the company has something else to talk about, and it's a comforting family-friendly subject: a new minivan. Specifically, Toyota has introduced a substantially revamped version of its Sienna van for the 2011 model year, and the news on that front is mostly good. The latest Sienna is considerably better than the preceding model in nearly every way, and its improved ride and handling are particularly notable.
 Those who need a first-rate family room on wheels will find it checks off all the must-have boxes. There are five trim levels, two engines, front- or all-wheel-drive configurations, regular or sporty suspensions and a wide range of prices. 
 A 4-cylinder version starts at a budget-friendly $25,060 and is so nicely equipped that a lot of buyers could stop there. For those with nagging concerns about ice and snow, the least expensive Sienna with all-wheel drive is $31,930, and prices top out at a jaw-dropping $45,705. Indeed, Toyota is the only automaker offering a conventional minivan with either a 4-cylinder engine or all-wheel drive.
 There are versions catering to other preferences as well. If the race driver Danica Patrick slows down to become a mother, she can zip her children around in a Sienna SE with a sport suspension. Baby boomer grandparents can spoil their grandchildren (and themselves) with the luxurious XLE or Limited versions.
 Toyota calls the 2011 model the third-generation Sienna, although there are many similarities with the previous one. The V-6 engine is carried over and the van is built on ''roughly'' the same underlying architecture, said David Lee, a product communications specialist.
 The new exterior styling came from Toyota's California design studio. A 6-speed transmission replaces a 5-speed unit. The steering system, formerly hydraulic, is now electric.
 The least expensive Sienna with a V-6 engine is $26,300. I tested a fancier XLE V-6 with all-wheel drive. It came with 18-inch run-flat tires and a Premium Package ($6,225) that included rear-seat entertainment features, a navigation system and a backup camera. That, and a $51 cargo net, ballooned the price to $41,591 from a starting point of $35,315.
 I put the Sienna to the test with a 1,400-mile New Hampshire-to-Ohio round trip that included a visit to Cleveland where two nephews, ages 10 and 13, joined the test crew.
 While fancy gadgets are appreciated by passengers, minivans are all about spacious interiors, accommodating seats and flexible cargo space.
 Seven-passenger Siennas come with two plush captain's chairs in the second row. In 8-passenger versions, a very narrow seat is wedged in between.
 In either version, the second-row seats can move forward or backward as much as 23 inches, providing a lot of space flexibility for the second and third rows. Sliding the second row forward also makes it much easier to climb into the third row. That seat can accommodate three small people or two adults.
 For carrying more gear, the third row folds fairly easily into a well. But even when the third-row seats are being used, the cargo space is 39 cubic feet -- about two and a half times as much as the trunk of a Camry sedan.
 One potentially negative note: the second row cannot be folded flat into the floor as it can in Chrysler minivans with the clever Stow 'n Go feature.
 Like other XLEs with all-wheel drive, my test van had second-row ''lounge seats'' as standard equipment. These have pull-out leg rests -- an ''ottoman feature,'' in Toyota speak -- that turn them into recliners like the ones you may have in your living room. Nephews Adam and Clay scrambled into the back, popped in a DVD, reclined the seatbacks, crossed their arms and became rulers of their own ottoman empires.
 But Toyota is saying that passengers should not use the leg rests while the van is moving, for safety reasons. In a crash, having your legs extended could cause the lap belt to slide up past the hips, concentrating crash forces on the abdomen. Or the shoulder belt could come into contact with the neck, increasing the risk of a neck injury.
 But Mr. Lee says you won't find any cautionary information about the ottoman feature in the Sienna owner's manual. Rather, the warning will be on a tag hanging from the gearshift lever in dealer showrooms.
 As for storage, there are so many trays, bins and compartments that even the messiest among us could become highly organized. Notably there are two glove boxes, including one with two levels and several compartments; a tray on the floor for a purse or briefcase; and a center console with a rear portion that can slide back to make the cup holders more accessible to second-row passengers.
 The V-6 engine is available on all versions and is required with all-wheel drive. This 3.5-liter engine, rated at 266 horsepower and 245 pound-feet of torque, was used in the old Sienna as well as in the Avalon, Camry, Venza, RAV4 and Highlander.
 The new 6-speed automatic transmission always seems to be in the correct gear, matching up so well with the V-6 that it forms a kind of propulsion dream team. With the V-6, there is plenty of power to merge into fast-moving Interstate traffic. In sixth gear, you can cruise at about 65 miles per hour with the engine loafing around 2,000 r.p.m., a boon to fuel economy.
 The Environmental Protection Agency estimates fuel economy for the all-wheel-drive Sienna at 16 m.p.g. in town and 22 on the highway.
 I averaged a little over 21 on the Cleveland trip, which included some hill-climbing in Vermont. The van returned 22 m.p.g. on a separate 200-mile trip on two-lane roads.
 Fuel economy should be higher for the V-6 with front-wheel drive: it is rated 18/24 m.p.g.
 The economy-minded customer may be attracted to the 4-cylinder Sienna, but there is not much to be gained: its mileage estimate is only slightly better than the V-6's (19 m.p.g. in town vs. 18).
 I tested a 4-cylinder Sienna as well. Its 2.7-liter engine, rated at 187 horsepower and 186 pound-feet, can also be found in the Venza and Highlander. It is also paired with the 6-speed automatic.
 Loaded with four adults and their luggage, this Sienna struggled a bit to merge onto Interstates. But it had no trouble keeping up with fellow travelers at speeds of 75 m.p.h. or higher, even on inclines in Vermont. As you might expect, the engine makes more noise, a sort of droning, than the V-6.
 I averaged 23.3 m.p.g. on a 321-mile trip in the Sienna 4-cylinder. On a separate trip on two-lane roads, by myself, the van averaged 26.6 m.p.g.
 The Sienna handles well for a big box on wheels. It rides smoothly on broken-up roads and the body feels solid. In the turns it isn't excessively nose-heavy and is pleasingly responsive. Over all, the driver feels far more connected and confident than with the old Sienna, which sometimes made driving feel like a chore.
 I didn't care for the electric power steering, which seemed too light and too vague. Wind and road noise can intrude a bit, and there is the drumming sound you often hear in an open van interior.
 The Sienna is loaded with air bags, including one for the driver's knees, and safety features like electronic stability control. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety rated it a Top Safety Pick for its performance in crash tests, including rollover protection.
 It seems fair to conclude that the Sienna is the new benchmark for minivans. But that status could be fleeting. Honda will be introducing a new version of the Odyssey this fall, Chrysler is updating its minivans later this year and Nissan will have a new Quest early in 2011.
 Toyota is carefully watching the reception its new Sienna -- the first big car introduction since the troubles earlier this year -- receives in the marketplace. In May, the company's overall sales were up 6.7 percent, but that fell far short of the performance of other major automakers, which had gained 17.5 percent or more.
 And in another sign that bad news has taken a toll, Toyota's ranking plunged in the latest Initial Quality Study by J. D. Power & Associates, to 21st place (out of 33 brands), from sixth a year earlier.
 INSIDE TRACK: A van for all reasons.

HEADLINE: In Spain, Formula One Is Taking Hold, but the Roots Are Not Yet Deep

BYLINE: By BRAD SPURGEON

 BODY:
It is called the European Grand Prix, but the race that takes place this weekend on the street circuit through the Juan Carlos I Marina in Valencia, on the Mediterranean coast of Spain, is actually another Spanish Grand Prix, the second of the year after the one in Barcelona on May 9. 
 This is the one that is trying to cash in on the cachet of the most illustrious of them all, Monaco. It takes place in Spain's third-largest city -- where paella was invented, by the way -- with yachts, clean beaches and interesting cultural attractions like the City of Arts and Sciences. 
 In other words, whereas the other Spanish Grand Prix takes place in a boring country area outside of Barcelona, this race has a touch of glamour. 
 The marina is where, in 2007, the America's Cup yacht race took place in a European city for the first time, and the Formula One race is part of a push by the regional government to bring in more world-class sporting events, like the world indoor athletics championships and the Volvo Ocean Race, both in 2008. 
 Being host to the race may also be seen in the context of Spain's growing momentum in becoming a powerhouse in sports in recent years, as in tennis with Rafael Nadal, in cycling with Miguel Indurain and then Alberto Contador, and in soccer. 
 A decade ago, Spain was a backwater in automobile racing. There were some excellent circuits, but interest and participation was stronger in motorcycle racing than in anything to do with four wheels. 
 Now, the country has three full-time drivers -- one of whom is a double world champion -- a test driver, two Grand Prix races and even its own Formula One team, which goes by the name of Hispania. 
 As recently as in the mid-1990s, about 60 percent of the spectators at the Spanish Grand Prix were foreigners. Now the sport is one of the two most popular in the country, along with soccer, and during winter testing at a race track outside Valencia more than 35,000 spectators showed up just to watch Fernando Alonso, the double world champion, test his new Ferrari racing car for the first time. 
 According to Pedro de la Rosa, a Spaniard who drives for the Sauber team, the depth of the public understanding of this complicated sport has also increased over the years, which he sees as a sign of the growth in the national enthusiasm.
 ''This was something that was missing in Spain,'' he said. ''Now they discuss strategies when they are in the bar, in the pub. They stop me in the streets and they ask, 'Why did you stop on Lap 18 and not on Lap 24? Why didn't you do what Fernando did, stop on Lap 1 in Monaco?'''
 One of the main things that stoked this Formula One fever was a financial boom that has long since deflated. The country contributes only one major sponsor to the series, Banco Santander, which sponsors the Ferrari team, for whom Alonso drives. 
 Contrast this with a country like Germany. Before the mid-1990s Germany had never had a world-champion driver, let alone a race winner. Then Michael Schumacher began winning world titles, in 1994 and 1995, and Germany became a powerhouse in the sport, too, lifted by the popularity the driver created.
 But then the German economy kicked in and contributed major sponsors, from tobacco companies in the early days to telecommunications companies and even the German postal service and, especially, the car manufacturers Mercedes and BMW, although BMW withdrew last year. Several German drivers won races, though only Schumacher won a world title.
 Still today, six of the 24 drivers on the grid are German, four are from Brazil, and Spain has the third-largest number of drivers, with three -- Jaime Alguersuari, at Toro Rosso, is the third.
 But can Spain, without financial contributions, continue such a vital presence in the series? Some feel that it has reached the height of its popularity and what it can contribute. 
 ''I think we are reaching our limit because it is close to football, and I don't think you can be bigger than football,'' de la Rosa said. ''But it's like a plant -- we have to keep putting water on it. And putting water is achieving good results.
 ''We are lucky that Fernando is doing that, but the rest of us are not. So we need to be sure that if he is not there, some of us will be.''
 Others see signs that, as with the economy, the series may now be on a downward arc.
 ''I really believe it has reached its peak,'' said Marc Gene, the Spanish test driver for the Ferrari team, who has a degree in economics. ''There is no money in Spain at the moment. I think it is always going to be at a very healthy level, but my opinion is that it is never going to be healthier than it is at the moment. Maybe as healthy, or maybe slightly less.''
 ''Where you can really see what is going to happen in the future is in karting,'' he said. ''How many licenses, how many drivers there are. That is the mirror of the family economy, where the families can really spend 1,000 per race -- at least, because some spend as many as 5,000 per race -- and the numbers have gone down a little bit.''
 The race in Valencia has been criticized from the outset by local groups claiming that government money is being squandered, and some reports say the rights to hold the race cost $50 million a year. 
 And while it is one of the most unusual and spectacular street circuits on paper, in design it has unfortunately produced uninteresting races in its first two years, because it is difficult to overtake on the circuit.
 Other signs of a difference between the vision and the execution have also appeared.
 The Hispania team was initially supposed to be based in Spain and run by Adrian Campos, a Spaniard who raced briefly in Formula One in the late 1980s. The project fell apart just a month before the start of the season, however, and the team was bought out by Jose Ramon Carabante, a Spanish entrepreneur. It was handed over to Colin Kolles to operate out of his factory in Germany. Kolles has various motor-racing interests and he used to run the Force India team. 
 Kolles said that Hispania was a Spanish team, despite its being based in Germany.
 ''It is a Spanish team the same way Renault is a French team, the same way McLaren is an English team and the same way Mercedes is a German team,'' Kolles said. ''With Mercedes, for example, all the operations and the base are in England. It doesn't make the team English -- it's a German team. Same with Renault. Renault is French, they operate from England. 
 ''This is 100 percent a Spanish team, at the moment they operate from Germany -- this is the only way it could be managed.''
 Even so, the team is having a difficult time finding major sponsors in Spain. Indeed, with Banco Santander and Alonso at the Ferrari team, what large Spanish company would want to sponsor a team that so far has failed to score points, has two non-Spanish drivers -- Bruno Senna of Brazil and Karun Chandhok of India -- and currently is stuck in the next to last position in the championship.
 The main thrust of Formula One's popularity in Spain remains Alonso's successful career. He started racing in Formula One in 2001, but it was only in 2003, when he began scoring pole positions and winning races, that the country began to take notice. 
 Gene said it was not possible to make a better mix than that of Ferrari and this particular Spanish driver. ''Alonso plus Ferrari is a huge thing,'' he said. ''It's putting two very charismatic concepts together -- the driver and the team. There used to always be Ferrari fans in Spain, but now there are very many more.''
 That support offers its own form of self-perpetuating success, as it pushes a driver to achieve ever better results -- which can in turn feed the popularity of the sport.
 ''Racing at home is always special,'' Alonso said. ''When you arrive at the next corner you are 100 percent because you know all the people are expecting a lot from you. So this gives you a very high motivation. Friday, Saturday and Sunday your concentration is very high and so at the end of the weekend it is a positive atmosphere. Not extra pressure, but extra motivation.''
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: How Many Graduates Can Be No. 1? Ask the 30 Valedictorians

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
There will be no valedictory speech at Jericho High School's graduation on Sunday. With seven seniors laying claim to the title by compiling A-plus averages, no one wanted to sit through a solid half-hour of inspirational quotations and sappy memories. 
 Instead, the seven will perform a 10-minute skit titled ''2010: A Jericho Odyssey,'' about their collective experience at this high-achieving Long Island high school, finishing up with 30 seconds each to say a few words to their classmates and families.
 ''When did we start saying that we should limit the honors so only one person gets the glory?'' asked Joe Prisinzano, the Jericho principal. 
 In top suburban schools across the country, the valedictorian, a beloved tradition, is rapidly losing its singular meaning as administrators dispense the title to every straight-A student rather than try to choose the best among them. 
 Principals say that recognizing multiple valedictorians reduces pressure and competition among students, and is a more equitable way to honor achievement, particularly when No. 1 and No. 5 may be separated by only the smallest fraction of a grade from sophomore science. But some scholars and parents have criticized the swelling valedictorian ranks as yet another symptom of rampant grade inflation, with teachers reluctant to jeopardize the best and brightest's chances of admission to top-tier colleges.
 ''It's honor inflation,'' said Chris Healy, an associate professor at Furman University, who said that celebrating so many students as the best could leave them ill prepared for competition in college and beyond. ''I think it's a bad idea if you're No. 26 and you're valedictorian. In the real world, you do get ranked.''
 Not, though, at graduation from Stratford High School in the suburbs of Houston, which accorded its 30 valedictorians -- about 6.5 percent of the class -- gold honor cords. Nor at Cherry Hill High School East in southern New Jersey, which has revised its graduation tradition, picking a speaker among this year's nine co-valedictorians by lottery and printing speeches from the others in the program. 
 In Colorado, eight high schools in the St. Vrain Valley district crowned 94 valedictorians, which the local newspaper, The Longmont Times-Call, complained in an editorial ''stretches the definition.'' And north of New York City, Harrison High School is phasing out the title, and on Friday declared 13 of its 221 graduates ''summa cum laude.''
 William R. Fitzsimmons, the dean of admissions at Harvard, said he had heard of schools with more than 100 valedictorians, and had seen home-schooled students praised as No. 1 -- out of one -- all of which has helped render the distinction meaningless.
 ''I think, honestly, it's a bit of an anachronism,'' he said. ''This has been a long tradition, but in the world of college admissions, it makes no real difference.''
 Even some principals who have named multiple valedictorians acknowledge that the honor no longer carries the same weight.
 ''If you've got one in a population of 500, it has special significance,'' said John O'Breza, the principal of Cherry Hill East. ''When you have 9, 10 or 30 in a population of 500, the numbers speak for themselves. The more rare it is, the more distinguished.''
 Still, being tapped as valedictorian resonates deeply. ''I feel like as long as you reach that point, it doesn't matter how many you have,'' said Yvette Leung, one of the Jericho seven, who is bound for Harvard. ''To be named valedictorian is an honor and a testament to how hard we've tried.'' 
 The word valedictorian -- Latin for ''farewell sayer''-- appears as early as 1759 in the diary of the Rev. Edward Holyoke, then president of Harvard College. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines it as ''the student usually having the highest rank in a graduating class who delivers the valedictory address at the commencement exercises.''
 School officials contend that there are more valedictorians than ever before because the frenzy over college admissions has made students more serious about grades and has spurred them to load up on advanced courses beginning in freshman year. In addition, some schools have adjusted their formulas to give more students a shot at the top spot by counting more courses toward the grade-point average, or limiting the weight given to any one particular subject.
 Don Haddad, the superintendent of the valedictorian-laden St. Vrain Valley district, where all 94 honored seniors earned a cumulative G.P.A. of at least 4.0, said his schools had simply produced stronger students with more rigorous coursework in early grades. ''We have not lowered the bar to achieve more valedictorians,'' he said. ''More kids now are getting over the bar.''
 Santa Monica High School in California recognized all 23 students with a 4.0 G.P.A. this year as ''valedictorian candidates'' and displayed their pictures at the entrance to the cafeteria. But for graduation, the school winnowed that pool to two valedictorians and one salutatorian by giving extra points for advanced placement, honors and college courses. As the principal put it, ''If we had 23 speeches along with everything else, we'd still be graduating right now.''
 Jericho selects its valedictorians through a formula that does not distinguish between honors and nonhonors courses, with the result that any student who earns all A-pluses all four years automatically receives the honor. The most valedictorians previously was four, in 2008; last year, there was one. Henry L. Grishman, the Jericho superintendent, said there were no plans to move to a weighted formula that could break, say, a seven-way tie for valedictorian because ''it levels the playing field to say a course is a course is a course'' and encourages students to focus on learning rather than competing. The district does not rank students.
 This year's co-valedictorians -- all friends since middle school -- are an illustrious group. Ms. Leung just returned from meeting President Obama as a presidential scholar. Brandon Li, who is headed to Yale, invented a water filtration system for third world countries. Four of the seven placed in international research competitions.
 Mr. Prisinzano, the principal -- himself valedictorian of his upstate New York high school in 1994 -- said Jericho's co-valedictorians had spent more than 20 hours developing and rehearsing their graduation skit over the past two weeks. There is no star: everyone has about the same amount of speaking time.
 Jeremy Feinstein, who plans to study engineering at Cornell, said he was surprised to learn that he was one of seven valedictorians. ''I've never even heard of more than one or two,'' he said. ''Then I thought, 'They worked as hard as I did and they deserve it as much as I do.' They're all great people.''
 Anyway, he added, ''I wouldn't know what to do with 10 minutes on the podium.''

FAITH AND POWER
 Religion and Politics in the Middle East
 By Bernard Lewis
 208 pp. Oxford University Press. $24.95
 MUHAMMAD AND THE BELIEVERS
 At the Origins of Islam
 By Fred M. Donner
 Illustrated. 280 pp. The Belknap Press/Harvard University Press. $25.95
 In the United States, a country saturated with instant punditry, serious scholars rarely attain celebrity as public intellectuals. Yet Bernard Lewis, a professor emeritus of Near Eastern studies at Princeton, has long radiated influence far beyond his specialization in Ottoman studies. A friend of Henry Kissinger and a mentor to subsequent cohorts of conservative policy makers, Lewis arguably has done more than any Mideast expert to mold American attitudes to the region.
 His latest book, ''Faith and Power,'' a collection of essays, lectures and speeches from the past two decades loosely linked to the theme of relations between Islam and the state, reminds us why. Lewis is a fine writer, with a commanding authorial voice that sweeps magisterially across the ages. His linkage of diverting historical anecdotes to pressing current issues and his skill at contracting complex ideas into clever apothegms do much to explain his appeal to politicians in search of a punchy quote. 
 Here, for instance, is Lewis contrasting political structures at home and abroad: ''In America one uses money to buy power, while in the Middle East one uses power to acquire money.'' Even a subject as vexed as the search for Arab-Israeli peace boils down to this satisfyingly pithy formula: ''If the conflict is about the size of Israel, then long and difficult negotiations can eventually resolve the problem. But if the conflict is about the existence of Israel, then serious negotiation is impossible.''
 Such distillations can be salutary, but may also prove dangerously reductionist. Take Lewis's remark that democracies do not make war, and dictatorships do not make peace. This glib elaboration of a neoconservative mantra is easily challenged. The strongmen who ran Grenada, Panama and Iraq may have been bad guys, but there is no disputing that it was the United States that attacked them, not the other way around. The Egyptian dictator Anwar Sadat made peace with Israel, not the democratically elected Hamas party.
 Yet Lewis blithely hoists his rhetoric to even more contentious heights. Like Nazi Germany and Communist Russia, he asserts, Middle Eastern dictators need war to justify their tyranny. This means peace will come only with their collapse or their defeat. In other words, democracies must clobber every dictator. And that's not all. Giving a more specific nudge to policy makers, Lewis pretends to have discerned ''deep roots'' of democratic traditions in Iraq and Iran, of all places. Democracy might easily prevail there, he opines, and inspire others in the region, ''given the chance.''
 It might be argued that it is hardly Lewis's fault if some in the Bush administration took such expert advice a little too literally. Yet Lewis himself makes his intentions pretty clear in another essay: ''Either we bring them freedom, or they destroy us.''
 The quaintly missionary idea of ''bringing freedom'' to benighted peoples may simply betray Lewis's age: he was born in England in 1916, in the already waning glory of the British Empire. But the shrill alarmism jars with his repute as a historian whose most notable contribution has been to chronicle the relative decline of Islam in the past three centuries. It is a fair judgment to say that the four-fifths of the world's people who are not Muslim appear in no immediate or even distant danger of extinction at the point of a scimitar.
 If it were only the present that Lewis perceived through a gently distorted mirror, this might not detract from his distinction as a historian. But he gets the past subtly wrong, too, often by omitting vital context. He says that when the Arabs rejected the partition of Palestine in 1947, it was simply because they refused to accept having a Jewish state next door. Yet Arabs were not alone in questioning the United Nations plan to allocate 56 percent of Palestine's territory to a minority consisting mostly of recent immigrants, which made up barely a third of the population and owned just 7 percent of the land. Greece, India and Cuba, among others, also voted no, while China, Ethiopia, Colombia, Chile and Mexico abstained. The overriding motive of all these doubters was presumably not bigotry, as Lewis implies, but concern about Palestinians' rights.
 Modern history may not be Lewis's forte. Yet even regarding older eras, his views sometimes seem at odds with those of another distinguished historian. Fred M. Donner is a professor of Near Eastern history at the University of Chicago. His new book, ''Muhammad and the Believers,'' is a learned and brilliantly original, yet concise and accessible study of Islam's formative first century.
 Western historians have tended to ascribe the astonishing success of the new faith to external factors, like economic and political conditions in seventh-century Arabia. Donner persuasively returns the faith itself to centrality. Equally convincing is his well-documented assertion that Islam, at its origins, was rather different from the religion later understood by either its practitioners or by non-Muslims.
 This more sophisticated reading of history explains Islam not as a static doctrine, but as one that evolved from an ecumenical, syncretic, pietist and millenarian cult into a more dogmatic and exclusivist faith. In contrast to Lewis, who depicts Islam as aggressive from the start, Donner shows that contemporary followers of other religions initially, and perhaps even for several generations, regarded Islam as an open-minded and not specially threatening movement with universalist aspirations. A Nestorian Christian patriarch writing to a bishop in A.D. 647 testified not only that his new Muslim rulers were peaceable, but also that they honored priests and bestowed monasteries with gifts. An Armenian bishop recorded around A.D. 660 that the first governor of Muslim Jerusalem was Jewish.
 The documentary evidence suggests that the term ''Muslim'' came into common use only in the eighth century. The earlier word, ''Believers,'' described a community that embraced many faiths.
 gain in contrast to Lewis, Donner shows that while the theocratic leanings of Islam make it seem different from other monotheistic faiths today, at the beginning they merely perpetuated the models of the contemporary great powers, Christian Byzantium and Sasanian Persia. Over time, as Donner shows, doctrinal and dynastic divisions among the Muslims created a need to enforce orthodoxy, rendering Islam more distinct from other faiths and hardening its boundaries.
 Indeed, it was Muslim historians themselves, writing only after this process was well under way, who began to portray Islam as having been doctrinally rigid from the start. The Muslim triumphalism that Lewis discerns, it seems, was largely introduced in retrospect, to explain the seemingly miraculous spread of the faith as a result of heavenly favor. Donner's explanation of the process by which Muslims came to define themselves is both fascinating and enlightening. Surely, this kind of subtle understanding of how history works comes closer to the truth than Lewis's lapidary pronouncements from on high.

STILL ON CALL
 By Richard Stern
 240 pp. The University of Michigan Press. Paper, $25.95
 In a long literary career, the Chicago writer Richard Stern has published eight novels, several highly acclaimed. But he has also dabbled in a genre he calls ''orderly miscellany.'' ''Still on Call,'' his sixth such book, is a grab bag of essays, reflections, lectures, blog posts and assorted scribblings that has the fragmented, meandering structure from which such collections often suffer.
 There are gems here that sparkle, like this one about the death of the economist Milton Friedman, Stern's colleague at the University of Chicago: ''Death, like a novelist, assembles the contacts and associations one has had with the dead person and then makes some sense out of what had been more or less incidental encounters.'' Or this, about the contrast between friends and professional acquaintances: ''The difference is that between the special dinner plates brought out for occasions and the good familiar plates off which one eats every day.'' And here is his perceptive bouquet for John Updike: 
 ''Has there ever been anyone who wrote more interestingly, if, at times, excessively, about more things: the American way of packaging, the hysteria of ideology, the charms of Doris Day, the look, smell and feel of genitalia, a mother's failure as a writer, children's anger, the breakup of marriage, Emerson's essays, the cold war, '89 Toyotas, Ted Williams, zippers, the Masters golf tournament, the cello . . . ?'' 
 But to find these gems the reader has to wade through observations that seem dashed off, self-indulgent ruminations about often trivial matters. The book includes disconnected blog posts that Stern wrote for The New Republic between 2006 and 2009, some on barely remembered dust-ups. (One provocative exception: his description of Condoleezza Rice, whose charm, ''sheer delight in the elegance of power'' and ''complex devotion to the president and his family fused in a conscience deeply formed by racial insult and injury,'' and made for ''the kind of character she has read about in the pages of her favorite Dostoyevsky.'') 
 There is no coherent theme to carry a reader along and make up for momentary lapses of interest. While scattered thoughts could have been tolerated with a writer like Saul Bellow (Stern's longtime friend), whose every foible and quirk seems to excite curiosity, Stern has not drawn that kind of attention. Indeed, this book sometimes gives the impression of having been written by Bellow's marvelous Hamlet-like creation, Herzog, a man of ideas who writes letters into the void to rail against life's letdowns. 
 Stern, now 82, seems to anticipate this criticism in the preface, where he tells us that he is tempted to say ''this is an old man's book,'' a ''geriatric self-inoculation'' aimed at eliciting a charitable reading. There are unremarkable, touristy journals from his visits to Rwanda and Afghanistan that shed little light on the troubles of those lands. Too many observations are responses to a reading of The New York Times and not drawn from lived experience -- or, to use a word Stern favors, from ''actualities.'' Or they are familiar, like his musing on the pleasures of using credit cards to create the illusion one is not really paying. 
 But there are vivid departures, including a bracing recollection of the Chicago literary scene in the mid-1950s after Stern arrived to teach literature. He gives sharp glimpses of writers he invited to speak -- John Berryman, Flannery O'Connor, Ralph Ellison -- and a wonderful thumbnail of a dinner flirtation between Nelson Algren and Lillian Hellman. 
 And he recalls a teacher at Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan -- ''a thin, dour, elegant fellow who sported a handkerchief in the breast pocket of his blue suit'' -- who complimented the teenage Stern's essay about Pearl Harbor. ''Our teachers were people of dignity and intellect; their words had scriptural weight,'' Stern writes. ''A key turned in the lock of a door I hadn't even noticed.'' 
 Then we know we are back in the hands of a masterly writer.

HEADLINE: On Finance Bill, Lobbying Shifts To Regulations

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Well before Congress reached agreement on the details of its financial overhaul legislation, industry lobbyists and consumer advocates started preparing for the next battle: influencing the creation of several hundred new rules and regulations.
 The bill, completed early Friday and expected to come up for a final vote this week, is basically a 2,000-page missive to federal agencies, instructing regulators to address subjects ranging from derivatives trading to document retention. But it is notably short on specifics, giving regulators significant power to determine its impact -- and giving partisans on both sides a second chance to influence the outcome.
 The much-debated prohibition on banks investing their own money, for example, leaves it up to regulators to set the exact boundaries. Lobbyists for Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and other large banks already are pressing to exclude some kinds of lucrative trading from that definition.
 Regulators are charged with deciding how much money banks have to set aside against unexpected losses, so the Financial Services Roundtable, which represents large financial companies, and other banking groups have been making a case to the regulators that squeezing too hard would hurt the economy. 
 Consumer groups, meanwhile, are mobilizing to make sure that regulators deliver on promised protections for borrowers and investors. They worry that the shift from Capitol Hill to the offices of regulators could put the groups at a disadvantage. 
 ''It's out of the public eye, so a natural advantage that we benefit from -- public outrage -- we lose that a little,'' said Cristina Martin Firvida, a lobbyist for AARP, which advocates for older Americans. ''We know there's still a lot here left to do.''
 The legislation is intended to expand federal oversight of the financial industry to police risks to the broader economy and to protect consumers of financial products. It would also impose federal regulations for the first time on the trading of derivatives, the complex financial instruments that can be used to make large bets. But Brett P. Barragate, a partner in the financial institutions practice at the law firm Jones Day, estimated that Congress had fixed in place no more than 25 percent of the details of that vast expansion.
 ''Congress is doing this in broad strokes,'' said Scott Talbott, a lobbyist for the Financial Services Roundtable. ''Where the rubber meets the road is the regulatory process.''
 President Obama hopes to sign the bill into law by the Fourth of July. In his weekly address on Saturday, Mr. Obama said, ''I urge Congress to take us over the finish line, and send me a reform bill I can sign into law, so we can empower our people with consumer protections, and help prevent a financial crisis like this from ever happening again.''
 His signature will start the clock on dozens of deadlines embedded in the legislation for regulators from a host of agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to make those decisions. 
 Interest groups have been preparing for months. When the Consumer Bankers Association convened its annual meeting in early June, there was still plenty of time to lobby Congress. But the group's president, Richard Hunt, told his board that the group should shift its focus to the rule-making process. The board voted to increase the group's budget and staff.
 ''Now we hope to have a good give and take with the regulators on the best interests of the consumer and the industry,'' said Mr. Hunt.
 Shaping regulations is a different game than shaping legislation. Political considerations carry less weight. Instead, regulators crave data that can be used to justify decisions.
 Consider the new restrictions on the fees that merchants must pay to banks when customers swipe debit cards. The Nilson Report, a trade publication, estimated that last year, those fees averaged 1.63 percent of the transaction amount.
 The legislation directs the Federal Reserve to cap those fees at a level that is ''reasonable and proportional'' to the cost of processing transactions. It gives the Fed nine months to gather data and decide.
 Trade groups for retailers, which want a lower cap, and banks, which want a higher one, are standing by to weigh in. 
 ''We have the data ready and we have the right people ready to go to the Fed, and we've had an ongoing dialogue with the Fed,'' said John Emling, a lobbyist for the Retail Industry Leaders Association.
 The debit card regulations are unusual, however, in pitting the interests of two industries against each other. Many more of the new regulations pit the interests of consumer groups against financial companies.
 Historically, industry groups have dominated these information wars, plying regulators with exhaustive studies and detailed analyses of the options at hand. Trade groups have more money and more people, and they often produce and control the relevant information about their business and customers.
 Seeking an equalizer, the AARP decided several months ago to begin preparing research that could be presented to regulators on several parts of the bill that it favored. The group was gambling that the provisions -- like a requirement that investment brokers act in the interest of their clients -- would end up in the final bill. 
 ''We took a risk,'' said Ms. Firvida, the group's government affairs director for financial issues. ''Success will depend on how much quality information is in front of the rule makers.''
 The legislation would hand consumer groups a series of important victories, most notably the creation of a consumer protection bureau inside the Federal Reserve. But Ms. Firvida and others said there could be a sharp distinction between the authorities granted by the legislation and the results.
 Affected companies are nervous as well and are banding together. In the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis, trade groups lost members as banks cut back on spending. That trend has now reversed. The Consumer Bankers Association has added seven members in recent months, bringing its total to 60. 
 Mr. Hunt, the group's president, said its role was expanding in direct response to the plan to create the consumer protection bureau, which would focus on regulating his membership.
 ''The entire financial services industry understands that what happens in Washington affects them,'' he said. ''It's something other industries found out many years ago, and we're finding it out now.'' 
 In a recent letter to the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, the American Bankers Association estimated that banks had been hit with 50 new or expanded federal regulations in the last two years. A single example, the credit card bill that passed Congress last year, landed on the desks of bankers as 252 pages of new regulations.
 And that count does not include the impact of the new legislation. ''It's a massive compliance burden,'' said Edward L. Yingling, the group's president. ''And there is going to be massive uncertainty in the financial industry about how all of this will play out.''
 One clear consequence is a surge in the demand for lawyers with expertise in financial regulation, particularly those who have worked for regulatory agencies. Most of the major trade groups are hiring lawyers. The major banks say they are employing more, too.
 ''I don't know that there has been a bill that has touched as many different substantive areas as this one,'' said A. Patrick Doyle, a partner at Arnold & Porter who has worked on financial issues for three decades. ''Clearly there's going to be a lot of work.'' 
 The surge in hiring has sent a joke bouncing around Washington: Congress finally passed a jobs bill -- full employment for lawyers.

HEADLINE: A World on the Move

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE

 BODY:
GORDON BROWN'S rant about a ''bigoted'' voter sped his exit from the British prime minister's post. What punctured his cool? Her complaint about immigrants. When an earthquake shattered Haiti, Dominicans sent soldiers and Americans sent ships -- to discourage potential immigrants. The congressman who shouted ''You lie!'' at President Obama was upset about immigrants. ''Birthers'' think Mr. Obama is an immigrant. 
 There was also the Hamas rocket that landed in Israel this spring, killing a farmworker. Not so unusual, except that the worker was Thai. 
Perhaps no force in modern life is as omnipresent yet overlooked as global migration, that vehicle of creative destruction that is reordering ever more of the world. Overlooked? A skeptic may well question the statement, given how often the topic makes news and how divisive the news can be. After all, Arizona's campaign against illegal immigrants, codified in an April law, set off high-decibel debates from Melbourne to Madrid. But migration also shapes the landscape beneath the seemingly unrelated events of the headlines. It is a story-behind-the-story, a complicating tide, in issues as diverse as school bond fights and efforts to isolate Iran. (Seeking allies in Latin America this month, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton had to emphasize the dangers of a nuclear-armed Tehran while fending off complaints about the Arizona law.)
 Even people who study migration for a living struggle to fully grasp its effects. ''Politically, socially, economically, culturally -- migration bubbles up everywhere,'' James F. Hollifield, a political scientist at Southern Methodist University, said. ''We often don't recognize it.''
 What prompted Google to close an office in China, rather than accept government censorship? Many factors, no doubt. But among those cited by Sergey Brin, Google's co-founder, was the repression his family suffered during his childhood in the Soviet Union before they immigrated to the United States.
 One realm where migration has particularly powerful if largely unstated effects is school finance. Political scientists have found that white voters are more likely to oppose spending plans when they perceive the main beneficiaries to be children of immigrants (especially illegal immigrants). The outcome, of course, affects all children, immigrant or 10th generation.
 ''When you get increased diversity, you weaken support for the common good,'' said Dowell Myers, a demographer at the University of Southern California.
 Professor Myers studied Proposition 55, a 2004 ballot initiative in California that sought $12.3 billion in bond sales to relieve overcrowding and upgrade older schools. Publicly, most opponents framed their concerns in economic terms, saying the government wasted money and ran unsustainable debts. Still, anger about illegal immigration was, as one opponent put it, the ''elephant in the living room.'' School crowding, he wrote in a letter to The Riverside Press Enterprise, was ''solely caused by America's foolish open-borders policy.''
 Holding all else equal (like other political views), Professor Myers found, voters who saw immigration as a burden were nearly 9 percentage points more likely to oppose the measure than those who called immigration a benefit. ''That's a big effect -- it was almost enough to take it down,'' he said. The measure squeaked through, with barely 50 percent of the vote.
 Immigration also quickened the bitter split in the American labor movement. In 2005, a half dozen unions left the venerable A.F.L.-C.I.O. to form a rival federation, Change to Win. (The dissident unions included the Service Employees International Union and UniteHere.)
 On the surface, the fight was mostly about the pace of organizing, with the breakaway group pledging more aggressive moves to enlist members. But the dissidents also counted more low-wage immigrants in their membership. 
 As Daniel B. Cornfield, a labor scholar at Vanderbilt University, said, the immigrants' marginal (and sometimes illegal) status created a constituency for a more aggressive approach. ''I don't think it was a split about immigration, but immigration shaped the split,'' he said.
 The split, in turn, has had repercussions beyond the labor movement. Janice Fine, a political scientist at Rutgers University, noted that the Change to Win unions played an important (some have argued decisive) role in the early stages of Mr. Obama's presidential campaign. 
 ''If they were inside the larger bureaucracy, it would have been harder for them to make an early endorsement and move money his way,'' Professor Fine said.
 Theorists sometimes call the movement of people the third wave of globalization, after the movement of goods (trade) and the movement of money (finance) that began in the previous century. But trade and finance follow global norms and are governed by global institutions: the World Trade Organization, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund. There is no parallel group with ''migration'' in its name. The most personal and perilous form of movement is the most unregulated. States make (and often ignore) their own rules, deciding who can come, how long they stay, and what rights they enjoy.
 While global trade and finance are disruptive -- some would argue as much as migration -- they are disruptive in less visible ways. A shirt made in Mexico can cost an American worker his job. A worker from Mexico might move next door, send his children to public school and need to be spoken to in Spanish.
 One reason migration seems so potent is that it arose unexpectedly. As recently as the 1970s, immigration seemed of such little importance that the United States Census Bureau decided to stop asking people where their parents were born. Now, a quarter of the residents of the United States under 18 are immigrants or immigrants' children.
 The United Nations estimates that there are 214 million migrants across the globe, an increase of about 37 percent in two decades. Their ranks grew by 41 percent in Europe and 80 percent in North America. ''There's more mobility at this moment than at any time in world history,'' said Gary P. Freeman, a political scientist at the University of Texas.
 The most famous source countries in Europe -- Ireland, Italy, Greece, Spain -- are suddenly migrant destinations, with Ireland electing a Nigerian-born man as its first black mayor in 2007.
 As heirs to an immigrant past, Americans may have an edge in a migrants' age. As contentious as the issue is here, the Americans' capacity to absorb immigrants remains the envy of many Europeans (including those not inclined to envy Americans). Still, today's challenges differ from those of the (mythologized) past. At least five differences set this age apart and amplify migration's effects.
 First is migration's global reach. The movements of the 19th century were mostly trans-Atlantic. Now, Nepalis staff Korean factories and Mongolians do scut work in Prague. Persian Gulf economies would collapse without armies of guest workers. Even within the United States, immigrants are spread across dozens of ''new gateways'' unaccustomed to them, from Orlando to Salt Lake City.
 A second distinguishing trait is the money involved, which not only sustains the families left behind but props up national economies. Migrants sent home $317 billion last year -- three times the world's total foreign aid. In at least seven countries, remittances account for more than a quarter of the gross domestic product.
 A third factor that increases migration's impact is its feminization: Nearly half of the world's migrants are now women, and many have left children behind. Their emergence as breadwinners is altering family dynamics across the developing world. Migration empowers some, but imperils others, with sex trafficking now a global concern.
 Technology introduces a fourth break from the past: The huddled masses reached Ellis Island without cellphones or Webcams. Now a nanny in Manhattan can talk to her child in Zacatecas, vote in Mexican elections and watch Mexican television shows.
 ''Transnationalism'' is a comfort but also a concern for those who think it impedes integration. In the age of global jihad, it may also be a security threat. The Pakistani immigrant who pleaded guilty last week to the attempted bombing of Times Square said that jihadi lectures reached him from Yemen, via the Internet.
 At least one other trait amplifies the impact of modern migration: The expectation that governments will control it. In America for most of the 19th century, there was no legal barrier to entry. The issue was contentious, but the government attracted little blame. Now Western governments are expected to keep trade and tourism flowing and respect ethnic rights while sealing borders as vast as the Arizona desert and the Mediterranean Sea. Their failures -- glaring if perhaps inevitable -- weaken the broader faith in federal competence.
 ''It basically tells people that government cannot do its job,'' said Demetri Papademetriou, a co-founder of the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington research group. ''It creates the anti-government rhetoric we see, and the anger people are feeling.''
 Still, rich, aging countries need workers. People in poor countries need jobs. And the rise in global inequality means that migrants have more than ever to gain by landing work abroad. Migration networks are hard to shut down. Even the worst economy in 70 years has only slowed, not stopped, the growth in migration. And it is likely to grow, in numbers and consequence.
 When scholars get to feeling expansive, they call today's migration networks a challenge to the order set by the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, which established the territorial sovereignty of the nation-state. Judging by the wall rising along the Mexican border, nation-states do not appear to be going away. Their people, increasingly, do.

HEADLINE: At Summit Talks, Obama Lacks Strong Hand on Stimulus

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
TORONTO -- Despite President Obama's pitch at the summit meeting for developed nations here for continued stimulus measures to prevent another global economic downturn, the United States will go along with other leaders who are more concerned about rising debt and join in a commitment to cut their governments' deficits in half by 2013, administration officials said on Saturday. 
 That goal is the proposal of Stephen Harper, the prime minister of Canada and the host of the two-day Group of 20 summit of developed nations. Mr. Harper wanted it to be part of the communique on global economic policy that the group adopts before concluding on Sunday, and he had the support of European leaders, including David Cameron, the new prime minister of Britain, who has proposed the most ambitious austerity plan of spending cuts and tax increases in his country in a half-century.
Mr. Cameron and Mr. Obama, in their first private meeting since Mr. Cameron took office, acknowledged their different approaches toward balancing the need to promote greater economic growth and job creation in the short term with the long-term desire to reduce national debts, which reached dangerous heights during the downturn. But they downplayed those differences. 
 Mr. Obama said the two leaders were bound to have different approaches given their country's separate budget outlooks; Britain's debt is bigger than that of the United States, measured against the size of their respective economies. ''But we are aiming at the same direction, which is long-term sustainable growth that puts people to work,'' Mr. Obama said.
 Mr. Cameron added, ''Those countries that have big deficit problems like ours have to take action in order to keep that level of confidence in the economy which is absolutely vital to growth.'' He joked that he could not afford to pay for the helicopter ride that Mr. Obama had given him Saturday from the isolated site of the Group of 8 talks to the subsequent G-20 session in Toronto.
 The separate approaches represented by Mr. Obama and Mr. Cameron reflected the splintering that is occurring within the G-20 as the global economy recovers, if haltingly, amid some fears of another recession. In three previous summit meetings since the financial and economic crisis began in 2008, the Group of 20 has coordinated on stimulus measures, banking regulations and anti-protectionist measures.
 The Obama administration did have allies at the summit in opposing rapid moves to withdraw governments' stimulus measures. The Brazilian finance minister, Guido Mantega, told reporters that the debt-reduction targets could compromise economic growth and would be ''too draconian'' for certain countries to meet. ''It is clear that we need to cut, but at what speed?'' he asked. Japan has also taken a position more closely aligned with the United States'. 
 Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner emphasized the American position again Saturday as he arrived here for the beginning of the G-20 talks. Speaking to reporters, he said that for all the progress the G-20 countries had made since late 2008, ''the scars of this crisis are still with us.''
 Trying to bridge the differences among leaders here, he said: ''Our challenge, as the G-20, is to act together to strengthen the prospects for growth. This will require different strategies in different countries. We are coming out of the crisis at different speeds.''
 Mr. Obama came to the summit table this weekend with a strong hand to press his case to foreign leaders for tougher banking regulations, after Congress agreed to a far-reaching overhaul of the American regulatory system. But he was hindered in his effort to persuade other governments to keep stimulating their economies.
 Even as Congress allowed Mr. Obama to pack the big victory on banking regulation as he left for the Group of 20 summit talks, the Senate separately dealt him a significant setback that no doubt resonated with the foreign leaders here pushing fiscal austerity: Democratic leaders shelved an economic stimulus package of aid for the long-term unemployed and financially squeezed states, along with assorted tax cuts. 
 The setback underscored the difficulty Mr. Obama has had in making the case for stimulus. At home as abroad, Mr. Obama is confronting the limits of the consensus that took hold after the economic crisis began in 2008, which favored bigger deficits to spur job creation. At stake, as the administration sees it, is continued global recovery or a relapse into another recession. 
 Yet even within Mr. Obama's administration there are fault lines on how much additional stimulus is desirable.
 Some news reports in recent days suggested that Peter R. Orszag, the budget director who recently announced that he would be leaving in late July, was resigning partly out of frustration that he had lost the argument for deeper and quicker reductions in projected deficits. Advisers and associates of Mr. Orszag insist that is not so, however, and Mr. Orszag was moved to address the issue late Friday in his blog on the Web site of the Office of Management and Budget.
 Saying that ''it was simply time for me to move on,'' Mr. Orszag recounted the deficit-reduction steps that Mr. Obama has proposed: a three-year freeze after this fiscal year for nonsecurity domestic appropriations, $1 trillion in reductions over the coming decade and a bipartisan fiscal commission -- a priority of Mr. Orszag's -- that will try to make recommendations, with a Dec. 1 target, for reducing the debt. 
 ''The president has made it clear to his economic team that he is seriously committed to tackling our fiscal problems,'' Mr. Orszag wrote.
 Indeed, Mr. Orszag has complained to associates that the debate over job creation versus deficit reduction is a false one; the only disagreement is over timing. In advance of the G-20, Mr. Geithner, who is closer in his thinking to Mr. Orszag, and Lawrence H. Summers, the director of the White House National Economic Council, and a proponent of more short-term stimulus measures, co-wrote an op-ed column in The Wall Street Journal to project a united front on the issue.
 ''We must demonstrate a commitment to reducing long-term deficits, but not at the price of short-term growth,'' they wrote. ''Without growth now, deficits will rise further and undermine future growth.''
 European countries generally are running annual deficits of about 6 percent of the size of their economies -- twice as large as the limit that the European Union tries to enforce. Even before Mr. Cameron took action in London, Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, and Nicolas Sarkozy, the president of France, had begun turning from stimulus to immediate deficit reductions.
 Mr. Harper of Canada on Friday praised Mr. Cameron for his austerity initiative, saying it was the sort of fiscal constraint the rest of the G-20 nations should adopt. On Saturday, an adviser said Mr. Harper was lobbying the other leaders to commit to fully implement ''existing'' stimulus plans -- suggesting no additional spending or tax cut measures -- and to cut their annual deficits in half by 2013 and put them on a downward trajectory after 2016.
 That is a more ambitious and constrictive path than the one Mr. Obama has proposed as the goal of his fiscal commission. He has proposed that the United States cut its annual deficit to 3 percent of the gross domestic product by fiscal year 2015.

HEADLINE: At Kagan Hearings, the Topic May Be Obama and Roberts

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- At Supreme Court confirmation hearings, the nominee is usually the star. But Elena Kagan may well be a supporting player in a drama featuring two men not even there: President Obama and Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.
 With an eye on the midterm elections, Democrats will use Ms. Kagan's hearings, which begin Monday, to put the Roberts court on trial by painting it as beholden to corporate America. 
 Republicans will put Mr. Obama on trial over what they view as his Big Government agenda, and will raise questions about whether Ms. Kagan, his solicitor general and former dean of Harvard Law School, is independent enough to keep that agenda in check.
 ''This debate and what it says about President Obama will be part of the discussion, frankly,'' said Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee. Americans, he said, ''are not happy with the expanding power of the federal government'' and want judges to ''say no to the federal government when it overreaches.'' 
 The confrontation -- a clash over the size and scope of government and the proper role of judges in American society -- is hardly academic. Already, state attorneys general are pursuing legal challenges to Mr. Obama's landmark health care bill, an issue that could wind up before Ms. Kagan if she is confirmed. 
 In Ms. Kagan, Democrats see an intellectual heavyweight who can counter Chief Justice Roberts and other conservatives on the court. Leading up to the hearings, Democrats have been ticking off a litany of what Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the Judiciary Committee chairman, calls ''wrong-headed decisions'' in cases like Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which lifted limits on corporate campaign spending, and Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, a suit alleging sex discrimination in salary that was thrown out by the court.
 Mr. Obama set the stage for the debate when, shortly before nominating Ms. Kagan, he accused the Roberts court of a brand of conservative judicial activism. Democrats are echoing that language; Mr. Leahy, for instance, complained of a ''conservative activist majority'' in the court when he previewed the hearings for reporters last week.
 Caught in the middle of the debate is Ms. Kagan who at 50 would be the youngest member and third woman on the current court if confirmed. In the seven weeks since Mr. Obama nominated her to replace the retiring Justice John Paul Stevens, Americans have come to know her as an ambitious overachiever and a product of Manhattan's liberal Upper West Side and elite Ivy League institutions.
 Now, after courtesy calls to 62 senators and a period of enforced silence, Ms. Kagan will have a chance to reframe that narrative and reintroduce herself to the country. She will use it, White House officials said, to remind Americans that her past is humble and to present herself, in the words of Mr. Obama's senior adviser David Axelrod, as a woman who subscribes to ''the notion that everyone, no matter their station in life, rich or poor, gets a fair shot'' before the court.
 ''It's not a rags-to-riches story'' of the sort that characterized Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Mr. Axelrod said. ''But her grandparents were immigrants who came here for freedom and opportunity. Her mother was a public school teacher. Her father was a tenant lawyer. They had a strong sense of what American legal traditions and the Constitution mean, and that was passed on to her.''
 But while Ms. Kagan's biography may be clear, her judicial philosophy is not. She has never been a judge, and despite the release of 160,000 pages of records from her tenure as an adviser to former President Bill Clinton and her memorandums as a clerk for Justice Thurgood Marshall, experts said senators had few clues to her judicial philosophy, a subject that will be ripe for exploration when the hearings begin.
 ''We certainly don't know what sort of justice she's going to become,'' said Dennis Hutchinson, a law professor and Supreme Court historian at the University of Chicago. ''She may be the second coming of Thurgood Marshall; she may be the first coming of Elena the moderate. That may not come out in all the questioning, but it is a huge difference.''
 The debate will play against a polarized midterm election where Democrats are expected to lose seats. Although Ms. Kagan is almost certain to be confirmed, and her nomination will hardly supersede issues like the economy and jobs, Republicans see the court fight as a way to energize their base, especially conservative Tea Party activists disenchanted with Mr. Obama.
 Republicans will use the Clinton documents to press Ms. Kagan on her views on the hot issues of the day -- gun rights, same-sex marriage and the procedure opponents call partial-birth abortion, among them -- and will also question her on her decision, while dean at Harvard, to briefly bar military recruiters from using law school facilities. They will also remind her of her own words in a 1995 book review, when she denounced confirmation hearings as a ''vapid and hollow charade'' and called for nominees to be more forthcoming.
 It is unlikely that Ms. Kagan will follow her own advice, although people close to the White House said they did expect she might answer questions more fully than past candidates. Bob Bauer, the White House counsel, promised ''illuminating testimony,'' but said she would decline to answer questions about internal deliberations involving cases she has prepared as solicitor general.
 One clue to Ms. Kagan's thinking will come in her answer to the inevitable question about the umpire analogy articulated by Chief Justice Roberts, who at his own hearings famously declared, ''It's my job to call balls and strikes, not to pitch or bat.'' (Democrats complain that he has departed from this standard with rulings like Citizens United, which overturned years of precedent.) 
 Republicans hold up the Roberts standard as one Ms. Kagan must embrace to win their support. ''It's a powerful, correct description of what a judge does,'' Mr. Sessions said.
 But it is not the description Mr. Obama uses. When he nominated Ms. Kagan, he called her someone who understands the law ''as it affects the lives of ordinary people.'' The phrase was a new twist on an idea Mr. Obama used last year when he nominated Justice Sotomayor and argued that judges must show empathy.
 In the starkest terms, said Ed Whelan, the president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative research organization here, the Kagan hearings may come down to the standards for judging set forth by the president and the chief justice. It will be, Mr. Whelan said, ''the battle between the empathy standard and the umpire analogy.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Keeps Command Of Military In Seoul

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN and JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
TORONTO -- In his strongest move against North Korea since the sinking of a South Korean warship, President Obama said Saturday that the United States would retain control of all military forces in the South during any conflict on the Korean Peninsula. 
 North Korea has been widely blamed for the attack on the ship in March that killed 46 sailors. 
 The announcement was an apparent attempt to signal to the North, which has long wanted American forces off the peninsula, that the United States would remain firmly in control of military operations if war were to break out. 
 The decision is somewhat symbolic; the United States was not slated to give up wartime control of South Korean troops until 2012, and the new deadline is just three years later. But it allowed Washington and Seoul to take some action after months of struggling for ways to punish the North -- and try to deter it from further violence -- without provoking the country's erratic leader, Kim Jong-il, to launch new attacks. 
 ''There have to be consequences for such irresponsible behavior on the international stage,'' Mr. Obama said Saturday during a news conference with President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea on the sidelines of an economic conference of world leaders. 
 The difficulty of taking action against the North was underscored earlier in the day when the leaders of the world's largest industrialized economies and Russia -- the so-called Group of 8 -- condemned the sinking of the South Korean vessel, the Cheonan, without explicitly blaming North Korea. An investigation by South Korea and investigators from several other countries firmly placed responsibility for the attack on North Korea, but neither China nor Russia has embraced that conclusion. China is not part of the G-8, but is a dominant force in the G-20. 
 The G-8 said in a communique, ''We support the Republic of Korea in its efforts to seek accountability for the Cheonan incident.''
 Mr. Obama also met Saturday with President Hu Jintao of China, and the White House announced after the meeting that Mr. Hu had accepted an invitation for a state visit. The news came just days after China said it would allow greater flexibility in the value of its currency, defusing one of the greatest sources of tension between Beijing and Washington.
 In addition, Mr. Obama vowed Saturday to seek Congressional ratification for a long-stalled free-trade agreement with South Korea -- a possibly risky political move that could please businesses but upset unions and their allies in Congress.
 In an apparent attempt to satisfy those groups, the administration said that, in exchange for pushing the trade deal forward, Mr. Obama would ask the South to drop restrictions on auto and beef imports; the restrictions have been particularly unpopular with unions. 
 The decision to seek approval of the trade agreement was a victory for the White House economic team, and the chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, who supported it over the misgivings of Mr. Obama's political advisers, who worry about angering allies in the labor movement in the months before the midterm elections.
 President George W. Bush's administration negotiated the agreement in June 2007, but Congress has not acted on it, nor has the Obama administration pressed the issue until now. 
 ''President Obama's leadership in breaking down barriers to commerce couldn't come at a better time,'' said Vikram S. Pandit, the chief executive of Citigroup, who leads a coalition of businesses that have urged ratification of the agreement. He said that the agreement ''should lead to increased trade and investments, driving growth and job creation to fuel our economic recovery.'' 
 Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, the powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said that the agreement as negotiated by the Bush administration ''does not effectively address the regulatory and tax barriers that have led to one-way trade and hurt our industrial sector as well as kept out our beef.'' 
 Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, the top Republican on the committee, said he welcomed the decision. ''I hope that this process will provide us an opportunity to address market access for autos and beef and increase the value of the trading relationship,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The 36 Hours That Shook Washington

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
THE moment he pulled the trigger, there was near-universal agreement that President Obama had done the inevitable thing, the right thing and, best of all, the bold thing. But before we get carried away with relief and elation, let's not forget what we saw in the tense 36 hours that fell between late Monday night, when word spread of Rolling Stone's blockbuster article, and high noon Wednesday, when Obama MacArthured his general. That frenzied interlude revealed much about the state of Washington, the Afghanistan war and the Obama presidency -- little of it cheering and none of it resolved by the ingenious replacement of Gen. Stanley McChrystal with Gen. David Petraeus, the only militarily and politically bullet-proof alternative.
 What we saw was this: 1) Much of the Beltway establishment was blindsided by Michael Hastings's scoop, an impressive feat of journalism by a Washington outsider who seemed to know more about what was going on in Washington than most insiders did; 2) Obama's failure to fire McChrystal months ago for both his arrogance and incompetence was a grievous mistake that illuminates a wider management shortfall at the White House; 3) The present strategy has produced no progress in this nearly nine-year-old war, even as the monthly coalition body count has just reached a new high. 
 If we and the president don't absorb these revelations and learn from them, the salutary effects of the drama's denouement, however triumphant for Obama in the short run, will be for naught.
 There were few laughs in the 36 hours of tumult, but Jon Stewart captured them with a montage of cable-news talking heads expressing repeated shock that an interloper from a rock 'n' roll magazine could gain access to the war command and induce it to speak with self-immolating candor. Politico theorized that Hastings had pulled off his impertinent coup because he was a freelance journalist rather than a beat reporter, and so could risk ''burning bridges by publishing many of McChrystal's remarks.'' 
 That sentence was edited out of the article -- in a routine updating, said Politico -- after the blogger Andrew Sullivan highlighted it as a devastating indictment of a Washington media elite too cozy with and protective of its sources to report the unvarnished news. In any event, Politico had the big picture right. It's the Hastings-esque outsiders with no fear of burning bridges who have often uncovered the epochal stories missed by those with high-level access. Woodward and Bernstein were young local reporters, nowhere near the White House beat, when they cracked Watergate. Seymour Hersh was a freelancer when he broke My Lai. It was uncelebrated reporters in Knight Ridder's Washington bureau, not journalistic stars courted by Scooter and Wolfowitz, who mined low-level agency hands to challenge the ''slam-dunk'' W.M.D. intelligence in the run-up to Iraq.
 Symbolically enough, Hastings was reporting his McChrystal story abroad just as Beltway media heavies and their most bold-faced subjects were dressing up for the annual White House correspondents' dinner. Rolling Stone has never bought a table or thrown an afterparty for that bacchanal, and it has not even had a Washington bureau since the mid-1970s. Yet the magazine has not only chronicled the McChrystal implosion -- and relentlessly tracked the administration's connections to the ''vampire squid'' of Goldman Sachs -- but has also exposed the shoddy management of the Obama Interior Department. As it happens, the issue of Rolling Stone with the Hastings story also contains a second installment of Tim Dickinson's devastating dissection of the Ken Salazar cohort, this time detailing how its lax regulation could soon lead to an even uglier repeat of the Gulf of Mexico fiasco when BP and Shell commence offshore drilling in the Arctic Ocean.
 The Interior Department follies will end promptly only if Obama has learned the lessons of the attenuated McChrystal debacle. Lesson No. 1 should be to revisit some of his initial hiring decisions. The general's significant role in the Pentagon's politically motivated cover-up of Pat Tillman's friendly-fire death in 2004 should have been disqualifying from the start. The official investigation into that scandal -- finding that McChrystal peddled ''inaccurate and misleading assertions'' -- was unambiguous and damning.
 Once made the top commander in Afghanistan, the general was kept on long past his expiration date. He should have been cashiered after he took his first public shot at Joe Biden during a London speaking appearance last October. That's when McChrystal said he would not support the vice president's more limited war strategy, should the president choose it over his own. According to Jonathan Alter in his book ''The Promise,'' McChrystal's London remarks also disclosed information from a C.I.A. report that the general ''had no authority to declassify.'' These weren't his only offenses. McChrystal had gone on a showboating personal publicity tour that culminated with ''60 Minutes'' -- even as his own histrionic Afghanistan recommendation somehow leaked to Bob Woodward, disrupting Obama's war deliberations. The president was livid, Alter writes, but McChrystal was spared because of a White House consensus that he was naive, not ''out of control.''
 We now know, thanks to Hastings, that the general was out of control and the White House was naive. The price has been huge. The McChrystal cadre's utter distaste for its civilian colleagues on the war team was an ipso facto death sentence for the general's signature counterinsurgency strategy. You can't engage in nation building without civilian partnership. As Rachel Maddow said last week of McChrystal, ''the guy who was promoting and leading the counterinsurgency strategy has shown by his actions that even he doesn't believe in it.'' 
 This fundamental contradiction helps explain some of the war's failures under McChrystal's aborted command, including the inability to hold Marja (pop. 60,000), which he had vowed to secure in pure counterinsurgency fashion by rolling out a civilian ''government in a box'' after troops cleared it of the Taliban. Such is the general's contempt for leadership outside his orbit that it extends even to our allies. The Hastings article opens with McChrystal mocking the French at a time when every ally's every troop is a precious, dwindling commodity in Afghanistan.
 In the 36 hours between the Rolling Stone bombshell and McChrystal's firing, some perennial war cheerleaders in the Beltway establishment, including the editorial page of The Washington Post and Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution, did rally to the general's defense and implored Obama to keep him in place. George Stephanopoulos, reflecting a certain strain of received Beltway wisdom, warned on ABC that the president risked looking ''thin-skinned and petulant'' if he fired McChrystal. 
 But none of the general's defenders had an argument for him or the war beyond staying the course, poor as the results have been. What McChrystal's supporters most seemed to admire was his uniquely strong relationship with Hamid Karzai, our Afghanistan puppet. As if to prove the point, Karzai was the most visible lobbyist for McChrystal's survival last week. He was matched by his corrupt half-brother, the reported opium kingpin Ahmed Wali Karzai, who chimed in to publicly declare McChrystal ''honest.'' Was Rod Blagojevich unavailable as a character witness? 
 You have to wonder whether McChrystal's defenders in Washington even read Hastings's article past its inflammatory opening anecdotes. If so, they would have discovered that the day before the Marja offensive, the general's good pal Hamid Karzai kept him waiting for hours so he could finish a nap before signing off on the biggest military operation of the year. Poor McChrystal was reduced to begging another official to wake the sleeping president so he could get on with the show.
 The war, supported by a steadily declining minority of Americans, has no chance of regaining public favor unless President Obama can explain why American blood and treasure should be at the mercy of this napping Afghan president. Karzai stole an election, can't provide a government in or out of a box, and has in recent months threatened to defect to the Taliban and accused American forces of staging rocket attacks on his national peace conference. Until last week, Obama's only real ally in making his case was public apathy. Next to unemployment and the oil spill, Karzai and Afghanistan were but ticks on our body politic, even as the casualty toll passed 1,000. As a senior McChrystal adviser presciently told Hastings, ''If Americans pulled back and started paying attention to this war, it would become even less popular.''
 To appreciate how shielded Americans have been from Afghanistan, revisit Rahm Emanuel's appearance last Sunday morning on ''This Week,'' just before the McChrystal firestorm erupted. Trying to put a positive spin on the war, the president's chief of staff said that the Afghans were at long last meeting their army and police quotas. Technically that's true; the numbers are up. But in that same day's Washington Post, a correspondent in Kandahar reported that the Afghan forces there are poorly equipped, corrupt, directionless and infiltrated by Taliban sympathizers and spies. Kandahar (pop. 1 million) is supposed to be the site of the next major American offensive. 
 The gaping discrepancy between Emanuel's upbeat assessment and the reality on the ground went unremarked because absolutely no one was paying attention. Everyone is now. That, at least, gives us reason to hope that the president's first bold move to extricate America from the graveyard of empires won't be his last.

CRISIS ECONOMICS
 A Crash Course in the Future of Finance
 By Nouriel Roubini and Stephen Mihm
 353 pp. The Penguin Press. $27.95
 In late March, the former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan told Al Hunt of Bloomberg Television that the financial crisis had been a ''once in a century'' shocker. ''We all misjudged the risks involved,'' Greenspan said. ''Everybody missed it -- academia, the Federal Reserve, all regulators.'' 
 Well, not everyone. A number of prominent scholars warned long before the meltdown of 2008 that something awful was approaching. Greenspan and his successor, Ben Bernanke, chose to ignore the alarms. 
 One of the most articulate pessimists was Nouriel Roubini, nicknamed Dr. Doom by the news media. Roubini, a professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University, told an audience of fellow economists at the International Monetary Fund as early as Sept. 7, 2006, that the United States faced a catastrophic housing bust, a crash in the market for mortgage-backed securities, the collapse of major investment banks and a deep recession. Most listeners seemed ''skeptical, even dismissive,'' Stephen Mihm reported in The New York Times Magazine. The moderator of the event joked, ''I think perhaps we will need a stiff drink after that.'' 
 Now Roubini is taking his victory lap. Writing with Mihm, an associate professor of history at the University of Georgia and the author of that admiring August 2008 Times Magazine profile, Roubini clearly relishes an I-told-you-so opportunity in his book ''Crisis Economics: A Crash Course in the Future of Finance.'' Why shouldn't he? Readers hungry for more of the professor's grim analysis will appreciate his erudition. Even people who aren't finance buffs ought to read and heed his words.
 To his credit, Roubini doesn't merely recount how right he was. After a brisk recap of Wall Street's scariest hours since the Great Depression, he turns to the question of the moment: how to prevent such debacles in the future?
 That's no graduate school exam question. As I write this, the United States Congress is trying to iron out kinks in a broad financial regulatory reform bill. Sadly, lawmakers have been debating halfway measures whose inadequacy becomes all the more striking in comparison with Roubini's bracing agenda. His ideas aren't all politically feasible, but that doesn't make them any less sensible. 
 Roubini begins with an indisputable paradox. The government's emergency rescue plan -- the distasteful but necessary Wall Street bailouts and deficit-enlarging stimulus spending -- staved off global depression and brought about a dramatic stock market recovery. It also drained whatever fleeting political will existed to rein in Wall Street in a serious way. The surviving megabanks have brazenly paid out record bonuses, even though they owe their very survival to taxpayer largess. 
 Let's start with those fingernails-on-the-blackboard bonuses. Roubini notes that the main problem isn't their size, grating as that may be. The real trouble is that investment bank traders are paid huge bonuses for making reckless bets that yield short-term returns. They aren't penalized when their gambling ultimately costs their employers money (or drives the firms out of business). This leads to a casino culture lacking common-sense caution. One potential remedy: put bonuses into a pool held in escrow for several years. If a trader's record proves solid, he or she gets a payout. If not, the bonuses are nullified. Greater prudence would kick in, and, not coincidentally, overall compensation would shrink. 
 Only government could impose across-the-board pay reform. Since Wall Street would have collapsed without the taxpayer-financed rescue, Roubini says, Congress should have mandated a bonus-escrow system as a condition of the bailouts. Mesmerized by Wall Street campaign dollars and terrified of being branded ''socialists,'' lawmakers never seriously considered the idea. It didn't help that President Obama surrounded himself with bank-friendly economic advisers like Lawrence Summers and Timothy Geithner.
 The sorry performance of the three major private credit-rating agencies -- Standard & Poor's, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings -- played a critical role in the financial mess. Over and over, they stamped AAA ratings on the sausage-like securities made up of poisonous minced mortgages. Congress has debated imposing modest new requirements that the rating agencies make their operations more transparent. Roubini demands more drastic action. He would have government end the tradition of the sausage-making investment bankers paying the raters for their grades, a whopping conflict of interest if ever there was one. Roubini recommends that the agencies should be limited to accepting pay from investors in securities. Further, he urges a smart deregulatory move: removal of the agencies' certification by the Securities and Exchange Commission as ''nationally recognized statistical rating organizations.'' This publicly blessed oligopoly, intended to maintain high standards, has only inhibited competition that would bring down the price of security-rating services. 
 Lawmakers have been debating provisions that would shed some additional light on the opaque market in derivatives. Those are the voluminous Wall Street deals that were supposed to dilute risk by spreading it but instead contributed to a risk epidemic. Heck, Roubini writes, let's just identify the most dangerous ones and ban the suckers. He nominates credit default swaps, the quasi-insurance policies sold by American International Group, among others, which paid off when designated bonds went bad. Since we don't allow people to insure their neighbors' houses against fire, for fear of encouraging arson, why allow traders to bet on bonds blowing up? We shouldn't.
 Eliminating all bad loans will never happen. Since banks will always make mistakes, Roubini argues, they should be required to retain more capital and maintain higher levels of liquid assets (cash and securities that can be sold quickly). The legislation under consideration by Congress would authorize regulators to stiffen capital and liquidity rules. But the legislation would leave it to regulators to provide specific numbers. Roubini wouldn't give the civil servants so much discretion. 
 Capital requirements are connected to Roubini's most radical suggestion. He would force financial conglomerates to retain capital relative to all the risks posed by their various units. ''This requirement would reduce leverage and, by extension, profits,'' he writes. ''Ideally, sending the message that bigger isn't better would lead these firms to break themselves up.'' 
 That's right, break themselves up. Unfortunately, the implicit assumption that some banks have grown ''too big to fail'' has become explicit. Roubini maintains that we should pressure the biggest of them to contract, until they're small enough that their demise wouldn't bring down the rest of Wall Street. 
 With the federal safety net removed, an organization like Citigroup would act more prudently. Repeatedly rescued by the government since the Great Depression, Citigroup shouldn't continue in its current unmanageable form, Roubini asserts. ''Any bank that needs that much help doesn't deserve to exist.'' If Citigroup's board of directors doesn't share this view, the N.Y.U. economist advocates legislation that would authorize regulators ''to break up banks and other financial institutions that are so large, leveraged and interconnected that their collapse would pose a danger to the entire financial system.'' The plutocrats might well perk up and do the job themselves.
 Dr. Doom operates far beyond the horizon of what most experts consider plausible. Based on his track record, we would be wise to catch up to him.

HEADLINE: Joint Chiefs Chairman, in Afghanistan, Reassures Leaders and Troops

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- With the American-led military mission temporarily a ship without a captain, the nation's top admiral spent Saturday in this land-locked war zone reassuring Afghan leaders and allied troops that Washington would not pause in pressing forward its strategy -- one that will require enhanced cooperation between civilian and military officials.
 ''The leadership has changed, but the policy hasn't changed,'' said Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ''The strategy hasn't changed. And we are very much committed to it.'' 
 Admiral Mullen arrived in Kabul, the Afghan capital, at a tumultuous moment: the top commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, was fired by President Obama last week after publication of comments in Rolling Stone by the general and his staff that disparaged senior civilian officials; and the war effort is hindered by rising violence and a frustratingly slow pace of political and economic progress required to attract appeal to a war-weary population.
 Admiral Mullen's agenda included private talks with the most senior level of the Afghan leadership, including President Hamid Karzai and Defense Minister Abdul Rahim Wardak.
 But as Mr. Obama himself acknowledged in a textured statement delivered when he relieved General McChrystal of command, the entire national security team -- civilian and military -- must now come together and work in greater accord.
 ''That is a mandate for the leadership,'' Admiral Mullen told gatherings of military officers and American embassy personnel. ''If we don't make this happen, we are going to fail.''
 And he bluntly warned, ''We do not have the luxury of time.''
 To aggressively press that agenda of enhanced civilian-military cooperation, Admiral Mullen met with the United States ambassador in Kabul, Karl W. Eikenberry, a retired three-star general who had well-publicized disputes with General McChrystal, as well as with Mark Sedwill, the British diplomat who serves as NATO's senior civilian representative here.
 Mr. Sedwill offered an assessment of optimism for the effort now under way, but tempered it with an acknowledgment of past missteps in the fight against the insurgency.
 ''I don't think we've regained the initiative yet, but we've arrested their initiative,'' he said. ''In the south, we are taking the fight to them. But that takes time to see.''
 Admiral Mullen also had an encounter with another senior member of the administration's national security team -- the sort of meeting possible only in the rarefied atmosphere of high-level government travel -- when he crossed paths in Brussels with Richard C. Holbrooke, the special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, who had been a target of negative comments from the McChrystal team.
 That meeting occurred when Admiral Mullen's Air Force jet stopped to refuel en route to Kabul. Mr. Holbrooke came bounding up the stairs, as his plane, too, was refueling in Brussels on its way home from Pakistan.
 The two huddled at length in private.
 In Kabul, Admiral Mullen delivered a special message of encouragement to military officers who had served under General McChrystal.
 ''They are going to be a down group,'' Admiral Mullen said in an interview. ''Any time you lose a commander, particularly one you care so much about, it crushes you.''
 But he told senior military officers that General McChrystal would want them focusing on the mission, not on his abrupt departure from command. And he told the officers to carry away with them the correct example from the controversy leading to General McChrystal's firing.
 He repeated two themes: the military must remain steadfast in its respect for civilian control of the armed forces, and the military must continue to engage with news organizations.
 ''We need to tell our story,'' Admiral Mullen said. ''We must not shy from engagement. We must not overcompensate.''
 Admiral Mullen told military officers that he had paid a private, personal visit to the Washington home of General McChrystal and his wife after the announcement of the general's firing.
 Mr. Obama nominated Gen. David H. Petraeus, the former Iraq commander who is now in charge of American troops in the Middle East, to take over the mission in Afghanistan. He is scheduled to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday for a confirmation hearing set at an accelerated pace.
 Admiral Mullen emphasized that General Petraeus, who was deeply involved in developing the current counterinsurgency strategy for Afghanistan, would be able to take over command in a seamless transition.

THE DEVIL'S CASINO
 Friendship, Betrayal, and the High-Stakes Games Played Inside Lehman Brothers
 By Vicky Ward
 Illustrated. 270 pp. John Wiley & Sons. $27.95
 The fall of Lehman Brothers, the 158-year-old firm bankrupted by its hubris and perilous mortgage bets, was one of the defining episodes of the 2008 financial crisis. Its chief executive, Richard S. Fuld Jr., became overnight, in the words of Vicky Ward, ''a poster boy for the naked avarice of Wall Street.''
 But Dick Fuld is only a shadowy presence in ''The Devil's Casino''; instead, in reporting on the tumultuous demise of Lehman Brothers, Ward has decided to concentrate on four friends who operated just below Fuld in the Lehman hierarchy. 
 These four -- nicknamed the Ponderosa Boys, after the 1960s television show ''Bonanza'' -- carpooled into Manhattan and treadmilled together at the gym. It was their friendship that built a kind of golden era for the firm in the 1980s and '90s. Eventually, however, it was the Ponderosa Boys' betrayals and infighting that weakened the bank; Lehman was unable to cope when catastrophe struck.
 Ward's hero is T. Christopher Pettit. A Vietnam veteran, ''a prince of a man,'' he would become Fuld's second in command, corralling the Lehman troops for his remote boss, fighting to preserve the firm's name and culture, until even he was spoiled by success and money. Pettit died in 1997, and Ward's description of the funeral is telling: ''Many of the Lehman people . . . went back to the city in their separate limos, back to their separate intrigues. Some left Pettit in the ground that day; some never forgot him.''
 Joseph M. Gregory -- ''a man as nervous as he was voluble, lithe, with long hair, huge glasses and rope bracelets'' -- comes across as the villain here. He would climb to become president in 2004. In Ward's telling, Gregory culled able staff members, blocked successors to Fuld and promoted his own favorites as he beat the drum for greater risk-taking.
 ''The Devil's Casino,'' well researched, chatty, lively, sets itself up as a successor to ''Greed and Glory on Wall Street,'' Ken Auletta's 1986 book about Lehman. But the cliches of business articles are too frequent here: standing ovations on the trading floor, the rich wife's shoe collection and so on. There are too many names and points of view. One wishes Ward, a contributing editor at Vanity Fair, had stuck with her hero, Pettit, and told his story alone. But then that would have ignored the financial crisis, which serves as Gregory's delicious comeuppance.
 Still, as she charts the rivalries of life on Wall Street, Ward entertains with rich detail: the rough-edged Fuld taking elocution lessons and copying the nail-clipping habits of a smoother senior whose job he desires; Henry Kissinger at a board meeting, stirring his iced tea with a pencil.
 Ward shows that more than two decades ago, Lehman was developing dodgy habits that would cause trouble later. For example, it used a secret cash cushion known as ''Dick's reserve'' to polish its results at the end of each quarter.
 The book skillfully depicts the lives lived in the background of great clashing events. And it also hints at what Wall Street has become since the crisis, at the apparent dominance of two survivors, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase.
 Ward ends the story before this year's revelations of the accounting sleight of hand that helped Lehman conceal $50 billion in debt from investors right at the end of its life. Since then have come charges against Goldman Sachs over the products it was selling during the subprime boom. In one wacky final scene, though, Ward contacts Pettit's spirit, who talks ominously of ''creative accounting.'' It's as if her hero, even from the grave, were suggesting we all have more to learn about who exactly did what during those crazy years Ward charts so well.

HEADLINE: Equality: What a Liberal Court Should Be

BYLINE: By NOAH FELDMAN. 
Noah Feldman, a contributing writer, is a professor at Harvard Law School. His new book, ''Scorpions: The Battles and Triumphs of F.D.R.'s Great Supreme Court Justices,'' will be published in the fall.

 BODY:
I.THE CRISIS
 After decades of stagnation, progressive constitutional thought is reaching a crisis point. Consider that the two great ''liberal'' justices who retired from the Supreme Court most recently -- David Souter in the spring of 2009 and John Paul Stevens a year later -- were conservatives. Not only were both appointed by Republican presidents, but both also subscribed loosely to the adage ''If it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' With a handful of exceptions, neither favored identifying new constitutional rights where none existed before. Their status as liberals came from the fact that, as the court on which they served tilted to the right, they held their ground as moderate Republicans, consistently voting to sustain the constitutional rights that were discovered by the Supreme Court before they were on it. To be sure, without their votes, the liberal constitutional legacy of the period stretching roughly from Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 to Roe v. Wade in 1973 would have been reversed. But Souter and Stevens were not independent forces for progressive change in American life. 
To a great extent, the crisis of liberal thought on the Supreme Court is a result of liberalism's success. From the time that Franklin Roosevelt's appointees came to form a majority on the Supreme Court until the appointees of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan came to predominate, liberal constitutional thinking had two major objectives -- both of which it largely achieved. First, it sought to give bite to the 14th Amendment's promise to extend to all persons the equal protection of laws. The Brown decision voiding racial segregation in schools as unconstitutional was the most famous piece of the court's push for equality. The same ideal was also encompassed in holdings that demanded ''one person, one vote'' and -- more controversially -- that upheld affirmative action as consistent with the values of the Constitution.
 Second, the liberal Supreme Court interpreted the constitutional promise of liberty as a guarantee of individual autonomy -- the freedom to make important life decisions without government interference, especially in the realms of sex and reproduction. Roe v. Wade was the culmination of this movement toward personal liberty. The court took the rubric of a right to privacy that it found in what it called the ''penumbras, formed by emanations'' of various constitutional amendments and extended the right from marital contraception to abortion. Although the court has never embraced a right to die, it has in recent years, through Justice Anthony Kennedy, spoken of ''the right to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe and of the mystery of human life.''
 Since Roe, the majority of the most-pitched battles in the Supreme Court have concerned whether the liberal visions of equality and liberty should be reined in. Much of the time, as with the court's compromise rulings on affirmative action and partial-birth abortion, the result has been uneasy deadlock and indecisive squabbling. The most prominent exception is the issue of gay rights, which the court came late to embracing in Lawrence v. Texas in 2003 and which -- through the same-sex marriage question -- remains in the court's future. It is not too much to say that its resolution (one way or the other) will be the last act of the liberal constitutional revolution.
 No new progressive constitutional vision, meanwhile, has emerged from within the court. The only two Democratic appointments in the 42 years between Thurgood Marshall in 1967 and Sonia Sotomayor in 2009, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, reflect this reality. Ginsburg's distinguished career as a lawyer in the women's rights movement before she went on the bench embodied the drive for equality; but as a justice, she has striven, mostly successfully, to preserve what she won as a Supreme Court advocate. Breyer's own pre-judicial reputation was made as part of a bipartisan, technocratic movement for cautious deregulation; on the court, he has been centrist and pragmatic, voting to preserve the liberal legacy while also showing a willingness to compromise on a case-by-case basis. Neither Sotomayor nor the current nominee to the court, Elena Kagan, has articulated a new progressive constitutional vision, either.
 Why does the absence of this vision constitute a crisis for liberals? The answer is that new and pressing constitutional issues and problems loom on the horizon -- and they cannot be easily solved or resolved using the now-familiar frameworks of liberty and equality. These problems cluster around the current economic situation, which has revealed the extraordinary power of capital markets and business corporations in shaping the structure and actions of our government. The great economic and political challenges of our present decade -- salvaging and fixing financial institutions, delivering health care, protecting the environment -- have major constitutional dimensions. They require us to determine the limits of government power and the extent to which the state can impinge on collective and individual freedoms. Progressive constitutional thinkers, so skilled in arguing about social and civil rights, are out of practice in addressing such structural economic questions.
 More alarming is the fact that, over the past couple of decades, evident gains from deregulation have made many lawyers -- progressive and conservative alike -- too complacent about deferring to the markets on which our economy depends. That markets work well in so many contexts has strengthened the traditional conservative argument about the constitutional duty to respect private economic transactions -- even in the minds of many liberals. Civil libertarian commitments, meanwhile, have become increasingly absolutist, leading some liberals to favor extending basic rights to corporations, not just to individuals. The American Civil Liberties Union, for example, has long urged the Supreme Court to treat corporations just like individuals when it comes to political speech.
 To address these challenges, progressive constitutional thought must discover (or rediscover) a core set of beliefs about the right relationship between government, the individual and the powerful corporate entities that operate under the umbrella of the market. Reregulation, embraced by the Obama administration to address a range of serious economic and environmental dangers, demands its own set of constitutional explorations and explanations. A truly progressive constitutional project needs to go beyond simply upholding regulations challenged in court. It demands that the Supreme Court and other bodies acknowledge the government's responsibility to protect our democracy from the harmful side effects of all-powerful markets.
 II. THE PAST AND FUTURE OF A LIBERAL COURT
 To understand today's jurisprudential crisis, it helps to recognize that liberal constitutional thought is not a single settled body of doctrine but rather a set of ideas that has evolved in response to political, social and economic challenges. Today, for instance, judicial activism is a constitutional approach mostly associated with liberals, while judicial restraint is a constitutional theory most often connected to conservatism. But liberal constitutional thought did not begin with the activist-judicial expansion of equality and liberty as its main goal. It started, rather, with a near-absolute commitment to judicial restraint. 
 The story begins in the years after the Civil War, as the United States industrialized. By the late 19th century, political progressives had identified a great threat to American democracy in the overwhelming capacity of business to dominate the lives of individuals and the functioning of government. Their answer was to regulate the new industries and labor markets, in the hope of cleaning up business practices, serving consumers and getting workers decent wages for reasonable hours of work. But an activist Supreme Court blocked the way. In a string of cases that, with ebbs and flows, lasted from 1905 into the 1930s, the court overturned progressive laws. Its philosophy was based on a libertarian reading of the Constitution, one that emphasized inalienable rights and treated property as being inseparable from liberty.
 The case that gave its name to this constitutional era was Lochner v. New York (1905). Joseph Lochner, a baker in Utica, N.Y., employed a bakery worker formore than the 60 hours a week allowed by a progressive New York law. The Supreme Court vindicated Lochner by striking down the New York law as an unconstitutional violation of the liberty of contract -- a right that it found in the due-process clause of the 14th Amendment. Progressive critics of the Supreme Court argued that it was overstepping its bounds, engaging in judicial activism by mandating an economic philosophy that served the interests of business. Dissenting from the Lochner decision, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. wrote that ''a Constitution is not intended to embody a particular economic theory, whether of paternalism and the organic relation of the citizen to the state or of laissez-faire.''
 With the election of F. D. R. in 1932, the progressive critique of the Supreme Court in the Lochner era merged with what was coming to be called ''liberalism'' -- the rejection of socialism and corporatist fascism in favor of regulatedmarket capitalism. F. D. R. threatened to pack the court with justices who would stand aside, exercise judicial restraint and allow Congress and the president to enact laws reflecting the popular will. After a full four-year term in which no justice retired, F. D. R. got the chance to start appointing justices. Beginning in 1937, he appointed eight associate justices and elevated another to chief justice. In the main, these justices took the bench as staunch supporters of the liberal constitutional ideal of judicial restraint. ''Activism'' to them was a dirty word -- a cover for justices' imposing their own preferences without constitutional warrant.
 Then a funny thing happened. Little by little, the liberal majority began to realize that it had the capacity to protect minority rights and to expand individual freedom. Its members maintained the liberal constitutional orthodoxy that the court should not impose a single economic vision in the name of the Constitution. But when it came to equality and individual liberty, most of the liberal justices slowly moved away from judicial restraint, actively protecting religious and racial minorities and defending civil liberties.
 The liberal justices and their academic followers labored mightily to explain why activism in support of equality and individual liberty was consistent with the Constitution while activism in protecting the liberty of contract was not. Their efforts demanded creativity and generated much of modern constitutional thought. Justice Hugo Black, for example, came up with the theory of constitutional originalism to explain the difference: equality and individual liberty, he argued, were consonant with the text of the Constitution and the intention of its framers, but corporations should not be protected under the meaning of the word ''person'' in the 14th Amendment. (For Black, originalism was a liberal theory, not the conservative one it would become decades later in the hands of Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.) Others, including Justice William O. Douglas, were less troubled by the abandonment of judicial restraint. For Douglas, trained as a legal realist to notice power more than principle, the court's inevitably political character justified the choice to interpret the Constitution in terms of liberty. Justice William Brennan echoed this perspective. He would ask his new law clerks what was the most important rule of constitutional law, then answer by holding up five outstretched fingers to signify the number of votes needed to form a majority of the court.
 Among scholars, too, the effort to reconcile the new liberal activism with the liberal tradition of judicial restraint bore fruit. The legal scholar John Hart Ely sought to solve the dilemma by arguing that the underlying purpose of the Constitution was to facilitate political participation; equality and individual liberty served this goal, he maintained, while propertyprotection did not. The lawyer-philosopher Ronald Dworkin offered a theory in which fidelity to constitutional tradition must be joined to moral judgment about the right results. His view, designed to explain how judges should think about the law generally, salved the consciences of liberals who believed that blocking economic regulation was morally mistaken while enhancing equality and individual liberty was morally desirable.
 Today, constitutional progressives still say that the courts should defer to economic regulation by the government. But the ideal of judicial restraint has been undercut by the selective and opportunistic way in which liberals and conservatives alike have invoked it. And conservatives have once again mastered the art of depicting corporate interests in terms of individual liberties. What is needed, therefore, is an argument about why regulating markets is, from a constitutional perspective, desirable to enhance the constitutional values of self-government and individual liberty.
 III. A RETURN TO PROGRESSIVISM
 The liberal constitutional vision in the years before World War II was an inseparable part of the liberal ideal of the right relationship between the government and business, especially the financial markets. Liberals argued that the capitalist system could not survive its internal or external threats unless it was tempered and constrained by government regulation. The point of that regulation was not to subvert the market but to save it. One job of the Constitution, on this view, was to allow the government to protect its citizens and itself from the market's tendency to dominate everything that came into its path. F. D. R.'s supporters did not see the court as the primary government institution for regulating the market, but they did say that the court must implement the regulatory objectives chosen by the president, Congress and the administrative agencies. In contrast, constitutional conservatives at the time argued that the job of the court was to act as a check on government in its efforts to regulate the markets -- to protect private property against its erosion and to preserve capitalism against the threat of socialism. 
 The fundamental difference, then, between constitutional liberals and constitutional conservatives was on the question of whom they feared most. Liberals feared that, unregulated, business and markets might destroy both themselves and republican government. Conservatives shared the liberals' fear about the fate of republican government, worrying that, unfettered, regulation might destroy private property, the market and capitalism itself. Both sides contended that the Constitution ought to be interpreted in the light of their substantive views about the dangers to a system of democratic capitalism that both sides equally embraced.
 Today, we are moving toward a contemporary version of this debate between liberals and conservatives about what we need to fear most -- an overreaching state or unconstrained market forces. The positions in this debate today are not identical to what they were three-quarters of a century ago, but there are important similarities. Progressives today view regulation as the necessary response to the market failures that led to the present economic crisis. Many conservatives fear that taking regulation too far will cripple the possibilities of economic recovery and long-term growth. These differences are not only shaping the leading political debates of our day, but framed in terms of constitutional rights like free speech and due process, will also determine the outcomes of important constitutional challenges to legislative and regulatory reforms. And progressive constitutional thought, in its current form, may not always be adequate to produce the desired progressive outcomes.
 IV.FREEDOM OF SPEECH
 The recent Supreme Court case that most vividly captures this division between liberals and conservatives has to do with the constitutional rights of corporations -- and with their role in influencing the government. The case, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, was the subject of President Obama's in-person criticism of the Supreme Court during his State of the Union speech in January, when his comments elicited the response ''That's not true'' from Justice Samuel Alito. The case has received more attention than any First Amendment case in two decades -- and with good reason.
 At the heart of the case was a provision of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 that prohibited corporations and unions from using general treasury funds to pay for a radio or television broadcast that refers to a candidate in the immediate run-up to an election. Citizens United was a nonprofit corporation that made an unflattering documentary about Hillary Clinton and sought to show it during the 2008 primary season. The Supreme Court, in a highly contentious 5-to-4 decision, held that the First Amendment barred the government from limiting independent corporate expenditures. The decision overruled a 1990 precedent to the contrary. According to a dissent written by Justice Stevens (and echoed by President Obama in his remarks), the opinion also overturned more than a century of precedent treating corporations and individuals differently for purposes of free speech.
 On the level of partisan politics, it is easy to see why the decision might have divided Democrats from Republicans. In general, the Republican Party identifies itself as pro-business and thus would most likely benefit from a new constitutional rule that allows corporations to make independent expenditures during political campaigns. Democrats correspondingly might prefer limits on corporate campaign expenditure. Yet the principles involved went well beyond ordinary partisanship -- to the core question of how government and business should interact.
 Justice Kennedy, who wrote the majority opinion, has proved to be a powerful advocate of individual liberty (including in cases establishing the right to private homosexual conduct and the rights of Guantanamo detainees). But he remains staunchly conservative in his understanding of the role of corporations as bulwarks againstgovernment. His central argument in the Citizens United case was that the right to speak freely cannot vary based on the identity of the speaker. An individual who speaks is maintaining his independence vis-a-vis the state; and so, by extension, is a corporation, because corporations are nothing more than collections of individuals organized to achieve some greater end. According to this view, civil society is made up not just of civic groups like the N.A.A.C.P. or the N.R.A., but also of for-profit corporations. To deny them the right to speak freely is to allow government to pick and choose which kinds of speech it wants to allow and hence to distort the free marketplace of ideas.
 Kennedy has a point: corporate speech often shades into the realm of the expressive, whether the message is creative or political. Thus a progressive approach to corporate speech cannot simply try to demarcate different kinds of expression. The progressive argument must go deeper, to the institutional reality of the effects that corporate money can have on our entire democratic system, elections included. Supreme Court doctrine has historically tried to capture a version of this concern by asserting that the government has a legitimate interest in ''anticorruption'' -- the idea being that money from corporations can produce the appearance of a quid pro quo from elected officials. The court has also sometimes spoken of an ''antidistortion'' value -- the concern that corporations will have a disproportionate effect on elections by providing more money than individuals can. Justice Souter, quoted by Justice Stevens in his Citizens United dissent, referred to these interests collectively as demonstrating a concern for ''democratic integrity'' -- a concern that may in some circumstances outweigh the constitutional value of unfettered speech.
 But these polite, high-sounding terms do not go far enough. Couched in abstract language, they reflect the liberals' discomfort with stating bluntly that money talks. A truly progressive jurisprudence would go further in its legal reasoning, acknowledging that the for-profit corporation, man's most-advanced technology for making and concentrating wealth, creates unique risks for the structure of democratic government. It is true that corporate political speech is still speech, as Justice Kennedy and the A.C.L.U. alike have insisted. But that speech serves different ends than individual speech. Organized to use all lawful means to generate profit, corporations have the means and opportunity to try to capture the operation of government to serve this objective. Campaign-spending lets them do it directly. That is why Congress must be able to limit the effects of corporate speech during elections. It is a matter of defending democracy against the risk that business interests will come to dominate government decision-making -- an interest that derives from the constitutional commitment to republican government.
 V.DUE PROCESS
 The renewed battle lines between constitutional progressives and conservatives are not restricted to the First Amendment: the constitutional debate about business regulation is also becoming increasingly salient. This term, for example, the Supreme Court took up the constitutionality of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, created by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to review accounting practices. Similar challenges will certainly be brought to the new financial regulations proposed by the Obama administration. The council of regulators that is supposed to identify risk and deal with emergencies will be challenged as unconstitutional, as will the design of the consumer-credit-protection entity that is expected to be housed somewhere in the Federal Reserve. 
 Wherever possible, conservatives claim that legislation aimed at regulating business actually infringes on the constitutional rights of individuals. Indeed, the very authority of the government to resolve the affairs of large financial corporations -- the heart of the new financial-reform legislation -- will very likely be challenged as a violation of the due-process rights of those firms and their shareholders. Thus will the aim to stymie structural change be framed in terms of individual freedom. It will be up to progressives to explain why this view is mistaken -- and why limiting corporate rights is justified.
 The grave difficulty that must be met by a new progressive constitutional approach can so far be sensed most readily not in court cases but in the government's actions and justifications connected with the bailout of financial institutions. The now-canonical A.I.G. bailout serves as a useful example. In saving the insurance giant, the government (under the Bush administration) famously paid A.I.G. counterparties, including Goldman Sachs, 100 cents on the dollar for insurance contracts that they had taken out with the firm. Critics wondered loudly why the government didn't renegotiate the debts and demand that the counterparties settle at a discount. Then, while in control of A.I.G. (this time under the Obama administration), the government's managers allowed A.I.G. to pay out the bonuses it owed employees under their employment contracts -- again inviting the criticism that a private acquirer would have renegotiated and paid out less, or nothing.
 The public explanation for these decisions -- given after the fact by Lawrence Summers, Obama's chief economic adviser -- was that the rule of law required paying up. ''We are a country of law,'' Summers told George Stephanopoulos in a television interview. ''There are contracts. The government cannot just abrogate contracts.'' The government, Summers suggested, lacked the authority ''under law'' to do anything other than pay in full or force A.I.G. into bankruptcy. Summers's argument implied that some legal source, perhaps the Constitution, barred the government from impairing the obligation of contracts. 
 But the law is not so definitive. The government could have set conditions on the loans it made to A.I.G., as the recently released Congressional Oversight Report on the A.I.G. bailout explains. And that is not all. Pressed with dire economic necessity, the government has historically had the authority to go further and actually abrogate contracts. When Roosevelt became president in March 1933, he immediately suspended all banking operations in the country for four days. Then, relying on emergency legislation that retroactively validated the banking holiday, he used an executive order to demand that privately held gold be turned in to the government (with the government determining its worth). Finally, after a joint resolution of Congress, Roosevelt ordered the repudiation of private and public contracts denominated in gold -- contracts designed specifically to get around the danger of government repudiation. The Supreme Court grumbled but essentially upheld his decision. The markets responded positively.
 A progressive constitutional vision would acknowledge what seems relatively obvious in the A.I.G. case: the danger is not that risk-taking financial actors will lose when contracts are repudiated, but that taxpayers will lose if they are not. There was no constitutional obligation on the government to make itself weaker than A.I.G. itself would have been under the circumstances. Even if the government did not have clear statutory authority to reorganize A.I.G. summarily and repudiate some of its obligations overnight, it could have relied on the precedent of the 1930s. Faced with an emergency situation that was arguably less pressing, Roosevelt simply ordered the steps necessary, sought Congressional validation and dared anyone injured to sue after the fact. At a minimum, the government could have threatened A.I.G.'s counterparties and executives with the possibility of such emergency measures. It is not as if President Obama had specific statutory authority on June 16 to compel BP to set aside $20 billion to cover the costs of the Gulf oil disaster -- his demand was backed by the weight of his office and the direness of the emergency.
 Why did the progressive economists and lawyers of 2008-9 not act as F. D. R. would have acted? Surely neither the Bush nor the Obama administrations intended consciously to act in the interests of bankers rather than those of the public. But under the logic of the bailout, the markets were in charge, and the overarching aim of the government was to propitiate them to avoid disaster. Even under these conditions, a progressive constitutional vision should focus on government's duty to protect the public -- not the bankers who needed to be bailed out in the first place. A bailout had to happen; but the way it was done did not have to be shaped by the strange goal of protecting the ''rights'' of the corporate actors whose shirts were being saved.
 For constitutional conservatives, the most worrisome feature of the Troubled Asset Relief Program was the possibility that government funds would come with strings attached, leading to government control of financial institutions akin to the control the government now has over General Motors. They were concerned that government control in the private sector would compromise the independence of the business community, weakening its capacity to stand against government -- a danger that exists in socialist systems. For constitutional progressives, the fear associated with the TARP funds should be almost exactly the opposite: that the bailout reflected and enhanced a system in which the government serves the markets, not the taxpayers. Under today's economic conditions, the risk of corporations being subordinated to government interests seems faint indeed. The danger of the government's operating to serve the interests of the corporations in which it has acquired a stake seems remarkably serious. Constitutional decisions made against this backdrop -- whether by courts or by other government actors -- should recognize that the government may take the steps necessary to achieve the best economic outcomes without being tender about the property rights of market actors who have taken on (and hedged) risk in the hope of high return.
 VI.BEYOND RESTRAINT
 It is unfortunate that constitutional law is now once again facing the severe challenge of dealing with the astonishing strengths and risks associated with our version of capitalism. We are all better off when economic crisis is averted and wealth increases. Constitutional law, for its part, is purer and more morally uplifting when it is focused on liberty and equality.
 But these issues will not go away. The health care reform, President Obama's biggest legislative accomplishment thus far, has already been challenged by 20 states as an unconstitutional infringement on individual liberties and states' rights. We can expect constitutional challenges to any Congressional attempt to plug the holes left by the Citizens United decision. More broadly, the Tea Party movement finds its roots in deep skepticism about the legitimacy of government action -- an impulse that will issue eventually in legal and constitutional battles.
 The Constitution can fulfill its function only if it enables us to adjust to the most basic problems that the world throws at us. Our democracy -- including free speech, elections, civic organizations and the rest of its assorted components -- has never existed independent of our economy. Absent crisis, it is hard to muster the concentration or the will to make our constitutional system accept this reality and deal with it. So long as the markets continued to deliver the immense gains of recent decades, the chances of regulating the markets' effect on the democratic system were slim indeed.
 Now the moment has arrived for progressive constitutional thought to return to its origins -- and to improve on them. Judicial restraint is once again needed. But it must be justified in terms of the underlying goal of preserving our democratic system against the threat of control by market actors. Corporate rights should not be confused with individual rights. Our success or failure will not be felt right away -- but it will have consequences for generations to come.

An article last Sunday about the ways in which states are trying to control the cost of their pension plans described a pension cap in Illinois incorrectly. The cap applies to the annual salary upon which pensions will be based (for employees hired after Jan. 1, 2011, the cap is $106,800, indexed for inflation). The pension itself will not be capped at that amount.

 BODY:
THE NEWS A federal law widely applied in white-collar criminal cases has been used by prosecutors in unconstitutionally vague ways, and only passes muster when aimed at bribes and kickbacks, the Supreme Court ruled. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS The law made it a crime to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services. By reining in the law's scope, the decision threatens to unravel the convictions of Jeffrey K. Skilling of Enron infamy and the media mogul Conrad M. Black and could upend the political corruption case against former Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois.
THE NEWS To help Columbia University assemble land in Harlem for a proposed $6.3 billion satellite campus, New York State may use its power to take private property without the owner's consent, the state's highest court ruled. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS The decision, reversing a lower court, turned on the question of who gets to say whether a use of the state's eminent domain seizure power has met two legal requirements: that the properties to be seized are ''blighted'' and that they will be used for a ''public purpose.'' The ruling said courts must defer to a state agency's determinations on those issues. 
 THE NEWS The Supreme Court upheld a federal law making it a crime to provide some kinds of assistance, like training or advice, to foreign terrorist organizations, even if the help promotes the peaceful resolution of conflicts.
 BEHIND THE NEWS The plaintiffs in the case, which pitted free speech against national security, wanted to teach militants in Turkey and Sri Lanka how to resolve disputes peacefully and work with relief agencies. But the court ruled that even benign-seeming ''material support'' could indirectly further violent ends, and thus could be banned without violating the First Amendment. 
 THE NEWS A federal judge blocked a six-month moratorium on deepwater oil and gas drilling that the Obama administration imposed in May, and refused to delay his order while the administration appealed it.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Judge Martin L. C. Feldman said the government had failed to justify its ''blanket, generic, indeed punitive, moratorium,'' given the economic disruption it would cause, beyond simply assuming that all rigs must pose a danger because one failed catastrophically. The Interior Department began working on a more flexible moratorium to answer his concerns. 
 THE NEWS A lower court went too far in banning any planting of alfalfa seeds engineered to resist a common herbicide, the Supreme Court ruled.
 BEHIND THE NEWS The ruling, the court's first on the issue of genetically modified crops, was a victory for Monsanto, which markets the herbicide and the seed. The Supreme Court let stand the lower court's finding that the Agriculture Department had too readily approved wide use of the seed, but said the court should not have stopped the department from considering limited planting in places where it would be isolated from conventional alfalfa.

HEADLINE: Clear the Aisle

BYLINE: By PHILIP GALANES

 BODY:
At our upcoming wedding, my fiance and I would like to honor our families by having our parents and siblings walk down the aisle before us. I have four siblings, and he has one, plus a cousin he considers a brother. So that's four for me and two for him. He's been making a big fuss that things are not ''balanced.'' He wants me to eliminate two of my siblings, or add a couple of his friends. I'm flabbergasted! The whole idea is to honor family. What am I missing here? 
 Anonymous
 Here comes the brid(al fever), during which perfectly normal couples lose their grip on reality, become completely narcissistic, and crave attention 24/7 -- sort of like Liza Minnelli at Radio City Music Hall. 
 The family procession is a sweet idea, but try not to lose sleep over it. Aside from you and your groom, no one cares how many people precede you down the aisle. It's going to take 45 seconds, and most of your guests won't notice what's going on anyway.
 So how about a compromise? If you're stuck on family, and he's all even-Steven, maybe eliminate the siblings and go with your parents alone, or let him add the odd uncle or aunt. Personally, I'd rather see an all-sibling version of Sister Sledge's ''We Are Family'' on the dance floor.
 The Least You Deserve
 Last year, my husband and I eloped because he had to report for active duty in the Army. Now he's back, and we're going to celebrate our marriage with dinner and dancing. We didn't mention gifts on the invitation, but people are calling my mother to ask if there's a bridal registry. We're young and don't have much. I'd love a crockpot and a new set of cookware. Would it be O.K. to register now? 
 M.B., Washington, D.C.
 You are getting that crockpot, Army Wife, if I have to buy it for you myself! You may absolutely set up a delayed bridal registry under the circumstances. I wish you and your husband the best.
 (And it's good that you didn't mention gifts on the invitation. That's a wedding no-no.)
 An Unwanted Gift
 A friend from graduate school is getting married. We aren't BFF's or anything, but I'm going to the wedding. A few weeks ago, she asked if I would be her ''wedding coordinator'' on the day of the event: dealing with vendors and making sure things run on time. I agreed because I couldn't think of a way out when she asked. But now I feel like free labor. Am I overreacting? 
 Anonymous
 Not at all. As payback, I suggest stealing the groom, a la J-Lo in ''The Wedding Planner.'' (Only kidding, letter writers.) This is a job for family or besties. Or better still, paid professionals. And unless you've left out a piece of the puzzle -- like you're the best organized person in North America -- her request seems very odd.
 But you said yes, my dear. So if Bridezilla has time to replace you, say, ''On second thought, coordinating your big day feels like too much responsibility.'' Hinting will not suffice; you must actually say ''Please find someone else.''
 If the ceremony is next week, welcome to your new profession.
 And next time someone asks too much of you --say, donation of a kidney -- and you can't summon the courage to refuse on the spot, try: ''Let me think about it and get back to you.''
 When in doubt, buy time. And in this case, extra boutonnieres for the groomsmen and a headset for yourself -- to prompt the organist when the taffeta-clad eagle has landed.
 Generation Gap
 My husband and I drove five hours to the wedding of a close friend's daughter and stayed two nights at a pricey inn. At the reception, we were seated with friends of the bride and groom, who are 30ish. We were the only couple in our 60s at the table, though there were plenty at the wedding. I took it as an insult to be seated with people with whom we had nothing in common. Am I wrong to feel this way? 
 S. K., New Jersey
 I'm guessing you really hate ''Cougar Town''?
 Wedding receptions require flexibility on the part of guests, no doubt about it: so-so food, cheesy music and corny toasts -- all to let other people play king and queen for a day. But seating plans are as hard as Rubik's Cubes, and we've all pulled a lousy table assignment in our day.
 There was no insult here. What's more, it doesn't sound as if you even tried. Who knows? There may have been an old soul in one of those 30-year-old bodies. And wasn't it Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young (all in their 60s) who sang: ''If you can't be with the one you love, honey, love the one you're with''?
 The No-Shows
 I was married recently, and seven people who responded that they'd attend didn't come. One contacted us later with a valid medical excuse and sent a gift. The others haven't said (or sent) anything. Our no-show next-door neighbor has been avoiding us. Last time we saw him, he ducked down in his parked car. I'd like to say to these people: ''I'm sorry you missed my wedding. Is everything O.K.?'' 
 Anonymous, Long Island
 That's what you want to say? Really?! Not: ''You blew us off and wasted a perfectly good piece of rubber chicken. Now, where's my gift, loser?'' Perhaps you're a better person than the rest of us.
 It might be fun to play ''Tom and Jerry'' with your neighbor for a while, but your approach seems fine, too. Just try to keep the curiosity in your voice, and the hostility out of it. Remember: Spouses get sick, and sitters don't show -- and sometimes, the prospect of Spanx on a Saturday afternoon is simply too much to bear.
 Your no-shows are probably embarrassed. Give them a graceful out. Or don't -- and keep your neighbor ducking until he's forced to move.
 Granny's Shop
 My boyfriend and I are planning to marry. When the question of the ring came up, I told him I'd like to wear one of my grandmother's, which was a gift from my grandfather. It has a lot of sentimental value. What's the best way for my fiance-to-be to go about acquiring it? Obviously, he'll offer to pay. 
 Lauren
 I'm afraid the wedding bells have made you a little tone deaf, Lauren. If I were Granny, I'd much rather hear from you than from some Johnny-come-lately who may turn out to be Ex-Husband No. 1.
 It's your idea. Why pretend otherwise?
 Don't offer her cash, either. Your grandmother will probably be delighted to give you the frosting, unless she still enjoys seeing it on her own finger -- in which case, you and your guy can order up some breakfast at Tiffany's.
 A Marriage of Strangers
 My wife and I received a wedding invitation from a couple, neither of whom we recall knowing. We don't know their parents, and neither of us has ever been to the state where the wedding is to be held. We're at a loss whether (and how) to R.S.V.P. What should we do? 
 James, Greenville, Tenn.
 How many times in your life have you declined a wedding invitation without a shred of guilt? (I thought so.) Grab this opportunity and run with it. Simply reply that you and your wife are unable to attend, then skip to the post office with a smile on your face and a song in your heart: you're free, James, free!
 Reciprocity for Generosity
 Eight years ago, my friend's daughter received a $1,000 wedding gift. Now the gift-giver's daughter is getting married. Is my friend obliged to reciprocate in kind, and does he have to account for inflation? 
 J.O.
 Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner: the most mercenary wedding question of the year -- and a sample of the tit-for-tat thinking that gives weddings a bad name. Rather than focusing on price point and adjustments for inflation, why not be guided by affection for the bridal couple, our ability to give -- and whether there's any way to make those crystal goblets tax deductible?

HEADLINE: Emily Murphy, John Zedlewski

BYLINE: By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI

 BODY:
Emily H. Murphy and John R. Zedlewski were married Saturday at St. Paul's Church in Cambridge, Mass. The Rev. Michael Drea, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony. 
 The bride, 30, is an assistant principal at Marlborough Middle School in Marlborough, Mass. She graduated from Duke and received a master's degree in education policy and management from Harvard. She received a second master's degree, in school administration, from Trinity University in Washington.
 She is the daughter of Jane Murphy and Daniel F. Murphy of New York. Her father is the managing partner at the New York law firm Putney, Twombly, Hall & Hirson. Her mother is a mathematics teacher at Summit High School in Summit, N.J.
 Mr. Zedlewski, also 30, is a doctoral candidate in business economics at Harvard, where he received a master's degree in economics. He graduated from Princeton.
 He is a son of Sheila Rafferty Zedlewski and Edwin Zedlewski of Arlington, Va. His mother is the director of the Income and Benefits Policy Center at the Urban Institute in Washington. His father works in Washington as the senior scientific adviser to the director of the National Institute of Justice.
 The couple met in September 2007 while studying at Harvard. Mr. Zedlewski and a friend posted an online advertisement seeking a third roommate, and Ms. Murphy immediately responded.
 ''I knew it was two guys living together, but my parents did not,'' Ms. Murphy said. ''I figured I would at least meet them.''
 The bride's parents sent her younger brother to perform an informal background check on Mr. Zedlewski and his friend.
 ''They said he was going to help her move in, but all he really did was ask us a lot of questions,'' Mr. Zedlewski said with a laugh.
 The report was positive, and the bride recalled her father declaring to their family, ''She's going to end up marrying one of these guys.''
 Almost a year later, the couple started dating.
 ''In the beginning we were just friends,'' Mr. Zedlewski said. ''But she has just an irrepressible personality, and once you get to know her, you have to love her.''

HEADLINE: Inside the List

BYLINE: By JENNIFER SCHUESSLER

 BODY:
BECK BUMP: Swedish socialism may still rule the hardcover fiction list, via Stieg Larsson's megahit ''The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.'' But Larsson, who died in 2004, was recently given a run for his money by the free-market Austrian economist Friedrich von Hayek (who died in 1992), thanks to a mighty fist-bump from Glenn Beck. Hayek's classic treatise ''The Road to Serfdom,'' first published in the United States in 1944, shot to the No. 1 spot at both Amazon and Barnesandnoble.com after Beck devoted the entire June 8 episode of his television show to the book. A perennial seller for the University of Chicago Press, Hayek's libertarian cri de coeur had already received a big boost from Barack Obama, who has been cited by conservative pundits as the embodiment of the kind of creeping government tyranny that Hayek warned of. After Obama's election, sales went from about 7,000 copies a year to almost 30,000, according to Garrett Kiely, director of the press. After Beck's program, the book sold about 60,000 to 70,000 copies in one week. This surge came too late to push the book onto this week's paperback nonfiction list, which records sales until June 12. But stay tuned. 
 LOVE AND TAXES: Larsson may suffer another Beck body blow now that the broadcast superstar has loosed his second novel upon the world. ''The Overton Window,'' published just after the sales cutoff for this week's list, is something of a mash-up of Tom Clancy and Ayn Rand, featuring scenes of bureaucrat-melting action (including a plot to nuke the office of the Senate majority leader, who turns out to share a Las Vegas address with Harry Reid) interlaced with long speeches about the evils of big government. For those who want to keep abreast without putting down their Larsson, the liberal Web site Media Matters for America published a useful breakdown of the novel's highlights. For example, in one of the steamier passages, the hero tells his inamorata that the country needs to get back to ''fundamentals'' everyone can agree on, like, um, taxes: ''How about a set of specific spending cuts and a 13 percent flat tax to start with? Get that ridiculous 67,000-page tax code down to four or five bullet points, and show exactly what effects it'll have on trade, and employment, and the debt, and the future of the country.'' Salander, we're not in Sweden anymore.
 SURPRISE CALL: Justin Cronin's much-ballyhooed vampire thriller ''The Passage'' enters the hardcover fiction list at No. 3. Glenn Beck hasn't filed his review yet, but Stephen King called in to ''Good Morning America'' during Cronin's recent appearance to offer an enthusiastic thumbs up. ''I really love your book,'' King said. ''I hope it sells about a million copies. You put the scare back in vampires, buddy.'' As Steve from Maine went on, a beaming Cronin -- whose previous two novels have sold about 74,000 copies combined -- gazed skyward, as if thanking the literary gods. ''I keep looking up,'' he explained, ''because that's where the voice is coming from.''

HEADLINE: White House to Push Free Trade Deal With South Korea

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN and JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
TORONTO -- The Obama administration announced Saturday that it would ask Congress to ratify a long-stalled free-trade agreement with South Korea after the midterm elections in November. 
 The decision, which risks angering labor unions and their Congressional supporters, was announced as the Group of 20 economies began a two-day summit meeting here, following a smaller meeting by the Group of 8 powers.
 After the meeting with the South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, Mr. Obama's aides said they would try to resolve lingering issues by the time of the next G-20 leaders' talks, to be held in Seoul, South Korea, in November, and present the deal to Congress shortly after the November elections. 
 ''We very much welcome and thank President Obama for proposing a date for us to look forward to, and we will work towards that date and objectives,'' Mr. Lee said here in Toronto. 
 A top White House official said the administration was committed to removing two significant obstacles -- Korean restrictions on auto and beef imports -- to ratification of the agreement. The United States trade representative, Ron Kirk, said he planned to promptly initiate talks with his Korean counterpart, Trade Minister Kim Jong-hoon, but also pledged to consult with Congress in carrying out the negotiations.
 President George W. Bush's administration concluded the agreement in June 2007, but the Democratic leadership in Congress has not acted on it, nor has the Obama administration pressed the issue until now. 
 ''President Obama's leadership in breaking down barriers to commerce couldn't come at a better time,'' said Vikram S. Pandit, the chief executive of Citigroup, who leads a coalition of businesses that have urged ratification of the agreement. 
 He said that the agreement ''should lead to increased trade and investments, driving growth and job creation to fuel our economic recovery.'' 
 Response from Congress was mixed. 
 Representative Sander M. Levin, the powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said that the agreement as negotiated by the Bush administration ''does not effectively address the regulatory and tax barriers that have led to one-way trade and hurt our industrial sector as well as kept out our beef.'' 
 Mr. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, added: ''Congress expects to be consulted actively in these negotiations, and the date targeted by the president can be met only if the outstanding issues are fully addressed with enforceable commitments.''
 Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said he would support ratification as long as ''the unscientific barriers Korea has erected against American beef'' were removed. 
 And Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, the top Republican on Ways and Means Committee, said he too welcomed the decision. ''I hope that this process will provide us an opportunity to address market access for autos and beef and increase the value of the trading relationship,'' he said.
 The South Korea free-trade agreement is one of three -- the others are Colombia and Panama -- that were completed under the Bush administration. Neither the Obama administration nor Congressional Democrats have moved to complete the accords. 
 In the case of the Latin American countries, labor groups have cited a variety of objections concerning the treatment of union workers. 
 In the case of South Korea, the United Automobile Workers union and Ford have asserted that South Korea has not provided the United States with sufficient market access for American auto exports. General Motors and Chrysler, which have made headway in the Korean market, have supported ratification. 
 ''The U.S. has been notably absent on trade and investment liberalization efforts while the European Union and Canada have moved vigorously to conclude trade deals,'' said Daniel M. Price, who worked on trade and international economics during both Bush presidencies. 
 ''Three pending free-trade agreements have languished in the absence of administration and Congressional support for their approval.'' Mr. Price added, ''The announcement to reinvigorate efforts on the Korea agreement is a welcome break with past administration silence.'' 
 The European Union recently completed a free-trade accord with South Korea, and Canada is close to a similar deal. At the G-8 summit talks this weekend, the Canadian prime minister, Stephen Harper, highlighted the link between economic recovery and trade expansion. 
 Despite the president's announcement, the two-day G-8 meeting ended without a commitment to completing the long-delayed Doha round of world trade negotiations this year, as the G-8 leaders had promised last year in L'Aquila, Italy.
 ''While it may reflect the reality of intransigent negotiating positions of both developed and major emerging markets, it is nonetheless regrettable that the G-8 appears to have given up on its prior commitment to conclude the Doha deal this year,'' said Mr. Price, who was President George W. Bush's personal representative to the G-20 and now practices international trade law at the firm Sidley Austin.

HEADLINE: The State's Green Ways Are Under Attack

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEBER. 
Jonathan Weber is the editor in chief of The Bay Citizen. jweber@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Jonathan Weber writes a column for The Bay Citizen.
 Californians, and especially politically liberal Northern Californians, take a lot of pride in the state's history of aggressive environmental regulation. This is the state whose air-quality initiatives all but invented automobile emissions controls. It is a place where the high-tech industry supports stringent pollution rules, pointing to the thousands of jobs being created in the solar power business as an example of how a tech-driven industry can lead an economic renaissance -- and offer cleaner air, too.
 Even with a Republican, Arnold Schwarzenegger, sitting in the governor's chair, California has pushed hard on the environmental front, especially with the 2006 passage of AB 32, an ambitious effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the state. 
 In this context, it comes as a bit of a shock to see an effort to undo AB 32 gaining traction. A November ballot initiative would suspend the law until the state's unemployment rate -- currently at 12.4 percent -- drops to 5.5 percent or less for an extended period.
 The effort is driven by the lousy economy, and specifically the concern that stringent greenhouse-gas reduction targets could raise costs for consumers and businesses and worsen unemployment. The initiative is also -- surprise --financed by oil companies, which are major emitters of greenhouse gases and have the most to lose from any shift away from carbon-based fuels.
 While stopping short of advocating the sweeping long-term roll-back envisioned by the initiative, Meg Whitman, the Republican candidate for governor, has called for suspending parts of AB 32. With her Democratic opponent, Jerry Brown, the attorney general, promoting a plan to create 500,000 ''clean-energy jobs,'' the whole matrix of issues surrounding environmental protection and energy policy promises to be front and center this fall.
 The California debate bears a lot of resemblance to the national argument over energy legislation, especially a cap-and-trade plan to reduce carbon emissions. Opponents of cap and trade fear that it will function as a new tax on businesses. Proponents say it's necessary to save the planet and will stimulate investment in clean energy, helping the economy.
 In fact, AB 32 already implements in California much of what is envisioned in the national law -- and that has a lot to do with the state's drawing about half of all clean-energy investment in the nation.
 ''AB 32 is an important piece of California's attraction for the renewable energy industry,'' said Julie Blunden, executive vice president for public policy at the SunPower Corporation, a leading solar power firm. The company employs nearly 1,000 people in the state, many in well-paid jobs.
 ''Why have companies chosen to locate here? Long-term, visible policy supporting clean energy,'' Ms. Blunden said, is a big part of the answer.
 As a general matter, alternative energy remains highly dependent on such ''policy support''; carbon-reduction rules are only the half of it.
 Nationally, the solar power industry is booming, the result of the passing in 2008 of an eight-year extension of an investment tax credit and a subsequent measure that allows companies to get cash payments in lieu of tax credits if they don't actually owe any taxes. (Whether this last provision is extended is an issue still pending in the Congressional energy debate.)
 According to a study released last week by the International Energy Agency, solar could reach ''grid parity'' on price with coal and natural gas by 2020. That means, of course, that subsidies and other incentives will be needed for some time yet.
 Academics still debate the merits of such policies, but for many people in California, they look like a no-brainer. The solar industry has already created tens of thousands of jobs. The electric car industry could create tens of thousands more.
 ''The thing the Bay Area does best is incent entrepreneurs, gather and deploy capital and choose management teams,'' said Wade Randlett, entrepreneur, Democratic activist and chairman of the San Francisco biodiesel firm NextFuels Inc.
 Government policies and incentives create the framework for those things to happen, Mr. Randlett argues. And in the case of sustainable energy, they merely level the playing field with a fossil fuel industry that is not required to pay for its many ''externalities,'' be they pollution or trade deficits or even wars to protect oil supplies.
 Clean-energy industry executives I spoke with said they were confident that the anti-AB 32 effort would fail. If they're right, it will be nothing less than a reaffirmation of an important California faith -- in, of all things, the power of government.

HEADLINE: A Crusader For Boldness As the Arts Face Deficits

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
NEW HAVEN -- Watching Michael M. Kaiser, the president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, speak to arts executives, as he did during two recent swings through New England, is like watching Jack Welch talk to business students.
 The executives pay rapt attention, take notes and nod their heads. They ask questions, some of which begin with a heartfelt, ''Thank you, Mr. Kaiser, for being here and speaking to us.'' Standing ovations are routine, as are the crowds who hover hoping to shake his hand.
 ''He's kind of the rock star of performing arts management,'' said James Patrick, executive director of the Warner Theater in Torrington, Conn., at a talk in West Hartford this month.
 Mr. Kaiser has encountered this kind of reception many times since he began barnstorming the country last year on what he has dubbed an Arts in Crisis tour, named after a program he initiated in February 2009. Alarmed by reports that arts groups were cutting programming because of money woes -- a recipe for disaster, in his view -- he created a Web site, artsincrisis.org, where organizations can write to apply for free planning help from Kennedy Center staff members or a group of volunteer mentors. So far more than 800 groups have applied. 
 When the tour ends, on July 20, he will have spoken in all 50 states, hammering home an argument familiar to readers of his book, ''The Art of the Turnaround,'' that in hard times arts organizations retain audiences, and donors, by offering their most exciting programming, not by scaling back or trying more conservative fare.
 ''I feel like the creativity has been beaten out of us,'' he said in New Haven. ''We're so scared about money that we're afraid to do really interesting, innovative work.''
 At a time of many questions in the world of culture, Mr. Kaiser is regarded by many as the man with most of the answers, a miracle worker credited with having saved the Kansas City Ballet, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, American Ballet Theater and the Royal Opera House in London, when he ran those organizations. At the Kennedy Center, which he took over in 2001, he has more than doubled donations and has run a surplus every year.
 Just how transformative his message is for others, though, can be hard to gauge. No one, including the Kennedy Center, tracks the long-term outcomes for the organizations helped through the Arts in Crisis program. One might be tempted to dismiss Mr. Kaiser as a well-meaning cheerleader if he did not have such a solid track record of repeat successes, and if there were not such a long line of arts executives he has counseled, often far from the spotlight, who speak of him with gratitude approaching devotion.
 Laveen Naidu, the executive director of the Dance Theater of Harlem, which Mr. Kaiser helped attract new donors, said there was a period when they spoke almost daily. 
 Mr. Kaiser's generosity, Mr. Naidu said, was ''an amazing blessing and a great, great thing for the industry.''
 Mr. Kaiser attributes his multiple activities on several platforms -- including the book, a Huffington Postblog as well as the road tour -- not to any effort at self-promotion but simply to a full-octane passion for arts management. 
 ''I'm trying to build a respect for the field,'' he said in a black town car between West Hartford and New Haven.
 Reflecting on the speaking tour, he said, ''A lot of people come up saying: 'I heard you talk here,' 'I heard you talk there,' 'I read your book,' 'I read your blog on The Huffington Post,' 'I've seen your video.' '' He continued, ''I'm creating-- it's not about me so much -- but I'm creating the sense that there is a field out there, that there is something for people to talk about.''
 Mr. Kaiser, who rises at 4 each morning and has not taken a vacation in nine years, is what many people would call a workaholic, albeit one who takes enormous pleasure from his career. The Kennedy Center has since 2001 housed an arts management institute, rechristened the DeVos Institute of Arts Management this year in recognition of a $22.5 million gift, and Mr. Kaiser has advised groups around the world, from the Market Theater in Johannesburg to New York City Opera.
 Instead of moving on from the Kennedy Center in 2011, as he had once planned, he now says he will stay until 2014 and will then lead the institute.
 Mr. Kaiser has many admirers, among them Marc Feldman, the executive director of the Sacramento Philharmonic Orchestra, who sent an e-mail message to the Arts in Crisis Web site last year that described how his board, anxious about the economy, was pressuring him to make cuts. He was amazed, he said, when Mr. Kaiser called him within 24 hours and subsequently agreed to meet with members of the board, whom he convinced that strong, well-marketed programming would attract an audience and keep the orchestra on a steady course. The result, Mr. Feldman said, was a season with the strongest ticket sales ever: 27 percent over predictions. 
 Mr. Feldman said he felt empowered by Mr. Kaiser's message, which he described as: ''It's O.K. to be passionate. It's O.K. to be out there and pushing for your company. You don't have to be just cold and numbers driven.''
 Critics, though, say that for a man who says arts management must be taken more seriously, Mr. Kaiser can approach the topic rather simplistically and make turnarounds sound too easy.
 Ted Legasey, the president of the imperiled Charleston Symphony Orchestra in South Carolina, said he was disappointed in Mr. Kaiser's remarks there in February, which he called too general and removed from day-to-day realities.
 ''He operates at about 30,000 feet,'' Mr. Legasey said, adding, ''As someone who is trying to navigate a pretty tight set of wickets here, I said, 'Well, not much we can do with this.' '' 
 Russell Willis Taylor, the president and chief executive of National Arts Strategies, which runs leadership seminars for arts executives, said that she respected Mr. Kaiser but found his approach somewhat one-dimensional.
 ''Just putting on shows and just putting money into marketing isn't going to do it,'' she said. ''The biggest problem the arts face is not financial. It's, 'Why do they matter?' ''
 Several years ago, in an unusual flare-up within the typically collegial nonprofit arts world, the president of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, Reynold Levy, responded quickly to an op-ed article in The Washington Post by Mr. Kaiser that argued that the performing arts needed better leadership.
 Mr. Levy's published response faulted Mr. Kaiser for making a ''rather sweeping assessment,'' unsupported by facts. He testily advised him ''to leave the predictions of Cassandra and the wailings of Jeremiah backstage.''
 In his book Mr. Kaiser returned the dig, suggesting Mr. Levy was motivated by jealousy because the Kennedy Center, he said, was advancing in the eyes of the arts world while Lincoln Center was facing problems. 
 More typical, though, were Mr. Kaiser's interactions with Zvonimir Dobrovic, the founder of the Queer Zagreb Festival, a performing arts event in Zagreb, Croatia. Mr. Dobrovic had been a summer fellow at the Kennedy Center's management institute for two years and said he came away from those encounters with a deep sense of Mr. Kaiser's commitment. ''What's really great is that you feel a personal connection immediately,'' he said. ''He has the time just for you whenever you need it in a way that's really beautiful.'' 
 Despite that kind of admiration Mr. Kaiser's life can be solitary. He lives by himself in Washington and does not take vacations in part because, he said, it's ''not so much fun'' to do so alone. As grueling as the road tour has been, it has provided him with a chance to meet people, which he enjoys.
 He is fond of meeting them too, on Facebook, which he joined last year as a pleasant way to pass the time in hotels. He posts his blog to his Facebook account, and many people leave comments or thank him for one of his talks. 
 In no time, Mr. Kaiser said, he had quickly collected 5,000 ''friends,'' which Facebook sets as the limit, even for a person who has spent more than a year traveling around firing up crowds of arts managers eager for inspiration.
 ''I'm not allowed to add any, and it's a little depressing,'' he said. ''I wish they would extend the limit.''

HEADLINE: From CNBC Business Journalist to Critic of Bankers on MSNBC

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
On most cable newscasts, the people who are writing new financial regulations are called congressmen. But on ''The Dylan Ratigan Show'' on MSNBC, some are called ''banksters.''
 That term, a twist on gangsters, tells viewers a lot about Mr. Ratigan, a financial news apostate who has transformed himself into an outspoken opponent of too-big-to-fail banks and the politicians whom he calls their servants. In the recent fight over financial reform, he lent a megaphone to people who wanted an end to ''too big to fail,'' and he called on viewers to lobby the Senators in his imaginary Bankster Party.
 All this from a man who, until recently, hosted a stock-picking show on CNBC, the cable personification of Wall Street. Now Mr. Ratigan, who labels himself a taxpayer advocate, rails against the ''vampire'' banks who ''have assumed control of our government.''
 ''It's like being the guy who was running the casino, and then having an awakening and realizing that the casino is what's killing the country,'' Mr. Ratigan said in an interview last week. 
 On Friday, he concluded that the financial overhaul, which Democrats hope to send to President Obama by the end of the week, would not put a halt to what he calls theft by the banks. The bill is ''nothing more than window dressing,'' he said. On CNBC, meanwhile, there was almost an audible sigh of relief that the reforms were, as Maria Bartiromo put it, ''not as strict as many people had feared.''
 Both channels are owned by NBC Universal. MSNBC, which leans left in prime time, epitomizes a very different view of the world than CNBC, which is sometimes mistaken for the captain of the stock market cheerleading squad.
 The financial crisis and subsequent bailouts have already had a powerful effect on American politics, helping to start the Tea Party movement and putting some proponents of government action on the defensive. The financial crisis also tested cable television's lucrative financial news channels, which have strained to balance the corporate interests of their audience with government intervention and rising populist anger.
 Mr. Ratigan underwent a ''Lou Dobbs-like transformation,'' from sober-minded journalist to all-out advocate, said Andrew Leckey, the president of the Donald W. Reynolds National Center for Business Journalism at Arizona State University.
 In a nod to his old network, Mr. Ratigan said that CNBC ''does more good than bad,'' because it ''still shines the light on the debate about ideas in the financial markets.'' But MSNBC seems to be a better platform than CNBC for a political crusade against corruption, said Mr. Ratigan, 38, whose one-year anniversary at MSNBC will come on Tuesday.
 On Monday, Mr. Ratigan will begin ''Fix-It Week,'' proposing solutions to problems like the federal budget deficit and dependence on foreign oil. ''Dylan wants to change the world. He's a crusader,'' said Phil Griffin, the president of MSNBC.
 There are risks for crusaders, and one is that they can potentially turn into Howard Beale, Peter Finch's character in the 1976 movie ''Network.'' 
 ''You can become almost a stereotype of yourself,'' Mr. Leckey said.
 Still, it makes for good television. More than ever, cable news is a political perch, and ''The Dylan Ratigan Show'' is just one example of Mr. Griffin's effort to build a bench of opinionated hosts. This month, he announced that the Democratic political analyst Lawrence O'Donnell would be the host of a show at 10 p.m., starting this fall.
 There are early signs that viewers are responding favorably to Mr. Ratigan. His show, which is on at 4 p.m. on weekdays, had an average of 330,000 viewers each afternoon in May, up 20 percent from the straightforward newscast that ran on MSNBC in that time slot last year -- yet another viewer vote for opinion over old-fashioned news.
 But in the battle for second place behind Fox News, MSNBC still loses to CNN in the daytime -- including Mr. Ratigan's hour -- even though it wins at night..
 Mr. Ratigan went to work at CNBC in 2005 after spending his 20s at Bloomberg Television as a journalist and a manager, a job he won after getting to know Michael Bloomberg's ex-wife and daughters. They recommended him for an entry-level job, Mr. Ratigan said. He agrees with the gossip column claims that he fought all the time with his bosses at CNBC about the structure of ''Fast Money,'' but he says the disputes had nothing to do with his exit in early 2009.
 He traces his midcareer conversion to fall 2008, when he says he came to see the corrupt practices of banks, special interests and politicians.
 At MSNBC, Mr. Ratigan was initially given a midmorning time slot, but he made no dent in the ratings. Mr. Griffin concluded that ''he plays better in the afternoon,'' closer to the channel's evening lineup of point-of-view hosts like Chris Matthews and Ed Schultz.
 Mr. Ratigan does not just have a point of view, he has a point -- one that he repeats relentlessly and feverishly, sometimes with props like buckets and Monopoly money. To hear Mr. Ratigan tell it, the American people are being held hostage by a banking system that acts like a government subsidized casino. His analogy: ''My mother is paying taxes to the government. The government is giving her money to the banks. The banks are gambling like they're watching 'Fast Money.' But my mother didn't sign up for that.''
 Mr. Ratigan said flatly, ''As long as there's been banks and governments, banks and governments have been conspiring to take money from the people.'' What has changed now, he said, is that ''we have the ability to engage it directly,'' through fair elections and a free press. The first step in his playbook, then, is to end the denial about it through his show.
 He made headlines online in December when he cut off an interview with a congresswoman after fighting with her over what he called the ''private insurance monopoly'' that stood to benefit from an overhaul of health care.
 ''You're asking your own questions and answering them. You could be your own guest,'' Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Democrat of Florida, said on the show (Mr. Ratigan later apologized). Most of the time he reins himself in, recognizing, he says, that anger distracts from productive conversations.
 Of course, in the bailout era, going after greed is arguably an easy way to ''get a lot of people behind you,'' Mr. Leckey said, calling it ''an almost fail-safe position to be in.''
 What has changed, perhaps, is that, while an anchorman like Mr. Dobbs fought to express his opinions on CNN, Mr. Ratigan is being emboldened by his bosses. Mr. Griffin likened Mr. Ratigan to a ''wild mustang,'' and said, ''I don't want to change him. I want to tame him a little bit,'' so that the audience can keep up.
 His advice to Mr. Ratigan: ''If you want to create a movement, take it a little slower,'' he said.

HEADLINE: G-20 Countries Agree to Halve Budget Deficits

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN and JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
TORONTO -- Leaders of the world's biggest economies agreed Sunday on a timetable for cutting deficits and halting the growth of their debt, but also acknowledged the need to move carefully so that reductions in spending did not set back the fragile global recovery.
 The action at the Group of 20 summit meeting here signaled the determination of many of the wealthiest countries, after enacting spending programs to counter the worldwide financial crisis, to now emphasize debt reduction. And it underscored the conviction of European nations in particular that deficits represented the biggest threat to their economic stability. 
 President Obama and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner had consistently advocated a measured approach to debt reduction that would not stymie growth and lead to a double-dip recession.
 The United States, however, joined other countries at the summit meeting, which was met by protests and several hundred arrests, by endorsing a goal of cutting government deficits in half by 2013 and stabilizing the ratio of public debt to gross domestic product by 2016. Canada's prime minister, Stephen Harper, had proposed the targets, backed by Germany and Britain. 
 To assuage objections from the United States, Japan, India and some other countries, the timetable was couched as an expectation, rather than a firm deadline. The G-20 joint statement explicitly stated that Japan, which is heavily dependent on domestic borrowing, was not expected to meet the targets. 
 The divisions were in contrast to the unity that characterized the previous three G-20 leaders' summits, when the urgency of a potential global collapse produced solidarity and a unified economic approach. Although Mr. Obama insisted emphatically that there was ''violent agreement'' on the need to reduce debt over time, the final communique included a delicately worded call for deficit reduction ''tailored to national circumstances.'' In essence, the leaders were blessing their decision to go their own ways.
 The joint statement acknowledged both sides of the debate. ''There is a risk that synchronized fiscal adjustment across several major economies could adversely impact the recovery,'' the statement said. ''There is also a risk that the failure to implement consolidation where necessary would undermine confidence and hamper growth.''
 In a news conference at the conclusion of the summit meeting, Mr. Obama referred only indirectly to the disagreement with Europe, saying, ''We must recognize that our fiscal health tomorrow will rest in no small measure on our ability to create jobs today.'' 
 His concern about stimulus was echoed by some economists who viewed the pledge on deficits as imperiling the prospects for growth. 
 ''China's growth, specifically, is not seen as sustainable at current rates,'' Ronald A. Kurtz, professor of global economics and management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in an e-mail message. ''The G-20 declaration therefore amounts to saying 'assume a miracle' for global growth.'' He said Europe's fiscal austerity plans would also slow growth.
 But Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the International Monetary Fund, said he thought the risks of a new downturn were minimal. 
 ''We don't forecast any double dip,'' he said. ''Double dip was not discussed at the meeting.''
 It is the first time the G-20 has set dates for deficit reduction, but the timetable, which is not binding, will probably not require new policy actions. Most of the governments, including the United States, have already put forward budget proposals in line with the targets. 
 The leaders also discussed banking regulations, but could not agree on a proposal for a global bank tax, supported by the United States, Britain and the European Union, but opposed by Canada and Australia. 
 And while the G-20 reaffirmed a deadline -- their next meeting, in November in Seoul, South Korea -- for agreeing on new capital standards for banks, they signaled that several countries might not implement the standards by 2012, as initially planned.
 ''While the illusion of progress is good, I don't see real action to alter the imbalances that brought us to this crisis,'' said Raghuram G. Rajan, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund who is now a professor in the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago. 
 The United States, he said, continues to run large trade deficits financed by Germany, China and Japan. ''The U.S. has been the world's consumer of first resort,'' he added, ''and because it has been unable to persuade other countries to spend more or to reform quickly, it is likely to take up that position once again.'' 
 Though Mr. Obama did not prevail in his emphasis on stimulus, he did arrive in Canada with three victories under his belt. 
 European leaders had agreed to conduct stress tests on their big banks, an exercise successfully undertaken in the United States last year, in an effort to restore market confidence. China had announced that it would allow a gradual appreciation of its currency. And Congressional negotiators had agreed on a far-reaching overhaul of financial regulations. 
 But those accomplishments did not alter the mix of lagging growth, heavy debts and anxious voters that pushed European leaders to press for austerity. 
 ''The U.S. may be concentrated on premature fiscal tightening, but most other countries are looking with a nervous eye to the sovereign debt mess in Europe,'' said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a Harvard economist and former I.M.F. chief economist. ''Aiming for a gradually improving debt-to-G.D.P. ratio by 2016 is hardly wild-eyed fiscal conservatism.'' 
 In that light, the G-20 outcome was a victory for Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who argued that without actions to rein in spending, investors would drive up governments' borrowing costs, as they did in Greece. 
 Mr. Obama said, ''We helped to draft this communique, which reflects our policies,'' and added, ''Keep in mind that we had already proposed a long time ago that we were going to cut our deficits in half by 2013.'' 
 He continued, ''We can't all rush to the exits at the same time.'' But he also said that for all the talk of German austerity, it was actually reducing its spending gradually, and not any more quickly than the United States.
 While aides to Mr. Obama said that the G-20 statement was in line with budget plans he had already announced, others said it was a move toward austerity. 
 ''The best thing that countries with fiscal challenges can do is to show that they can live within their means,'' George Osborne, Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer, said. ''Barack Obama has recognized that.''
 The mood here was far less anxious than in November 2008, when the G-20 leaders converged for the first time, in Washington, to battle a still-raging financial crisis. But it was hardly cheery. 
 While China did not make any new commitments, the G-20 statement appealed to China to increase spending on infrastructure, let its currency fluctuate and strengthen social protections.
 Those actions are part of what economists call rebalancing -- a reorientation of the world economy to be less reliant on debt-financed spending by North American and Western European consumers. China is the largest growth engine but its workers save too much and spend too little, some economists say.
 At China's urging, the G-20 leaders removed from their joint statement a proposed clause that would have praised China for agreeing to greater exchange-rate flexibility. Mr. Harper said he understood China's wish not to be singled out, for either criticism or praise, but added, ''When you make commitments on the world stage, you will be held accountable for them.''

HEADLINE: New Diploma Standard in New York Becomes a Multiple-Question Choice

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
When the State Education Department announced five years ago that all students would soon be required to pass five tests to earn high school diplomas in New York, officials applauded themselves for raising standards. 
 The new requirements do not take full effect until the class of 2012 graduates. What is clear is that if they were in place today, New York City's graduation rate would almost certainly drop after years of climbing steadily. 
 What is not so evident, educators and testing experts say, is whether the higher bar will inspire students and schools to greatness, or merely make them lean more heavily on test-taking strategies. Nor is there agreement on whether it will actually make a difference in how students perform in high school and beyond. 
 Currently, the state awards two basic kinds of diplomas. The tougher one, called a Regents diploma, requires scores of at least 65 (out of 100) on five Regents exams: in English, math, science, global history and United States history. The other type, called a local diploma, requires a 65 on three of those tests, and a 55 on the other two. In two years, the local diploma will cease to exist. Students who want a diploma but have not passed all five tests by the end of senior year will have to retake the missed tests in a following year or seek a G.E.D. 
 If the new standards had been in place for the class of 2009, the city's graduation rate would have been roughly 45 percent, instead of the nearly 60 percent that city officials boasted of, according to city statistics. Among black and Latino students, barely more than one-third would have qualified for diplomas. 
 A Regents diploma is supposed to signify that a student is prepared for college. Today, most New York City graduates who enroll in an associate degree program at a City University of New York college need to take remedial courses there. 
 ''This is the question that everyone is asking everywhere, not just in New York but nationally: Should high school graduation mean that a student is successful in first-year college courses?'' John B. King Jr., senior deputy state education commissioner, said. ''There isn't a state answer at the moment, and that's what we have to grapple with.'' 
 State officials are considering whether to change the testing requirements even more, to align more closely with college standards. 
 Nevertheless, some teachers and administrators expect state officials to make the tests easier to pass, rather than face public outrage for declining graduation rates. They note that Regents scores do not reflect the percentage of questions answered correctly, but rather the number of correct answers that state officials and testing experts determine represents proficiency in the subject, in a process known as scaling. For example, on last year's algebra exam, a student could earn a 65 by getting only 30 out of a maximum 87 points. 
 Despite the gap between the number of city students who graduate and the number who earn Regents diplomas, some educators say the change in standards is too small to cause a steep drop in graduation rates. 
 ''In some cases, we're talking about the difference of two questions -- if a student manages to respond to two more questions correctly, they'll have no problem,'' said Colin Thomas, the principal of Bronx Regional High School. 
 But Mr. Thomas also said the tougher requirements might encourage students to put off taking the tests for another year to improve their chances of passing; students can take the tests at any time before graduation. ''Some of this will just be about timing,'' he said. ''We will have to make sure every kid is ready to take the test at the right moment.'' 
 Sam Decker, the principal of Bronx Guild High School, said he was far more concerned that students show proficiency in their writing than pass tests. He said the Regents test in biology, for example, simply required students to recite basic facts. 
 ''It doesn't require much more than memorization,'' Mr. Decker said, adding that even memorization was a challenge for some students. ''I would rather my students demonstrate that they can walk through the scientific process of crafting a hypothesis and analyze the results. That way we don't have to spend time just preparing them to regurgitate information.'' 
 As at many schools, however, teachers and administrators at Bronx Guild do prepare students for the tests. They analyze tests from previous years, which are made public, looking for which topics are asked about again and again. They say, for example, that the history tests inevitably include several questions about industrialization and the causes of the two world wars. 
 For a time, Mr. Decker encouraged teachers to spend more time delving into the philosophy behind the Bill of Rights, a line of inquiry that seldom leads to points on the test in United States history. But he drew back when he saw that many students were failing the exam. 
 Educators are also debating how the tests are graded. Teachers currently grade their own students' exams, which many critics say encourages grade inflation, particularly on tests that include essays, whose scoring is somewhat subjective. Because schools can be closed for sagging graduation rates, teachers have a stake in the scoring, and will have an even larger one two years from now. 
 ''We've raised issues about scoring of the test for the last 10 years, but I don't see sufficient pressure for them to really examine it,'' said Howard T. Everson, a senior research fellow at CUNY and the chairman of a committee that advises the state on testing. ''The problem is it would be expensive to do it any other way, but I don't see a plan for them to address it.'' 
 More important, Mr. Everson said, there has been little evidence that state officials are certain about what the exams really test and what their impact is. 
 ''People have always taken the Regents as a fact of life,'' he said. ''They were always seen as a benchmark of quality -- it has always meant something. And does it still? That's the real question.'' 
 To learn more, state officials have begun to track the success of high school students at city and state universities. They will examine, for example, how many students from each school need remediation, and how many students drop out after their first year of college. 
 ''It's not going to be devastating to most high schools to have more students pass a few tests; they know this is coming,'' said John Garvey, who recently retired as the liaison between the city's Education Department and CUNY. ''On the other hand, everyone is beginning to realize that a Regents diploma has very, very little to do with what it takes to do well in college.''

HEADLINE: G-20 Nations Agree to Delay in Setting New Rules for Big Banks

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN and JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
TORONTO -- Giant banks, while bracing for a wave of tougher regulation in Washington, will not have to face a new set of global rules on capital and liquidity anytime soon.
 The world's biggest economies have been developing rules that would require banks to hold more capital and be better equipped to absorb losses when financial conditions sour. But it became clear on Sunday at the meeting of the Group of 20 countries that it could be years before they take effect.
 The rules are to be finished at the next G-20 leaders' summit talks, in Seoul, South Korea, in November. 
 While the participants here said they aimed to adopt the rules by the end of 2012, they cautioned that the standards would be ''phased in over a time frame that is consistent with sustained recovery and limits market disruption.'' 
 The United States Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, said that progress was being made on new capital standards, although disagreements remained. 
 ''We're narrowing those differences, but we're still some ways apart,'' he said during a news conference here on Saturday. He added that negotiators were trying to ensure that limiting the risks taken by banks would not endanger the recovery by choking off financing. 
 ''And the best way to strike that balance is to make sure you set ambitious standards, but give people a transition period so they can adapt over time to those standards,'' he said. 
 Trillions of dollars are at stake in the negotiations over what is being called Basel III, named for the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a body of regulators that meets regularly in Switzerland. 
 In some ways the Basel negotiations will be as significant for future financial stability as the Congressional debates over the American regulatory system. ''We want to have a level playing field,'' Mr. Geithner said. 
 ''In these markets today, risk can move very quickly to evade the strongest standards, and we think the system will be stronger as a whole if these measures in the U.S. we're about to enact are complemented by strong actions by other countries.'' 
 But banks across the world have been pressing for a delay or even a rewrite of the proposed rules, in part by arguing that the new standards could hamper the global recovery. 
 The Institute of International Finance, the world's leading banking industry group, warned earlier this month that economic growth in the United States, Japan and the countries that use the euro would be reduced by three percentage points between now and 2015 if the current Basel proposals were put in place. 
 The Basel Committee, which sets standards that are then carried out by national regulators, wants to tighten the definition of what can be counted as Tier One capital, which is the basic measure of what banks hold against the risk of future losses. 
 The committee also wants banks to have enough liquid assets to survive a short-term market plunge, by reducing their dependence on short-term wholesale financing.
 Mario Draghi, the chairman of the Financial Stability Board, a global coordination body that works closely with the Basel Committee, said on Sunday that it would be better to delay putting the standards in effect, rather than weakening them.
 ''The quality and amount of capital in the banking system must be significantly higher to improve loss absorbency and resiliency,'' Mr. Draghi, the governor of the Bank of Italy, wrote in a letter to the G-20 leaders. He added that governments ''should provide transition arrangements that enable movement to robust new standards without putting the recovery at risk, rather than allow concerns over the transition to weaken the standards.'' 
 Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics, who follows bank capital standards, said the G-20 committed itself to ''implementation by 2012 unless that proves inconvenient.'' 
 She added: ''Clearly, new tough rules are coming, but what they are and how they will affect each nation is up to each nation. In the U.S., the rules will be very stringent, but that's because of the bill Congress passed on Friday.''
 The Financial Stability Board is also working on rules that would tighten scrutiny of hedge funds and debt rating agencies; set restrictions on executive pay to discourage excessive risk-taking; and push trading of derivatives onto open markets. The Congressional legislation, which is expected to go to President Obama's desk within the next week, includes similar provisions in those areas.
 An amendment to that legislation, sponsored by Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican whose support was vital to the measure's passage in the Senate, requires that only equity -- and not instruments like trust-preferred securities, which are a hybrid of equity and debt -- count as Tier 1 capital.
 Banks opposed that amendment, and the Obama administration had concerns about putting the provision in law as opposed to regulation. 
 In a compromise, Congressional negotiators agreed to give big bank holding companies five years to follow the new rule, and to allow companies with assets of $15 billion or less to count their current holdings of trust-preferred securities as part of Tier 1, though not new investments.
 But the banks appear to have won an important victory in blocking an effort that would have effectively made them hold more government securities as a way of raising liquidity, or the ability to handle short-term financial shocks.

HEADLINE: Egypt Concedes to Resistance and Backs Off a Privatization Drive

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN

 BODY:
CAIRO -- Back in the 1990s one of Egypt's top economic priorities was the privatization of state-owned industries, as Egypt tried to free itself from a failing, centrally controlled economy. 
 But the government's enthusiasm waned over the years, and last month the government quietly announced that the sale of state assets to individual investors had effectively ended. 
 The act of selling state companies had become radioactive because of resistance from a skeptical public that believed that the transactions were riddled with corruption and insider dealing as well as from powerful old-guard officials who equated the status quo with stability, Egyptian economists and government officials say. 
 In addition, they said, most of the likely candidates had already been either privatized or dissolved, leaving hard-to-sell industries that were technologically outdated and overstaffed with ill-trained workers. 
 And then came the protests. 
 In recent months, thousands of workers have staged demonstrations outside Parliament complaining about the loss of jobs, wages and social protections, often in connection with businesses that have been sold. With so much turmoil, and with parliamentary elections this fall followed by a presidential election next year, the political calculus was obvious, officials said.
 ''The value became less than the headache,'' said Abdel Monem Said Aly, chairman of Al Ahram, a state-owned media group, publishing house and research organization. ''The whole cabinet decided to forget it.''
 The announcement had little practical impact, in part, because it formalized what had already occurred. In the past four years, Egypt sold only seven companies while actually buying back seven from investors, said the Ministry of Investment, which oversees the process.
 ''I am surprised they announced it openly, even though de facto there had been a suspension for a while,'' said Ragui Assaad, an expert on Egypt's economy at the Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs of the University of Minnesota. ''That, to me, seems an attempt to make a concession to all the protesting workers, with the government saying, 'We are protecting your rights.' ''
 Indeed, it appeared as though the statement was the equivalent of a white flag waved by Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif's cabinet. Having been appointed in 2004 with the mandate to repair a moribund economy, Mr. Nazif's team has ''lost momentum,'' said Mr. Said Aly of Al Ahram. ''Now it seems they don't know what to do next.''
 The government made a fundamental mistake, experts say, in failing to reset public expectations fashioned decades ago when the state was the primary provider. Even today, there are about six million civil service employees, Mr. Assaad said.
 ''That is the brake on reform,'' said a government official who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to offend the public. ''They have grown up with the state doing everything: 'You educate me, give me a degree, you give me a job, when I die you bury me -- and I do nothing.' ''
 The uneven nature of Egyptian reform meant, for example, that while the government worked on the economy it neglected retooling an inadequate education system that at its best was intended to prepare graduates to work for the government. One consequence is a shortage of qualified workers in a country with high unemployment. 
 ''Mismanagement is the essence of the problem,'' said Amr El-Shobaki, a political scientist at the Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies. ''People aren't genetically incapable of working.'' 
 Mr. Shobaki and others said that privatization was a way for the friends of the rich and powerful to grow more rich and powerful. Even the government acknowledges that the economic changes have had little impact on average lives.
 Privatization began in earnest in 1991, when Egypt agreed to work with international lenders on an economic restructuring plan to help it repair a failing economy. This represented an effort to accelerate changes started in the 1970s by President Anwar el-Sadat, who began the process of dismantling the state-controlled economy fashioned by President Gamal Abdel Nasser in the 1950s and early '60s.
 The 1991 effort started off easily enough when the state readily found buyers for assets like its beer and cement industries. But over time, the state said it was left with difficult-to-sell assets, outdated factories producing cars, instruments for textile manufacturing and other things that are either obsolete or unwanted. At the same time public pressure became intense as workers complained that their rights were being auctioned off.
 The goal was originally to sell off 314 companies. There are still 150 left: the rest have been sold to investors, gone public on the stock market, dissolved or merged with other state industries.
 ''There is always a cost for reform, but the problem here is that people now have the impression that those who always pay the cost of every reform are the simple people, while businessmen are never held accountable for corruption and while privatization of companies takes place in secret, without the knowledge or participation of the people,'' Mr. Shobaki said.
 Faced with so many obstacles, the government took another approach, trying to open the door to foreign investment while quietly allowing state industries to wither. In the Egyptian context, economists say it is a victory that this work force has shrunk, to about 300,000 from about 1.3 million in 1978.
 The government also adopted a law that allowed state-owned companies to deal with employees in the same way as private-sector companies. This year it began to carry out a new law allowing the private firms to build infrastructure, including sewage plants and hospitals, another unpopular move intended to whittle away the state-dominated system.
 But even those in a position of authority acknowledge that these moves are, at best, incremental. They understand that the next big change that will probably occur is a new president to succeed Hosni Mubarak, 82, who has served for nearly 30 years. 
 The president recently returned to work from a long convalescence in Sharm El Sheik after gallbladder surgery in Germany. His health crisis forced a very public discussion over who would come next. So far, the answer has been that there is no consensus candidate. 
 So the government hunkers down, and waits.
 And the protesters carry on.

HEADLINE: The Third Depression

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Recessions are common; depressions are rare. As far as I can tell, there were only two eras in economic history that were widely described as ''depressions'' at the time: the years of deflation and instability that followed the Panic of 1873 and the years of mass unemployment that followed the financial crisis of 1929-31. 
 Neither the Long Depression of the 19th century nor the Great Depression of the 20th was an era of nonstop decline -- on the contrary, both included periods when the economy grew. But these episodes of improvement were never enough to undo the damage from the initial slump, and were followed by relapses. 
 We are now, I fear, in the early stages of a third depression. It will probably look more like the Long Depression than the much more severe Great Depression. But the cost -- to the world economy and, above all, to the millions of lives blighted by the absence of jobs -- will nonetheless be immense.
 And this third depression will be primarily a failure of policy. Around the world -- most recently at last weekend's deeply discouraging G-20 meeting -- governments are obsessing about inflation when the real threat is deflation, preaching the need for belt-tightening when the real problem is inadequate spending.
 In 2008 and 2009, it seemed as if we might have learned from history. Unlike their predecessors, who raised interest rates in the face of financial crisis, the current leaders of the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank slashed rates and moved to support credit markets. Unlike governments of the past, which tried to balance budgets in the face of a plunging economy, today's governments allowed deficits to rise. And better policies helped the world avoid complete collapse: the recession brought on by the financial crisis arguably ended last summer.
 But future historians will tell us that this wasn't the end of the third depression, just as the business upturn that began in 1933 wasn't the end of the Great Depression. After all, unemployment -- especially long-term unemployment -- remains at levels that would have been considered catastrophic not long ago, and shows no sign of coming down rapidly. And both the United States and Europe are well on their way toward Japan-style deflationary traps. 
 In the face of this grim picture, you might have expected policy makers to realize that they haven't yet done enough to promote recovery. But no: over the last few months there has been a stunning resurgence of hard-money and balanced-budget orthodoxy.
 As far as rhetoric is concerned, the revival of the old-time religion is most evident in Europe, where officials seem to be getting their talking points from the collected speeches of Herbert Hoover, up to and including the claim that raising taxes and cutting spending will actually expand the economy, by improving business confidence. As a practical matter, however, America isn't doing much better. The Fed seems aware of the deflationary risks -- but what it proposes to do about these risks is, well, nothing. The Obama administration understands the dangers of premature fiscal austerity -- but because Republicans and conservative Democrats in Congress won't authorize additional aid to state governments, that austerity is coming anyway, in the form of budget cuts at the state and local levels. 
 Why the wrong turn in policy? The hard-liners often invoke the troubles facing Greece and other nations around the edges of Europe to justify their actions. And it's true that bond investors have turned on governments with intractable deficits. But there is no evidence that short-run fiscal austerity in the face of a depressed economy reassures investors. On the contrary: Greece has agreed to harsh austerity, only to find its risk spreads growing ever wider; Ireland has imposed savage cuts in public spending, only to be treated by the markets as a worse risk than Spain, which has been far more reluctant to take the hard-liners' medicine.
 It's almost as if the financial markets understand what policy makers seemingly don't: that while long-term fiscal responsibility is important, slashing spending in the midst of a depression, which deepens that depression and paves the way for deflation, is actually self-defeating. 
 So I don't think this is really about Greece, or indeed about any realistic appreciation of the tradeoffs between deficits and jobs. It is, instead, the victory of an orthodoxy that has little to do with rational analysis, whose main tenet is that imposing suffering on other people is how you show leadership in tough times. 
 And who will pay the price for this triumph of orthodoxy? The answer is, tens of millions of unemployed workers, many of whom will go jobless for years, and some of whom will never work again.

HEADLINE: Day 68: The Latest on the Oil Spill

 BODY:
Praying for Divine Intervention
 At the request of five governors, Sunday was a day of prayer for divine intervention for the residents of the Gulf Coast states directly affected by the oil spill. In the two months since the deadly Deepwater Horizon explosion began leaking oil into the gulf, damaging the ecosystem and disrupting the economy, all the efforts to stem the flow of oil have either failed or yielded very limited successes. Robots and golf balls and even the massive containment dome seem small in retrospect. So the state leaders felt a supplementary method was in order: coordinated prayer. 
 World Leaders Take Note
 World leaders meeting in Toronto for an economic summit meeting took note of the oil spill in their closing statement on Sunday. ''We recognize the need to share best practices to protect the marine environment, prevent accidents related to offshore exploration and development, as well as transportation, and deal with their consequences,'' the statement said.
 An Appeal for More Resources
 Gov. Haley Barbour said Sunday that he was pressing BP and federal officials to increase resources in Mississippi, where oil has reached the shoreline and continues to flow into the waters around barrier islands. ''While command and control of on-water resources has improved, it must get much better, and the amount of resources to attack the oil offshore must be greatly increased,'' Mr. Barbour said in an e-mailed statement. Mr. Barbour said resources were needed to attack the oil as far south as possible. For weeks, Mississippi's coast had been spared from the oil, which has inundated fragile marshes and beaches in other Gulf Coast states. But in recent days, oil has found its way into the state's waters and barrier islands. Donald Langham, the emergency management director for Jackson County, said tar balls and a patch of oil were spotted on Sunday at the St. Andrews beach and at the Lake Mars pier in Gulf Park Estates. He said cleanup teams were on the scene. Mr. Barbour said more oil was found in the Mississippi Sound, north of Petit Bois and Horn islands.
 Dozens of Pelicans Released in Refuge
 Federal officials said 72 brown pelicans that were rescued from the spill and cleaned had been released at the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge. The refuge, about 175 miles southwest of Houston, meets the pelicans' coastal habitat needs for breeding, the Fish and Wildlife Service officials said.

HEADLINE: Long-Serving Senator Byrd Seriously Ill, Office Says

BYLINE: By JANIE LORBER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senator Robert C. Byrd, the longest-serving senator in United States history, is ''seriously ill,'' his office announced Sunday afternoon.
 Mr. Byrd, a 92-year-old Democrat from West Virginia, was admitted to an undisclosed hospital late last week with symptoms of heat exhaustion and severe dehydration as temperatures in the Washington area approached 100 degrees. Though he was initially expected to remain hospitalized for only a few days, Mr. Byrd's condition deteriorated and his doctors are now describing it as ''serious,'' a spokesman said. 
 Mr. Byrd's absence could pose a challenge to Senate Democrats as they try to pass the final version of the financial overhaul bill and win other procedural battles in the week before the Independence Day recess. 
 Democrats will need every vote they can get. With the midterm elections on the horizon, Washington is as polarized as ever and, for the second time in just over six months, President Obama's agenda could once again hinge on Mr. Byrd's health.
 In the final days of the health care debate, Mr. Byrd appeared for several crucial votes -- pushed each time to the Senate floor in his plaid wheelchair and greeted by handshakes and applause from his colleagues. He spent six weeks in the hospital last spring with a staph infection, prompting persistent speculation about his health and who would replace him if he became too sick to finish his term.
 Mr. Byrd served as the Democratic leader of the Senate for 12 years in the 1970s and 1980s, and he later served several times as chairman of the Appropriations Committee. In November 2008, as the country grappled with the greatest economic crisis since the Depression, Mr. Byrd agreed to relinquish the gavel amid fears that he was no longer up to the task of leading the committee.
 Mr. Byrd, the president pro tem of the Senate, has been a senator since January 1959 and served six years in the House before that. 
 He is known as a fierce guardian of Congressional authority, including spending power, and is an authority on Senate procedure. 
 ''The rules, precedents, customs, practices, traditions and courtesies of the Senate have been forged over hundreds of years and after much trial and experience,'' Mr. Byrd said last month. Some senators may be frustrated with what they see as abuses of Senate rules, he said, but ''the Senate's purpose is to carefully and critically examine, not to expedite.''
 Mr. Byrd became a hero to many liberals in 2003 when he denounced the invasion of Iraq, and he said he was appalled by the silence in the Senate on the eve of the war. Gov. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a Democrat, said on Sunday that he was praying for Mr. Byrd, whom he described as ''a true champion for our state.'' 
 As a senator, Mr. Byrd has cast more than 18,000 votes, many of them for bills that funneled money to projects in his state, where highways, bridges and federal buildings are named in his honor.

HEADLINE: Broadband Availability To Expand

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration is seeking to nearly double the wireless communications spectrum available for commercial use over the next 10 years, an effort that could greatly enhance the ability of consumers to send and receive video and data with smartphones and other hand-held devices.
 President Obama will sign a presidential memorandum on Monday that aims to make available for auction some 500 megahertz of spectrum that is now controlled by the federal government and private companies, administration officials said Sunday. Most of that would be designated for commercial use in mobile broadband and similar applications, though aspects of the plan will require Congressional approval. 
 The effort embraces recommendations made by the Federal Communications Commission in its National Broadband Plan, which was released in March and encourages the expansion of high-speed wireless broadband services. 
 But some aspects could be opposed by television broadcast companies, which will be asked if they want to give up some of their spectrum for auction. Cable companies that have invested heavily in wired telecommunications networks could also lose from the new direction.
 Proceeds from the auctions would go in part to finance the construction of improved communications systems for police, fire and other public safety agencies. Law enforcement agencies have proposed that parts of the newly available wireless spectrum be used for a dedicated broadband public safety network.
 Roughly 45 percent of the spectrum to be auctioned would come from federal government agencies that will be asked to give up allocations that they are not using or could share, according to administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to upstage the announcement.
 The remainder would come from unused spectrum already scheduled for auction or from broadcasters and other spectrum licensees who would be offered incentives to give up or share parts of their communications airwaves. Currently, the spectrum for wireless communications is about 547 megahertz.
 Lawrence H. Summers, the director of the National Economic Council and assistant to the president for economic policy, is expected to detail the broadband effort in a lunchtime speech in Washington to the New America Foundation, a public policy institute.
 ''This initiative will catalyze private sector investment, contribute to economic growth, and help to create hundreds of thousands of jobs,'' Mr. Summers said in a statement. ''This policy is a win three times over. It creates prosperity and jobs while at the same time raising revenue for public purposes like public safety and increasing our ability to compete internationally.''
 While it is not unexpected that the Obama administration would embrace some of the recommendations of the National Broadband Plan, the announcement is significant because it puts momentum behind actions that the F.C.C. does not have the authority to take on its own.
 Specifically, the presidential memorandum will direct the National Telecommunications and Information Administration to identify federally controlled communications bands that can be made available within five years for exclusive or shared use by commercial companies. 
 Negotiations have been continuing between the White House and federal departments including defense, justice, state, Treasury and energy, which use dedicated government spectrum for official and classified communications.
 The administration is expected to ask Congress to approve the use of some of the proceeds from an auction of federal spectrum to finance the upgrading of government communications equipment and systems. 
 Congress would also need to approve the F.C.C.'s use of so-called incentive auctions of spectrum that is already allocated to private companies, including broadcast networks. Those auctions would pay broadcast networks and others to give up unused portions of the spectrum that they license from the federal government, which would then be licensed to or shared with wireless companies.
 Finally, Congress would have to designate how the money generated by auctions should be spent. The plan seeks to use some of the proceeds to build the public safety network that would allow police and fire departments from different jurisdictions to talk to one another in emergencies -- something that generally is not possible now and that was identified as an issue on 9/11.
 Julius Genachowski, the chairman of the F.C.C. and an Obama appointee, welcomed the administration's initiative on Sunday. ''The administration's strong actions on wireless broadband will move us significantly toward sustainable economic success, robust investment, and global leadership in innovation,'' he said.
 In the long term, companies that are developing emerging wireless technologies could benefit from the greater availability of wireless spectrum, industry analysts say. Consumers also could benefit from the actions, as wireless communications continue to improve and more convenient devices are made widely available.
 Some spectrum also would be made available for free, unlicensed use by start-up companies and others, administration officials said. Such unlicensed spectrum has previously helped in the development of cordless phones, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth applications.
 Harold Feld, legal director of Public Knowledge, a consumer-oriented policy group, said the interest of consumers will be most helped by auctions that help to promote competition between wireless companies rather than entrenching the dominant providers in the market.
 Since the release of the F.C.C.'s broadband plan, some broadcasters have expressed doubts about the spectrum allocation recommendations. Dennis Wharton, an executive vice president at the National Association of Broadcasters, said that while expanding broadband is important, it should not be done at the expense of broadcasting, which provides free, local television service to tens of millions of Americans. 
 ''We appreciate F.C.C. assurances that further reclamation of broadcast television spectrum will be completely voluntary,'' Mr. Wharton said.
 With the recent conversion of analog broadcast signals to digital, broadcasters returned 108 megahertz of spectrum to the government for auction. Some of the wireless companies that bought that spectrum have not developed all of it, leaving broadcasters wary of giving up more of their holdings to companies that might simply warehouse it, industry officials say.

HEADLINE: Seeking God's Help For a Wounded Gulf

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY

 BODY:
BON SECOUR, Ala. -- In a small white building along the baptizing Bon Secour River, a building that once housed a shrimp-net business, the congregation of the Fishermen Baptist Church gathered for another Sunday service, with the preacher presiding from a pulpit designed to look like a ship captain's wheel.
 After the singing of the opening hymn, ''Ring the Bells of Heaven,'' and the announcement that an engaged couple was now registered at Wal-Mart, the preacher read aloud a proclamation from Gov. Bob Riley that declared this to be a ''day of prayer'' -- a day of entreaties to address the ominous threat to the way of life just outside the church's white doors. 
 Whereas, and whereas, and whereas, the proclamation read. People of Alabama, please pray for your fellow citizens, for other states hurt by this disaster, for all those who are responding. And pray ''that a solution that stops the oil leak is completed soon.''
 In other words, dear God, thank you for your blessings and guidance. And one other thing, dear God: 
 Help.
 The governor's words hung a moment in the fan-turned air. Then the preacher, Shawn Major, summoned the men of the church to the front to ''ask God to do something special.'' 
 Two dozen men, many of them wearing short-sleeve shirts in summery colors, knelt and sat with heads bowed and eyes closed, while a half-mile down the street, other men -- and women -- underwent training in the use of a more secular form of hope, the laying of boom.
 The wall between church and state came a-tumbling down on Sunday, as elected leaders from the five states on the Gulf of Mexico issued proclamations declaring it to be a day of prayer. Although days of prayer are not uncommon here -- Governor Riley declared one asking for rain to relieve a drought a few years ago -- these proclamations conveyed the sense that at this late date, salvation from the spill all but requires divine intervention.
 In the two months since the deadly Deepwater Horizon explosion began a ceaseless leak of oil into the gulf, damaging the ecosystem and disrupting the economy, the efforts by mortals to stem the flow have failed. Robots and golf balls and even the massive capping dome all seem small in retrospect. 
 So, then, a supplementary method was attempted: coordinated prayer.
 In Texas, Gov. Rick Perry encouraged Texans to ask God ''for his merciful intervention and healing in this time of crisis.'' In Mississippi, Gov. Haley Barbour declared that prayer ''allows us an opportunity to reflect and to seek guidance, strength, comfort and inspiration from Almighty God.'' In Louisiana, Gov. Bobby Jindal invoked the word ''whereas'' a dozen times -- as well as the state bird, the brown pelican -- but made no direct mention of God. In Florida, Lt. Gov. Jeff Kottkamp asked people to pray that God ''would guide and direct our civil leaders and provide them with wisdom and divinely inspired solutions.''
 The suggestion by government to beseech God for help -- to petition a power higher than any elected official -- rang out in churches and halls from Pensacola, Fla., to Galveston, Tex., as well as here, in Bon Secour, where Brother Harry prayed with head bowed.
 The Fishermen Baptist Church has been in this village, whose name means safe harbor, since 1989. An anchor is planted in its front lawn. Its walls are adorned with paintings of nautical scenes. Its collection boxes are a miniature lighthouse and a treasure chest. The dock across the street is used for baptisms and fishing.
 These are all reflections of the church's founder and pastor, Wayne Mund, who grew up here. His father, grandfather and great-grandfather were fishermen, and so was he, until the age of 21, when he dropped his nets and went off to Bible school. 
 Pastor Mund, 66, lanky and proud to call himself a Bible Baptist, works hard to incorporate his seafaring past into his mission. He sees the Bible, from the Book of Genesis to the Book of Revelation, as a nautical book, and the sea as a mesmerizing draw. He will end conversation by warning that those who do not climb aboard God's boat of salvation ''will drown in a sea of sin and despair.''
 And now the oily despair in the sea is affecting his small church, his community. Fewer envelopes are being slipped into the treasure chest and lighthouse at the back of the room because some of his 200 congregants can no longer afford to tithe. Fewer people are attending service because fishermen, who normally take Sundays off, are now working for BP to help clean up its goo, which is washing up in Gulf Shores and Mobile Bay.
 ''The sea, the sea, the sea,'' Pastor Mund says. ''It has to do with the sea.''
 Pastor Mund expected to be out of town on Sunday, so he assigned an associate pastor, Mr. Major, to preside over the 10:30 service. Mr. Major is 46, stocky and more apt to smile than his boss when proselytizing. The spill affecting the river, the world, has been difficult for him to fathom, and he expects that the human toll will not be felt for another year.
 Mr. Major spent Saturday with 70 men and women, all learning the proper way to lay boom. But now he was with 70 other men and women, all praying from nine wooden pews; all saying amen to his assertion that ''We are still a Christian nation''; all nodding when he said that everyone knew ''who ultimately will stop'' the spill. 
 A missionary about to leave for Brazil was waiting to make a multimedia presentation, but first these kneeling men, led by Brother Harry -- Harry Mund, a relative of the pastor's -- needed to finish their prayer. 
 Please God, help us with ''this awful oil spill,'' he said. In Jesus' name. Amen.
 The men rose from their knees and returned to their pews, a couple of them rubbing the salty wet from their eyes.

HEADLINE: Czech President to Name Fiscal Conservative as Prime Minister

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY

 BODY:
PRAGUE --President Vaclav Klaus of the Czech Republic said Sunday he would appoint a center-right leader, Petr Necas, as the country's new prime minister on Monday, clearing the way for a government that is both pro-American and focused on fiscal austerity. 
 The appointment of Mr. Necas, whose Civic Democratic Party is in coalition talks with two new rightist parties -- the conservative TOP 09 and the rightist Public Affairs -- will help bring an end to a drawn-out period of instability in Czech politics. The country has been run by a caretaker government since a coalition led by the Civic Democrats lost a vote of no confidence in March 2009. 
 Mr. Necas, 45, who previously served as a social affairs minister, has vowed to slash a budget deficit that stands at about 5.9 percent of the country's gross domestic product. He has said he wants coalition talks to conclude by early July so the new government can push through a belt-tightening budget for 2011. 
 Center-right parties here won a majority in May's parliamentary elections after voters, alarmed by the Greek economic crisis, gave parties favoring fiscal austerity the most votes. During the campaign, TOP 09, led by Karel Schwarzenberg, a popular former foreign minister who could resume that role, sought to scare voters away from the left by sending them mock invoices showing the country's growing debt.
 The Czech economy has been resilient compared to neighbors like Hungary, though the economy shrunk 4.1 percent last year amid a sharp contraction in the export markets upon which the country depends. Economists say the new government will face the challenge that governments face across the continent to promote fiscal austerity without hurting growth.
 Political analysts described Mr. Necas as a hard-working pragmatist, with free-market instincts and a keen commitment to the European Union and NATO. The new government is expected to seek close ties with the Obama administration and to fulfill the previous government's pledge to host elements of a reformulated American missile defense system. 
 Late last year President Obama canceled former President George W. Bush's plans to station a radar facility in the Czech Republic, and 10 ground-based interceptors in Poland, raising some concerns in the region that he was appeasing Russia at the expense of regional security. Instead, he ordered the development of a revamped system designed to shoot down short- and medium-range Iranian missiles, with the Czech Republic expected to play an as-yet unspecified role.
 The elections in May handed the conservative Civic Democratic Party and the two new parties 118 seats in the 200-seat Parliament. A coalition government of the three parties would have a comfortable majority and a strong mandate to enact difficult changes, including plans to shake up the country's bloated pension and health care systems.

HEADLINE: Labor's New Critics: Old Allies in Elected Office

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
TRENTON -- Stephen M. Sweeney, the president of the State Senate here, glowered with disgust as he described how one New Jersey town paid out nearly $1 million to four retiring police officers for their unused sick days and vacation time. 
 Mr. Sweeney, a Democrat, also scowled about the estimated $46 billion New Jersey owes in pension contributions and its $58 billion in liabilities to finance retiree health coverage for government employees.
 For years, Republican lawmakers have railed against public employees' pay and benefits, but now another breed of elected official is demanding labor concessions, too: current and former labor leaders and allies themselves. 
 After 12 years erecting steel beams for office buildings, Mr. Sweeney became a top official in New Jersey's ironworkers union, now holding that post along with his legislative one. He says the state can no longer afford the benefits won over the years by public sector unions. 
 ''At some point, you reach the limit of your ability to pay,'' he said.
 In Oregon, Gov. Theodore R. Kulongoski, a former lawyer representing the state employees' union, is insisting upon wage concessions from those very workers. In Los Angeles, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, a former teachers' union organizer, is battling once-friendly unions, demanding $100 million in concessions. 
 In New York, Gov. David A. Paterson, a longtime union ally whose father is a top adviser to several unions, is threatening large-scale layoffs unless public sector unions agree to a pay freeze and re-open contracts.
 The transition from labor ally to labor critic can be bruising. Viewing Mr. Sweeney as a traitor, several public sector unions in New Jersey are threatening to get another Democrat to challenge him and have hired airplanes to fly over the Jersey Shore with banners denouncing him. They have even dragged out giant inflatable rats to embarrass him at speaking engagements.
 ''I'm getting branded as an antilabor person by the public employee unions, which amazes me because I've spent my lifetime doing right by working men and women,'' said Mr. Sweeney, who has sponsored legislation that raised the state minimum wage and required companies to provide paid sick days. ''I'm a labor leader, but I'm also elected to do right by all the people in the state of New Jersey, and not just union members.''
 Another New Jersey Democrat, Donald Norcross, who is both a state senator and president of the Southern New Jersey Central Labor Council, has been told by several public sector unions that they will not contribute a cent toward his Senate re-election campaign because he has backed so many of Mr. Sweeney's proposals. And in Los Angeles, Mr. Villaraigosa has faced hostile union-paid advertisements and librarians demonstrating outside his home on Father's Day.
 For decades, many state and city politicians, especially Democratic ones, helped assure their re-election by cozying up to public-sector unions and benefiting from their campaign dollars and precinct walkers. Prior to their current jobs, Mr. Paterson did just that as Democratic leader of the New York State Senate and Mr. Villaraigosa did the same as a member of the California State Assembly. 
 Like many labor-friendly politicians, they happily voted for pension sweeteners and other benefits for unions. But now, with cities and states struggling to close budget gaps, there is a glaring need to scale back costs of all kinds, and public employees are a favorite target.
 Last year, 51 percent of cities froze or reduced pay, according to the National League of Cities, while 25 percent laid off workers, 24 percent reduced health benefits and 22 percent revised union contracts to reduce pay and benefits. According to the Pew Center on the States, states are $452 billion behind in their pension contributions while also having $554 billion in liabilities for retiree health care. 
 Even with the resistance from public sector unions, some elected officials are realizing that getting tough with the unions can be good politics in down economic times, as government employees' benefits are held up as examples of excess -- and as taxpayers (and voters) demand greater accountability.
 Gary N. Chaison, a professor and labor expert at Clark University, said some Democratic officials now see it as a ''badge of honor'' to take on the unions.''They see it as a way to show their independence,'' he said. 
 At a time when many private sector workers have been badly squeezed by stagnant wages, soaring health care premiums and shrinking 401(k)'s, resentment has grown even among private sector union members toward the public employee unions. ''It's almost as if the private sector is blaming the public sector as the spoiled child in the house of labor,'' Professor Chaison said. 
 Hetty Rosenstein, state director of the Communications Workers of America, New Jersey's main government workers' union, sees these moves as scapegoating.
 ''You can drum up a lot of resentment when people are hurting economically,'' Ms. Rosenstein said. ''It's very, very hard to see people so angry at teachers and social workers.''
 In New York, Danny Donohue, president of the Civil Service Employees Association of New York, said union members feel betrayed by Mr. Paterson. 
 ''If you told me five years ago that David Paterson would be our enemy, I would have laughed at you,'' Mr. Donohue said. ''He's trying to balance a $9 billion deficit on the backs of public employees.'' The Paterson administration says it is asking many parties to sacrifice. 
 In New Jersey, Mr. Sweeney faulted many public employee union leaders for not telling their members the hard facts.
 ''All you get is finger-pointing,'' he said. ''They don't tell their people that they got them these things without a way to pay for them long-term.''
 As New Jersey's top Democrat and second-most powerful official, Mr. Sweeney has made proposal after proposal to rein in labor costs, like setting a $15,000 cap for cashing out unused vacation and sick days and requiring all state employees to pay 1.5 percent of their wages toward their health coverage. 
 But some union officials have criticized Mr. Sweeney for collecting more than $150,000 a year from the three jobs he holds simultaneously -- Senate president, county freeholder and union official. He responds that he works 16-hour days and donates his county salary to charity.
 In demanding cutbacks, Mr. Sweeney does not go as far as New Jersey's Republican governor, Chris Christie. Mr. Sweeney has called for eliminating -- for all future state hires -- a 9 percent pension increase that a Republican governor pushed through in 2001. Mr. Christie would also eliminate that increase for current employees and retirees now receiving pensions and set a 2.5 percent annual cap on any increase in teachers' contracts.
 Ms. Rosenstein, of the communications workers, said many state workers in New Jersey have already taken an 18-month wage freeze and 10 unpaid furlough days. Moreover, she said, public pensions are in trouble not because they are too generous, but because many years the state failed to make the $2 billion annual contribution needed to keep the pension fund solvent (while most employees' contributions have increased to 5.5 percent of pay, from 3 percent).
 ''People talk of shared sacrifice,'' Ms. Rosenstein said. ''We've already sacrificed.''

HEADLINE: Faustian Bargains and the Testing of the Liberals

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Faustus Makes a Deal,'' by David Brooks (column, June 22): I enjoyed Mr. Brooks's conceit in which the liberal Dr. Faustus sells his soul to Mephistopheles in return for the granting of wishes that will supposedly demonstrate the superiority of liberal ideology. As is the custom in Faustian bargains, things go terribly wrong and liberalism ends up losing popular appeal. 
 This is all fiendishly clever, but then, of course, the devil is in the details. And in this case, the deal must be with some third-rate devil. Just look at the mostly unconditional TARP bailouts for Wall Street, the white flag on single-payer health care and the ceding of effective authority to BP in the oil spill: strong progressive magic has simply not been attempted.
 The soul in question here all along has been that of split-the-difference centrism, not true liberalism.
 Russ Weiss Princeton Junction, N.J., June 22, 2010
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks suggests that the country's move toward political conservatism is a result of the Obama administration's liberal agenda. I don't think that shift has much to do with President Obama's agenda (liberal or otherwise). It is the result of the catastrophic economic situation and rampant deregulation that were left at Mr. Obama's doorstep on the day he took office.
 Unfortunately, the body politic in our country has a short memory. It prefers to hold a president accountable for the economic and environmental disasters when he has been in office less than a year and a half.
 Neil Stein Brooklyn, June 22, 2010
 To the Editor:
 The Republican message of tax cuts, strong defense and balanced budgets is easy for people to understand. Health care reform, a new energy policy and stronger environmental protections are not as clear-cut and require sacrifice on the part of the American people.
 The Republicans have provided tax cuts and strong defense but not balanced budgets -- the one part of their policy that would require sacrifice. As long as they shift the pain into the future, they will be successful in their message.
 If Republicans convince Americans that deficits matter, they will win this fall. But they will face the consequences down the road when people expect them to either raise taxes or cut spending. They have shown no willingness to do either, and eventually both will need to be done if we are to compete in the 21st century.
 Henry Rosenberg South Windsor, Conn., June 22, 2010
 To the Editor:
 I like the sentiment behind David Brooks's statement that ''if your policies undermine personal responsibility by separating the link between effort and reward, voters will punish you for it.''
 If that is the case, then the current polling numbers favorable to Republicans, who never seem to blink at the yawning disparity between effort and reward, will prove ephemeral.
 Chief executives are making thousands of dollars an hour, which means they collect in a few hours what minimum-wage workers, often performing the toughest and least savory jobs around, earn in a year. Here's hoping Mr. Brooks is right, that voters will punish those who promote policies that so grossly de-link reward and effort.

HEADLINE: A Magazine Back on a Roll

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
In its early days in the 1960s and '70s, Rolling Stone was a chronicle of the counterculture where a generation of young people came to find political coverage that spoke to their disaffection. 
 Then those baby boomers grew up, and Rolling Stone's voice seemed to fall flat.
 But no more. Those same subversive tendencies that led Jann Wenner to help found the magazine in 1967 were reawakened under the presidency of George W. Bush. And now, rather unexpectedly, Mr. Wenner's magazine is hitting its journalistic stride -- aggressively tackling the American government on financial regulation, the environment and the war in Afghanistan -- with a Democrat in the White House, one that Mr. Wenner supported. 
 Mr. Wenner said Rolling Stone's more antagonistic tack is, in a sense, a way of shaking off the cultural complacency many liberals felt in the 1990s. 
 ''Everything was kind of hunky-dory under Clinton,'' Mr. Wenner said in a telephone interview last week. ''With Bush, between 9/11 and his response to it, he put the country in pretty serious danger. And that kind of got our juices going again.'' 
 Rolling Stone's explosive piece ''The Runaway General,'' which last week brought a disgraceful end to Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal's career, was just the latest in a string of articles resonating in the nation's corridors of power. 
 Its excoriating takedown of Goldman Sachs last summer was one of the most provocative and widely debated pieces of journalism to come out of the financial crisis. In the article, the writer Matt Taibbi described the investment bank as ''a great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money.''
 And this month, the magazine published a critical take on the Obama administration's regulation of the oil industry, which started a firestorm on cable news and in the blogosphere. (The current issue contains a follow-up on BP's plans to drill in the Arctic.)
 Mr. Wenner said he had been emboldened by what he described as a sense of disappointment over Mr. Obama's first 18 months in office. ''I'm for Obama, but I think he needs to make some course corrections,'' Mr. Wenner said. The unforgiving and hard-nosed publisher then mustered about as much sympathy as he could and added, ''I realize he's got a tough job.''
 As many of his peers in the magazine world have gathered moss, Mr. Wenner has pushed Rolling Stone back uphill. While its single copy sales for the first three months of 2010 were down slightly from 2009, it has attracted enormous attention for its political coverage and consistently draws a young readership, with an average age of 30. 
 Over all, the biweekly magazine's circulation has grown to about 1.5 million copies an issue from about 1.4 million in 2008. 
 More unusually, the masthead of the magazine, which has been known to churn through editors under Mr. Wenner, has also been remarkably stable for the last several years. Will Dana, the managing editor, has held that position since 2005. Mr. Dana's predecessor, Ed Needham, quit after being on the job three years.
 Under Mr. Dana, the magazine has put more of its resources into longer profiles and investigative pieces.
 ''This is what we do,'' Mr. Dana said. ''We let our reporters run.''
 Rolling Stone's success also could be, in part, a function of its publishing schedule. Many newsweeklies have faltered and lost their impact on shaping the national conversation, but as a biweekly Rolling Stone has thrived in defiance of a digital age in which articles are supposed to appear then vanish within hours.
 ''In a way the advantage almost goes to monthlies or biweeklies in that we don't chase the previous week,'' said Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity Fair. ''We sort of describe and cover our own worlds as we see them. And you have the time and the space to spread out a story and go after it in a deeper way.''
 Vanity Fair has published its share of bombshells in recent years, the most stunning being its revelation of the identify of the Watergate source known as Deep Throat. The magazine reported in 2005 that W. Mark Felt, a top-ranking F.B.I. official during the Nixon administration, was the source for The Washington Post as it exposed the Watergate scandal.
 Mr. Carter says biweekly publications have the best of both worlds: they can respond nimbly to the news and take their time on longer enterprise pieces. 
 ''Rolling Stone sort of owns even a better schedule being fortnightly, being not weekly, and not monthly. And they've had a hell of a run the last few weeks,'' he said.
 Of course, Rolling Stone is something of an anomaly among its peers in national affairs reporting because it had always pushed against the limits of objective journalism. It was the longtime home of Hunter S. Thompson.
 Some close to General McChrystal have grumbled anonymously to newspapers that the critical comments the general and his aides uttered in front of the Rolling Stone reporter were off the record. The reporter, Michael Hastings, has denied that, saying that few ground rules were set for his interactions with the general.
 One side-effect of the McChrystal piece could be to make magazines rethink what a Northwestern journalism professor, Charles Whitaker, described as a dumbing down of coverage.
 ''I think it's encouraging for writers and editors because they can say we can still have impact,'' Mr. Whitaker said. ''We don't have to pander so much to an audience with pop culture stories. We can continue to do these kinds of stories, which are expensive and hard to report.''

HEADLINE: Box Office Measures Star Power

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
The weekend box office delivered very different results for three A-list stars, as Adam Sandler hit another home run in ''Grown Ups,'' and Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz whiffed in ''Knight and Day.'' 
 The No. 1 movie in North American theaters was Disney-Pixar's ''Toy Story 3,'' which sold about $59 million in its second weekend for a new domestic total of $227 million, according to Hollywood.com, which compiles ticketing statistics. But the movie capital's focus was on the battle of the box office all-stars -- or at least what's left of them.
 ''Grown Ups,'' a Sony Pictures Entertainment release, stars Mr. Sandler and a small armada of other funnymen, including David Spade, Kevin James, Rob Schneider and Chris Rock. The comedy, estimated to cost about $70 million to produce, sold about $41 million in tickets, placing second for the weekend and extending Mr. Sandler's consistent run in goofball pictures.
 Mr. Cruise and Ms. Diaz, co-starring in ''Knight and Day,'' weren't as lucky. That $107 million action comedy, released by 20th Century Fox, was third with about $20.5 million. The result appeared to seal Mr. Cruise's worst summer debut in nearly two decades. (His ''Far and Away'' opened to $16 million, when adjusting for inflation, in late May of 1992.)
 Fox seemed relieved ''Knight and Day'' did as well as it did. 
 ''We are really happy with this number,'' said Chris Aronson, the studio's senior vice president for domestic distribution. Citing a sales uptick from Friday to Saturday, Mr. Aronson added, ''The way the movie is playing is indicative of the great word-of-mouth that we always knew it would have with adult audiences.''
 Slamming Mr. Cruise has almost become a cottage industry in the media, particularly online, following his erratic public appearances in recent years. ''Knight and Day'' will surely add fresh fodder. 
 But there is a lot of blame to go around. Ms. Diaz, whose live-action track record has been shaky of late, didn't bring out her usual young audience in great numbers. Fox's marketing was disjointed at best. Some industry veterans point to an overly developed script, which was put through endless rewrites. 
 Fox hopes adult moviegoers, who often stay home on opening weekend, will ultimately power ''Knight and Day'' to a solid total. Overseas markets, where Mr. Cruise remains a formidable draw, will also be crucial; in limited release internationally the picture took in $12.6 million.
 The studio opened ''Knight and Day'' on Wednesday after it became clear that it was in trouble. The picture's five-day total was about $28 million.
 For the weekend Sony's ''Karate Kid'' remake was fourth with about $15.4 million for a new total of about $135.6 million. ''The A-Team'' (Fox) was fifth with $6 million ($62.8 million total).

HEADLINE: Global Group Warns Banks Of the West Remain Risky

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
BASEL, SWITZERLAND -- An organization that brings together most of the world's major central banks said Monday that the easy money that has propped up the banking system during the financial crisis must soon be withdrawn -- even as it warned that many banks are still in fragile health. 
 ''Exceptional government and central bank support was needed to quell the enormous uncertainty and market disruption during the crisis,'' said Jaime Caruana, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements, whose board includes the U.S. Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and the European Central Bank president, Jean-Claude Trichet.
 ''But keeping support measures in place over a long period creates moral hazard,'' meaning it can encourage risky behavior, Mr. Caruana said at a news conference following the organization's annual meeting in Basel. 
 Many banks in Europe and the United States remain heavily leveraged and dependent on central bank support, the B.I.S. said in its annual report. Without naming specific countries, the report said that policymakers must begin raising official interest rates to avert inflation and wean banks from their dependency on the massive amounts of cash that the E.C.B., Fed and other central banks have provided.
 ''You may need to raise rates before your comfort zone, that is what we are saying,'' Mr. Caruana said. 
 The underlying message from Mr. Caruana, former governor of the Bank of Spain, and of the B.I.S. report seemed to be that many banks will soon face a day of reckoning. The removal of government and central bank support and a return to higher interest rates, along with public stress tests planned for European banks, will force them to write down losses on toxic assets and depend on markets for funding. 
 Banks will also face more regulation that, the B.I.S. report said, may crimp short-term profits but provide more reliable earnings over time. Mr. Caruana dismissed assertions by the banking industry that new regulations will cripple economic growth. The costs of new rules, which include requiring banks to hold more capital in reserve, are ''low and temporary,'' Mr. Caruana said.
 Mr. Caruana also said that he does not expect any delay in implementing new banking rules, despite signals to the contrary from the meeting of the G-20 nations in Toronto last weekend. ''The only thing I read there is significant support,'' Mr. Caruana said. Detailed proposals will be ready by the G-20's November summit, he said, though he added that implementation of new regulations will depend on the state of the economy.
 While the participants in the Toronto talks said they intended to adopt the rules by the end of 2012, they cautioned that the standards would be ''phased in over a time frame that is consistent with sustained recovery and limits market disruption.''
 Those negotiations over what is being called Basel III are conducted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, a body of regulators that meets at the B.I.S. headquarters, but is separate from the settlements bank.
 The Basel Committee, which sets standards that are then carried out by national regulators, wants to tighten the definition of what can be counted as Tier1 capital, which is the basic measure of what banks hold against the risk of future losses.
 The committee also wants banks to have enough liquid assets to survive a short-term market plunge, by reducing their dependence on short-term wholesale financing.
 But banks across the world have been pressing for a delay or even a rewriting of the proposed rules, in part by arguing that the new standards could hamper the global recovery.
 Mario Draghi, the chairman of the Financial Stability Board, a global coordination body that works closely with the Basel Committee, said Sunday that it would be better to delay putting the standards in effect than to weaken them.
 ''The quality and amount of capital in the banking system must be significantly higher to improve loss absorbency and resiliency,'' Mr. Draghi, the governor of the Bank of Italy, wrote in a letter to the G-20 leaders.
 The B.I.S. also joined the G-20 in calling for governments to reduce their deficits, arguing that solid public finances will promote economic recovery by raising confidence. ''It's not just market confidence, it's also consumer confidence and investor confidence,'' Mr. Caruana said. ''The risks of not moving rapidly in fiscal consolidation are high.''
 While noting that emerging markets such as China, India and Brazil have bounced back from the global recession quickly, the B.I.S. warned that they face higher inflation and other symptoms of overheating if interest rates remain low. Borrowing by consumers has risen, real estate prices are up and international investors are funneling money to emerging markets because of the better returns they offer compared with the United States, Europe and Japan. 
 In comments that appeared aimed at China, the report said emerging countries were unlikely to be able to resist upward pressure on their currencies by means of capital controls or intervention in money markets. ''There may be no alternative to raising interest rates, allowing greater flexibility in exchange rates and reducing reliance on foreign exchange intervention,'' the report said. 
 The B.I.S. report was often critical of the banking industry, in tune with what seems to be growing frustration among central bankers toward financial institutions that engage in high-risk practices while resisting more oversight. 
 ''The crisis exposed deficiencies in the financial sector's business model that had prevailed for several decades,'' the settlements bank said. Financial institutions earned high profit only by leveraging ''opaque and illiquid balance sheets,'' the report said. ''Their performance has been volatile at all times and subpar in periods of general stress.'' 
 Banks remain overly dependent on short-term funding, which can dry up abruptly in a crisis, the report warned. 
 The Bank for International Settlements, which provides a platform for transactions among more than 50 central banks as well as a forum for debate, has been at the forefront of calls for new rules to restrain risky practices by banks and avoid future crises. 
 Among other measures, the B.I.S. has called for changes to banker pay to remove incentives to make risky bets; more disclosure by banks of their holdings and trading activity; and wind-down procedures to prevent the failures of individual banks from taking down the whole system. 
 The report said that banks faced the expiration during the next two years of $3 trillion in bonds that they have issued. The banks will have to pay sharply higher interest rates than before the financial crisis. 
 ''Banks that have trouble tapping new funding sources will have to shrink,'' the report said. 
 In a statement, Christian Noyer, chairman of the B.I.S. and governor of the Bank of France, also seemed to be signaling that it is time for governments to take the lead in restoring stability to the financial system.
 ''Over the past two years policymakers worldwide, acting in close cooperation, have succeeded in containing the financial crisis,'' he said in a statement. ''The main tasks of the public sector now is to design policies that minimize the risks of future financial crises and promote sustainable growth.''
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Preparing More Care Of Elderly

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
With a nudge from the new health care law and pressure from Medicare, hospitals, doctors and nurses are struggling to prepare for explosive growth in the numbers of high-risk elderly patients. 
 More than 40 percent of adult patients in acute care hospital beds are 65 or older. Seventy million Americans will have turned 65 by 2030. They include the 85-and-older cohort, the nation's fastest-growing age group. 
 Elderly people often have multiple chronic illnesses, expensive to treat, and they are apt to require costly hospital readmissions, sometimes as often as 10 times in a single year. 
 The Obama administration is spending $500 millionfrom last year's stimulus package to support the training of doctors and nurses and other health care providers at all levels, ''from college teachers through work force professionals on the front lines of patient care,'' said Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services. 
 But the administration and Congress seem to be paying less attention to geriatric health issues. For example, only 11 percent of research funding at the National Institutes of Health went to aging research last year. 
 ''In every area of aging -- education, clinical care, research -- people just don't realize how dire the situation is,'' said Dr. David B. Reuben, chief of the geriatrics division of the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles. 
 Dr. Judith Salerno, a geriatrician who is executive officer of the Institute of Medicine in Washington, agreed. ''All the most common causes of death and illness and functional impairment in the general population are diseases of aging,'' she said.
 At N.I.H., the director, Dr. Francis S. Collins, sees the picture in different terms. He says N.I.H. budgets are tight across the board, not just for aging research, after a $10 billion spike from stimulus funds. 
 ''The opportunities in aging research are compelling,'' Dr. Collins said in a telephone interview. He mentioned a study last year on mice that lived significantly longer after being given rapamycin, a cancer and immunosuppressive drug. 
 ''That is turning out to be the most exciting new pathway for extending normal life span that has ever been discovered,'' Dr. Collins said. But he said the opportunities were also compelling in cancer, diabetes, mental illness and autism. 
 ''It is frustrating to have such great opportunities and limited budget resources,'' Dr. Collins said. They all need more funds, he added.
 In hospitals and doctors' offices, where explaining to elderly patients how to deal with their often-complicated problems can be time-consuming, payments from Medicare, Medicaid and most private insurers are not sufficient, said Dr. J. Fred Ralston Jr., president of the 129,000-member American College of Physicians.
 ''The payment system doesn't finance the kind of resources we need to take care of the 20 percent of Medicare patients who use 80 percent of resources,'' he said. 
 Dr. Mark R. Chassin, a former New York State health commissioner, said, ''The biggest challenge that we face with the increasing numbers of very elderly folks is how to preserve as much independence in their lives as possible.'' Dr. Chassin heads the Joint Commission, which accredits thousands of hospitals and other health care providers. 
 To stay independent, the elderly will need to stay healthy.
 ''Many of these people could be back on the golf course and enjoying their grandchildren if we did the right thing for them,'' said Mary D. Naylor, a longtime geriatric care researcher and professor of gerontology in the School of Nursing at the University of Pennsylvania. 
 Her research showed that even fragile older people could avoid a quick return to the hospital if they are managed by teams of nurses, social workers, physicians and therapists, together with their own family members. Hospital readmissions, which cost $17 billion a year, could be reduced by 20 percent -- $3.5 billion -- or more, she said. 
 Hospitals will be penalized by cuts in their Medicare payments, starting in 2012, if too many patients are readmitted within 30 days after being discharged. 
 Dr. Reuben at U.C.L.A. said research showed that ''vulnerable elderly people who are at risk of becoming frail often do not get appropriate care. For dementia, falls, bladder incontinence, depression, they get about a third of the care they need.'' 
 He added: ''If somebody is falling, it makes sense to examine their gait and their balance. If someone has bladder incontinence, you might want to have them do exercises, but their doctors commonly reach for the next drug they can give them.'' 
 Hospitals are training their staffs to make special assessments of patients who may be at risk of falling, a major threat for the elderly. A fall-prevention program is a requirement for Joint Commission accreditation. 
 Many internists, family physicians and other primary care doctors are lobbying for payments for a team approach based in the physician's office. The concept, which they call a patient-centered medical home, will be tried out under the new health care law by Medicare, Medicaid and some private insurers. Secretary Sebelius has called the medical home idea ''one of our most promising models for improving the quality of care and bringing down health care costs.''
 Geraldine Goldsmith, a patient at New York University's Langone Medical Center, said a team of N.Y.U. geriatric care specialists ''taught me how to survive'' during her long fight against sickle cell anemia, a genetic blood disorder. 
 To stave off a painful sickle cell crisis, which may put her in the hospital as often as every six weeks, Ms. Goldsmith, who is 73, gets continuous support from Marilyn Lopez, a geriatric nurse practitioner. 
 Caring for the elderly is ''a profession of the heart,'' Ms. Lopez said. 
 Ms. Goldsmith said the geriatric team ''makes sure that I eat proper food, take my medications, keep my appointments -- as you get older, you forget.'' 
 She added that Ms. Lopez ''calls and says: 'Geraldine, look at your calendar. I'm going to see you tomorrow.' '' 
 At the N.Y.U. medical center, an electronic screening system tracks patients who may be at risk for problems with cognition, falls, nutrition, pain, skin conditions like pressure ulcers, and taking multiple medications, Ms. Lopez said. Similarly, at the University of Alabama Hospital at Birmingham, Susan B. Powell, a nurse practitioner, sees to it that medications prescribed for older patients are checked by a pharmacist against a list of drugs found to be unsafe for the elderly. So many of these patients are seeing six or eight doctors and end up with many prescriptions, Ms. Powell said. 
 After elderly patients are sent home, she telephones to remind them to contact a physician and to follow orders from their nurses and doctors.
 Both hospitals use a precise set of methods and principles for geriatric care called Niche (for Nurses Improving Care for Healthsystem Elders). With support from the John A. Hartford Foundation and the Atlantic Philanthropies, the Niche program has spread to 300 hospitals around the country. 
 Although the recession has made finding jobs difficult for recent nursing graduates in places like New York and California, the Labor Department has said that 600,000 new nurses would be needed within 10 years to replace those who retire and to meet growing demand. 
 Currently, 11,000 of the nation's 3.1 million registered nurses are certified as geriatric nurses or nurse practitioners. Buttens of thousands of student nurses are now learning about the special needs of the elderly as part of their regular studies, said Geraldine Bednash, chief executive of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing.
 Every student nurse at N.Y.U. spends time working with elderly patients. ''Before long, 90 percent of American nurses will have to provide care for older adults,'' said Terry Fulmer, dean of the N.Y.U. College of Nursing. Ms. Fulmer helped create and develop the Niche approach.
 This year, the National Health Service Corps, a unit of the Department of Health and Human Services, is doubling its program that repays student loans for caregivers who work in rural and underserved urban neighborhoods. Family practice doctors, nurse practitioners, dentists and others who care for the elderly areamong those eligible. The administration has allocated $300 million in stimulus funds to support about 7,800 graduates.
 With stimulus money and $34 million more under the new health care law, the administration is also expanding training for geriatric specialists who commit to teaching student physicians and nurses.
 ''As we talk about needing more health care providers of all kinds,'' Ms. Sebelius said in a telephone interview, ''we are also retraining current providers'' to become better at geriatric care. 
 But doctors are generally not paid extra for the time they spend in lengthy meetings listening to elderly patients with multiple problems. ''Geriatricians work in one of the few fields where the more you know, the less you are paid,'' said Dr. Salerno of the Institute of Medicine.
 Not surprisingly, specialists in geriatric care are in short supply. There are only about 7,000 geriatricians to deal with the aging boomer generation over the next 10 years, Dr. Reuben said. More than 20,000 will be needed, according to the American Geriatrics Society, a professional and advocacy group. To help fill that gap, all first-year interns in internal medicine at the Birmingham medical school are spending four weeks with geriatric patients this year. They are part of a $200 million national effort to promote geriatric education principally financed by the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation, based in Las Vegas.
 Dr. Kellie Flood, a geriatrician who directs the Birmingham program, discusses newly admitted elderly patients at 10 a.m. daily with Ms. Powell and other nurses and doctors, as well as therapists, dietitians and social workers. 
 ''We start planning for their departure from Day 1,'' Dr. Flood said. By some counts, her geriatrics unit outperforms comparable general medical units in the hospital. ''We have a lower average length of stay -- four days -- and a lower 30-day return rate -- 16 percent,'' she said. The national average is close to 20 percent for Medicare patients discharged from a hospital and readmitted within a month. 
 Dr. Flood, Ms. Powell and their team have a fan in William Mullins, 88, a retired pharmacist who lives in nearby Pelham, Ala. Mr. Mullins, who had a small stroke in April, praised the ''great care'' at Birmingham. ''They treated me,'' he said, ''like they was my daddy or my mother.'' 
 THE NEW LANDSCAPE: This is the 12th in a series of articles on how the health overhaul will affect everyday lives.

HEADLINE: Preparing For Next Big One

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
The next Great Crash is coming. Guaranteed.
 Maybe not today and maybe not tomorrow. But, in all likelihood, sooner than we think. 
 How can I be so sure? Because the history of modern markets is a story of meltdowns. The stock market crashed in 1987, the bond market in 1994. Mexico tanked in 1994, East Asia in 1997. Long-Term Capital Management blew up in 1998, Russia that same year. Dot-coms dot-bombed in 2000. In 2007 -- well, you know the rest. 
 And that was just the last 20 years or so. The stagflation of the 1970s, the Depression of the 1930s, the panics in the 1900s ... and back and back and back it goes, all the way to the Dutch and their tulip bulbs. 
 In those giddy years before the Great Recession, it seemed as if we had grown accustomed to the wild ride. Wall Street certainly had. Jamie Dimon, the chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase and Company, likes to say that when his daughter came home from school one day and asked what a financial crisis was, he told her: 'It's the kind of thing that happens every five to seven years.' '' 
 No one should be surprised, Mr. Dimon insists, that booms go bust. That's the way markets work. Most Americans probably find that answer unsatisfying, to put it politely. After all, millions have lost their homes, their jobs, their savings. 
 But now here comes the Dodd-Frank Act, which is supposed to ensure that we never repeat that 2008 finale of Wall Street Gone Wild. The bill, if signed into law, might help us avoid another sorry episode like that. But one thing it won't do is prevent another crisis -- if only because the next one probably won't be like the last one. 
 So amid all the back-and-forth over this bill, keep in mind one of the most important aspects of the act: it would give Washington policy makers a powerful tool to mitigate the next too-big-to-fail blowup, however that blowup manifests itself. For the first time, Washington would have what is known as resolution authority, that is, the power to wind down a giant financial institution that runs into trouble. If policy makers had had that power during the tumultuous autumn of 2008, they might have averted the catastrophic failure of Lehman Brothers. They might have placed the teetering American International Group into conservatorship. And they might have taken over Bank of America and Citigroup, and possibly even Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Senior management would have been tossed out. 
 ''We will have a financial crisis again -- it's just a question of the frequency,'' said the economist Kenneth Rogoff, who, with Carmen M. Reinhart, wrote a terrific book titled ''This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly.'' The title says it all. We've been through this before and will go through it again. 
 While Dodd-Frank might avert another crisis in the short term, Mr. Rogoff says the legislation itself is less important than how regulators act on it -- and keep acting on it over the years. 
 Before World War II, ''banking crises were epidemic,'' Mr. Rogoff said. Then things settled down because ''regulation had become pretty draconian'' and laws were actually enforced.
 But memories fade. ''Having a deep financial crisis is the best vaccination for another right away,'' Mr. Rogoff said. Down the road, a lot will depend on the regulators. Ten or 15 years after a crisis, and sometimes a lot less, the watchdogs start to doze. Political winds change. Regulators loosen up. 
 Many on Capitol Hill insist Dodd-Frank means the end of the ''too big to fail'' culture, period. Many on Wall Street insist it means the end of American finance. Bankers and their lobbyists argue that American businesses and consumers will ultimately suffer, since all these rules will end up throttling the vital flow of credit through the economy. 
 Neither side is entirely correct. Businesses in general, and Wall Street in particular, often overreach in search of profits. And regulators, however stringent the laws, often struggle to keep up. We haven't found a way to legislate around that sober reality.
 Consider the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley law, which sought to reform corporate America after the Enron and WorldCom scandals. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Sarbanes-Oxley on Monday. It is a strong law that sought to hold executives accountable for accounting shenanigans. Many business people screamed that the law was too strict. Few experts ever argued that the law was too lax.
 Have companies engaged in financial fraud since? You bet. 
 After the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989, the government enacted the Oil Pollution Act. Did that legislate away oil spills? Of course not. 
 Strong regulation is important. And Dodd-Frank goes a long way toward cracking down on some of the worst practices that led to this financial crisis. But my bet is that next time, the culprit won't be C.D.O.'s or swaps, or shady subprime mortgages. No, the culprit will be some other financial instruments -- something someone somewhere is probably dreaming up right now. 
 In his memoir, Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary, recalled telling President George W. Bush in 2006 that it was impossible to spot a coming financial blowup. 
 ''We can't predict when the next crisis will come,'' Mr. Paulson told the president. ''But we need to be prepared.''
 Dodd-Frank, whatever its pros and cons, helps prepare us for the next Big One -- whatever that might be. But it won't stop it.

HEADLINE: To Compete, New Luxury Developments Are Arming With Amenities

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
At 200 West 72nd Street, where rents for two bedrooms start at $8,000 a month, tenants can impress their guests on the common rooftop with views taking in Central Park, the Hudson River and the George Washington Bridge. They can send their children to burn off energy in the building's high-tech playroom, and expend their own in its well-equipped gym.
 That last perk might be the most essential one, because of this perk: Every morning, there is a free breakfast buffet. 
 At 7 a.m. one day last week Juliet Rotondo, 3, bounced into the third-floor common room to pick out a blueberry muffin as other residents snapped up juices and fruit. Her father, Joe Rotondo, grabbed a sesame bagel and strawberries, passing up yogurt parfaits and egg sandwiches. The Rotondo family eats on the landlord's dime at least three times a week, a welcome benefit, since the family also includes a 9-month-old, Jonathan.
 ''Breakfast is a huge convenience,'' his mother, Kim Rotondo, said. ''It's something I don't think about.''
 In the last few years, developers began trying to woo buyers and renters to their cookie-cutter properties with such amenities. But what started with gyms and concierges quickly sprouted into an amenities arms race, with developers offering full-blown hotel services like spas, breakfast and even room service to draw from the relatively small pool of high-paying apartment hunters.
 Now New Yorkers who have moved into these buildings are learning which aspects of hotel living they actually find useful. Some have watched pounds melt away because they use their buildings' lavish gyms, while others have had to work so hard to afford such add-ons that they can barely use them.
 At the rental building Truffles Tribeca, residents have been flooding into the building's public rooms, collectively called Truffles Prive, which include a library, a gym, a screening room and living room-type spaces where coffee is served in the morning and a neighborhood wine store offers tastings during happy hour.
 Kate Hovey, who dreamed of living in a hotel when she was growing up, said she had spent a lot of time in the club when she was job-searching. Now that she is working, she stops by each morning for coffee and to read the newspapers. In her free time, she tries to work out at the gym, attends the wine tastings and sunbathes on the roof deck. Even though Ms. Hovey's rent rose by roughly $100 in April and she has less time to take advantage of these resort-style amenities, she is staying.
 ''When you get to a certain age and you're busy, you need these services,'' she said. ''Everyone likes to be catered to.''
 Her neighbor Norma E. McGrody has used the common rooms to run her small businesses. Ms. McGrody's meeting management business dried up when the economy slowed in 2008. So she closed her Midtown office, asked her five employees to work from home and now holds weekly staff meetings in Truffles' club and rooftop.
 ''If I kept my old office and stayed in my old building, I would have let quite a few of the staff go,'' Ms. McGrody said.
 Some residents are using different amenities than they originally expected. Courtney Flint and her husband, Andrew, moved from a walk-up to a one-bedroom at Truffles, which has the same ownership as the Parker Meridien hotel, the Jack Parker Corporation. The couple are paying more than $3,000 a month because they wanted services like a doorman and a gym. But as Ms. Flint has been working more in the past year, she has missed some 7 p.m. yoga classes she would have liked to attend and does not get to exercise as much. She has used more services like the concierge's cleaning company, since she has less time on the weekends for errands.
 ''You definitely have to pay for all of these amenities,'' she said. ''But I think it's worth it.''
 When residents of new condominiums take over a building's management from the original developer, they have the power to decide which amenities are kept.
 In 2008, Gideon Stein, his wife and two children moved into a $3.2 million, five-bedroom apartment at Ariel West, which has a swimming pool and a fitness center by La Palestra. Mr. Stein, who is the condo board's president, said his neighbors asked to keep the building's gym, even though it accounted for 10 to 15 percent of the building's common charges.
 ''I have not heard a single person complain that we have a gym, a couple of porters and all of the amenities that we have,'' Mr. Stein said. ''Most people are heavy users.''
 Residents are aware they can live without these kinds of services. For the past two months, Karolina G. Berglof has lived in a one-bedroom condo her father's company bought for $835,000 at the Smyth Residences. The condominium, which literally sits above the Thompson Hotel, offers residents full access to everything the hotel offers. Ms. Berglof enjoys perks like being greeted by the doormen and being able to people-watch in the lobby.
 But there are many things about hotel living she has not gotten used to. She still takes her clothes to the laundromat and cooks her own meals. She has never used room service, though she and a friend once considered ordering a bottle of wine. When she returns to her native Sweden, she suspects she will be fine.
 ''I will miss my smiling guys opening doors for me,'' she said. ''It's life. You adjust to what you get.''

HEADLINE: Consumer Shares Gain, But Indexes Close Lower

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks ended slightly lower on Monday as gains in consumer-related stocks, including tobacco shares, were offset by losses in the energy sector.
 Shares of Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble were two of the Dow Jones industrial average's best performers. Coca-Cola rose 1.6 percent to $51.08, and Procter & Gamble gained 1.4 percent to $60.62. 
 The Dow Jones dropped 5.29 points, or 0.05 percent, to 10,138.52. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 2.19 points, or 0.20 percent, to 1,074.57. The Nasdaq composite index shed 2.83 points, or 0.13 percent, to 2,220.65.
 The S.& P. Consumer Staples index advanced 1.1 percent.
 Consumer shares rose after the government said that personal spending increased moderately in May, exceeding expectations, after being flat in April. 
 Tobacco companies rallied after the Supreme Court rejected an attempt by the federal government to get billions of dollars in damages from the tobacco industry. The Altria Group gained 3.3 percent to $20.34, and Reynolds American rose 4.1 percent to $53.45. The Dow Jones tobacco index rose 1.8 percent.
 The spotlight, however, was on the consumer as investors and analysts waited for further evidence that consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of economic activity, would show greater strength and propel broad growth.
 ''What has been driving the market higher has been expectations that the good manufacturing recovery we've seen is going to take root and drive the whole economy forward,'' said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Ill.
 ''But the big concern there is, the consumer has to be the one to step up to the plate and make that happen.''
 But Wall Street's earlier advance was short-circuited by weakness in the energy sector, as crude oil futures fell as fears Tropical Storm Alex would disrupt production in the Gulf of Mexico eased. Exxon Mobil shares dipped 1.1 percent to $58.47.
 Among the bright spots in the energy sector, Noble, the owner of a major fleet of offshore drilling rigs, gained 2.5 percent to $30 after announcing it would buy Frontier Drilling, a privately held company in Norway, for $2.16 billion.
 After the closing bell, 3M gained 1 percent to $79.75 as the diversified manufacturer announced a second-quarter sales forecast of $6.6 billion to $6.75 billion.
 Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 25/32, to 104 3/32, and the yield fell to 3.02 percent, from 3.11 percent late Friday.

HEADLINE: Pressure on G-20 Economies to Back Up Lofty Rhetoric

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
TORONTO
 In agreeing to cut deficits in half by 2013, leaders of the world's biggest economies surpassed some of their own, modest expectations. ''Honestly, this is more than I expected, because it is quite specific,'' the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, said.
 But the gathering of the Group of 20 leaders, while acknowledging imbalances that predated the global financial crisis, did not address fundamental structural issues buffeting world economic stability.
 The United States still saves and invests too little and spends and borrows too much. China is holding down its currency -- though promising to do less of it -- to bolster its export-reliant economy. Europe, newly enamored of penny-pinching and stress-testing, still grapples with expensive social programs in the face of grim growth prospects.
 ''A casual reader of the document would presume that G-20 members are on the same page, when in fact countries are moving in quite different directions,'' Stewart M. Patrick, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said of the 27-page joint declaration released Sunday afternoon at the meeting's conclusion. 
 Despite the lack of a common economic strategy, President Obama implied that there was no better alternative setting for economic negotiation. ''The G-20 is now the premier forum for international economic cooperation,'' he said.
 The G-20, which began as a gathering of finance ministers and central bank governors in 1999 following the Asian financial crisis, became a meeting of national leaders after the 2008 financial crisis. Leaders of Brazil, China, India, Mexico and South Korea were brought into the discussion, among others, two years ago.
 In Washington in 2008 and in London and Pittsburgh last year, all were unified on the need for stimulus spending, reforming financial systems, and what they called, in G-20-speak, a ''framework for strong, sustainable and balanced growth.''
 But as the worst of the fears have faded, the recent European debt crisis notwithstanding, so has the urgency for consensus.
 David Shorr, a program officer at the Stanley Foundation, an organization in Muscatine, Iowa, that promotes global cooperation, said the G-20 should be given credit for at least confronting the problems.
 ''If they didn't seriously want to tackle the imbalances, they wouldn't be saying as much as they are about them,'' he said. ''The only thing that would have satisfied the skeptics would be 'How to Fix the Imbalances in 10 Easy Steps.' That's not how this was going to go.''
 Raghuram G. Rajan, a former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund, agreed. ''We should really see these meetings as opportunities for the leaders to get more comfortable with one another, to discuss bilateral issues in meetings on the sidelines, and to bless technical agreements that have been reached in the interim,'' he said, ''rather than as occasions which will alter macroeconomic policy making in the world.''
 Mr. Obama, who entered the meeting warning that pulling back spending too quickly could choke off the economic recovery, left agreeing with leaders of other wealthy nations to halve their deficits by 2013 and stabilize their ratio of public debt to gross domestic product by 2016.
 White House aides insisted the budget targets were in line with what the Obama administration had already proposed, they said, and Mr. Obama's emphasis on growth was widely heard.
 Indeed, Mr. Obama insisted that imbalances of the past were over.
 ''After years of taking on too much debt, Americans cannot -- and will not -- borrow and buy the world's way to lasting prosperity,'' he said Sunday. ''No nation should assume its path to prosperity is simply paved with exports to the United States.''
 Other leaders, as is typical in such gatherings, also pointed to victories. Britain's new prime minister, David Cameron, avoided any public clash over the BPoil spill. He and Ms. Merkel, Europe's leading advocate for austerity, gave crucial backing to a proposal by Canada's prime minister, Stephen Harper, to set out deficit-reduction targets. Japan's new premier, Naoto Kan, secured a reprieve from the targets for his country, which is heavily indebted, though very little of the debt is held by foreigners.
 China's currency, the renminbi, has appreciated only slightly since China announced on the eve of the summit talks that it would gradually allow it to fluctuate. Mr. Obama, while arguing that the move was made in China's own interest, said his administration would be watching closely to see if China followed through.
 The deficit and debt pledges overshadowed other achievements: a $5 billion financing commitment for maternal health, a pledge to end subsidies for fossil fuels, and tough language on new bank capital standards that are to be completed later this year.
 And yet, in a way, deficit cutting is the relatively easy part. In oblique and indirect language, the G-20 statement set out daunting recommendations.
 China should promote domestic consumption by strengthening its social safety net (so its workers do not have to save as much) and raise the value of its currency (so its workers have more buying power). The United States should expand exports, which Mr. Obama has vowed to double in five years, and avoid protectionism in trade, as Democrats in Congress have threatened. Europe should pare back spending while altering onerous labor market rules and other regulations that hamper business formation and growth. And the G-20 countries should complete the long-delayed Doha round of world trade talks, though few expect it to happen soon.
 Alan S. Alexandroff, who co-directs the G-20 Research Group in the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto, said the G-20 and the G-8 (which met on Friday and Saturday in a lakeside resort two hours north of here) had been ''harshly criticized and frequently dismissed as irrelevant'' because they do not produce legally binding agreements.
 And yet, he said the prospect for more inclusive global cooperation, even in informal settings, was real. ''Crisis is different than recovery,'' he said. ''Keeping these countries in a common framework of cooperation is a test, and this summit passed that test.''

CORRECTION-DATE: June 30, 2010, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Tuesday about agreement among the world's biggest economies to address their budget imbalances misstated China's stance on its currency, the renminbi. While the country has indicated it will ease the practice, its policy has aimed to hold down the value of the renminbi as a way of promoting exports; it has not been ''propping up its currency.'' The article also misstated a recommendation of the Group of 20 nations aimed at promoting domestic consumption in China. To do that, China was urged to raise the value of its currency, not lower it.

HEADLINE: Fostering China's Taste for Nuts

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
How might the Chinese best like to snack on their almonds? Pickled with chili peppers? Wrapped in seaweed like sushi? Or perhaps mixed with donkey hide glue, a substance prized in traditional Chinese medicine?
 Those offbeat ideas were among the winners in a student recipe contest sponsored in China by California's almond industry, which is seeing powerful demand for its products from a country that has begun gobbling up as many American walnuts, pecans and almonds as it can get.
 This year, China will emerge as the top foreign buyer of American almonds, more than doubling its purchases from two years ago, according to data from the Almond Board of California. Last year, China was the top foreign buyer of American walnuts, and in 2007, it became the leading export market for pecans. Altogether, China bought $737 million in tree nuts from the United States last year, up from just $89 million five years earlier, according to the United States Department of Agriculture. 
 ''They've basically gone from nothing to No. 1 in a relatively short period of time,'' said Keith Rigg, of the Minturn Nut Company, an almond grower and exporter in Le Grand, Calif. ''It's really taken off like a rocket.'' 
 The boom follows earlier increases in other American agricultural exports to China, including dairy and meat products, which rose as Chinese consumers became more affluent.
 But the increase in China's nut consumption has also depended in part on marketers' efforts to change eating habits and tastes. 
 China is the world's leading grower of walnuts, and walnuts have long had a place in the Chinese diet, as in the moon cakes popular during the yearly midautumn festival. So it was easy for Chinese consumers to embrace American walnuts, which are often perceived as being of higher quality than the domestic version. 
 But almonds and pecans were not widely available in China until recently. Complicating matters, the Mandarin word for almonds, ''xing ren,'' is the same as the one for the small, often bitter apricot kernels that are also eaten by the Chinese.
 So American exporters have been forced to get creative. The Almond Board of California has spent about $1 million annually in recent years to promote the nuts in China, mostly through work with food manufacturers. To distinguish their product from the apricot kernels, they call it ''American big xing ren.''
 Last fall, the board started a $3.3 million campaign that includes its first ads aimed directly at Chinese consumers. Using the film actress Gao Yuan Yuan as a spokeswoman, the board has bought ads in women's magazines and on bus shelters in several cities, with the tag line: ''Enjoy American big almonds for a healthy and radiant life.'' 
 In addition, the board has been sponsoring annual recipe competitions among food science students at several Chinese universities. 
 Last year's event, whose winners were announced in the fall, drew entries from students at 26 universities. The grand-prize winner was a sour-spicy snack of pickled nuts and chili peppers. Another winning entry was a sushi-style roll of diced almonds wrapped in seaweed. And taking first prize in the nutritional food category was a chewy confection of almonds and donkey hide glue, an ingredient used in women's health remedies.
 Guangwei Huang, principal scientist of the Almond Board, acknowledged that some of the winning entries, like the product involving donkey hide glue, might seem strange to American tastes. Others, he said, might go nicely with a glass of beer. 
 Liu Jia, 25, was part of the team that concocted the winning entry of pickled almonds with chili peppers, which she said was inspired by the use of pickled peppers to give flair to dishes in traditional Chinese cooking, like chicken feet with pickled peppers. 
 ''It's spicy but not dry, and a little bit tender but not sticky, and it's fresh and crisp,'' she said of her team's recipe. 
 The upside for American exporters in the huge Chinese market is obvious. Americans eat 22 ounces of almonds per capita each year, according to the almond board. In China, the group estimates that per capita consumption is slightly more than an ounce, although the number is probably higher in the cities, where most American nuts are sold, than in the countryside.
 American almond growers would like to increase Chinese consumption by promoting nuts as an ingredient in manufactured foods. Right now, a high proportion of the almonds, walnuts and pecans imported into China from the United States are eaten as snacks.
 Chinese consumers tend to buy their nuts roasted, salted and still in the shell. The shells become brittle enough during the roasting that they can be cracked easily by hand, and the Chinese eat them much the way Americans eat peanuts in the shell. Sometimes sugar or other flavorings are used instead of salt. The nuts are often sold in markets in small quantities to make them more affordable to the average consumer. The China boom has come at a good time for American nut growers. 
 ''With the collapse of the American economy, it really hit walnut growers very hard,'' said Barrett Blain, whose family grows and exports walnuts and pecans.
 Walnut and almond prices dropped in late 2008 and early 2009. But then Chinese importers jumped on the low prices and started buying, pushing prices back up. Walnut prices have also been helped by strong sales to Turkey. ''The market shot back up in a year, which is absolutely unheard of,'' Mr. Blain said.
 The effect on prices has perhaps been strongest in the pecan industry. Last year, according to Daniel J. Zedan, president of Nature's Finest Foods, a nut brokerage based in Illinois, the global pecan supply was well above average levels. That should have depressed prices, but instead, Chinese demand has pushed prices to record levels. 
 ''We are now at the highest prices ever in the history of the pecan industry for pecan meats and yet we have one of the largest supplies ever,'' said Mr. Zedan. ''All because of China.''
 Mr. Zedan said the higher prices had not yet been felt strongly in American supermarkets, partly because many large buyers bought pecans last year on contracts negotiated at lower prices, before the market soared. That could change later this year. Mr. Zedan said higher prices might eventually lead ice cream makers in the United States to skimp on the nuts in butter pecan ice cream. And pecan pies might be selling at a premium this fall. 
 But Mr. Zedan also said there were risks in the China boom. Sales to China last year accounted for more than a quarter of the American crop, and he said that growers should worry about becoming too reliant on a single market. In addition, rising prices could drive away customers in Europe or in the domestic market. 
 Randy Hudson, a pecan grower and exporter in Ocilla, Ga., was an early seller of pecans to the Chinese, making his initial sale in 1999. At the time, he said pecans were largely unknown in China, and that year he sold about 125,000 pounds there.
 Last year, he sold more than a million pounds. The growth prompted Mr. Hudson to plant about 175 acres of additional pecan orchards over the last three years, although the trees can take 10 years to reach peak production. In the meantime, he has doubled his overall production capacity by renting orchards with mature trees. 
 ''China has totally changed our industry,'' Mr. Hudson said. ''We've seen some very significant increases in price, and it's just put new enthusiasm back into pecan production in this country.''

HEADLINE: With Incomes Climbing, Consumer Spending Rose in May

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer spending rose 0.2 percent last month after no change in April, the Commerce Department said Monday.
 Incomes rose for the sixth time in seven months, potentially providing fuel for greater spending. 
 But money spent on goods declined. The increase came from spending on services -- much of that was probably a result of Americans' using more electricity as the weather warmed up.
 Incomes rose 0.4 percent. The savings rate, or the percentage of income that was not spent, rose to 4 percent.
 Consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of economic activity in the United States.
 The economy has grown for three consecutive quarters. Still, consumers are cautious, facing high unemployment, tight credit and a slumping housing market. If consumption remains sluggish, the economy may not grow fast enough to generate jobs and quickly bring down the 9.7 percent unemployment rate.
 Wages and salaries rose 0.5 percent last month, the department said. Paychecks gained from recent increases in the average workweek, as well as temporary census hiring.
 Employers added 431,000 jobs in May, but the vast majority were temporary positions with the Census Bureau. Private employers added only 41,000 jobs. About 250,000 of the census jobs are expected to end this month.
 Consumers have not been driving the current recovery. Instead, it has depended more on business spending and exports. In the four quarters after the steep 1981-82 downturn, consumer spending rose by an average of 6.5 percent a quarter. By contrast, even as the economy has grown for the last three quarters, consumer spending has risen an average of only 2.5 percent a quarter.
 The government said this month that retail sales fell sharply in May, a sign consumers were cutting back.

PERSON: Nicolas Hayek 

HEADLINE: Nicolas Hayek, 82, Dies; His Swatch Saved an Industry

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

 BODY:
Nicolas Hayek, a Lebanese-born business consultant who is widely credited with having saved the Swiss watch industry with the introduction of the Swatch, the inexpensive, plastic -- and, as it transpired, highly collectible -- wristwatch that made its debut in 1983, died Monday in Biel, Switzerland. He was 82.
 Mr. Hayek, a founder and the chairman of the Swatch Group, died of heart failure while working at the company's headquarters, according to an announcement on the company Web site. 
 The formation of the Swatch Group, which in addition to Swatch today comprises high-end watch brands like Breguet, Omega, Longines, Tissot, Calvin Klein and Mido, made Mr. Hayek one of Switzerland's wealthiest men. The exquisite irony is that the company came about after Mr. Hayek was brought in to help shut the foundering Swiss watch industry altogether.
 A flamboyant figure with a roguish sense of humor, Mr. Hayek was ''a rare phenomenon in Europe -- a genuine business celebrity,'' as The Harvard Business Review described him in 1993.
 Nicolas Hayek was born in Beirut in 1928 and moved to Switzerland as a young man. After studying mathematics, physics and chemistry at the University of Lyon in France, he started a consulting firm, Hayek Engineering, in Zurich in the early 1960s.
 By the 1970s, the vaunted Swiss watch industry, a pillar of the national economy for centuries, was in jeopardy. Japanese watchmakers like Seiko had begun to undercut Swiss prices. And public tastes were shifting from the finely wrought analog timepieces in which Swiss artisans had long specialized to the pale flickering faces of mass-market digital watches.
 In the early 1980s, with no apparent remedy in sight, a group of Swiss banks asked Mr. Hayek to compile a report on how the watchmaking industry might best be liquidated. Instead, he merged two of its former titans, Asuag and SSIH, which between them owned brands like Omega, Longines and Tissot.
 Mr. Hayek bought a majority stake in the reorganized group, known as SMH -- the Societe Suisse de Microelectronique et d'Horlogerie. (He was fond of telling interviewers that the initials stood for ''Sa Majeste Hayek'' -- ''His Royal Highness Hayek.'')
 In 1983, SMH introduced the Swatch. Lightweight, with vibrantly colored bands and breezy novelty faces, it was remarkably inexpensive to produce. (It had 51 parts, as opposed to the nearly 100 needed to make a traditional wristwatch.) It retailed for less than $35 when it was first marketed in the United States later that year. 
 The Swatch quickly became a sought-after collector's item worldwide. It was very likely the first time that ordinary people had even considered owning multiple watches. (Mr. Hayek himself was known to appear in public wearing as many as eight -- four to an arm -- though at least a few of these were from his luxury brands.) Several hundred million Swatches have been sold since the brand's inception.
 The success of the Swatch also resuscitated the high-end brands under the SMH umbrella. The company, whose name was changed to the Swatch Group in the 1990s, generated about $4.9 billion in sales last year, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. 
 By redirecting consumers' attention to Swiss watchmaking as a whole, the little plastic watch lifted all boats. Even the expensive brands, like Breguet, ''we will continue to sell -- and sell well,'' Mr. Hayek told the publication Swiss News in 2008. He added, ''We sell the mentality of Switzerland.''
 Mr. Hayek stepped down as the Swatch Group's chief executive in 2002 and was succeeded by his son, Nicolas Jr. His daughter Nayla sits on the company's board. Information about other survivors could not be confirmed.
 Over time, the humble Swatch itself was borne upward by its own success: the company has issued limited-edition Swatches designed by noted artists like Keith Haring. In 1992, The New York Times reported, a Swatch by Kiki Picasso, a pseudonym of the French artist Christian Chapiron, sold at auction at Christie's in London for $28,000.

HEADLINE: The Travel Advantages Of a Brief Stint on 'The Sopranos'

 BODY:
ALMOST all my travel is for the Nobelity Project, either shooting a film, promoting and showing a film or working with our partners on projects. I traveled to 20 countries on five continents for our feature documentary ''Nobelity'' and its sequel, ''One Peace at a Time.''
 Though the trips were sometimes grueling, it was incredible to meet with Nobel laureates like Muhammad Yunus, Steve Chu, Helene Gayle and Desmond Tutu to get their take on how we can provide basic human rights like food, water and education to every child on this planet. 
 Currently, I'm traveling quite a bit to Haiti, where we're starting a school reconstruction effort in partnership with Architecture for Humanity, and Kenya, where we're building Mahiga Hope High School, a model school for rural Africa.
 It seems like I'm constantly in the air or at an airport. Because we're a nonprofit, I've learned to make do with economy seating even though I'm 6 feet 7 inches tall and have to wrap my legs around my body to try to get comfortable. Fortunately, I try to stick with one airline to rack up points, and a lot of times I can snag an upgrade.
 When I'm on a film trip, I bring tons of gear. I've seen people take a look at my carry-on and then make a beeline to another checkpoint.
 I don't take it personally. My bag is big, filled with two high-definition video cameras, a small digital still camera, batteries, chargers, tape and audio equipment. I can never check it all. If my bag got lost, I couldn't replace this stuff quickly since I'm almost always in remote locations.
 Most of my flights are long haul, and I've set some personal records.
 I used to fly a lot from Dhaka, Bangladesh, back home to Austin, Tex. With all the layovers, it was 44 hours. I thought that was the longest flight ever. But then I beat that time when we screened ''One Peace at a Time'' at the Maui Film Festival.
 I asked Willie Nelson, who is in the documentary, to sing before the screening. He told me he would sing if I showed up. So I flew from Nairobi to London, then on to Chicago and then Austin, to drop off my camera equipment. Then, I boarded a flight to Los Angeles and then another one to Maui. Total time: 54 hours.
 I don't mind talking to seatmates on flights. I always carry a couple of DVDs with me and hand them out. Sometimes people are really interested in the work, and that's always rewarding.
 Other times people are interested in hearing about what it was like to work on ''The Sopranos.'' I'm always surprised when people recognize me. I had only a small role in the series, playing Janice Soprano's crazy boyfriend Aaron Arkaway, a born-again, narcoleptic hippie. People love the show, and no matter what part of the world I'm in ''The Sopranos'' always has a fan base.
 I was in Nairobi recently, and I was wandering around downtown looking for a music store so I could buy some instruments for our school. I wasn't having any luck. Then a young Kenyan man came up to me and said, ''Have you heard the good news?'' -- one of Aaron's most memorable lines. Turns out, he was a huge Sopranos fan and he was more than happy to help me out.
 It was a fun encounter. And the good news for our school? I was able to get them a keyboard and a guitar.
 Q.How often do you fly?
 A. At least twice a month, both domestic and international.
 Q. What's your least favorite airport?
 A. Delhi. The check-in is just too chaotic.
 Q. Of all the places you've been, what's your favorite?
 A. The best place I've been is usually the last place I've visited.
 Q. What's your secret airport vice?
 A. When traveling out of Austin, it's good barbecue, Mexican food and Amy's Ice Cream. The airport does a good job of keeping things very local.

HEADLINE: Near-Empty Tower Still Holds Hope

BYLINE: By NICOLAI OUROUSSOFF

 BODY:
For those who follow real estate trends, One Madison Park, the new luxury residential tower at 23rd Street and Madison Avenue, is a choice example of the hubris that led to the financial crash. Earlier this year, just as workers were putting the final touches on its glittering facades, the building went into foreclosure, halting construction. The floors meant for a swimming pool, a spa and a wine bar remain cavernous concrete shells. The half dozen or so overly eager tenants who chose to move into the tower before its completion are still navigating through labyrinthine scaffolding, an unfinished lobby and ghostly corridors to get to their luxury apartments, without any idea when -- or if -- construction will begin again. 
 Still, those tenants -- and the rest of us -- can take a measure of solace from the quality of the building's architecture. Even in its current state, their new home, with its stack of multistory glass cubes plugged into one side of a bronze-colored shaft, is a dazzling addition to a street that includes two of the city's most celebrated skyscrapers: Pierre LeBrun's 1909 Metropolitan Life tower, across the street, and Daniel Burnham's 1903 Flatiron building, a half block west. It jolts the neighborhood into the present. 
 The achievement seems particularly improbable, given the firm that designed it. During its more than 20 years of existence, CetraRuddy had never before produced a building of any architectural significance. If it is known at all in the wider architectural world, it is for the infomercial, repeated endlessly on taxicab video screens, in which one of the firm's founding partners, John Cetra, hawks apartments in a pair of generic glass-and-steel towers in Jersey City. 
 An optimist, in fact, may see One Madison Park as an example of how, despite the endless bellyaching about the poisonous effects of ''starchitecture,'' New York's recent embrace of megatalents like Jean Nouvel, Frank Gehry and Santiago Calatrava can raise expectations for mainstream architects as well. The trend has led to more than a few pitiable knockoffs (as anyone who has taken a walk through Chelsea knows), but it would be nice to believe that, on occasion, it can also lead to inspired work from unexpected sources. 
 Much of the design's strength stems from how the architects came to terms with the demands of the developer, Ira Shapiro, of Slazer Enterprises, and the constraints of the site. As you would expect, Mr. Shapiro wanted to pack in as much square footage as possible; he also wanted to complete construction fast to keep his costs down. 
 But the building would have to be squeezed onto an odd-shaped little lot, most of which ran along 23rd Street, with a small sliver extending through the block to 22nd. And because of the inordinate amount of time it took to move tenants out of a rundown building on the eastern portion of the site on 23rd Street, the tower would have to start construction first, to be followed a year later by the five-story glass structure that would house the pool, spa and wine bar. 
 CetraRuddy began by placing the 50-story tower on the westernmost corner of the site, and then cantilevered the glass cubes out over the lot to the east. A series of one-story slots interrupt the cubes, creating large, wraparound balconies that break down the building's mass and give it a sense of lightness. (The project's third phase -- more apartments on the 22nd Street side -- was to be developed later.) 
 The building is handsomest approached from the west through Madison Square Park, where the silvery cubes peek out from behind the dark bronze glass of the tower's core. As you move east, the cantilever seems to become more pronounced, as if the cubes were straining toward the view up Madison Avenue. The facade is slightly more menacing from the east, where the narrow gaps between the cubes contribute to an unexpected feeling of vicelike compression.
 As captivating, for architecture lovers, are the ghosts that the design conjures. The stacked cubes are reminiscent of Santiago Calatrava's abandoned 2004 proposal for a luxury tower in Lower Manhattan: a design whose structural system of tension cables was far more refined than this building's but also more cloyingly precious. Both designs, in turn, are reinterpretations of the modular plug-in architecture of the 1960s and 1970s, in particular Kenzo Tange's Shizuoka Press Administration building and Kisho Kurokawa's Nakagin Capsule Tower. These structures were conceived as radical experiments in mass production for an increasingly dense and urban postwar society. The latter-day version is used to envelop the rich in the aura of luxury while insulating them from the masses; they are private town houses in the sky. 
 And once you are inside, One Madison Park is pretty much what you would expect: views, views and more views. Because of the tiny footprint, even some of the smaller apartments take up half a floor. And since the developer has used up all the remaining air rights on lots to the south, east and west of the building, and it faces the corridor of Madison Avenue to the north, the sweeping views should never be obstructed by another tower. (A point, no doubt, that the building's realtors will make much of.) 
 Even those who will never enjoy these luxuries, though, can still appreciate the building as a valuable addition to a prominent and historic site. And as part of a slow but steady rise in aesthetic standards, it at least feeds the fantasy that someday high-quality architecture will trickle down to the city's shrinking middle classes. The reverse -- that as the city continues to wallow in its current financial malaise, it will retreat to the aesthetic conservatism of old -- is too depressing to contemplate.

HEADLINE: Setting Diversity as Hallmark, Mayor Falls Far Short of a Vow

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN and JO CRAVEN McGINTY

 BODY:
Since winning a third term in November, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has announced a parade of major appointments: bringing aboard three new deputy mayors and six commissioners and trumpeting most of those arrivals in the Blue Room at City Hall.
 All nine are white. All but one is a man.
 Those selections are hardly anomalous. Despite a pledge he made when he took office to make diversity a hallmark of his administration, Mr. Bloomberg has consistently surrounded himself with a predominantly white and male coterie of key policy makers, according to an analysis of personnel data by The New York Times. 
 The city's non-Hispanic white population is now 35 percent, because of an influx of nonwhite immigrants and other demographic changes in the past two decades. 
 But Mr. Bloomberg presides over an administration in which more than 70 percent of the senior jobs are held by whites, and he has failed to improve on the oft-criticized diversity record of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. 
 ''Obviously, it demonstrates no greater commitment under Bloomberg than there was under Giuliani in appointing minorities to high-level positions in government,'' said Abraham May Jr., executive director of the city's Equal Employment Practices Commission, an independent agency that monitors diversity and discrimination in city government.
 Moreover, New York lags behind the three cities closest to its population in diversifying its senior ranks. 
 In Los Angeles, 52 percent of the top advisers to Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa are white; in Chicago, that figure is 61 percent for Mayor Richard M. Daley; and in Houston, it is 55 percent for Mayor Annise D. Parker. 
 ''The numbers -- they're sad,'' said Kevin P. Johnson, a former assistant commissioner of the Department of Correction, who was responsible for equal-employment policies, but quit in December because he was frustrated by the administration's efforts. ''It's terrible in a city with such a large minority population.''
 The Times examined diversity in several top management tiers of the Bloomberg administration. Each tier showed a nearly identical pattern: 
 Of the 80 current city officials identified by the Bloomberg administration as ''key members'' on its Web site, 79 percent are white, and 64 percent are men. 
 Of 321 people who advise the mayor or hold one of three top titles at agencies that report directly to him -- commissioners, deputy commissioners and general counsels, and their equivalents -- 78 percent are white, and 60 percent male, according to a database created by The Times, based on public records and dozens of interviews with current and former officials.
 And of the 1,114 employees who must live in the city, under an executive order, because they wield the most influence over policies and day-to-day operations, 74 percent are white, and 58 percent are men, according to the mayor's office.
 In addition to their demographic similarity, many of the recent appointees fall into two broad categories: former Wall Street executives and loyalists from City Hall or the mayor's re-election campaign.
 ''Given Bloomberg's background, we shouldn't really be surprised,'' said Bruce F. Berg, a political scientist at Fordham University who has studied racial diversity in New York City government. ''He's picking from the business world, his key advisers are from the business world, and this is still very much a white male bastion.''
 Mr. Bloomberg declined requests for an interview to discuss the findings.
 But his press secretary, Stu Loeser, acknowledged in a statement that ''there is always more we can do.'' Mr. Loeser said, however, that ''we're proud of what we've accomplished over the last eight years'' in diversifying the city's management ranks, noting that almost half of the people in citywide programs intended to identify and develop future top managers are people of color. 
 In addition, he said, managers -- the nearly 6,000 employees who rank just below the top level administrators -- have become more diverse in recent years under Mr. Bloomberg.
 ''These talented up-and-coming managers are positioned to be the next generation of assistant and deputy commissioners, then agency heads, of city agencies,'' Mr. Loeser said of those in the training programs.
 Still, Mr. Bloomberg has conceded that he has fallen short, acknowledging at a news conference last year that ''the diversity of our administration has not been as diverse as the city itself.'' 
 The homogenous composition of the administration is especially striking in crucial areas where city personnel deal with issues predominantly affecting minority residents, like education, homelessness and child welfare.
 At the Department of Homeless Services, the Department of Education and the Administration for Children's Services, 80 percent of the top officials are white, according to the Times's research -- including the newly installed commissioner of homeless services, Seth Diamond. And while the Bloomberg administration, early on, featured minority commissioners at the Department of Finance, the Human Resources Administration and the Administration for Children's Services, all those positions are now held by white men.
 ''I have chaired and been present at one too many meetings where every senior person happened to be Caucasian, representing the administration,'' said Bill de Blasio, the city's public advocate, and a former City Councilman who was the chairman of the General Welfare Committee. ''It's not really an acceptable situation.''
 Since the 1990 census, the city's non-Hispanic white population has dropped to 35 percent, from 43 percent. And that change is reflected in the overall city government work force, which dropped from 46 percent white in 1994 to 38 percent in 2008. 
 Still, little change has occurred in the most senior ranks.
 Diversity, of course, is one of the most delicate issues and hardest goals to achieve in any workplace. Many employers want a workplace, especially in the public sector, that has highly qualified managers who reflect the broader community and can engage in a vigorous exchange of ideas by people of different backgrounds. So failing to name minority employees to high-level positions, time after time, not only can dampen employee morale, but also send a message that an employer is insensitive or indifferent, according to political analysts and human resources professionals.
 ''This is the most diverse city in the world, and to be respected and seen as the mayoral administration of that city, you want to be pushing hard to build a much more diverse pool of people from which to draw expertise,'' said Andrew White, director of the Center for New York City Affairs at the New School. ''So if you're not making that effort, your pool is going to be severely limited, and you're going to go for the kinds of people that you've always worked with.''
 Mr. Bloomberg pledged during his first campaign, in 2001, to hire people of different backgrounds. And shortly after taking office, he underscored his commitment to diversity, saying that ''if you have that as a goal, and you have a process that gets lots of input from various communities, you will wind up with an administration that is reasonably diverse.''
 More than eight years later, many people credit Mr. Bloomberg with achieving real progress on race relations, by discussing racial issues forthrightly, supporting immigration reform and meeting with different groups regularly on issues like public health, economic development and basic quality-of-life services. 
 ''Even though minorities may not be filling out the ranks of his cabinet, in proportion to their ranks in the population at large,'' Professor Berg, of Fordham, said, ''Bloomberg goes out of his way, on many occasions, to assuage minority leaders, and include them.'' 
 No longer, some say, is race viewed as the lightning rod in the way it was under Mr. Giuliani.
 ''Together with a City Hall that listens to every community across the five boroughs,'' Mr. Loeser said in a statement, ''we've helped contribute to creating a city where people are almost universally seen as getting along together better than at any time in memory.''
 But while his language has been inclusive, that has not translated into concrete changes in the highest ranks at city agencies.
 A telling measure involves the commissioners who are frequently the faces and voices of the administration at City Council hearings and town-hall-style forums. And the numbers suggest that Mr. Bloomberg has fewer people of color than some previous administrations. 
 According to the mayor's office, 72 percent of his commissioners and agency heads are white. That percentage is higher than the 63 percent figure during Mr. Giuliani's first year, in 1994, and his 69 percent in 1998. Mr. Giuliani's predecessor, David N. Dinkins, who is black, meanwhile, had a cabinet that was slightly more than half white, in keeping with his goal of a ''gorgeous mosaic'' of an administration.
 And comparing the ''key members'' identified by the Bloomberg administration with people in similar posts in the past yields striking results: 79 percent white under Mr. Bloomberg, about 75 percent white under Mr. Giuliani, and 55 percent under Mr. Dinkins, according to a review of earlier city rosters and interviews with former officials.
 To be sure, some sectors of the Bloomberg administration are more diverse. The New York City Housing Authority is dominated by minorities at the top tier and led by two black officials whom the mayor tapped last year: John B. Rhea, the chairman, and Michael Kelly, the general manager. 
 And at the Police Department, where for the first time ever a majority of patrol officers are minority, Raymond W. Kelly, the commissioner, promoted two Hispanics to department chiefs in the last year and Chief Rafael Pineiro as first deputy commissioner -- the highest rank achieved by a Hispanic.
 Such moves, though, stand out in part because they have been relatively infrequent, current and former city officials said.
 Mr. Johnson, formerly with the Department of Correction, recalled that at regular meetings, a top official at the city's Department of Citywide Administrative Services would invariably boast about the administration's diversity record. Afterwards, a few equal employment officers would huddle, and scratch their heads.
 ''We would say to each other, 'What are they talking about? This administration is not diverse,' '' said Mr. Johnson, who is now an investigator for lawyers.
 He said that he still had ''a lot of respect for the mayor.'' But he feels disillusioned, after Mr. Bloomberg's initial inclusionary talk in 2002.
 ''The message is: Make me a believer again,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Senate Bid Was No-Go With Mayor As Companion

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
Blame the mayor -- or at least the tricky nature of two-career couples.
 Diana L. Taylor, the former New York state banking superintendent and the companion of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, acknowledged Monday for the first time that she ''really wanted'' to run for the United States Senate as a Republican this year, but decided against it because of her boyfriend's day job.
 ''My significant other is the mayor of New York City, so that would be really complicated,'' she told the audience at a fund-raiser for David Malpass, a Republican contender for the Senate seat she coveted. 
 ''So I decided not to run,'' Ms. Taylor said, adding that by sitting out the race, she would leave Mr. Bloomberg ''running New York City without having to worry about this other thing.''It was Ms. Taylor's most detailed -- and her only public -- discussion of her Senate ambitions, which were heavily encouraged by state and national Republican leaders, who are seeking a big-name candidate to challenge the Democratic incumbent, Kirsten E. Gillibrand.
 And it was a small but telling glimpse into the relationship between two of New York City's most high-powered people: Mr. Bloomberg, the billionaire media mogul, and Ms. Taylor, a director at Citigroup, the giant bank, the chairwoman of Accion, a leading microfinance lender, and the chairwoman of the Hudson River Park Trust, which oversees the waterfront park on the West Side of Manhattan.
 In her remarks, Ms. Taylor said she was surprised by the enthusiasm of national Republican leaders, like Senators Mitch McConnell and John Cornyn, who tried to recruit her to run earlier this year. She recalled warning them that ''my social outlook is not particularly Republican,'' because she ''is totally for gun control'' and supports abortion rights.
 Even though Ms. Taylor and the mayor disagreed on the wisdom of her candidacy, they clearly share a deep skepticism of career politicians. She said she seriously weighed a Senate run because ''I was so angry'' at events unfolding in Washington, where, she said, lawmakers charged with reforming the nation's financial system possessed ''no understanding'' of the markets and ''were doing it for political reasons every step of the way.''
 She quoted a friend's description of elected officials in Washington -- although it seemed like she was speaking for herself. ''Every politician in office today is concerned about three things,'' she said. ''Number one: getting elected or re-elected. The second thing is making sure that their party is in control. The third thing is so far behind that it doesn't really matter.''
 Her endorsement of Mr. Malpass, a former Treasury official in the Reagan administration and economist at Bear Stearns, is the latest sign of her interest in the political sphere. She recently endorsed a Democratic Congressional candidate in New York, Reshma Saujani, who is challenging Representative Carolyn B. Maloney.
 The fund-raiser took place within the wood-paneled confines of the Women's National Republican Club on West 51st Street in Midtown, where portraits of Ronald Reagan compete for space with those of Barbara Bush. Ms. Taylor praised Mr. Malpass's long record in government and the private sector as she introduced him.
 ''We need people like you in the U.S Senate who understand the economy, think about the issues and have done their homework,'' she said before an audience of several dozen women, who donated at least $200 a person.
 She added, ''The thing that struck me about David was, I was hearing from him all the things I would want to do in the Senate.''
 Mr. Malpass is promoting himself as a political outsider and fiscal conservative (not unlike Mr. Bloomberg, or, for that matter, Ms. Taylor). In his remarks, Mr. Malpass railed against what he said was excessive spending, unbridled deficits and unnecessary taxes imposed by lawmakers in Washington.
 At times, the fund-raiser seemed like the Taylor-Malpass show. When Mr. Malpass was asked about his stance supporting abortion rights, and how it would play with national Republicans, Ms. Taylor politely interrupted with a brief summary of her own experience with the party's leaders.
 Ms. Taylor said she was ''really surprised'' at how welcoming they were to her liberal social views. The Republican officials with whom she met, she said, acknowledged that the party's candidates in New York would hold different views from those in more conservative sections of the country.
 At another point, Mr. Malpass asked Ms. Taylor to weigh in when he was asked how Hispanic voters were reacting to President Obama's health care overhaul.
 Ms. Taylor observed that Hispanic voters were more conservative than many political observers realized. ''At this point,'' she said, ''they are leaving the Democratic Party in droves.''
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Wrong Track Distress

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
It's getting harder and harder for most Americans, looking honestly at the state of the nation, to see the glass as half full. And that's why the public opinion polls contain nothing but bad news for Barack Obama and the Democrats.
 The oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico, the war in Afghanistan and, above all, the continuing epidemic of joblessness have pushed the nation into a funk. All the crowing in the world about the administration's legislative accomplishments -- last year's stimulus package, this year's health care reform, etc. -- is not enough to lift the gloom. 
 Mr. Obama and the Democrats have wasted the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity handed to them in the 2008 election. They did not focus on jobs, jobs, jobs as their primary mission, and they did not call on Americans to join in a bold national effort (which would have required a great deal of shared sacrifice) to solve a wide range of very serious problems, from our over-reliance on fossil fuels to the sorry state of public education to the need to rebuild the nation's rotting infrastructure.
 All of that could have been pulled together under the umbrella of job creation -- short-term and long-term. In the immediate aftermath of Mr. Obama's historic victory, and with the trauma of the economic collapse still upon us, it would have been very difficult for Republicans on Capitol Hill to stand in the way of a rebuild-America campaign aimed at putting millions of men and women back to work.
 Mr. Obama had campaigned on the mantra of change, and that would have been the kind of change that working people could have gotten behind. But it never happened. Job creation was the trump card in the hand held by Mr. Obama and the Democrats, but they never played it. And now we're paying a fearful price. 
 Fifteen million Americans are unemployed, according to the official count, which wildly understates the reality. Assuming no future economic setbacks and job creation at a rate of 200,000 or so a month, it would take more than a decade to get us back to where we were when the Great Recession began in December 2007. But we're nowhere near that kind of sustained job growth. Last month, a measly 41,000 private-sector jobs were created. 
 We are in deep, deep gumbo.
 The Obama administration feels it should get a great deal of credit for its economic stimulus efforts, its health care initiative, its financial reform legislation, its vastly increased aid to education and so forth. And maybe if we were grading papers, there would be a fair number of decent marks to be handed out.
 But Americans struggling in a down economy are worried about the survival of their families. Destitution is beckoning for those whose unemployment benefits are running out, and that crowd of long-term jobless men and women is expanding rapidly.
 There is a widespread feeling that only the rich and well-placed can count on Washington's help, and that toxic sentiment is spreading like the oil stain in the gulf, with ominous implications for President Obama and his party. It's in this atmosphere that support for the president and his agenda is sinking like a stone.
 Employment is the No. 1 issue for most ordinary Americans. Their anxiety on this front only grows as they watch teachers, firefighters and police officers lining up to walk the unemployment plank as state and local governments wrestle with horrendous budget deficits.
 And what do these worried Americans see the Obama administration doing? It's doubling down on the war in Afghanistan, trying somehow to build a nation from scratch in the chaos of a combat zone.
 By nearly 2 to 1, respondents to the most recent New York Times/CBS News poll believed the United States is on the wrong track. Despite the yelping and destructive machinations of the deficit hawks, employment and the economy are by far the public's biggest concern. Mr. Obama is paying dearly for his tin ear on this topic. Fifty-four percent of respondents believed he does not have a clear plan for creating jobs. Only 45 percent approved of his overall handling of the economy, compared with 48 percent who disapproved.
 It's not too late for the president to turn things around, but there is no indication that he has any plan or strategy for doing it. And the political environment right now, with confidence in the administration waning and budgetary fears unnecessarily heightened by the deficit hawks, is not good. 
 It would take an extraordinary exercise in leadership to rally the country behind a full-bore jobs-creation campaign -- nothing short of large-scale nation-building on the home front. Maybe that's impossible in the current environment. But that's what the country needs.

HEADLINE: Robert Byrd, Living History

BYLINE: By JOHN DANFORTH, GARY HART, JAMES H. BILLINGTON, ALAN K. SIMPSON, GEORGE McGOVERN, STEVE KETTMANN, WALTER F. MONDALE, JOHN D. ASHCROFT, ETHEL MORGAN SMITH and LINCOLN CHAFEE,

 BODY:
It was probably in the late 1970s, when I was fairly new to the Senate, that Robert Byrd taught me a lesson about the institution he loved.
 This was before TV had become the great forum for over-the-top oratory, and I had made a speech on the Senate floor, venting my rage over something. I've forgotten the exact issue that had upset me, but I do recall that in my anger I cast the Senate in an unflattering light. To me, my remarks seemed perfectly appropriate: I was out of sorts, and the American people, then as now, had little regard for Congress.
 Robert Byrd was on the Senate floor at the time, and came up to me immediately after I finished talking. He stood with his face about six inches from mine, with an expression more disappointed than angry, like that of a chastising father. ''Don't soil your own nest,'' he said.
 Robert Byrd loved the Senate and he expected other senators to love it as well and to defend its honor. 
 Attacks on Congress play to the passions of the audience, but they do not serve the institutions of our government. Robert Byrd taught me that lesson.
 -- JOHN DANFORTH, Republican of Missouri, who served in the Senate from 1976 to 1995
 Robert Byrd was not happy with me during my first Senate campaign in 1974. He was touring the country campaigning for Democrats, presumably building up favors for a future campaign for majority leader, and he wanted to organize an event in Colorado that would feature him playing his fiddle. But my campaign, based on ''new politics'' and ''new ideas,'' did not seem compatible with his traditional hill-country fiddling. Looking back, I was wrong to turn him down. He would have been very well received.
 Following his predecessor as majority leader, Mike Mansfield, Robert Byrd sought to help the progress of younger senators. In my case, he did so by naming me one of the new congressional observers to the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks in Geneva, which proved vital to my gaining an understanding of the intricacies of arms control negotiations.
 Senator Byrd turned himself into not only a constitutional scholar but also an internationalist and something of a statesman. Though unable to depart from his often fierce protection of West Virginia's economy, he even made efforts to adapt to the environmental age. Greater senators have undoubtedly gone before and will come after. But few will have demonstrated the up-by-the-boot-straps personal transformation shown by the extraordinary life of Robert Byrd.
 -- GARY HART, Democrat of Colorado, who served in the Senate from 1975 to 1987
 Robert Byrd wrote a history of the Senate while he himself was making history within it. He also loved the folk songs of America, which he performed with voice and fiddle; recordings of some of his performances are now preserved among the special treasures of the archives of the American Folklife Center in the Library of Congress.
 Folk singers performed for him recently in his office and at a dinner in his honor; he rose from his wheelchair for both occasions and joined with full voice the singing and stomping of the performers for songs like ''There's More Pretty Girls Than One.''
 The last time I saw him, I was running through the halls of the Capitol. He stopped me and asked a question that no one had ever asked me before: ''What is the one book I should read in the Library of Congress?''
 -- JAMES H. BILLINGTON, librarian of Congress 
 When I came to the Senate, Robert Byrd -- the modern institutional memory, that magician of parliamentary procedure, a formidable foe and a trusted ally -- was quick to greet me warmly. He had served with my father, Senator Milward Simpson, and told me, ''Your father is a wonderful man, a man of patience, civility, kindness, humility and good humor.'' I thanked him. Within a year, I had a little ''dust-up'' with Senator Byrd and one evening on the floor, he said, ''Alan, I was thinking of your father again. You're not like your father!'' He then allowed that I was a bit more ''pesky'' than the old man! I'll never forget that one. He became a fine friend.
 You knew where you stood with him. During one night session, he asked me a remarkable question: ''Alan, in my leadership responsibilities, do our colleagues respect me or fear me?'' To me, the balance ran toward respect but I hedged: ''It's just that they are in total awe of you'' -- as we all were.
 -- ALAN K. SIMPSON, Republican of Wyoming, who served in the Senate from 1979 to 1997
 From the most humble beginnings, Robert Byrd grew in stature and wisdom to become one of the greatest senators in American history. He was a conservative in the best sense of that historic concept.
 During my presidential run of 1972, when asked what kind of person I would consider for the United States Supreme Court if I were elected, I said that Robert Byrd would be one I would seriously consider. While I did not approve of his early record on civil rights, I felt that his later education and growth on this and other major issues were highly commendable.
 At the time, some of my long-time liberal friends expressed their disapproval. But I thought I was right then and I still do all these years later. Senator Byrd was aware of the criticism I received, and was deeply moved that I had spoken about him as a possible Supreme Court appointee.
 He never ended up on the bench, but he did become the Senate's outstanding authority on constitutional government. I once told him that not one of us in the Senate had kept the pledge to uphold the Constitution more faithfully than he. In the late moments of that afternoon I saw his eyes glisten with tears.
 -- GEORGE McGOVERN, Democrat of South Dakota, who served in the Senate from 1963 to 1981 
 Robert Byrd may have been known to some as the King of Pork, and there's no question he redirected more than his share of federal money to West Virginia. But when it came to his personal tastes, he was remarkably modest. On my regular visits to his office for a book we were writing together, he talked up the cheese sandwiches he served me -- white bread with a dense, orange wedge inside -- as if food didn't get any better. He attended night law school as a congressman and senator, and his wife, Erma, would hand-deliver his ''paper poke'' meal, as he called it, a sandwich and ''maybe a pork chop or a piece of cheese.''
 Byrd's personal modesty led him to refrain from telling people, even his friend Senator Edward M. Kennedy, that he disliked being called ''Bob,'' as his Senate colleagues often addressed him. It was probably that same quality that kept him from ever going public with his fight with prostate cancer; for a period of months, from 1995 to 1996, he would leave home at 5 a.m. for radiation treatments, a total of 36, but kept them secret, even from much of his staff.
 The senator will be remembered for his great oratorical skills. But even here, he was modest. ''Words can move mountains,'' he told me after I'd politely declined yet another plate of cheese sandwiches. ''Nobody can stand in my way. I have to believe that I can be the best, and I do. I have to stay humble, too.''
 -- STEVE KETTMANN, co-author, with Senator Byrd, of ''Letter to a New President''
 I remember working with Robert Byrd on a horrendous struggle over the meaning of Senate Rule XXII, governing the filibuster. With his help, after weeks of struggle (and filibusters), we reduced the number of senators required to invoke cloture from 67 to 60, the most basic change in Senate rules in its history. Senator Byrd was able to forge a compromise where none appeared possible.
 A few weeks ago when I testified before the Senate Rules Committee to reform Rule XXII once more, there he was again, disabled in body but full of fight, testifying about his deep belief in the sanctity of the Senate and the responsibility to cherish and protect it, as he had done for longer than any other senator in American history.
 -- WALTER F. MONDALE, former vice president of the United States and Democrat of Minnesota, who served in the Senate from 1964 to 1976
 New members of the Senate spend sometimes tedious assigned hours presiding over the floor. For them, Robert Byrd's floor remarks became personal tutorials -- on the history of the United States Senate, and the Roman Senate as well. There were times when staff members, and perhaps even a new senator, might have wished for an abridged version, but the lessons were in the details, and those who listened learned.
 I recall a raucous back-and-forth Senate vote finishing at 11:59 p.m. Senator Byrd then spoke in detail on a matter he felt required constitutional elaboration. I was struck by how the weary senators stuck to their seats. We listened in deference and interest, because Senator Byrd knew when history could guide us aright.
 In times when outcomes seem to transcend the rules, when ''make it happen'' ignores how things happen, the Senate will sorely miss Senator Byrd's voice calling consciences to the Constitution. As he rests in peace, may the Senate have occasional second thoughts.
 -- JOHN D. ASHCROFT, a former United States attorney general and Republican of Missouri, who served in the Senate from 1995 to 2001
 I moved to Morgantown, W. Va., in 1993 to teach at West Virginia University. Senator Robert Byrd was the most popular politician in the state. I wasn't aware of his past with the Ku Klux Klan until one day, in my African-American literature class, a white student announced that Senator Byrd had been a member. I wasn't disturbed. Many good politicians had been on the wrong side of history at first. And, after all, I am from Barbour County, Alabama, the home of Gov. George C. Wallace, where even African-Americans aren't nearly as critical of him as the rest of the world is.
 Each semester another student would repeat the same announcement about Senator Byrd. I started to use it as a teaching tool. When are we forgiven for past mistakes? I asked my students to look at the buildings around campus, the hospitals and highways: this is your senator working for you.
 -- ETHEL MORGAN SMITH, professor of English at West Virginia University
 Senator Robert Byrd and I were neighbors for about a year, in one of the more nondescript subdivisions in McLean, Va. My young children and I would see him walking his little white dog on Saturdays; he was always affable, delighted to see us, and would chat for a few moments. At the same time, I couldn't help but notice that the shades and drapes in his windows were never open. Third in the line of succession to the White House, the Senate's president pro tem passed his few private hours in that simple suburban dwelling, with two Secret Service agents parked outside.
 I was once summoned to his office to accept the gift of a pastoral scene he had painted. He presented it in a solemn manner, with a great air of ceremony and for no reason I could ever discern. On another day, when the tragedy of the Iraq War was apparent, we met to share our alarm at the administration's dangerous, bellicose language. On that day we were entirely in sync.
 And if his filibuster of the Civil Rights Act was the nadir of his Senate career, his 2002 speech against the rush to war in Iraq was its apex. ''Fie upon the Congress,'' he thundered. The Congress that he loved.
 -- LINCOLN CHAFEE, Republican of Rhode Island, who served in the Senate from 1999 to 2007
 The Op-Ed editors asked former colleagues and constituents of Robert Byrd, who died on Monday, for their personal memories of the West Virginia senator.

PERSON: Robert C. Byrd 

HEADLINE: ROBERT C. BYRD, 1917-2010 : A Pillar of the Senate, a Champion for His State

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER

 BODY:
Robert C. Byrd served 51 years in the United States Senate, longer than anyone else in history, and with his six years in the House of Representatives, he was the longest-serving member of Congress. But it was how he used that record tenure that made him a pillar of Capitol Hill -- fighting, often with florid words, for the primacy of the legislative branch of government and building, always with canny political skills, a modern West Virginia with vast amounts of federal money.
 He had become an institution within an institution, as President Obama suggested in a statement of tribute on Monday, hours after Senator Byrd died at the age of 92 in a hospital in Fairfax, Va. Mr. Byrd, his health failing in recent years, had been admitted there late last week, experiencing heat exhaustion and severe dehydration as temperatures in the Washington area approached 100 degrees.
 ''America has lost a voice of principle and reason,'' the president said. 
 Mr. Byrd had held a number of Senate offices, including majority and minority leader and president pro tem. But the post that gave him the most satisfaction was chairman of the Appropriations Committee, with its power of the purse, a post he gave up only last year as his health declined. 
 A New Deal Democrat, Mr. Byrd used the position in large part to battle persistent poverty in West Virginia, which he called ''one of the rock bottomest of states.''
 He lived that poverty growing up in mining towns, and it fueled his ambition. As he wrote in his autobiography, ''Robert C. Byrd: Child of the Appalachian Coalfields'' (West Virginia University Press, 2005), ''it has been my constant desire to improve the lives of the people who have sent me to Washington time and time again.''
 That attention brought the state billions of dollars for highways, federal offices, research institutes and dams. It also attracted criticism. Citizens Against Government Waste, a nonpartisan watchdog group, regularly crowned him the ''king of pork,'' citing projects like the Robert C. Byrd Highway, two Robert C. Byrd federal buildings, the Robert C. Byrd Freeway, the Robert C. Byrd Center for Hospitality and Tourism, the Robert C. Byrd Drive and the Robert C. Byrd Hardwood Technologies Center.
 ''I lost no opportunity,'' Mr. Byrd said, ''to promote funding for programs and projects of benefit to the people back home.'' 
 Mr. Byrd was the valedictorian of his high school class but was unable to afford college. It was not until he was in his 30s and 40s that he took college courses. But he was profoundly self-educated and well read. His Senate speeches sparkled with citations from Shakespeare, the King James version of the Bible and the histories of England, Greece and Rome. 
 As a champion of the legislative branch, he found cautionary tales in those histories. In 1993, as Congress weighed a line-item veto, which would have given President Bill Clinton the power to strike individual spending measures from bills, Mr. Byrd delivered 14 speeches on the history of Rome and the role of its Senate.
 ''Gaius Julius Caesar did not seize power in Rome,'' he said. Rather, he said, ''the Roman Senate thrust power on Caesar deliberately, with forethought, with surrender, with intent to escape from responsibility.'' 
 A decade later, Mr. Byrd saw a similar lack of Congressional spine. In deferring to President George W. Bush on the Iraq war, Congress had shown a willingness to ''hand over, for the foreseeable future, its constitutional power to declare war,'' he wrote in ''Losing America: Confronting a Reckless and Arrogant Presidency'' (Norton, 2004).
 In 2007, at the unveiling of a portrait of Mr. Byrd in the Old Senate Chamber, former Senator Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland, a colleague of 30 years, recalled that Mr. Byrd had taught him how to answer when a constituent asked, ''How many presidents have you served under?''
 ''None,'' was Mr. Byrd's reply, Mr. Sarbanes said. ''I have served with presidents, not under them.''
 Senator Byrd died around 3 a.m. Monday at the Inova Hospital in Fairfax, his office said. He lived not far from there, in McLean, Va. Gov. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a Democrat, will appoint an interim successor. 
 Mr. Byrd's perspective on the world changed over the years. A former member of the Ku Klux Klan, he filibustered against the 1964 Civil Rights Act only to come to back civil rights measures and Mr. Obama. A supporter of the Vietnam War, he became a fierce critic, decades later, of the war in Iraq. In 1964, the Americans for Democratic Action, the liberal lobbying group, found that his views and the group's aligned only 16 percent of the time. In 2005, he got an A.D.A. rating of 95. 
 Mr. Byrd's political life could be traced to his early involvement with the Klan, an association that almost thwarted his career and clouded it intermittently for years afterward. 
 In the early 1940s, he organized a 150-member klavern, or chapter, of the Klan in Sophia, W.Va., and was chosen its leader. Afterward, Joel L. Baskin, the Klan's grand dragon for the region, suggested that Mr. Byrd use his ''talents for leadership'' by going into politics.
 ''Suddenly, lights flashed in my mind!'' Mr. Byrd later wrote. ''Someone important had recognized my abilities.'' 
 'A Sad Mistake'
 Mr. Byrd insisted that his klavern had never conducted white-supremacist marches or engaged in racial violence. He said in his autobiography that he had joined the Klan because he shared its anti-Communist creed and wanted to be associated with the leading people in his part of West Virginia. He conceded, however, that he also ''reflected the fears and prejudices'' of the time.
 His opponents used his Klan membership against him during his first run for the House of Representatives in 1952; Democratic leaders urged him to drop out of the race. But he stayed in and won, then spent decades apologizing for what he called a ''sad mistake.'' 
 He went on to vote for civil rights legislation in 1957 and 1960, but when the more sweeping Civil Rights Act was before Congress in 1964, he filibustered for an entire night against it, saying the measure was an infringement on states' rights. He backed civil rights legislation consistently only after becoming a party leader in the Senate.
 In the Senate, he was the Democratic leader from 1977 to 1989, though also something of a loner. He was not particularly well liked, and some senators feared him as a threat to their own spending projects. But he was deeply respected as a voice of the institution.
 ''His life is the Senate,'' said Bob Dole, the former senator from Kansas and Republican leader. ''He knows more about it than anyone living or dead. He doesn't watch television. He doesn't follow sports. He's dedicated his life to the institution and his family.'' 
 Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, who lost the position of majority whip to Mr. Byrd in 1971 but who became a friend and ally, especially in their opposition to the Iraq war, said in 2005 that Mr. Byrd's legacy would be ''his passion for preserving the institution and its prerogatives.''
 ''I think there is uniform respect for him for that in the Senate,'' Mr. Kennedy said, ''even from the people who have differed with him.''
 Mr. Byrd's respect and affection for Mr. Kennedy ran deep. In 2008, Mr. Byrd was distraught on the Senate floor after learning that a malignant tumor had been discovered in Mr. Kennedy's brain. ''Ted, Ted, my dear friend, I love you and miss you,'' Mr. Byrd said, his voice breaking. 
 In January 2009, when Mr. Kennedy suffered a seizure and collapsed during an inaugural luncheon for President Obama at the Capitol, Mr. Byrd, who was in a wheelchair next to him, grew emotional and had to leave the room after Mr. Kennedy was wheeled out. 
 And after Mr. Kennedy died that August, Mr. Byrd was present when the hearse bearing the body, on its way to Arlington National Cemetery, stopped at the Capitol steps so that members of Congress and their staffs could pay their respects. Mr. Byrd carried a small American flag and, again, wept. 
 A few days before, noting the rancor that surrounded proposals to revamp American health care, Mr. Kennedy's great cause, Mr. Byrd said his death was an occasion to put the discord aside. ''Let us stop the shouting and name calling and have a civilized debate on health care reform, which I hope, when legislation has been signed into law, will bear his name,'' he said.
 In an interview for this obituary in 2005, when asked what he considered his proudest Senate achievement, Mr. Byrd said it was his efforts to bring federal money to West Virginia. ''I'm proud I gave hope to my people,'' he said.
 West Virginians were grateful for the help. Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, a Democrat and the state's junior senator since 1985, said Mr. Byrd had meant ''everything, everything'' to the state. Mr. Byrd knew, he said, that ''before you can make life better, you have to have a road to get in there, and you have to have a sewerage system.'' 
 Bob Wise, a Democrat and a former West Virginia governor, once said that what Mr. Byrd had done for education -- ''the emphasis on reading and literacy'' -- mattered even more than roads.
 ''It's not only what Senator Byrd brought directly,'' Mr. Wise said, ''but the example he has lived throughout his life, about education being the way up.'' 
 From Humble Beginnings
 Mr. Byrd was born Cornelius Calvin Sale Jr. on Nov. 20, 1917, in North Wilkesboro, N.C. His mother died of influenza the next year, but before she did, she asked his father to give him to a sister and brother-in-law. They adopted him and renamed him Robert Carlyle Byrd, then moved to West Virginia. 
 As a boy, living on a small farm, he helped slaughter hogs, learned to play the fiddle and became a prize-winning Sunday school student after the manager of the local coal company store gave him two pairs of socks so that he could attend without embarrassment.
 In 1937, Mr. Byrd married Erma Ora James, his high school sweetheart. She died in 2006, after 68 years of marriage. Mr. Byrd is survived by their two daughters, Mona Fatemi of McLean and Marjorie Moore of Leesburg, Va.; five grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren.
 During World War II, Mr. Byrd worked as a welder building cargo ships in Baltimore and Tampa, Fla. When the war ended, in 1945, he returned to Crab Orchard, W.Va., to work in a supermarket. He taught Sunday school and an adult Bible class.
 Encouraged to enter politics by the Klan's grand dragon, he ran successfully for the state's House of Delegates in 1946 and again in 1948. In 1950, he was elected to the State Senate, and two years later, to Congress. During his campaign, he played the fiddle at one rural stop after another.
 Soon after arriving in Washington, he enrolled in night law school classes, despite his lack of a bachelor's degree. It took him 10 years, but he earned a law degree, cum laude, from American University in 1963. President John F. Kennedy presented his diploma.
 In the House, he spoke up for the coal industry, pushed for highway and military money and, in 1955, traveled around the world as a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.
 He waged his first race for the United States Senate in 1958 and won easily: the nation was in a recession, and West Virginia was largely Democratic. 
 With the Democrats gaining 13 seats in that election, spots opened up on major committees, and Lyndon B. Johnson, the majority leader, gave quite a few to freshmen. Mr. Byrd was put on the Appropriations Committee, and he promptly got to work winning money for West Virginia projects. 
 In 1960 he backed Johnson for president and campaigned against John F. Kennedy in the West Virginia primary. Kennedy's forces retaliated by bringing up Mr. Byrd's Klan connection. Kennedy won the primary. That summer, Mr. Byrd voted for the 1960 Civil Rights Act, a Johnson measure that allowed federal judges to appoint referees to register voters after discrimination had been proved in court.
 But in 1964, with Johnson now president and no longer a force in the Senate, Mr. Byrd sided with Senator Richard B. Russell Jr. of Georgia, the leader of Southern Democrats, and filibustered against a stronger civil rights measure that would open restaurants and hotels to blacks, ban job discrimination and enable the Justice Department to register black voters in Deep South states. Mr. Byrd also opposed the 1965 Voting Rights Act and its renewal in 1970, again arguing that they violated states' rights. 
 He went on to support the war in Vietnam and attack the Supreme Court over decisions prohibiting organized school prayer and ensuring rights for people suspected of committing crimes. 
 In 1967 he was elected secretary of the Senate Democratic Conference, the No. 3 leadership position. He made the job important by spending almost all day on the Senate floor, scheduling votes to accommodate fellow senators and keeping track of favors asked and delivered. In essence, he was doing the job of the Democratic whip, which Senator Russell B. Long of Louisiana, the elected whip, was neglecting.
 But in 1969, with the encouragement of the majority leader, Senator Mike Mansfield of Montana, Senator Kennedy ran against Mr. Long for the job that Mr. Byrd had been awaiting.
 ''To my astonishment,'' Mr. Byrd said in a 1993 interview, ''Ted Kennedy came in, leaped over me and ran for the office of whip and defeated Russell Long.''
 Defending Tradition
 Mr. Kennedy did not pay much more attention to details than Mr. Long had, and Mr. Byrd continued to do much of the whip's work. He described their relationship as ''enmity.'' In 1971 he set out to line up the votes to surprise Mr. Kennedy and oust him. With a deathbed proxy from Mr. Russell, he won, 31 to 24.
 Six years later, in January 1977, Mr. Byrd was elected majority leader, replacing Mr. Mansfield, who had retired.
 Among the toughest legislation Congress handled soon afterward was the pair of treaties that would shift control of the Panama Canal and the Canal Zone to Panama from the United States.
 Mr. Byrd came to support the treaties after military leaders convinced him that their passage would avoid unrest in Panama and best ensure uninterrupted use of the canal.
 Despite pressure from conservative organizations and overwhelmingly negative constituent mail, Mr. Byrd, working with Senator Howard H. Baker Jr., the Republican leader, won ratification of both treaties in 1978 by separate votes of 68 to 32 -- the required two-thirds majority of 67, plus a vote to spare.
 The canal issue cost the Democrats enough seats in the next two elections to give the Republicans a majority and relegate Mr. Byrd to minority leader in 1981. Six years later, the Democrats rebounded and Mr. Byrd's position as majority leader was restored.
 But after the 1988 elections, Senate Democrats replaced him with someone they thought would make a better spokesman on television -- Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine. 
 Mr. Byrd was given his dream job, as the Appropriations Committee chairman. ''I hope to become West Virginia's billion-dollar industry,'' Mr. Byrd said.
 ''By the time this six-year term of mine is up'' in 1995, he went on, ''I will have added at least a billion dollars. That's my goal for West Virginia.''
 In 1991, he had already reached that goal, four years early, according to a tally by The Associated Press. 
 Mr. Byrd wrote four books. He compiled speeches about the Senate into a four-volume history of the institution. His speeches about the Roman Senate were published in 1995. 
 Mr. Byrd always carried a copy of the Constitution. He was particularly proud of legislation requiring that educational institutions receiving federal aid teach students about the Constitution on the anniversary of its signing, Sept. 17. 
 He had an abiding concern for the traditions and dignity of the Senate. When the Senate was struggling to agree on rules for the impeachment trial of Mr. Clinton in 1999, Mr. Byrd warned that the Senate itself was also on trial.
 ''The White House has sullied itself,'' he said, ''and the House has fallen into a black pit of partisanship and self-indulgence. The Senate is teetering on the brink of that same black pit.'' 
 When, in 2005, Republicans considered banning the filibuster on judicial nominations, he warned that such an action would change the ''nature of the Senate by destroying the right of free speech it has enjoyed since its creation.''
 He denounced the 2002 Congressional resolution authorizing Mr. Bush to make war on Iraq. It ''amounted to a complete evisceration of the Congressional prerogative to declare war,'' he wrote in ''Losing America.'' 
 Mr. Byrd feared for the legislative branch. In a 1994 interview celebrating the defeat of a proposed balanced-budget amendment, he said, ''The basic power which is probably more fundamental than any other power in the Constitution is the power of the purse.''
 ''That power of the purse belongs to the people,'' Mr. Byrd said. ''And that is where it is vested. It is vested in the branch that represents the people, elected by the people.''

HEADLINE: Afghan Lessons, Beyond McChrystal

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In ''Worse Than a Nightmare'' (column, June 26), Bob Herbert gets our dilemma in Afghanistan exactly right. We either fight the war aggressively, killing scores of civilians, angering Muslims throughout the Middle East and creating more terrorists; or we restrain our forces, thus appealing to Afghan hearts and minds, but risking more American lives and angering both our troops and the American public.
 The only solution to this dilemma is to withdraw our troops from Afghanistan. 
 Peter Schanck Santa Fe, N.M., June 26, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Bob Herbert's column should cause moral outrage against the war in Afghanistan.
 A nation that permits only a small fraction of its citizens to bear the burden of combat and drains its financial resources in a winless effort while denying unemployment benefits to its citizens is morally reprehensible.
 I agree with Mr. Herbert that if a war is worth fighting, and I do not believe that this one is, then either the whole nation goes to war or nobody goes to war.
 John A. Viteritti Southold, N.Y., June 26, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Bob Herbert laments our inability to exit the ''fetid quagmire of Afghanistan.'' I believe that the fighting and dying would end if we were to reinstate the draft.
 Byron Alpers Shorewood, Wis., June 26, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Re ''The 36 Hours That Shook Washington'' (column, June 27):
 Frank Rich, writing about Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal's being removed from Afghanistan, observed that ''the present strategy has produced no progress in this nearly nine-year-old war, even as the monthly coalition body count has just reached a new high.''
 Pretty soon, we're going to have to start comparing Vietnam to Afghanistan, instead of vice versa.
 David S. Ewing Venice, Calif., June 27, 2010
 To the Editor:
 In ''The Culture of Exposure'' (column, June 25), David Brooks essentially blames the 24/7 news media whose job it is to feed a scandal-hungry public for Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal's fall from military grace.
 No one is to blame but the general himself. It was not the media that showed a callous disrespect for the president, the vice president and the national security adviser, nor was it the media that undermined America's mission in Afghanistan. Those words came from General McChrystal. Michael Hastings, the Rolling Stone reporter, simply did his job in reporting them.
 If high-level government and military officials like General McChrystal truly wish to avoid embarrassing public relations nightmares and retain their positions, then perhaps, especially in this constant news cycle, it is incumbent on them to muzzle their public ''kvetching.''
 Andy Ostroy New York, June 25, 2010
 The writer is a contributor to The Huffington Post.
 To the Editor
 Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal and his aides have a right to kvetch. But as our top-level tacticians in a complicated war, they also have a duty to assess every situation. Michael Hastings is not their spouse, clergyman, psychiatrist or even trusted friend; he is a journalist for a national publication. They should have known the difference.
 Pauline Yoo New York, June 25, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Even though I never liked Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal and am happy that he is gone, the fault here is with the journalist. He should never have published these private conversations between the general and his senior staff. They were not for publication.
 Journalists have the obligation to be sensitive to the moment and to know what should go to print and what to leave behind.
 Sonia Warriner Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., June 25, 2010
 To the Editor:
 It seems obvious to me that an experienced general with political savvy knew exactly what he was doing when he made inappropriate comments requiring his resignation. He did not want to be remembered as the general who lost the war in Afghanistan.

HEADLINE: 30 Valedictorians: Too Much of a Good Thing?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Your insightful June 27 front-page article ''How Many Graduates Can Be No.1? Ask the 30 Valedictorians'' provides another look at what happens as grades are persistently inflated while the curriculum is steadily dumbed down in American schools. 
 Of course this feel-good maneuvering is done in the name of bolstering students' self-esteem. But I'm afraid that these practices actually have a very detrimental effect: teaching young people that they can get (and therefore expect) things they didn't actually earn.
 Unless students graduate with the identical highest grade point average in their class, they are not really a ''valedictorian.''
 In the real world, these same kids will often not even get what they do deserve, whether that's a pay raise, a promotion or the trust of another person. Better to start toughening them up in high school. Then they'll be able to rise above the slights and adversity that come to everyone and have a shot at enjoying true success in life.
 Clayton Boothe Grand Rapids, Mich., June 27, 2010
 To the Editor:
 The emerging trend of recognizing multiple valedictorians is an ominous sign for our educational system and the nation.
 Spreading the traditional academic honor may well reduce competition and pressure. But it will hardly motivate students toward academic achievement or prepare them for the realities of post-graduation life.
 With luck, this flawed ''feel good'' experiment will be abandoned before it becomes the norm.
 Arnie Mori Fairport, N.Y., June 27, 2010
 To the Editor:
 As a history teacher for 45 years, I was led to speculate about the percentage of those valedictorians who benefited from another educational fad: the awarding of extra time to certain students for the taking of tests and completing assignments.
 In American schools, grade inflation is so out of control that a B minus is a classroom teacher's best and safest choice for indicating an actual grade of F. One Harvard professor, obviously a warrior on the front lines of academic excellence, assigns two grades. The first one is the ''Harvard grade'' and the second one is the ''actual grade.''
 In a class discussion of the desirability of the extra-time option, a young man turned to the class and asked everyone to raise his hand if he wanted a heart surgeon to operate on him who had been awarded extra time on his exams. Not a single student raised his hand.

HEADLINE: Winds From Storm in Gulf Disrupt Cleanup Efforts

BYLINE: By HENRY FOUNTAIN; Campbell Robertson contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The first major storm of the season in the Gulf of Mexico disrupted oil spill cleanup and containment work on Tuesday, BP and the Coast Guard said.
 But the storm, named Alex, was not expected to delay efforts to plug BP's runaway well 40 miles off the Louisiana coast, and it could help disperse some of the tens of millions of gallons of oil that have spewed into the gulf since late April.
 Alex started the day as a tropical storm, but its winds reached hurricane strength, exceeding 74 miles per hour late Tuesday. The storm was on track to make landfall Wednesday in northern Mexico and southern Texas. That would keep it far southwest of the well site, as well as coastal areas of Louisiana and other gulf states affected by the disaster. 
 But the winds were raising wave heights to seven feet or more, forcing the suspension of skimming operations and controlled burns, the Coast Guard said. Rough seas make it impossible to contain oil so that skimmers can pick it up or it can be ignited.
 High waves at the well site delayed surface work to prepare for the next phase of BP's system to collect oil at the wellhead, said Toby Odone, a company spokesman. That phase, in which up to 25,000 barrels of oil a day would be collected through a free-standing riser pipe that could be quickly disconnected if a hurricane threatened, is now expected to be completed in early July.
 But BP said existing systems that are collecting about 25,000 barrels a day were not affected by the rough seas, nor were efforts to drill two relief wells that are considered the ultimate solution to plugging the well. 
 Chris Vaccaro, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said winds from the storm might tend to push oil toward the Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama coasts. But there was little possibility of oil being pushed inland. 
 ''We're not dealing with a situation where we're running the risk of having a storm surge with oil in it,'' he said.
 Mr. Vaccaro said the winds and higher seas may help ''weather'' the oil, breaking it up into smaller droplets that are more easily consumed by microbes. While some weathering occurs in all conditions, he said, a major storm ''helps by stirring up the water and literally pounding away at it.''
 In addition to higher winds and waves, the gulf was due for heavy rains as moisture brought into the region by the tropical storm encountered a cold front from the north, said Eric Wilhelm, a meteorologist with AccuWeather in State College, Pa. 
 The rainfall may flush marshes and other sensitive coastal areas, Mr. Vaccaro said. 
 Any reprieve would be welcomed by fishermen throughout the gulf whose work has been halted by the spill. Some of them gathered in New Orleans on Tuesday to listen to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who met with response officials in a command center downtown and spoke at the dock of a seafood wholesaler that has been idled.
 Mr. Biden traveled to Pomes Seafood with Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana; Representative Anh Cao, Republican of Louisiana; Admiral Thad W. Allen of the Coast Guard; and other officials. 
 The fishermen said it was as grim a time as they could recall. As the oil moves around Louisiana's southeastern shoreline, closings of fishing areas are being declared like a rolling blackout -- this bay is out, now this one, they say this area will be closed on Wednesday -- so hundreds of fishermen are fighting for smaller and smaller spaces. 
 Mr. Biden emphasized to the fishermen that the spill's effects were more than economic and ecological. The oil spill, he said, was not only a threat to a natural ecosystem but to a cultural ecosystem, a way of life that goes back generations.
 ''It's in your blood,'' he said. ''It's in your bone, the bone of your bone. It's who you all are and who you've always been.''
 When the speech was over, Mr. Biden posed for pictures with the fishermen and their families and left for a flight to Pensacola, Fla., where an oil slick has washed ashore days before the holiday weekend, usually the peak of the tourist season.

HEADLINE: Bank Tax Is Dropped In Overhaul Of Industry

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Jackie Calmes, Carl Hulse and Edward Wyatt contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Congressional negotiators briefly reopened the conference proceedings on a sweeping financial regulatory bill on Tuesday after Senate Republicans who had supported an earlier version of the measure threatened to block final approval unless Democrats removed a proposed tax on big banks and hedge funds. 
 Conference negotiators voted to eliminate the proposed tax and adopted a new plan to pay the projected five-year, $20 billion cost of the legislation. 
 The new plan would bring an early end to the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the mammoth financial system bailout effort enacted in 2008, and redirect about $11 billion toward heightened regulation of the financial industry.
 The conferees also voted to increase the reserve ratio of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, but specified that small depository institutions -- those with less than $10 billion in consolidated assets -- be exempt from paying any increase. 
 They also voted to permanently set the maximum deposit insured by the F.D.I.C. at $250,000 per account, a change that would further raise the amount banks must pay toward the coverage.
 The votes were again on party lines, with Democrats in favor and Republicans opposed. Senate negotiators voted 7 to 5 to approve the revised package, and House negotiators voted 20 to 11.
 Democrats expressed frustration, saying they were adjusting the bill to meet the demands of centrist Senate Republicans only to face stiff criticism from Republicans on the committee. 
 ''Frankly, I'm caught in the middle of an intra-Republican debate here,'' said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the Financial Services Committee, who presided over the conference proceedings with Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the banking committee. 
 The need to reopen negotiations was slightly embarrassing for Democrats and represented a price they had paid for rushing to complete the legislation.
 President Obama had requested that the package be completed by the end of last week so that it could be sent to his desk before Congress went home for the Fourth of July. The proposed tax on banks was one of the provisions included as Democrats completed the bill shortly before daybreak on Friday. 
 But the Democrats were forced to change the bill after Senator Scott Brown, the Massachusetts Republican who had supported the Senate bill, said he would oppose the final version because it contained the tax on banks. Other senators who had supported the original Senate version also said they were unhappy with the levy on financial institutions. 
 Senate Democrats cannot advance the measure without the cooperation of at least some Republicans, and the death on Monday of Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, who had supported the bill, further complicated the legislative math. 
 With the changes, Democrats said they were confident they would be able to muster the needed votes in the Senate, at least on the procedural motion to end debate. The vote on final adoption of the conference report requires only a simple majority.
 But some Republicans who oppose the larger financial regulation bill reacted furiously to the idea of using spending authority freed up by ending the Troubled Asset Relief Program before its scheduled Oct. 3 expiration. 
 Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire and a member of the conference committee, noted that the asset relief program money was borrowed in the first place. 
 Mr. Gregg called the plan ''pure deception'' of taxpayers, who he said were promised that any money left from the program would be paid back to the Treasury. ''I know this because I wrote it,'' he said. ''As this money comes back, we shouldn't spend it.'' 
 Mr. Frank said the full House could vote on the adjusted final bill as soon as Wednesday. But given procedural hurdles it seemed unlikely that the Senate could approve the measure before the holiday recess. 
 The Obama administration supported the change in the final bill, in part because of concern that the proposed fee on big banks in the financial regulatory measure would complicate Mr. Obama's efforts to impose a separate, larger $90 billion bank tax over 10 years. 
 ''We support the action taken by the conference committee today and we are committed to helping pass this bill,'' said Amy Brundage, a spokeswoman. ''The bill has been strengthened throughout this process.''
 Mr. Brown was one of four Republicans to support the Senate version of the financial regulatory bill, which did not include the fee on banks and hedge funds. And he said he was frustrated that it was added to the bill by the conference committee.
 In a letter sent Monday to Mr. Dodd and Mr. Frank, Mr. Brown wrote: ''If the final version of this bill contains these higher taxes, I will not support it.'' 
 Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, who also supported the Senate version, made the same complaint on Monday but said she had not decided if it was reason to switch her vote. 
 Mr. Brown's opposition to the bank fee may put him in an awkward position given that there were few popular options to pay for the legislation. 
 Democrats had argued that the fee on big banks and hedge funds meant that the wealthiest players on Wall Street would bear responsibility for the new regulatory environment necessitated by the past mistakes of financial institutions. 
 Mr. Brown, in his letter, complained that a tax on banks would be passed along to consumers. But using money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program opens him to criticism that he forced taxpayers to pick up the tab.
 Heather Booth, director of Americans for Financial Reform, said she believed Mr. Brown's reasons for opposing the bank fees missed the point of overhauling the regulatory system. 
 ''Not passing this bill will cost taxpayers more,'' Ms. Booth said. ''It increases the risk in the economy over all.''
 She said her organization believed the biggest banks -- approximately 30 with assets of more than $50 billion that would be subject to the assessments -- had fanned the opposition.
 Senate Democrats need 60 votes to close debate on the conference report and move to a final vote. There are now 58 senators in the Democratic caucus, including two independents.
 One Democrat, Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, has said he will oppose the regulatory overhaul because he does not believe the bill is tough enough. 
 Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, who also opposed the bill, has not said how she will vote, but she could agree to help Democrats overcome a Republican filibuster by supplying the 60th vote on procedural grounds but then oppose the final measure.

HEADLINE: Dogs, Children, Gardening: Couples Accused as Spies Were Suburbs Personified

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ and FERNANDA SANTOS; Reporting was contributed by Lisa W. Foderaro, David Gonzalez, Abby Goodnough, Nate Schweber, Scott Shane and Benjamin Weiser.

 BODY:
They raised children, went to work in the city each day, talked the small talk with neighbors about yard work and overpriced contractors. In short, they could have been any family in any suburb in America.
 In Montclair, N.J., a woman who lived next to the Murphy family described them as ''suburbia personified.'' They asked their neighbors for advice about the best middle schools to send their two young daughters. Richard Murphy mowed the lawn; Cynthia Murphy would come home from her job as a financial-services executive, daffodils and French bread in her hands. 
 ''We would talk about gardening and dogs and kids,'' said one neighbor, Corine Jones, 53. 
 Miles away in Yonkers, there lived another ordinary couple, Vicky Pelaez and her husband, Juan Jose Lazaro Sr. They doted on their two pet schnauzers and their teenage son, Juan Jose Lazaro Jr., a classical pianist. 
 The elder Mr. Lazaro had been known among his students at Baruch College for his outspoken left-leaning politics, and his comments in class offended some but earned respect from others, just as Ms. Pelaez's columns for El Diario La Prensa, one of the country's most popular Spanish-language newspapers, had earned her a following of both fans and critics.
 And in Cambridge, Mass., there was Donald Heathfield and his wife, Tracey Lee Ann Foley. He received his master's degree in public administration from Harvard's Kennedy School of Government in 2000; she worked for a real estate company, passing a background check before she was hired.
 Movies, books and television shows have taken to depicting suburbia as a place where not all is as it seems, where people with decent jobs and decent homes mask their secret double lives, and that seemed to be the case here: The three couples were among 11 people arrested as part of a ring that prosecutors said spied for the Russians under deep cover inside the United States. 
 Relatives, friends, classmates, neighbors and co-workers of the three couples expressed shock at the arrests, and they searched their memories for signs that something was amiss, but mostly came up blank. 
 ''I didn't know they were spies, but I know what they weren't,'' said Stanley Skolnik, 67, a neighbor of the Murphys. ''They weren't unusual.''
 Some of those who knew the couples said there might have been clues, too subtle to cause concern. A neighbor asked Ms. Murphy, who received her M.B.A. from Columbia Business School last month, if she was from Russia, after hearing her accent. Ms. Murphy said that no, she was from Belgium.
 Classmates of Mr. Heathfield at Harvard thought highly of him, but ''his work was a little bit mysterious,'' said Craig Sandler, a classmate who is the president of State House News Service, a news organization in Boston.
 But there were also those who were skeptical that federal investigators had arrested the right individuals, saying that they did not believe the accusations and, in the case of Ms. Pelaez and Mr. Lazaro, that their pro-Communist political views made them targets of the investigation. 
 On Tuesday afternoon, as Waldo Mariscal, Ms. Pelaez's son from a previous marriage, walked out of the family's house in Yonkers, he was asked if Ms. Pelaez and Mr. Lazaro had any connection to Russia. 
 ''Yes,'' Mr. Mariscal said. ''Russian music. Tchaikovsky.'' 
 Unlike other Americans accused of spying over the decades, the three couples did not shy from leading private lives that were in many ways quite public. Ms. Murphy kept a page on the networking Web site LinkedIn. Another of the 11 arrested, Anna Chapman, ran a real estate Web site and said she wanted to start a venture fund to broker partnerships between American and Russian businessmen. 
 In her native country, Peru, Ms. Pelaez had earned acclaim as a television reporter for Frecuencia Latina, and was briefly kidnapped in 1984 by a group of leftist insurgents.
 At El Diario, where she had worked for more than 20 years, Ms. Pelaez's columns had a following, broaching topics that were openly sympathetic to Cuba, Haiti and Venezuela and that were critical of the Bush and Obama administrations. Her work was reprinted on leftist Web sites, including some sponsored by the Cuban government.
 ''It's not like I'm defending Vicky just for the sake of defending her, but I know her as a dedicated mother and a compassionate woman who would take food out of her mouth to give to someone who needs it,'' Monica Chang, a friend of Ms. Pelaez's who worked with her at Frecuencia Latina, said in a telephone interview from Peru.
 The authorities said that of the three couples, all but Ms. Pelaez had assumed false identities. And while neighbors and relatives detailed all the ways that they were typical families, the criminal complaint filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan detailed their alleged work as secret agents. 
 Ms. Chapman had met regularly with a Russian government official since January, the complaint said. On Saturday, after a meeting with an F.B.I. undercover agent posing as a Russian consulate employee, she bought a cellphone and provided a false name and address: 99 Fake Street.
 Ms. Pelaez and Mr. Lazaro were accused of receiving packages of money from representatives of the Russian government. Surveillance of their Yonkers home in 2003 revealed ''the irregular electronic clicking sounds associated with the receipt of coded radio transmissions,'' according to federal court papers. 
 In fall 2008, the elder Mr. Lazaro taught a class on Latin American politics at Baruch College. Students said he denounced the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and praised the health and educational systems in Cuba; among the required reading was ''The Secret History of the American Empire: Economic Hit Men, Jackals and the Truth About Global Corruption.''

HEADLINE: Who Will Fight for the Unemployed?

 BODY:
Without doubt, the two biggest threats to the economy are unemployment and the dire financial condition of the states, yet lawmakers have failed to deal intelligently with either one. 
 Federal unemployment benefits began to expire nearly a month ago. Since then, 1.2 million jobless workers have been cut off. The House passed a six-month extension as part of a broader spending bill in May, but the Senate, despite three attempts, has not been able to pass a similar bill. The majority leader, Harry Reid, said he was ready to give up after the third try last week when all of the Senate's Republicans and a lone Democrat, Ben Nelson of Nebraska, blocked the bill.
 Meanwhile, the states face a collective budget hole of some $112 billion, but neither the House nor the Senate has a plan to help. The House stripped a provision for $24 billion in state fiscal aid from its earlier spending bill. The Senate included state aid in its ill-fated bill to extend unemployment benefits; when that bill failed, the promise of aid vanished as well. 
 As a result, 30 states that had counted on the money to help balance their budgets will be forced to raise taxes even higher and to cut spending even deeper in the budget year that begins on July 1. That will only worsen unemployment, both among government workers and the states' private contractors. Worsening unemployment means slower growth, or worse, renewed recession. 
 So if lawmakers are wondering why consumer confidence and the stock market are tanking (the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index hit a new low for the year on Tuesday), they need look no further than a mirror. 
 The situation cries out for policies to support economic growth -- specifically jobless benefits and fiscal aid to states. But instead of delivering, Congressional Republicans and many Democrats have been asserting that the nation must act instead to cut the deficit. The debate has little to do with economic reality and everything to do with political posturing. A lot of lawmakers have concluded that the best way to keep their jobs is to pander to the nation's new populist mood and play off the fears of the very Americans whose economic well-being Congress is threatening.
 Deficits matter, but not more than economic recovery, and not more urgently than the economic survival of millions of Americans. A sane approach would couple near-term federal spending with a credible plan for deficit reduction -- a mix of tax increases and spending cuts -- as the economic recovery takes hold. 
 But today's deficit hawks -- many of whom eagerly participated in digging the deficit ever deeper during the George W. Bush years -- are not interested in the sane approach. In the Senate, even as they blocked the extension of unemployment benefits, they succeeded in preserving a tax loophole that benefits wealthy money managers at private equity firms and other investment partnerships. They also derailed an effort to end widespread tax avoidance by owners of small businesses organized as S-corporations. If they are really so worried about the deficit, why balk at these evidently sensible ways to close tax loopholes and end tax avoidance?
 House lawmakers made an effort on Tuesday to extend jobless benefits but failed to get the necessary votes, and it remains uncertain if an extension can pass both the House and Senate before Congress leaves town on Friday for a weeklong break. What's needed, and what's lacking, is leadership, both in Congress and from the White House, to set the terms of the debate -- jobs before deficit reduction -- and to fight for those terms, with failure not an option.
