HEADLINE: Safeguarding Social Security Checks as They Go Electronic

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Consumer groups urge the government to increase safeguards for seniors as Social Security checks go electronic. 

 BODY:
Consumer groups -- along with paper-producing interests - -are urging the federal government to improve safeguards for Social Security recipients, as the government phases out paper checks for beneficiaries in favor of electronic deposits.
Beginning in March, all Social Security checks will be deposited electronically unless recipients apply for and receive a waiver to keep getting payments via paper checks.
Recipients must receive the payments by direct deposit to a bank account, or to a debit card, including the government's DirectExpress card. The debit cards allow beneficiaries to make retail purchases with the card or withdraw the funds from automatic teller machines. If current recipients don't choose a deposit optionby March 1, they'll automatically be sent a DirectExpress card to avoid any delay in receipt of benefits, the Social Security Administration says.
The move is part of an continuing effort by the federal government to reduce paper and cut costs by going electronic for all sorts of things, including savings bonds, unemployment benefits and Social Security benefit statements. Already, 94 percent of beneficiaries receive payments electronically, according to the Office of Inspector General for the Social Security Administration.
But in testimony before a congressional committee this month, consumer advocates urged the government to make sure that safeguards are in place to prevent fraud, like re-directing recipients' electronic payments, and that the waiver process for recipients who do not want electronic deposits is clear and straightforward.
Beneficiaries aged 92 and older are exempt from the electronic deposit requirement, and others who still want to get paper checks can apply for a waiver. But according to testimony from the National Consumer Law Center, the waiver process is so difficult that few waivers actually have been granted. The group urges the government to liberalize the waiver process, so people who are more comfortable getting paper checks may continue to do so.
While the vast majority of recipients already have voluntarily switched to electronic deposit, "the
population that has resisted doing so to date generally has a good reason," according to testimony from Margot Freeman Saunders, a lawyer with the consumer law center. They include people who don't have a bank account; those who don't understand or feel comfortable with direct deposit; and people who already have workable and affordable methods of receiving their benefits.
Of the over 72,000 calls received by Treasury between May 1, 2011 and July 30, 2012 regarding a waiver, only about 14,000 were even sent a waiver packet with instructions, she said. Then, only 281 notarized responses were received back by Treasury. Those numbers, Ms. Freeman Saunders said, are a "clear illustration" that the need for the waiver far exceeds the number of people actually obtaining one.
Fraud is another concern. The Inspector Generalof the Social Security Administration said in testimony to Congress this month that it has received more than 19,000 reports about questionable or unauthorized changes to recipients' direct-deposit information, apparently as part of efforts to illegally re-direct monthly payments. "These reports have involved either an unauthorized change to direct deposit information, or a suspected attempt to make such a change," according to testimony by Patrick P. O'Carroll Jr., the inspector general for the SSA.
The Inspector General has recommended Social Security make changes to prevent fraudulent redirection of deposits, like developing an automatic notification system to alert recipients of any changes to their deposit information.
On a less dramatic level, consumer groups caution that debit cards may pose challenges for some senior citizens, who may not be used to using PINs and many not know how to properly safeguard them. The cards also carry fees that seniors may be unaccustomed to paying. Fees under DirectExpress are relatively limited; the card offers one free A.T.M. withdrawal after the funds are deposited, and subsequent withdrawals carry a 90-cent fee. Fees also apply for receiving a monthly paper statement (75 cents) and for transferring funds to a personal bank account ($1.50).
A new advocacy group, Consumers for Paper Options, argues that the move will present a hardship for many elderly check recipients. The group has asked the government to retain paper checks as the default option, with electronic delivery available if requested by recipients.
"We think people ought to have a choice for important financial information," said John Runyan, executive director of Consumers for Paper Options. He said the non-profit is primarily backed by "paper-based communication interests," like the Envelope Manufacturers Association, the American Forest Paper Association and various paper companies.
Do you or your relatives receive a paper Social Security check? Are you concerned about the move to electronic payments?

HEADLINE: The Economics of Law School

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: The trend away from law schools has prompted much discussion about what structural changes may be needed. 

 BODY:
Law schools have come under fire during these tough economic times, with critics saying that they leave too many graduates in debt, chasing too few employment opportunities. But it could be worse. Consider the plight of veterinarians.
The average tuition and expenses for a veterinary degree at a private school has doubled in the last 10 years to over $200,000, well above the typical cost of law school. Yet their pay remains moribund at an average of $66,469 - much less than lawyers.
But unlike law schools, veterinary school is not regularly being called a scam or bubble. In fact, applications to veterinary schools were up about 2 percent last year.
 Meanwhile, the number of applicants to law schoolis down 13.7 percent for this year's class after a 10 percent drop from 2011, according to the Law Students Admissions Council.
Perhaps today's youth are more eager to defend animals than people. Or maybe lawyers are better at voicing their dissatisfaction.
Regardless, the trend away from law schools has prompted much discussion about what structural changes may be needed. Should law schools charge less? Should they strip down their programs? Should they abandon their collegiate ivory towers in favor of a trade-school approach by having "real world" lawyers teach practical skills?
None of these solutions, however, are likely to improve the economics of law school.
I believe that law students do need more training in practical skills, but a focus on that is probably only going to make law school more expensive.
A single law professor can easily teach 70 students in one contracts law class, but a clinical professor is limited to six to 10 people a class. If reducing costs is the goal, then more clinical education will only increase it.
A second alternative is to pay professors less, or replace them with practitioners who would also be paid less. The average senior law professor who is not at a top-ranked school makes $130,000 to $150,000 according to a survey by the Society of American Law Teachers. It's a nice salary, but certainly not comparable to what a law firm partner earns.
This year, the law school at Ohio State University, where I teach, hired a former editor in chief of The Michigan Law Review and a Supreme Court clerk. Both could be paid far more in the private sector, where the hiring bonus alone for a Supreme Court clerk can be $280,000. If the salaries for their positions are even further reduced to make Ohio State's law school cheaper, they are likely to be replaced by less qualified people.
For this reason, good practitioners are likely to be even more expensive than law professors. After all, the average partner at a big law firm can make well over a million dollars a year.
So what if universities hire less qualified, lower-paid practitioners instead, you may ask? Well, quality matters.
U.S. News & World Report lists 15 law schools where tuition is currently less than $15,000 a year. CUNY School of Law, in New York City, has an in-state tuition of $12,090 and is ranked in the third tier by U.S. News. But there is not a flight of applications to these lower-cost schools from higher-paying ones. Instead, students still flock to top-tier schools with the highest-quality professors. In 2011, CUNY's applications were down from the year before.
Creating less expensive law schools with less-qualified staff may give graduates a degree, but that may not better qualify them for jobs. This points to another inherent problem with critiques of law schools - all are lumped together. This points to another inherent problem with critiques of law schools - all are lumped together.
There is, however, a qualitative difference between the top 15 law schools and the rest. These elite schools charge sky-high tuition that can exceed $50,000 a year. But graduates have a good chance of securing a coveted job with a starting salary of $165,000 a year - a salary that is likely to improve as the economy does. For a 26-year-old, that's certainly good money. Duke, for instance, which was No. 11 on the U.S. News rankings, said its graduates had a 95 percent employment rate last year, with an average private sector salary of $160,000.
There may be valid criticism about lower-ranked law schools, particularly those U.S. News places in the third and fourth tier. Such private schools often charge significant tuition but do not obtain the same employment outcomes. The question is whether changes can be made to lower their costs, and whether this will lead to better opportunities for their graduates.
The problem of law school is one that is ubiquitous to higher education - the current model is inherently expensive but even today, lower-priced alternatives don't seem to meet the standards or be desired by many students.
It is here where revolutionary technologies like online learning may come into play. If it becomes accepted that many basics like contracts law can be easily taught by one professor online to thousands of students, then a law school can charge a lot less. But this is still mostly a theoretical change embraced by those outside academia that has yet to sweep universities. Even with one online course, some local presence will be needed to facilitate learning, particularly if there is skills training involved.
It may not be simple enough to just pin the blame on the costs of law school education. For 2011 law school graduates, as of nine months after graduation, only 65.4 percent were employed in jobs requiring passage of the bar. And law schools should learn to be more innovative, as other types of graduate programs are doing.
Law schools have also hurt themselves badly by failing to fully disclose certain statistics, including their employment rates. It is clear that the number of lawyers in the United States will fall as fewer people apply to law school. But this trend will probably shrink enrollment, not decrease the number of schools over all.
In the longer term, the question is whether there will be a recovery in law jobs as the economy heals. There is hope that will be the case. One study has found that the average lawyer will earn about $4 million - or twice as much as someone with a bachelor's degree - over their lifetime of employment. In addition, law school provides a general education that is useful in other areas. Both presidential candidates have law degrees, as do the chief executives of a substantial number of companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
A hard look at reform appears to be a worthy goal, but any changes should consider whether they will actually reduce costs, and provide something students want. The problem of law school is thus the problem that all schools of higher education, even veterinary school, face.

HEADLINE: Evolving Global Strategy Gives Law Firm an Edge

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: By focusing on global deal-making, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, based in London, says it has been able to better compete with the major American firms. 

 BODY:
LONDON -- EDWARD BRAHAM took over the corporate practice at the London-based law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer at a rough time for deal-making. In the midst of the global economic slump in early 2009, banks were reluctant to lend money and companies did not want to spend their cash.
So Mr. Braham, 51, and his colleagues went on the offensive.
After reaching out to partners in the firm's 28 offices spread across 16 countries, Mr. Braham decided to refocus the group's strategy, emphasizing its international reach. To increase ties between Europe, North America and Asia, Freshfields hosted its own version of speed-dating at partners meetings, where lawyers outlined their areas of expertise to colleagues until a bell signaled them to switch.
 The firm also developed cross-border groups assembled around practices like capital markets and mergers and acquisitions. Each group, composed of roughly 15 senior lawyers from different countries, holds monthly conference calls to discuss trends and developments in their respective regions.
"I was convinced we could stay at the front of the pack," said Mr. Braham, an Oxford University graduate who started his legal career at Freshfields in 1985.
The global strategy has helped the firm to weather the financial turmoil.
Freshfields advised on almost a quarter of the European-related mergers and acquisitions announced during the first six months of the year, according to the data provider Thomson Reuters. It is working with the mining giant Xstrata on its proposed $90 billion merger with the commodities trader Glencore, as well as United Parcel Service on its planned $6.8 billion takeover of the Dutch shipping company TNT Express. Anheuser-Busch InBev also hired Freshfields as part of its $20.1 billion deal to buy the half of the Mexican brewer Grupo Modelo it did not already own.
With $162 billion of announced deals, Freshfields now ranks as the top law firm for the first half of 2012, up from eighth over the same period last year. Mr. Braham declined to comment on specific deals.
Still, the slump in acquisitions has forced Freshfields to adapt. The law firm has reorganized its teams, moving lawyers from depressed sectors, like private equity, to high-growth areas like restructuring.
Freshfields is also capitalizing on the European debt crisis. The firm is advising the Bank of England, the country's central bank, and the German Finance Ministry as they navigate the current financial problems. In debt-ridden countries like Spain and Italy, the law firm is helping struggling companies restructure their businesses and sell unwanted assets.
"Faced with the euro zone problems, there's a flight to quality by corporate clients across the markets where we operate," Mr. Braham said. "If you are in the flow right now, it's amazing how much is actually going on."
Freshfields has not been immune to broader problems affecting the legal industry. Since 2008, the firm has laid off lawyers in weaker units, like real estate. Analysts also warn that a prolonged downturn in deal activity is likely to weigh on the firm's earnings. The law firm reported a 9 percent drop in its net profit, to £535 million, or $869 million, in the 12 months through April 5, 2012.
Freshfields has learned to evolve over its long history. Founded in 1743, the firm took advantage of the deregulation of the British financial services industry in 1986 to gain new clients, like the private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and CVC Capital Partners.
In the 1990s, it expanded rapidly overseas, opening offices in Beijing, Moscow and Washington. In 2000, Freshfields merged with its German counterpart, Deringer Tessin Herrmann & Sedemund, and the Austrian-German firm Bruckhaus Westrick Heller Löber.
After the dot-com bubble burst, the firm was forced to reorganize, shedding more than 100 partners. The move prompted an age discrimination lawsuit against the firm, which it eventually won.
By focusing on global deal-making, Freshfields says it has been able to better compete with the major American firms, like Sullivan & Cromwell and Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett. Matthew Herman, head of the firm's corporate practice in the United States, says the ability to call on partners from as far as China and Germany gives it an edge.
"For larger deals, it's essential for law firms to have a global reach," said Edmund-Philipp Schuster, a law professor at the London School of Economics and former corporate lawyer at Baker & McKenzie. "Being able to work across borders is an important advantage."
The firm's international brand also has helped it attract clients in the emerging markets looking to expand overseas. The deals, which often involve state-owned enterprises, can cause legal headaches, as Western regulators scrutinize takeovers from new global powers like China.
When Freshfields advised the Chinese automaker Geely on its $1.8 billion takeover of the luxury brand Volvo from Ford in 2010, the law firm had to deal with intellectual property issues that spanned three continents. To get the deal done, a team of lawyers in Hong Kong, London and New York devised a structure that allowed Ford to keep control of its closely guarded technology, but gave Geely access to certain patents to continue manufacturing Volvo cars. The cross-border deal also granted the Chinese company control of Volvo's manufacturing plants in Europe, while allowing Geely to extend manufacturing into China.
"Around one-third of what we're doing now is connected to emerging markets," Mr. Braham said. "That's where our clients want to be."

HEADLINE: During National Plug In Day, Getting the Silent Treatment

BYLINE: RONALD AHRENS


HIGHLIGHT: In Los Angeles, 300 attendees picked from a test-drive fleet that included the Nissan Leaf, Tesla Model S, Chevy Volt, Coda sedan and Mitsubishi i-MiEV, as well as motorcycles from Zero and Brammo. 

 BODY:
EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- For four conspicuously quiet hours on the second-annual National Plug In Day, electric cars and motorcycles swarmed the flat, oak-shaded boulevards wending through office parks just south of Los Angeles International Airport.
From a shared starting point here at the Automobile Driving Museum, a 1957 Ford Fairlane 500 Skyliner and 1959 Cadillac Series 62 convertible, two of Detroit's most recognizable products of the late Eisenhower era, floated along the same route.
They all were participating in a promotion staged on Sunday in 65 cities nationwide by Plug In America, the nonprofit electric-vehicle advocacy group.
About 500 people took part in 300 test drives here, according to Zan Dubin Scott, a spokeswoman for Plug In America. The event is significant for the enthusiastic participation of private owners of E.V.'s, who make their cars available for brief test drives by the public.
E.V.'s from producers large and small, be it BMW, maker of the battery-powered ActiveE, to Coda, the California-based producer of a recently issued compact sedan, were on hand for display and public evaluation. Among these many offerings, a highlight was the cheekily customized Mitsubishi i-MiEV that echoed a traditional Southern California motif with simulated wood-grain siding, with the grain itself coming from the graphic outlines of digital circuits. And, naturally enough, the car was topped with a surfboard.
The museum, which regularly exercises the cars in its collection, provided the tailfins. The Cadillac 62 convertible driven by docent Andrew Wallace was an all-original car with 61,847 miles. Passengers entered by stepping over the low door sill. Once inside, they sat deep within the massive body and were only vaguely aware of the car's gentle movements, because in part of its 130.5-inch wheelbase. The instrument panel and accessory controls spreading over the dashboard seemed quaint when compared with those of the Tesla Model S that also was on hand. Its display consoles appear to have come from an intergalactic command vessel.
Jeff Walker, the museum's executive director, described himself as "one of the typical 'gasser' guys" who preferred large internal-combustion engines like the Cadillac's 390-cubic-inch V-8 unit, but he professed to being "shocked" upon driving an electric car for the first time. "I got into a Tesla, and it shut my mouth," Mr. Walker said. Indeed, the brisk acceleration of the company's discontinued Roadster brought a similar awakening to other drivers. Michele Etges, 30, of Los Angeles, called the car "extremely different from anything I've ever driven before."
Aside from E.V.'s of the four-wheeled variety, a number of battery-powered Zero S motorcycles were available for testing by licensed riders, and Abe Drucker took advantage of the opportunity. Mr. Drucker, 38, owner of two conventional sportbikes, had ridden from West Hollywood to the event on his electric Native Z6000 scooter with the objective of selling it there.
Cinching down his carbon-fiber helmet, he mounted the Zero S and glided away amid a pack of other riders. "It was stellar. Zero lag," he said afterward, comparing the performance to that of a typical bike in the half-liter class. Describing himself as a proponent of solar energy, Mr. Drucker said he saw how an electric motorcycle could be "hyper-economical, especially if you're tied to a solar system. If you can be off the grid, that's being green."
With a choice of test drives, I slid behind the wheel of the Coda sedan, wanting to see how it compared to other E.V.'s I've sampled, including the Ford Focus Electric, Honda Fit EV and Tesla Model S. This was my first exposure to the new sedan. The car, reviewed in The Times in June, is largely composed of systems sourced from China but is fitted with electric drive components at the company's plant in Benicia, Calif. It went on sale last March, and a "soft launch" is in progress, according to Matt Sloustcher, my passenger and Coda's director of government relations.
Like Bradley Berman in his review for The Times, I noted the sedan's satisfactory acceleration and well-tempered intercession of the regenerative braking system. Aside from the tire noise that is fairly typical of otherwise very quiet E.V.'s, the experience was embarrassingly reminiscent of my early sorties in bumper cars at the carnival midway.
A bit of historical perspective was provided by the display of Steve Pugh's 1921 Milburn Electric brougham, which he brought from Manhattan Beach, Calif. The car typifies the second wave of E.V.'s, that came into vogue after 1910, after the advent of Thomas Edison's nickel-iron battery. (Beforehand, battery-powered vehicles were of very limited use.)
Mr. Pugh's Milburn, built in Toledo, Ohio, had seven large batteries in the front and seven more in the rear. He said the car's top speed was 30 miles an hour, with a range of 100 miles. The lithium-ion cells of the Coda provide the juice to take the car just 25 miles farther, but its responsiveness beyond 30 m.p.h. is something the Milburn could never show.

HEADLINE: We Are the 96 Percent

BYLINE: SUZANNE METTLER and JOHN SIDES


HIGHLIGHT: Democrat or Republican, we are all both makers and takers. 

 BODY:
WHENMitt Romney told the guests at a fund-raiser in Florida in May that America is divided between people who pay no income taxes and depend on government and pretty much everyone else, he missed the deeper truth. It is not just that most of the 47 percent Mr. Romney talked about do pay payroll taxes and that many of them have paid income taxes in the past. The reality he glossed over is that nearly all Americans have used government social policies at some point in their lives. The beneficiaries include the rich and the poor, Democrats and Republicans. Almost everyone is both a maker and a taker.
We have unique data from a 2008 national survey by the Cornell Survey Research Institute that asked Americans whether they had ever taken advantage of any of 21 social policies provided by the federal government, from student loans to Medicare. These policies do not include government activity that benefits everyone - national defense, the interstate highway system, food safety regulations - but only tangible benefits that accrue to specific households.
The survey asked about people's policy usage throughout their lives, not just at a moment in time, and it included questions about social policies embedded in the tax code, which are usually overlooked.
What the data reveal is striking: nearly all Americans - 96 percent - have relied on the federal government to assist them. Young adults, who are not yet eligible for many policies, account for most of the remaining 4 percent.
On average, people reported that they had used five social policies at some point in their lives. An individual typically had received two direct social benefits in the form of checks, goods or services paid for by government, like Social Security or unemployment insurance. Most had also benefited from three policies in which government's role was "submerged," meaning that it was channeled through the tax code or private organizations, like the home mortgage-interest deduction and the tax-free status of the employer contribution to employees' health insurance. The design of these policies camouflages the fact that they are social benefits, too, just like the direct benefits that help Americans pay for housing, health care, retirement and college.
The use of government social policies cuts across partisan divides. Some policies were used more often by members of one party or the other. Republicans were more likely to have used the G.I. Bill and Social Security retirement and survivors' benefits, while more Democrats had taken advantage of Medicaid and unemployment insurance. Overall, 82 percent of Democrats and 64 percent of Republicans acknowledged receipt of at least one direct social benefit. More Republicans (92 percent) than Democrats (86 percent) had taken advantage of submerged policies. Once we take both types of policies into account, the seeming distinction between makers and takers vanishes: 97 percent of Republicans and 98 percent of Democrats report that they have used at least one government social policy.
The majority of individuals from households at every income level have used at least one direct social policy. Low-income people have used more of the direct policies than have the affluent: the average household with income under $10,000 per year used four of them, compared to only one by the households at $150,000 and above. But the proportions were reversed in the case of the submerged policies: wealthy families had typically used three of them, and the poor just one.
There were also few partisan differences in how long individuals had benefited. Among policies used by similar percentages of Democrats and Republicans, like the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit and tax credits for college tuition, members of both parties received the benefits for the same average amount of time. The same was true for policies that benefited one group of partisans more than the other. For example, although the mortgage-interest deduction was claimed by more Republicans and the earned-income tax credit by more Democrats, both claimed the benefits for two to five years on average. Similarly, Republicans who relied on the G.I. Bill did so for about as long as did Democrats who claimed unemployment insurance benefits.
Where Americans actually differ is in how they think about government's role in their lives. A major driving factor here is ideology: conservatives were less likely than liberals to respond affirmatively when asked if they had ever used a "government social program," even when both subsequently acknowledged using the same number of specific policies.
These ideological differences were on display at the party conventions. When Gov.Chris Christie of New Jersey noted that his father, who "grew up in poverty," had used the G.I. Bill to become the first in his family to graduate from college, it was in the context of a speech criticizing our "need to be coddled by big government." By contrast,Michelle Obama credited student loans with making her and her husband's college educations possible and then argued that "when you've worked hard, and done well, and walked through that doorway of opportunity, you do not slam it shut behind you."
Throughout our lives, almost all of us help sustain government social policies through our tax dollars and, at some point, almost all of us directly benefit from these policies. Because ideology influences how we view our own and others' use of government, Mr. Romney's remarks may resonate with those who think of themselves as "producers" rather than "moochers" - to useAyn Rand's distinction. But this distinction fails to capture the way Americans really experience government. Instead of dividing us, our experiences as both makers and takers ought to bind us in a community of shared sacrifice and mutual support.

HEADLINE: Has Manmohan Singh Gambled Enough?

BYLINE: VIVEK DEHEJIA


HIGHLIGHT: The prime minister is hampered by voters' resistance to reform, economist argues. 

 BODY:
After a week of high political drama in New Delhi, the prime minister of India, Manmohan Singh, spoke to the nation on Friday evening, making the case for economic reform that had, until then, languished during his tenure. The speech capped a week in which the government announced a series of long-delayed measures, most notably raising the price of diesel and opening up foreign direct investment for retailers who sell multiple brands and in aviation and broadcasting.
In his speech, Mr. Singh made a credible economic case for the measures. Raising diesel prices was necessary to stanch the burgeoning fiscal deficit and prevent the Indian economy from experiencing the sorts of woes currently afflicting the United States and Europe, he argued. Likewise, small retailers had nothing to fear from the impending arrival of giant Western retailers like Wal-Mart or Carrefour because there was a place for everyone, large or small, in a growing economy.
But he failed to address the political dynamics that this bold action, late in his tenure as prime minister, has unleashed. The measures might amount to good economics, but are they also good politics? Mr. Singh left that question unanswered.
Either way, Mr. Singh has thrown the dice. Some observers compare the boldness of the most recent initiatives with the resolve with which Mr. Singh signed a civilian nuclear pact with the United States in 2008, during his first tenure as prime minister and in the waning days of the administration of former President George W. Bush. That gamble paid off for Mr. Singh, paving the way for his party's re-election in 2009 and for his second term as prime minister.
Can Mr. Singh take a leaf from his old playbook and convert a late gamble on economic measures into a winning hand in the next general elections?
What is clear is that the stakes could not be higher. If Mr. Singh is forced to reverse course again on the economic measures, or should his government fall before the end of its mandate in 2014, many could conclude that sound economic policy remains politically impossible in a large, populous and still relatively poor democracy like India.
An explanation for this situation may lie in the "median voter theorem," which suggests that governments, regardless of ideology, tend to cater to the preferred policies of voters with the country's median income. In a nation in which one-third of the population lives below the poverty line, another third not far above it, and only the top third is considered middle class or prosperous, the median voter is likely to have relatively low income and to favor redistribution over long-term growth.
That is why market-oriented economic policies in India, going back to the original liberalization of the economy in 1991, have been implemented by stealth or in crisis mode rather than by articulating to the electorate why they are required. It is a situation I have dubbed the "original sin" of 1991, and its effects linger to this day.
This "original sin" explains why, in his speech to the nation, Mr. Singh couched his defense of economic reforms in the language of "inclusive growth" and with repeated appeals to the "aam admi," or common man. He did not address the fact that economic policies that confer long-term benefits may come with short-term costs, but that those costs may be worth it.
With the parsing of Mr. Singh's decisions and their likely consequences now solidly under way, it would be salutary to remind ourselves that the measures are, in fact, relatively modest.
Indeed, the recent announcements are comprised of administrative, or "stroke of the pen," reforms that do not require legislative approval - leading at least one news report to dub them "overhauls" rather than true reforms. The ultimately more important reforms, like revamping India's antiquated labor laws or implementing regulatory reforms to curb corruption, simply are not under discussion because they would need to go through a Parliament that is so deeply-divided that it barely functions.
Keeping that bigger picture in mind may temper the zeal either for or against Mr. Singh's current gamble. He has thrown the dice, but is he playing at the high stakes table?

HEADLINE: Conservatives and the Zombie Apocalypse

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney's remarks on those who don't pay taxes fit into a conservative narrative of a threat to civilization from the living dead, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Nancy Folbre is an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. She recently edited and contributed to "For Love and Money: Care Provision in the United States." 
At first glance, Mitt Romney's now-famous assertion that all those who don't pay federal income taxes are dependent moochers seems like a dumb mistake. Why would he lump recipients of Social Security, veterans, students and low-wage earners - many of whom have voted Republican in the past - in with welfare recipients? 
Perhaps Mr. Romney was confident that his remarks were private, or perhaps he was pandering to his audience of potential donors. But he did follow a well-established conservative script, one of two competing horror-show narratives that increasingly dominate political discourse in this country. 
The basic right-wing story line evokes zombie apocalypse: The shambling, diseased living dead - Obama Zombies - are threatening human civilization. A self-described neoconservative Web site features a parody of Shepard Fairey's Obama campaign poster featuring the zombie in chief. 
A forthcoming book by Nicholas Eberstadt is titled "A Nation of Takers: America's Entitlement Epidemic." Charles Sykes contends that we have become "A Nation of Moochers." 
The effort to elicit revulsion and moral outrage may be intended to counter the left-wing narrative of vampire threat, which warns of a small group of powerful, almost immortal beings who invest in blood funds, suck out the profits and stash them in Transylvanian tax shelters.

Both narratives reflect the enormous economic anxiety Americans feel in the aftermath of a financial crisis and ensuing recession. Zombies and vampires represent archetypal middle-class fears: the fear of being pulled down by the needy or stomped on by the powerful. 
But the two fears are not perfectly parallel. Because zombies are generally considered incompetent, they don't constitute a serious threat unless they mobilize in very large numbers; hence the pressure to exaggerate the size of the zombie class. 
Also, in most cinematic accounts, zombies don't suffer from moral failings; rather, they have contracted a virus or been exposed to some environmental toxin (for an extended literary treatment, see "Zombies Are Us: Essays on the Humanity of the Walking Dead"). 
So who exactly are these zombies (or "takers" or "moochers")? 
We know who they are not. 
They are not those who paid no federal income taxes last year, because many of these can point to a record of hard work. 
They are not those stuck at the very bottom of the income distribution: When all taxes (rather than merely federal income taxes) are taken into consideration, the share of all taxes paid by different income groups corresponds pretty closely to their share of total income.
They are not those who get more in government benefits than they pay in taxes in a given year, because many of these families include children, elderly people, or adults who are eager to resume wage-earning as soon as they can find jobs but for now are unemployed. 
Maybe the zombies are those likely to receive more in government benefits over their lifetime than they have paid in taxes. At the top of this list would be seriously injured military veterans in need of continuing care, along with those receiving costly Medicare-financed interventions in the last two months of their lives.
Alternatively, one might point to all those who have received means-tested public assistance. If so, Mr. Romney's father George, who received public relief at one point, falls under suspicion. 
If only we could use a simple blood test to determine who the real humans are. Would Mitt Romney be willing to release his own test results for past years? 
But never mind. Blood tests could be dangerous when vampires are around.

HEADLINE: Sympathy For The Doofus

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: It's not just Romney. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney is catching a lot of flack from his own side now, which seems premature; although the odds are now against him, this is by no means over. But let me say that even if he does spend election night weeping in his car elevator, his critics from the right are being unfair. Yes, he's a pretty bad candidate -- but the core problem is with his party, not with him.
What, after all, does Romney have to run on? True, he hasn't offered specifics on his economic policies -- but that's because he can't. The party base demands tax cuts, but also demands that he pose as a deficit hawk; he can't do both in any coherent fashion without savaging Medicare and Social Security, yet he's actually trying to run on the claim that Obama is the threat to Medicare. On fiscal matters, doubletalk and obfuscation are his only options.
And no, Paul Ryan didn't show that it can be done differently. His plan was, as I've documented many times, a fraud. Furthermore, he's basically a Beltway creation; the Ryan legend was based on the desire of Washington type to anoint a Serious, Honest Conservative; expose him to the wider scene, and it all falls apart.
Nor can Romney do the Bush thing of running as America's defender against gay married terrorists.
First of all, that old standby, national security, isn't working; between Bush's Iraq debacle and the fact that Obama was the one who got Bin Laden, the notion that only the GOP will defend America is dead for the foreseeable future. And at this point social issues are cutting the wrong way: there are almost surely more affluent women who will vote against the party of Todd Akin than there are white working-class voters who will punish the Dems for gay marriage.
And underlying it all is the diminishing whiteness of the American electorate.
This still might be a close election thanks to the weakness of the economy, and a better candidate than Romney might have had a better chance of pulling it off. But the long-term fundamentals are not good for Republicans.

HEADLINE: New Week, Same Ad Themes: China and Taxes

BYLINE: SARAH WHEATON


HIGHLIGHT: The Obama campaign is tying Mitt Romney's tax returns to his "47 percent" comments, while the Republican has put out his second ad that attacks the president's China policies. 

 BODY:

Both presidential campaigns have new ads out, but the themes are familiar. The Obama campaign is tying Mitt Romney's tax returns to his "47 percent" comments, while the Republican has put out his second ad that attacks the president's China policies.
As Representative Paul D. Ryan heads to Ohio to begin the Republican ticket's bus tour (Mr. Romney will join him on Tuesday), the Obama campaign is starting to run its new spot in the state. "No Taxes" weaves together a critique of Mr. Romney's comments at a fund-raiser about the 47 percent of Americans who pay no income taxes with a call for him to disclose his returns from before 2010, noting that the candidate "paid just 14.1 percent in taxes last year" and saying that he is holding money offshore.
"Maybe instead of attacking others on taxes, Romney should come clean on his," the narrator says.
The ad also plays a clip from the fund-raiser in which Mr. Romney says, "My job is not to worry about those people." The narrator responds, "Isn't it the president's job to worry about everyone?"
The Romney camp has maintained that the candidate was speaking as a strategist at that moment, and Mr. Romney has since said that his campaign is about "the 100 percent in America."
Meanwhile, as Mr. Romney tries to steer his campaign back on track after a week marred by the secretly recorded video, his new spot amplifies an early attack on Mr. Obama's China policy. In a previous spot, Mr. Romney called China "cheaters." This time, the country is "stealing American ideas and technology," the announcer says, and Mr. Obama has failed to stand up to China, contributing to continued job losses and stubborn unemployment. 
It is unclear to what extent the job losses noted in the ad are directly related to China's actions. "Seven times Obama could have taken action," the narrator says, a reference to the administration's refusal to label China a currency "manipulator," which administrations of both parties have also resisted doing. The Obama campaign has taken other actions, however, including a new trade caseannounced last week in, not surprisingly, Ohio.

HEADLINE: With Smartphone Deals, Patents Become a New Asset Class

BYLINE: STEVE LOHR


HIGHLIGHT: The recent multibillion-dollar patent purchases by Apple and Google, though exceptional, were possible because of a broader trend: patents have become a new asset class. 

 BODY:
David Berten has spent his legal career as a mercenary student of technological change. He has educated himself in one field after another: chemical coatings, genetics, navigation systems, semiconductors and digital communications software.
Keeping up is a constant challenge. This month, the 48-year-old lawyer was in his Chicago office, discussing past cases while scanning news Web sites and technology blogs for details on Apple's iPhone 5, which was being introduced in San Francisco that day.
"We have to know what's in it," Mr. Berten said. "In patent law, you're at the cutting edge of everything, and that's shifting all the time."
 His firm, the Global IP Law Group, is a sign of the fast-emerging patent marketplace. Global IP, founded in 2009, is one of several boutique firms specializing in patent legal and advisory work that have cropped up recently. Silicon Valley is home to a cluster of them, including Inflexion Point Strategy, Epicenter IP Group and 3LP Advisors.
Though created by lawyers, these companies are hybrids: more merchant banks than law firms. They have legal expertise, but focus on valuing and selling patents and giving strategic advice.
Global IP made its name as an adviser to Nortel Networks, a bankrupt Canadian telecommunications maker that sold its 6,000 patents for $4.5 billion to a group of six companies led by Apple.
The high price paid for the Nortel portfolio set off a bull market in patents that can claim some snippet of smartphone technology. By one estimate, as many as 250,000 patents may touch a modern smartphone. So patents have become defensive and offensive weapons in the smartphone wars, with the major companies suing one another in courtrooms around the world.
A few months after the sale, the big loser in the Nortel auction made its move. Google agreed to buy Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, and about $5.5 billion of that was the value of Motorola's patents, Google said in a government filing this year. Smartphones made by Samsung and other companies are powered by Google's Android software, making Google and Apple archrivals in smartphone technology.
The smartphone patent megadeals may be over now that the two main adversaries have armed themselves. An attempt by the bankrupt Eastman Kodak to sell 1,000 digital imaging patents stumbled recently, as bids from potential buyers like Apple and Google came in far below the $2.2 billion to $2.6 billion Kodak had said the patents were worth.
But the huge deals, while exceptional, were made possible by a broader trend: patents have become a new asset class.
Traditionally, patents sat on corporate shelves and were occasionally used as bargaining chips in cross-licensing deals with competitors. But that began to change in the 1990s, when technology companies like Texas Instruments and I.B.M. started to regard their patent portfolios as sources of revenue, licensing their intellectual property for fees.
Today, companies routinely buy and sell patents, mostly in deals that draw little attention, for millions of dollars instead of billions. The question, experts say, is how big the market will become.
"Patents are a tricky asset to trade," said Josh Lerner, an economist at the Harvard Business School. "But there is clearly a huge amount of value in intellectual property. And I think what we're seeing is the beginning of a lot more monetization and trading of intellectual property rights."
A sizable specialist industry has developed to build the marketplace for trading ideas. The players include patent aggregators like Intellectual Ventures and RPX, patent brokers like Ocean Tomo and ICAP, hedge funds, investment banks and law firms.
Yet boutique firms like Global IP play an important role, offering specialized expertise and an entrepreneurial approach. "We take patents and try to make money from them in all ways known to man - sales, licensing and litigating, if necessary," Mr. Berten said.
Global IP opened in 2009 with two lawyers, Mr. Berten and Steven Steger. The firm now has 10 lawyers. About two-thirds of its business is selling patents, and it is working on more than two dozen portfolios. Most work is done on a contingency basis, with a sliding scale of fees that can reach 40 percent on projects that involve litigation, Mr. Steger said.
In the Nortel project, Mr. Berten and his team built a vast database of the Nortel patents, tracking the history of each through the government patent office, citations in other patent applications, uses in license agreements and filings in other countries. "It was a boatload of work," said George Riedel, former chief strategy officer at Nortel.
Mr. Berten and Mr. Riedel, along with Nortel's bankers from Lazard, made presentations to companies in Silicon Valley and Europe. Mr. Riedel said Mr. Berten showed an impressive grasp of detail, down to individual patents and claims, when challenged by lawyers at the major technology companies.
His job, Mr. Berten said, was to "identify the value of patents and then demonstrate that value to potential buyers."
The auction was run by Nortel's bankruptcy lawyers at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton. The winning bid of $4.5 billion was well above the $2 billion to $3 billion projected. "Sure, I was surprised," Mr. Riedel said. "We were fortunate to be in the midst of an ecosystem battle in smartphones."
In the Kodak bankruptcy, Global IP was brought on in a very different role: as an outside adviser to the unsecured creditors, including Wal-Mart Stores and Sony Pictures Entertainment. Its job was to determine if the proposed auction was undervaluing the patents, and to advise the creditors if they might be better off taking another approach, like licensing the patents.
The very different experiences of Nortel and Kodak point to the many factors that go into pricing patents. Timing, competitive forces, regulation and court rulings all have an effect, said Ronald S. Laurie, managing director of Inflexion Point Strategy.
"Patents are a volatile, spot market," he said. "This is a market, but a market that is more like art than stocks or oil."
Ron Epstein, chief executive of Epicenter IP Group, agreed that pricing patents, especially large portfolios, was difficult. But he said he thought corporate trading in patents would become more commonplace, and pricing more routine. Someday, he predicted, patent acquisition costs may be a standard line item in corporate earnings statements.
"By fits and starts, we are moving to a more efficient marketplace for innovation," Mr. Epstein said.
Calling patents an asset class is shortsighted, said Kevin Rivette, a founder of 3LP Advisors. The larger value of a portfolio, he said, can be as a strategic tool to negotiate lower costs from a supplier or to alter a rival's product plans.
"You can use patents to change the competitive landscape," he said.

HEADLINE: Mitt Romney on 60 Minutes

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Now I know why he avoids getting into specifics. When he does, he doesn't make sense. 

 BODY:
I didn't learn anything about either Mitt Romney or President Obama by watching their dueling appearances last night on 60 Minutes. But now I know for sure why Mr. Romney avoids getting into specifics-on his tax policies, his spending priorities, his foreign policy and so on. When he does get specific, he doesn't make much sense.
On TV last night, he said he would cut everyone's tax rates by 20 percent, including really rich people like him who are already paying too little. Simultaneously, he would limit deductions and exemptions, "particularly for people at the high end," while "eliminating the tax for middle-income families on interest, dividends, and capital gains." 
As a result of this shakeup, while rates would go down everyone would pay roughly the same in taxes each year, except middle-income people who "will probably see a little break, because there'll be no tax on their savings."
The Romney campaign asserts that his plan will not add to the deficit, because of the above-mentioned limits on deductions and exemptions. What are those deductions and exemptions, exactly? How will they affect "people at the high end" more than in the middle? Mr. Romney would only say "that's something Congress and I will have to work out together."

The Tax Policy Center has already looked at Mr. Romney's proposals and called them "not mathematically possible." The Center concluded that despite Mr. Romney's assurances to the contrary, his plan would result in tax increases for middle-income earners.
But it doesn't take a PhD in economics to see that there's something fishy here. If a President Romney fiddles with taxes on capital gains, people with robust stock portfolios will benefit immensely, while Americans who live off their salaries will not. Eliminating taxes on interest will only result in a substantial break for those with substantial income from interest.
Moving on, the 60 Minutes interviewer, Scott Pelley stated that Mr. Romney "paid fourteen percent in federal taxes," the capital gains rate, and asked "is that fair to the guy who makes fifty thousand dollars and paid a higher rate than you did?"
Mr. Romney answered "Yeah I think it's the right way to encourage economic growth, to get people to invest, to start business, to put people to work."
Never mind that Mr. Romney would have paid even less in taxes if he hadn't kept his rate artificially high by declining to count $1.8 million in charitable contributions. (He can always revisit his deductions in a future year.) The important fact here is that there's little evidence supporting the idea that lower capital gains rates will lead to more investment and more growth, or vice versa.
Mr. Romney was even less coherent on foreign policy than he was on domestic issues. One particularly hilarious moment came when he criticized Mr. Obama for failing to close the Guantanamo Bay detention camp. It's true that Mr. Obama botched the debate over the camp, but it was Republicans in Congress who passed a law against transferring prisoners from Guantanamo to the United States.
And Mr. Romney does not actually favor closing the camp.
He tried valiantly to find some disagreement with Mr. Obama on Afghanistan, but ended up fumbling around. He said he agrees that most American combat forces should be out of Afghanistan by the end of 2014. But he said it's a bad idea to say when you plan to withdraw troops. Obama timeline bad. Romney timeline good.
He said the troops sent in for the surge should not be coming out until November, rather than September. He tried to sound military-savvy by saying, "I don't think you try and bring back troops during the fighting season." But does he really think two more months would make a difference?
At least Mr. Romney had a succinct, clear answer to the question "What's your big idea?" He responded: "Freedom. I want to restore the kind of freedom that has always driven America's economy. And that's allowed us to be the shining city on the hill."
His Big Idea is freedom. And quoting Ronald Reagan.

HEADLINE: Interviewing Egypt's Islamist President: Answers to Reader Questions

BYLINE: STEVEN ERLANGER and DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK


HIGHLIGHT: Following a lively discussion online about their interview with President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt, two New York Times reporters, Steven Erlanger and David D. Kirkpatrick respond to reader questions. 

 BODY:
The interview with President Mohamed Morsi published this weekend prompted more than 1,200 questions and comments on our Web site and a surge of interest on Twitter. Thank you to everyone who participated, and the authors - David D. Kirkpatrick and I - are taking the opportunity to answer some of the most central and thought-provoking questions here.
A word about the way the interview was conducted. Any interview is by nature artificial, and interviews of heads of state, particularly new ones, have a lot of protocol attached, not to mention consecutive translation, which is time consuming. President Morsi speaks good English but often chose to respond, as Egypt's head of state, in Arabic. But he did understand questions posed in English, which saved time. We had a long wait for him, but then he was generous with his time, giving us nearly 90 minutes. The first part was not as efficient, because the official translator was nervous and not very colloquial; finally a top aide, more bilingual than even Mr. Morsi, stepped in. His is the voice you hear on a lot of the audio excerpts.
All this to say, to respond to the reader in Atlanta who goes by Another Human and many others, that there are many questions both authors would have liked to have asked, some of which readers raised. But not everything is possible, and Mr. Morsi spent a lot of time at the start talking about the geography of California and his deep respect for a particular teacher of his. While one can interrupt the flow of a head of state to try to raise another question, one cannot do it continuously and maintain a necessary degree of respect. - Steven Erlanger 
 Q. 
 I want President Morsi to know that millions of Americans were supportive of Egypt's desire for some form of democracy. Perhaps we were not clear about what that means. My question is: Does Egyptian democracy include Shariah law? I ask this question because Shariah law is about religion and morality. How can that be a democracy? He also states that Egyptian democracy will be for all people. If it is an Islamic state and is under Sharia law how is that possible? - Madeline | Florida 
 A. 
 Thank you for articulating a frequent question. I think the honest answer is that there is a robust debate going on right now in Egypt and across the Arab world over how to apply the teachings of Islam in a democratic context, in the Arab Spring.
It is worth nothing that Egypt's Constitution, like many in the region, has long contained an article stating that its civil laws derive from the principles of Islamic law. So that is old news here.
There are some ultraconservatives - under the umbrella term Salafis - who say they want to change that to make the law conform more directly with literal, even medieval Islamic law, although the details are hazy. But Mr. Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood prefer to keep it as it is. When I have asked Brotherhood leaders about how to apply Islamic law, they say that they believe the first principle is "shura," or consultation, which they interpret to mean representative government or the consent of the governed. They say that the question of how to apply Islamic law should be up to the citizens, through their elected officials. Democracy, essentially. 
But the same Brotherhood leaders also sometimes say that they believe the people who craft Egypt's public policy should have expertise in a practical field - economics, or transportation, for example - but also in Islamic law. And Mr. Morsi says he will be a president for all Egyptians while also apparently sticking to the view that under Islamic law the president of the state should be a Muslim. 
Still, Mr. Morsi was careful to say that whatever his personal views, the constitution of the civil state should not exclude women or Christians from the highest office. We asked Mr. Morsi how he felt about a proposal by the more conservative Islamists for a panel of Muslim religious scholars chosen by Cairo's Al Azhar, the pre-eminent center of Sunni Muslim scholarship, to have court-like powers to strike down statutes that conflicted with Islamic law. He dismissed that immediately. He said that under the old government the Parliament could call on a panel of Azhar scholars for nonbinding consultation, adding that the "consultative" role at the parliamentary level to continue. (At the moment, Al Azhar is a beacon of moderation, but under Hosni Mubarak its leaders were chosen by the government. Now it is expected to be independent and could evolve in other directions.)
As a group, the Muslim Brotherhood has indicated that, however conservative its vision of a good society, it does not intend to impose that vision on others by law - though it might try to encourage by example. So we have seen Egypt drop its ban on female newscasters wearing the Muslim head scarf, though we have not seen newscasters required to wear it. We have seen an Islamic bank open, but we have not seen restrictions on Western banking. We see more public employees allowed to wear beards, but none are required to do so. And so on.
The Salafis are more open to using the laws to enforce moral codes. And on the other side there are also Islamists - including former presidential candidate and former Brotherhood leader Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh, and some other Brotherhood breakaway parties - who argue even more forcefully that Islamic law itself prohibits the enforcing of religious moral codes on others. "There is no coercion in matters of religion" is a quote from the Koran that Dr. Aboul Fotouh likes to repeat. The more moderate Islamists tend to argue that when the government starts interpreting and applying religious teachings then it risks corrupting both itself and the faith, and so a more or less secular state is the most conducive context for Muslims to practice their faith.
This thinking may sound familiar to Americans. - David Kirkpatrick 
 Q. 
 Great interview, but far too short. What are his plans for the country? What is his vision for the future? What does he see as the next step for the Arab Spring? What are his opinions of the other countries in the region? Does he think Iran is building nuclear weapons, or that Israel is planning an attack? How is the political transition going in Egypt - completely finished, or still in progress? How does he perceive the average citizen to be doing at this point in the history of his country? They just went through a great deal of change, and there are so many other topics worth exploring. 
Mr. Morsi seems like a very rational, aware, levelheaded person. He seems to have a clear understanding of his role, and of how to provide balanced leadership to his people and his nation. I hope the American media will stop focusing on his faith and pay more attention to his actions as a statesman,because the man himself clearly understands that those two things are separate. - Another Human | Atlanta 
 A. 
 Please tell our editors you found our article too short! We are always fighting for space, in competition with all the other news around the world.
I think you are right that President Morsi may have preferred to talk about his plans for Egypt, mainly its economy. Mr. Morsi, his advisers, his party, and the Brotherhood have all made clear that they see that as the most important issue they face in the short term, and how they handle it will go a long way toward determining their fortune in politics as well as Egypt's future. They are very much oriented toward the free market and, over time, dismantling a bloated public sector.
In foreign affairs, Mr. Morsi has sought to take a leadership role on the crisis with Syria. He has said he sees a successful outcome of the Syrian uprising as the next step for the Arab Spring, and he has used his case of Syria to stake out a new approach to regional politics and Iran.
His first real foray into foreign affairs was convening a contact group composed of what he considers the four chief regional powers, Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Iran - even though the last is treated as a pariah by the West, to try to broker their own solution to the Syrian crisis. 
Advisers say Mr. Morsi's project on Syria reflects his larger approach to relations with Iran: open to dialogue as key players in the region, unencumbered by Washington's own relations with Iran but without embracing Tehran as a new ally either.
In the interview, Mr. Morsi said he had received only encouragement from the United States and Europe for his efforts. "No government I dealt with, including American government, had any objection to this quartet," Mr. Morsi said.
He said the United States should focus its own effort on diplomacy within the United Nations Security Council, where Russia and China have blocked the imposition stringent penalties on the Assad government. And he stressed that he did not support any military intervention. "I want to continue to close the space around the Syrian regime, to allow the Syrian people to resolve this with their own values and their own strength," he said.
As for your point about treating him as a public official instead of a religious figure, he is the first Islamist freely elected as an Arab head of state. His inauguration is a defining moment for a movement that has struggled in the shadows for more than eight decades to try to remake the Arab world and its relations to the West. So I would expect continued media attention to the Islamic character or aspects of his agenda. - David Kirkpatrick 
 Q. 
 I wish you had asked the following questions: 
1. What is Morsi's opinion of [Sayyid] Qutb's writings and their role in defining the ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood. Does he reject Qutb's assessment of the inherent conflict between the Muslim world and the cosmopolitan West or does he accept them?
2. Hamas in the Gaza Strip is an affiliate of the Muslim Brotherhood. Would Morsi criticize any moves Hamas has taken since gaining control of Gaza, such as harassing Western nongovernmental aid organizations, and even some Christian congregations?
3. Morsi attended graduate school in the United States for his Ph.D. in materials science, and yet has endorsed the 9/11 deniers' belief that the World Trade Center towers collapse was due to explosives planted by parties other than the Al Qaeda terrorists. Indeed, Morsi has expressed skepticism that amateur pilots could have flown the planes into the towers. Does Morsi still believe this?
4. In his years in the U.S., Morsi undoubtedly was exposed to the First Amendment and the importance of free speech to Americans. Yet after the Cairo embassy attack, Morsi's first reaction was to call for the American government to place the filmmakers of the "Innocence of Muslims" on trial. Why did Morsi demand this, and did he expect the U.S. government to comply? Thanks. - Dubbmann | Albuquerque 
 A. 
 I see you are following Egypt closely! And these are also questions that come up often.
Sayyid Qutb was a historically significant and widely influential midcentury Islamist thinker. And he was a part of the Brotherhood during the revolution that brought Gamal Abdel Nasser to power. But he is now best remembered for his most radical and militant ideas. Those ideas were always controversial within the Brotherhood, whose founder, Hassan el-Banna, emphasized inclusiveness. And the Brotherhood has disavowed militancy or violence since at least Nasser's revolution in 1952.
But I find Qutb often looms larger in the West these days than he does in Egypt or the Middle East, because his ideas the foundation of a different, far more militant and anti-democratic strain of Islamist thinking that led to Al Qaeda. The Muslim Brotherhood has never endorsed terrorism or Al Qaeda. And when Al Qaeda took responsibility for the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, Mr. Morsi-then a leader of the Brotherhood's political arm and its parliamentary minority - was quick to denounce it.
We tried briefly to ask Mr. Morsi about Hamas's rule in Gaza, and, in a polite way, he told us it was a silly comparison. Egypt is a giant and far more diverse. It has an established Christian minority whose rights are at least written into the law, and it has a relatively strong tradition of respecting the rule of law, compared to some of its neighbors. But I regret that we did not get a chance to ask him exactly your question.
We did not ask Mr. Morsi about 9/11, but, despite an engineering degree in materials science, his aides tell me he does indeed question the official United States government account of what happened to the buildings. 
I know that a lot of Egyptians question the official story but at the same time think the attacks were a horrendous crime. I suspect part of the explanation is that many Egyptians, probably including Mr. Morsi, deeply distrust the United States for some of the reasons that he tried to articulate. And I think another part of the explanation is that Egyptians have been lied to by their own government and its official media for at least 60 years (and the privately owned media is not so accurate either). I sometimes have to explain to Egyptians that The New York Times is not owned or controlled by the United States government.
Mr. Morsi's first response to the attack on the United States Embassy here did condemn the violence. It is not true that he first called for legal actions against the makers of the video mocking the prophet.
But his reaction was more than a day late. The Muslim Brotherhood, which is allied with Mr. Morsi, had called for a nonviolent protect against the film in advance of the day the protest took place, and afterward it continued to call for criminalizing such films. And when Mr. Morsi and the Brotherhood both condemned the violence, their statements were mixed with criticism of the video. Many Egyptians seem to believe that it is possible to criminalize grave insults to established religions without intruding too much of freedom of expression - an idea utterly alien to the United States' legal tradition. - David Kirkpatrick 
 A. 
 I wish we had asked some of those questions, too, especially on Qutb. Morsi was clearly put off by the sexual freedom the United States, as Qutb was, but clearly to a significantly less violent degree. Even the 9/11 hijackers were both fascinated and repelled by parts of the American lifestyle. But I think a vast majority of Muslim visitors, even from conservative backgrounds, take it in stride. As Morsi said, couples living together out of wedlock is something legal and tolerated by American society. He does not admire it, he said. But his point was a fairly simple one: not all cultures are the same.
Singapore's Lee Kwan Yew often talked of "Asian values" as different from Western values on social issues as well as issues of human rights. And Beijing's leaders are very aggressive in stating the same thing. Mr. Morsi is breaking no new ground here.
I am sorry not to have asked the question about 9/11, though I'm sure he would have had an answer prepared, as he did for questions about Egypt's delay in ousting demonstrators from the U.S. Embassy.
In general I would say I found Mr. Morsi warm, affable and guarded. He was well-prepared and conscious of the importance of the interview for his visit to the United States. I had in the past met Mr. Mubarak and Omar Suleiman, and my sense for the moment is that Mr. Morsi is a man with a lot of good will, with an extraordinarily difficult task in front of him - a country of more than 80 million people, with rising prices and high unemployment, with enormous expectations that the Arab spring and Egypt's new leadership will deliver a new more prosperous life for all, and quickly.
Respect and a little patience seem to me modest things to ask. - Steven Erlanger 
 Q. 
 Please ask President Morsi how the U.S. should assist the Palestinians in achieving self-rule when Hamas, by its very charter, denies Israel's right to exist. Or phrased slightly differently, can there be a two-state solution when one of the states denies the other's right to exist. A third variation on the same question would be to ask President Morsi for his vision of an Israeli-Palestinian peace. - Pete | New Jersey 
 A. 
 Thank you for your question, which touches on a concern of many readers about Egyptian and Palestinian relations with Israel.
You were curious about President Morsi's long-term view of relations between Egypt and the Palestinians, particularly since Hamas does not recognize Israel's right to exist. I wish we had more opportunities to speak directly to President Morsi and at more length, so we could press him on all these things! 
But I have had a chance to speak to others in Mr. Morsi's Freedom and Justice Party, the political arm of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, about their view of these things. Hamas, as you may know, is a Palestinian offshoot of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, and its parent organization has traditionally argued that Hamas was exercising a legitimate right to resist against a foreign occupation. The Brotherhood was sharply critical of the Western-backed Fatah faction that controls the Palestinian Authority for agreeing to work with Israel without receiving any real guarantees about an end to settlements or genuine statehood.
Since coming to power in Egypt, however, the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood says that it has changed its stance and feels an obligation to play a more neutral role as an arbiter between Hamas and Fatah. The party's stated position is that Palestinian unity will advance the cause of a peaceful two-state solution. That means pressing Hamas to accept the fact of Israel's existence, if not Israel's moral right to exist. Analysts who follow Hamas closely tell me it has sometimes hinted of its willingness to do this, if it received enough recognition in return.
When I asked if a Brotherhood-led Egypt might provide weapons or military support to Hamas, a senior Brotherhood official responded with something close to shock at the idea; he said the overarching goal was regional peace and stability and the Brotherhood would never condone the militarization of the region.
The stated goal is putting more pressure on Israel to ensure Palestinian self-rule - not wiping Israel off the map.
That seemed to be President Morsi's thinking as well. He approached the question of the Palestinians in the framework of the Camp David Accord, which also envisions two states living side by side in peace. He has met with leaders of both Palestinian factions. When asked about his agenda, his advisers speak earnestly and almost exclusively about reviving the Egyptian economy, and they acknowledge that requires tranquil borders.
In my view of the Egyptian political scene, it will be a long time before any politician (secular or Islamist) starts talking publicly about an abstract moral "right" for Israel to exist. But by the same token there is not much appetite in the Egyptian public for efforts to challenge the fact of Israel's existence. - David Kirkpatrick 
 Q. 
 I am neither a Jew nor a Muslim. I've spent a great deal of time in the Middle East. I can appreciate Egypt's position on Palestine and Israel's position on Iran. I would have asked President Morsi if he would renounce Iran's position regarding the destruction of Israel if and when substantive progress were made on a Palestinian State? 
Let's hope that all players in the Middle East's drama begin thinking more of what they can do for their grandchildren and less of what their parents did to one another. - Old | Boston 
 A. 
 Mr. Morsi made it clear he would try engagement with Iran, especially on Syria, and said that the U.S. and others gave him the green light to do so, to try to arrange a regional solution. But there is no doubt that Iran remains a rival to Egypt for supremacy in the region, that the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran shakes Egyptians as well as the Gulf Arabs, that the Sunni-Shiite rivalry remains hot and hostile, and that Mr. Morsi intends for a newly democratic Egypt, led by a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, to take a more assertive leadership role. And that includes firm opposition to the continuing rule of the Assads in Syria, but also opposition to any outside military intervention. - Steven Erlanger 
 Q. 
 "On the eve of his first trip to the United States as Egypt's new Islamist president, Mohamed Morsi said the United States needed to fundamentally change its approach to the Arab world, showing greater respect for its values and helping build a Palestinian state, if it hoped to overcome decades of pent-up anger." And this seems to anger many readers, a great many saying Egypt has no business telling the U.S. how to interact with his country. They also suggest that the U.S. can cutoff funding if Egypt does not act as they think it should. 
As usual we see ignorance of history by these conservative commentators. They do not know the history of the Aswan Dam and the Russian financing. The Russians were quite happy to step in and give aid and arms to Egypt which made the U.S. sit up and take notice, you just cannot go pushing people around because they can use your financial aid. There are others willing to take your place, and Egypt is the largest and most influential country in the Arab world. Arabia my have more money, but Egypt has more resources.
He is not dictating to the U.S. how to treat them, he is saying what a great many of you do not want to hear. There is pent up anger and the U.S. has to change its approach to dealing with the Arab world, and many of you do not seem to be able accept this. Well get over it. He and his government are in charge there, and they can do without U.S. financing, they have before and can do so again. So listen to what he says. - David Underwood | Citrus Heights
 A. 
 Thank you for your perspective. It is not for me to judge whether his comments were appropriate. But there are two things worth noting Egypt's view of the U.S. aid money. First, in my experience the Egyptian military and political elite seems to feel like Egypt holds a lot of leverage here. Egypt is the linchpin of peace with Israel and stability in the region. Egypt controls the Suez Canal at the cross roads of three continents. And by virtue of its size and military strength it is a major player in the Arab world. Egyptian leaders often feel that the United States is getting more than its money's worth if its aid buys Egypt's allegiance. "The U.S. got Egypt cheap," is how one retired general put it to me.
Second, most Egyptians feel that all United States aid delivered before the revolution did not go to them. It went to Hosni Mubarak and his government. So when readers say, "We want our money back!," most Egyptians would say, "Please! See if you can get it back from those crooks but don't look at us! You helped prop up a corrupt autocrat who left his country's economy in a shambles, so our feelings about your past financial support are ambivalent - but this is no take it away." - David Kirkpatrick 
Q. 
 How great is it that people from all over the world, including President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt, chose to come to universities in the United States for their higher education. They bring their skills home again, but they also take with them cross-cultural understanding that serves them well when they become leaders back home. Of course Arab Spring is about beginning a path toward democracy and the U.S. played a certain role in 2011, but give some credit to our education system and visa opportunities that bring future leaders to the US in their early years. - Marc Seltzer | Los Angeles
 A. 
 I agree. During the cold war, we used to joke that the best way for the Soviet Union to lose future allies was to let their students come to Moscow to study. But the American university system, though varied by state, represents a major source of American soft power. Mr. Morsi had high praise for the California higher education he received, for his professors and for the way students organized themselves, including providing help to the disabled. He admired, he said, the openness and inclusiveness of America, and he admired, too, he said, the way that Americans worked hard and managed their time. - Steven Erlanger 
 Q. 
 My first impression, is that Mr. Morsi sounds is a lot more agreeable, logical, sensible and more contemplative than his counterpart in Israel. We back Israel blindly to our detriment. Notice his response to the "ally" question - it's spot on. I perceive in Mr. Morsi a real window of opportunity for the United States to move past its often myopic view of the middle east and reset its relationship to that world, with Mr. Morsi potentially acting as our ambassador of that good will. I think he's got the street cred we need to make it work, if we can prove that we are serious about it. 
Frankly, I'm a little tired of being barked at by what seems to me to be a completely ungrateful and unapologetic Netanyahu. And I feel that Mr. Morsi presents a refreshing new view and with it new possibilities.
Hopefully, this opportunity won't be wasted. - Chicago Guy
 Q. 
 Mr. Morsi enjoyed American freedoms and saw equality at work while he was living here. Yet, as a leader he would discriminate against both females and Christians. It would seem that Mr. Morsi only chooses to remember the scientific things that he learned here. 
It is time for the U.S. to do now with Arab countries like Egypt that call us neither enemy or ally, as President Reagan did in Lebanon after our Marines were killed in an unprovoked attack. We withdraw taking all of our aid, support, and materials that we have provided in the past until such time as leaders like Mr. Morsi decide if their countries will be enemy or ally of the U.S. If we compare the actions of Libya and Egypt after the attacks on the U.S. embassies in those countries, there is little doubt which country we can count on as an Ally and which one fits in one of the other categories. We should give aid only to those countries who openly claim to be allies of the U.S.
Mr. Morsi knows full well the game he is playing. The question seems to be what does he hope to gain by playing the way he is now and will he be sent home knowing that he played and lost it all? His popularity at home will quickly decline as the consequences of complete loss of U.S. aid starts to spread through Egypt.
Egypt may have been a valuable ally at one time. With the election of Mr. Morsi, Egypt is nothing more than the sum of its most recent actions. - Merlin8735 | Oklahoma 
 A. 
 Mr. Morsi is very much aware of the context in which he spoke. The relationship with the U.S. is very important to him and to Egypt, not simply for aid - which the U.S. has been slowly diminishing - but for future investment and stability. He has a huge unemployment problem among young people, a considerable factor in the Egyptian revolt against Hosni Mubarak, and Egypt needs to provide young people, especially those with an education, better jobs. It is easier in Egypt to get a job without education than with it; clearly that has to change.
Also a point on aid: a lot of what the U.S. gives to Egypt is military aid - in Israel's case, all or nearly all of it now is. And a lot of that goes to buy American-made equipment.
It seems to me, at least, that the United States has an important opportunity to rebalance its relationships with the Arab world itself, to deal with the new realities of shaky but more democratic governments and a wide variety of so-called Islamists. President Obama obviously feels himself constrained by electoral politics from reaching out too forcefully to Mr. Morsi, who knows enough about America to understand why. But beginning with President George W. Bush, the U.S. is committed formally to a Palestinian state living alongside Israel, while guaranteeing Israel's security; Mr. Obama supports the same ends.
Egypt matters enormously to U.S. interests and that is well understood in Washington, at the White House, State Department and Pentagon. The peace treaty with Egypt and a quiet Egyptian border are one of Israel's main security requirements, and Mr. Morsi and the Egyptian military give no indication that they want to overturn matters with Israel.
Mr. Morsi knows that the Sinai is a large and sometimes lawless place and that security has slipped since the Tahrir Square uprising. He says he intends to keep order there, and diplomats suggest the Egyptians and Israelis are in regular contact about Sinai, Gaza and possible radical Islamic groups and possible terrorists there. Hamas, too, is worried about being outflanked on the so-called right - by the Salafis and the Al Qaeda wannabes. But Morsi also made clear that Egypt has begun to shut down tunnel activity between the two Rafahs, which the military council did little about before his election.
I say good luck to that. The conditions of life in Gaza remain a sore point for Egyptians, but at the same time, Egypt itself is wary of opening up to Gaza so much that it allows Israel to wash its hands of Gaza entirely and Cairo becomes responsible for it.
Menachem Begin offered Gaza to Anwar Sadat in their peace-treaty negotiations; Sadat said no, thank you. The position in Cairo is unlikely to have changed. - Steven Erlanger

HEADLINE: Big Law Steps Into Uncertain Times

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSS SORKIN


HIGHLIGHT: The importance of lawyers has never been greater, yet the legal industry has come under great pressure. One result may be a change in the business model. 

 BODY:
The legal profession sits at the nexus of dealmakers' worlds, from Wall Street to Silicon Valley to Washington. As regulations change and the threat of litigation rises, the importance of lawyers has never been greater.
Yet the legal industry itself has been confronting great pressures. The collapse of Dewey & LeBoeuf exposed the potentially fatal flaws in the bigger-is-better mantra that has swept through Big Law in recent decades. And business - throttled by the financial crisis - is still not booming.
Some big blue-chip firms, like Cravath, Swaine & Moore; Debevoise & Plimpton; and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton have managed to navigate the industry's challenges successfully by sticking to their traditional ways, as Peter Lattman describes on Page 9. (My fellow New York Times columnist, James B. Stewart, has a poignant related essay on Page 8, reflecting upon his time as an associate at Cravath in the 1970s.)
 So all is not bleak. Still, a more sweeping transformation may be on the horizon. And it may look a lot like Axiom Law.
Axiom is a firm founded by Mark Harris, a former lawyer at the white-shoe firm Davis Polk & Wardwell. Mr. Harris is trying to rewrite the law firm business model. His firm, with some 900 lawyers, has no partners. The goal is to undercut the prices of the bigger firms on large cases and projects that require tens of thousands of hours. He hires lawyers of all stripes: some, from the biggest New York firms, do not have the drive or passion to become partners; others are lawyers who work from home.
Mr. Harris likens the difference between his firm and others to that between McKinsey & Company, the high-priced strategic consulting firm, and the consulting arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers. Cravath is like McKinsey, he says; Axiom is like PricewaterhouseCoopers. In the future, he imagines that companies will still hire the likes of Cravath for the biggest, most complicated work. But they will hire Axiom to trudge through projects that involve millions of pages of documentation and do not need to be done by an associate just out of law school billing $400 an hour. The law firms in the middle are likely to be squeezed.
"The legal industry is about to go through a transformational moment," Mr. Harris says.
Perhaps change cannot come soon enough. Clients are unhappy, feeling overbilled and underserved. Lawyers are similarly miserable, feeling underpaid and overworked.
What happened to the legal industry?
The problem, many lawyers say, is "P.P.P." (Some firms call it P.E.P.) P.P.P. stands for profit per partner. (P.E.P. is shorthand for profit per equity partner.) It has become the ultimate metric for measuring success among law firms. When American Lawyer magazine began publishing a ranking based on profit per partner in the early 1980s, it revolutionized the industry, but it also arguably led to a dangerous race among firms that left clients as a secondary priority.
Indeed, says Mr. Harris of Axiom, about three decades ago "the interests of law firms went from serving the clients to serving themselves."
As Michael H. Trotter, a partner at Taylor English Duma in Atlanta, says in his book "Declining Prospects" that there are only a few ways to increase profit per partner. One way is for firms to "charge their clients more for what they do"; another is for them to "do more work for their clients by working more hours or using more lawyers"; a third is to acquire more clients; and the last option is for firms to "reduce their overhead by paying less rent, restraining the compensation of their lawyer-employees and other personnel."
None of those options appear to be in the client's interest at all.
This is not a new lament.
A decade ago, Robert E. Hirshon, then president of the American Bar Association, declared that "the billable hour is fundamentally about quantity over quality, repetition over creativity."
He explained that "because a lawyer's time is not an elastic variable, increased billable-hour requirements are squeezing out other aspects of what it means to be a lawyer."
The focus on profits per partner is one reason so many companies have increasingly tried to move legal work away from big firms and have hired internal lawyers. And that means, Mr. Trotter says, that "the leverage that law firms have utilized to generate profits will go down and they aren't going to need as many associates."
Depending on how the industry transforms its business model, an old joke may need to be rewritten.
A prospective client calls a lawyer, asking, "How much would you charge for answering three simple questions?"
The lawyer says, "A thousand dollars."
"A thousand dollars!" the prospective client shouts. "That's very expensive, isn't it?"
"It certainly is," the lawyer replied. "Now, what's your third question?"

HEADLINE: Ex-Regulator Has Harsh Words for Bankers and Geithner

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: Adding to a growing collection of financial crisis histories, Sheila Bair, former head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, takes aim at some regulatory colleagues. 

 BODY:
Sheila C. Bair, who tormented Wall Street and its Washington allies as a banking regulator, is taking a fresh swipe at her foes in retelling the dark days of the financial crisis.
In a book to be released on Tuesday, the former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation takes aim at the bankers she blamed for the crisis. She also criticized fellow regulators, including current Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, for their response to the problems.
Ms. Bair painted Mr. Geithner, the former head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as an apologist for Wall Street, opposing some postcrisis reforms. She questioned whether his effort to inject billions of dollars into nine big banks masked a rescue intended solely for Citigroup, a theory that other government officials have rejected.
 "Participating in these programs was the most distasteful thing I have ever done in public life," said Ms. Bair, in the book, "Bull By the Horns: Fighting to Save Main Street from Wall Street and Wall Street from Itself."
People close to Mr. Geithner note that he issued early warnings about Wall Street risk-taking and championed a regulatory crackdown on big banks.
Lee Sachs, a former top Treasury Department official, said on Monday that Mr. Geithner never acted to protect Citigroup or any single institution, but rather the entire system. In 2004, the New York Fed under Mr. Geithner ordered Citigroup to pay $70 million for consumer lending violations.
"If anything, he was quite focused on the pain the country was suffering," Mr. Sachs said.
Another government official who attended some of the meetings with Ms. Bair and Mr. Geithner said she was overstating the animus. A Treasury Department spokeswoman declined to comment on Ms. Bair's attacks because officials had not read the book.
In a statement, a Citigroup spokeswoman defended the bank, whose bailout earned a profit for taxpayers. "Since Vikram Pandit became C.E.O. during the financial crisis, Citi has executed a strategy based on returning to the basics of banking and building a culture of responsible finance. It is a simpler, smaller, safer and stronger institution than it was five years ago and this record speaks for itself."
Drawn from personal e-mails and notes, Ms. Bair's book joins the growing collection of financial crisis histories. While the book contributes a few revelations to the annals of Wall Street, Ms. Bair mostly notably highlights the challenge of being the only woman in the room. At crucial times during the crisis, she said, Mr. Geithner and other top regulators kept her in the dark.
"Maybe the boys didn't want Sheila Bair playing in their sandbox," she wrote.
A Kansas native, Ms. Bair portrayed herself as a lifelong Republican with a populist streak. She was among the first regulators to sound the alarms about the subprime mortgage bubble. When the crisis emerged, she pushed for banks to replenish their capital cushions.
Ms. Bair, who is now senior adviser to the Pew Charitable Trusts, spent much of the book criticizing the go-go attitude that fueled the crisis. She also delivered blistering assessments of several crisis-era chiefs. She said, for example, that the deal-making skills of Kenneth D. Lewis, then Bank of America's chief, "were clearly wanting."
But she saved the sharpest critique for Mr. Geithner, calling him the "bailouter in chief."
When the F.D.I.C. was negotiating the contours of a plan to guarantee bank debt, she said that Mr. Geithner pushed the agency to charge banks only a "minimal" fee in return for the government support. Mr. Geithner and other regulators argued that it was counterproductive to assign hefty costs at a time when the industry needed saving.
"Geithner just couldn't see things from my point of view," Ms. Bair wrote.
Over her five-year tenure, Ms. Bair struggled to break into the clubby nature of high finance, detailing in the book how Mr. Geithner and others shut her out of major decisions. The F.D.I.C., for example, was not involved in picking which banks would receive the first round of bailout funds. One regulator circulated an e-mail questioning "the audacity of that woman."
Much of the book is devoted to the regulators' dealings with just one company, Citigroup, which received more government support than any other bank. Ms. Bair fleshed out her frustrations with Mr. Geithner and his desire, in her eyes, to treat a dysfunctional bank with kid gloves.
She even suggested that the industrywide bailouts were meant mainly to help Citigroup. Other commercial banks were in considerably better shape, she noted, and beleaguered investment banks like Morgan Stanley had secured private investments.
"How much of the decision-making was being driven through the prism of the special needs of that one, politically connected institution?" Ms. Bair wrote.
Other players in the crisis will most likely criticize her concerns as reductive, especially in light of major problems at Bank of America, which required two bailouts. While other banks were healthier than Citi, regulators opted for an across-the-board plan to instill confidence in the industry and the economy.
Even so, Ms. Bair laid out new details in the book suggesting that regulators went further than previously thought to protect Citigroup.
Early on in the crisis, she said, Mr. Geithner wanted Ms. Bair's agency to financially support Citigroup's planned $1-a-share acquisition of Wachovia. In turn, the F.D.I.C. would receive $12 billion in preferred stock and warrants.
Mr. Geithner and Citigroup held private talks about the deal without telling Ms. Bair, according to her account. Regulators then planned to allow Citigroup to count the stock as capital, a boost to the bank's "sagging capital ratios."
When Wells Fargo swooped in with a higher offer that required no government backing, Ms. Bair indicated her support for the new deal. Mr. Geithner, she said, was "apoplectic" and wanted the F.D.I.C. to stand behind Citigroup, which then raised its bid. The Fed ultimately approved the Wells Fargo deal and Citigroup required two infusions of government capital.
As Citi continued to suffer in 2009, Ms. Bair pressed for the bank to put its troubled assets into a "bad bank" supported by private money. Ms. Bair said she received no support from other regulators, who feared it would unnerve the markets.
In the book, Ms. Bair also scrutinized Mr. Geithner's approach to reforming Wall Street. Detailing new elements of the debate over the Dodd-Frank act, she argued that Mr. Geithner worked with Republican lawmakers to "water down" new regulations like the so-called Volcker Rule. Other people close to the Dodd-Frank debate recall that Mr. Geithner supported the rule but agreed to exemptions to secure Republican votes.
When Ms. Bair and other officials mentioned to lawmakers their concerns about a draft version of the legislation, she said Mr. Geithner summoned regulators to deliver an "expletive-laced tongue lashing."
For her part, Ms. Bair acknowledged her own temper flare-ups. When preparing for Congressional testimony one night, she recalled having stomped out of the room in a fit of exhaustion. Ms. Bair, who received a security detail after threats on her safety, also lashed out at journalists who she felt were unfair, underscoring her sensitivity to the glare of the spotlight.
"I get cranky when sleep-deprived," she wrote.

HEADLINE: Washington State, Women's Rights and Big Cities

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: As social issues became more prominent on the national political scene, Washington's social liberalism pushed the state toward the Democratic Party. 

 BODY:
 We continue our Presidential Geography series, a one-by-one examination of the peculiarities that drive the politics in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Here is a look at Washington, the Evergreen State. FiveThirtyEight spoke with Mark A. Smith, a professor of political science at the University of Washington. 
In presidential elections from the early 1880s through the mid-20th century, Washington was a swing state, even slightly Republican-leaning. In 1980, Ronald Reagan over-performed in Washington relative to the nation as a whole.
After that election, however, the state's partisan makeup began to shift. Washington voters began to move -- and fairly quickly -- toward the Democratic Party.
Reagan carried the state again in 1984, but he underperformed his national popular vote by four percentage points. By the 1988 election, Washington had been transformed. It was nine percentage points more Democratic-leaning than the nation, and George H. W. Bush failed to carry it. Washington has been reliably blue ever since.
"Democrats had about a 10 point shift in their direction in about a decade," Mr. Smith said.
The rapid political change in Washington was fueled by the rise of cultural conservatism in the Republican Party -- the same dynamic that turned the South deep red and pushed Northeastern states like New Jersey, Delaware and Connecticut into the Democratic column.
"Washington was a socially liberal state," Mr. Smith said, "and as the social issues became more prominent on the national scene in the 1980s, that social liberalism pushed the state more towards the Democratic side," Mr. Smith said.
In particular, Washington has been progressive on women's issues.1 It was early to embrace women's suffrage (in fact, women temporarily gained the right to vote in territorial Washington). In 1926, Seattle elected the nation's first female mayor of a major American city, Bertha K. Landes. Washington also elected one of the nation's earliest female governors, Dixy Lee Ray. 
Washington is still taking a leading role in female leadership. For the last eight years, Washington has had a female governor and two female senators, the only time in the nation's history that a state has had women in all three offices.
Given Washington's position on women's rights -- it was one of the first states to liberalize abortion laws -- and its status as one of the least religious states, it is no coincidence that as abortion became a driving national issue, the Evergreen State over all became more Democratic-leaning. But that realignment has been limited to Washington's urban and suburban areas.
Washington's political landscape is similar to Oregon's: a populous and liberal west; and a rural and conservative east. The divide in both states is stark and driven by some of the same issues. 
Washington's population is clustered in and around Seattle, which has seen an influx of well-educated voters drawn to work in biotechnology firms in towns like Bothell and to jobs with Microsoft in Redmond.
Seattle is one of the most liberal cities in the nation, home to young, single professionals and one of the country's largest gay communities. Seattle's King County is also one of Washington's most diverse areas; it is 15 percent Asian, 9 percent Hispanic and 7 percent black.
Although Western Washington is Democratic-leaning, there are some nuances. Southwest Washington, for instance, is more politically balanced than the Seattle area. The Olympia area skews liberal. But the fast-growing Vancouver area, just across the state line from Portland, Ore., is close to politically even. Vancouver's Clark County is home to many tax-conscious conservatives, who came to income-tax-free Washington but settled close enough to the border to shop in sales-tax-free Oregon. 
Traveling east, the Cascade Mountains mark the transition into majority Republican Washington, where the economy is based much more on the land. Central Washington, just east of the Cascades, is the most rural and conservative region of the state, Mr. Smith said. In south-central Washington, much of the nation's apples and hops are grown in the Yakima Valley.
As you travel farther east and reach Spokane, population density increases, but not to Seattle-like levels. Republicans are a majority, but a less dramatic one compared to central Washington.
 The Bellwether: Snohomish County 
Anchored by Everett, where Boeing has a large plant, Snohomish County is "far enough away from the urban core to become somewhat less liberal, but not out in a rural area that becomes conservative," Mr. Smith said.
Accordingly, it has been an almost exact barometer of Washington's political mood in the last three presidential elections. Snohomish County was just one percentage point more Democratic than the state in 2000 and 2008, and it matched the statewide vote perfectly in 2004.
 The Bottom Line 
Despite the similarities between Washington's and Oregon's political landscapes, Washington is at least slightly more Democratic-leaning. Oregon has seen some close presidential races in recent years; Washington has not.
In this year's race, President Obama is a 99 percent favorite in Washington and a 98 percent favorite in Oregon. That is obviously not a big difference. But Mr. Obama has a 12 percentage point lead over Mitt Romney in Washington in FiveThirtyEight's adjusted polling average. In Oregon, Mr. Obama is ahead by 6.5 percentage points. 
In both states, political preferences along the Pacific Coast tend to outweigh the ideology of those inland. But in Oregon, it is a closer contest (if not exactly close).
Eastern Washington, with more than half the state's land, still casts only about a fifth of Washington's votes. That's less than Seattle's King County, which alone accounts for almost a third of the statewide vote. 
Washington's population distribution and cultural progressivism, particularly on women's issues, combine to make it very difficult for Republicans to compete in statewide races.
1: Although cultural issues have moved Washington into the Democratic column, the state is still relatively conservative on fiscal issues. Washington has no income tax, and has rejected one at the ballot box several times. In 2010, voters rejected a ballot proposition to impose a 5 percent tax on income over $200,000 and a 9 percent tax on income over $500,000 by 30 percentage points.

HEADLINE: Interviewing Egypt's Islamist President: Answers to Reader Questions

BYLINE: STEVEN ERLANGER and DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK


HIGHLIGHT: Following a lively discussion online about their interview with President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt, two New York Times reporters, Steven Erlanger and David D. Kirkpatrick respond to reader questions. 

 BODY:
Last Updated | Tuesday, 9:14 a.m. The interview with President Mohamed Morsi published this weekend prompted more than 1,200 questions and comments on our Web site and a surge of interest on Twitter. Thank you to everyone who participated, and the authors - David D. Kirkpatrick and I - are taking the opportunity to answer some of the most central and thought-provoking questions here.
A word about the way the interview was conducted. Any interview is by nature artificial, and interviews of heads of state, particularly new ones, have a lot of protocol attached, not to mention consecutive translation, which is time consuming. President Morsi speaks good English but often chose to respond, as Egypt's head of state, in Arabic. But he did understand questions posed in English, which saved time. We had a long wait for him, but then he was generous with his time, giving us nearly 90 minutes. The first part was not as efficient, because the official translator was nervous and not very colloquial; finally a top aide, more bilingual than even Mr. Morsi, stepped in. His is the voice you hear on a lot of the audio excerpts.
All this to say, to respond to Ken Loehr, a reader in Atlanta, and many others, that there are many questions both authors would have liked to have asked, some of which readers raised. But not everything is possible, and Mr. Morsi spent a lot of time at the start talking about the geography of California and his deep respect for a particular teacher of his. While one can interrupt the flow of a head of state to try to raise another question, one cannot do it continuously and maintain a necessary degree of respect. - Steven Erlanger 
 Q. 
 I want President Morsi to know that millions of Americans were supportive of Egypt's desire for some form of democracy. Perhaps we were not clear about what that means. My question is: Does Egyptian democracy include Shariah law? I ask this question because Shariah law is about religion and morality. How can that be a democracy? He also states that Egyptian democracy will be for all people. If it is an Islamic state and is under Shariah law, how is that possible? - Madeline | Florida 
 A. 
 Thank you for articulating a frequent question. I think the honest answer is that there is a robust debate going on right now in Egypt and across the Arab world over how to apply the teachings of Islam in a democratic context, in the Arab Spring.
It is worth noting that Egypt's Constitution, like many in the region, has long contained an article stating that its civil laws derive from the principles of Islamic law. So that is old news here.
There are some ultraconservatives - under the umbrella term Salafis - who say they want to change that to make the law conform more directly with literal, even medieval Islamic law, although the details are hazy. But Mr. Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood prefer to keep it as it is. When I have asked Brotherhood leaders about how to apply Islamic law, they say that they believe the first principle is "shura," or consultation, which they interpret to mean representative government or the consent of the governed. They say that the question of how to apply Islamic law should be up to the citizens, through their elected officials. Democracy, essentially. 
But the same Brotherhood leaders also sometimes say that they believe the people who craft Egypt's public policy should have expertise in a practical field - economics, or transportation, for example - but also in Islamic law. And Mr. Morsi says he will be a president for all Egyptians while also apparently sticking to the view that under Islamic law the president of the state should be a Muslim. 
Still, Mr. Morsi was careful to say that whatever his personal views, the constitution of the civil state should not exclude women or Christians from the highest office. We asked Mr. Morsi how he felt about a proposal by the more conservative Islamists for a panel of Muslim religious scholars chosen by Cairo's Al Azhar, the pre-eminent center of Sunni Muslim scholarship, to have court-like powers to strike down statutes that conflicted with Islamic law. He dismissed that immediately. He said that under the old government the Parliament could call on a panel of Azhar scholars for nonbinding consultation, adding that the "consultative" role at the parliamentary level is likely to continue. (At the moment, Al Azhar is a beacon of moderation, but under Hosni Mubarak its leaders were chosen by the government. Now it is expected to be independent and could evolve in other directions.)
As a group, the Muslim Brotherhood has indicated that, however conservative its vision of a good society, it does not intend to impose that vision on others by law - though it might try to encourage by example. So we have seen Egypt drop its ban on female newscasters wearing the Muslim head scarf, though we have not seen newscasters required to wear it. We have seen an Islamic bank open, but we have not seen restrictions on Western banking. We see more public employees allowed to wear beards, but none are required to do so. And so on.
The Salafis are more open to using the laws to enforce moral codes. And on the other side there are also Islamists - including the former presidential candidate and former Brotherhood leader Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh, and some other Brotherhood breakaway parties - who argue even more forcefully that Islamic law itself prohibits the enforcing of religious moral codes on others. "There is no coercion in matters of religion" is a quote from the Koran that Dr. Aboul Fotouh likes to repeat. The more moderate Islamists tend to argue that when the government starts interpreting and applying religious teachings, then it risks corrupting both itself and the faith, and so a more or less secular state is the most conducive context for Muslims to practice their faith.
This thinking may sound familiar to Americans. - David Kirkpatrick 
 Q. 
 Great interview, but far too short. What are his plans for the country? What is his vision for the future? What does he see as the next step for the Arab Spring? What are his opinions of the other countries in the region? Does he think Iran is building nuclear weapons, or that Israel is planning an attack? How is the political transition going in Egypt - completely finished, or still in progress? How does he perceive the average citizen to be doing at this point in the history of his country? They just went through a great deal of change, and there are so many other topics worth exploring. 
Mr. Morsi seems like a very rational, aware, levelheaded person. He seems to have a clear understanding of his role, and of how to provide balanced leadership to his people and his nation. I hope the American media will stop focusing on his faith and pay more attention to his actions as a statesman,because the man himself clearly understands that those two things are separate. - Ken Loehr | Atlanta 
 A. 
 Please tell our editors you found our article too short! We are always fighting for space, in competition with all the other news around the world.
I think you are right that President Morsi may have preferred to talk about his plans for Egypt, mainly its economy. Mr. Morsi, his advisers, his party, and the Brotherhood have all made clear that they see that as the most important issue they face in the short term, and how they handle it will go a long way toward determining their fortune in politics as well as Egypt's future. They are very much oriented toward the free market and, over time, dismantling a bloated public sector.
In foreign affairs, Mr. Morsi has sought to take a leadership role on the crisis with Syria. He has said he sees a successful outcome of the Syrian uprising as the next step for the Arab Spring, and he has used his case of Syria to stake out a new approach to regional politics and Iran.
His first real foray into foreign affairs was convening a contact group composed of what he considers the four chief regional powers, Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Iran - even though the last is treated as a pariah by the West - to try to broker their own solution to the Syrian crisis. 
Advisers say Mr. Morsi's project on Syria reflects his larger approach to relations with Iran: open to dialogue as key players in the region, unencumbered by Washington's own relations with Iran but without embracing Tehran as a new ally either.
In the interview, Mr. Morsi said he had received only encouragement from the United States and Europe for his efforts. "No government I dealt with, including American government, had any objection to this quartet," Mr. Morsi said.
He said the United States should focus its own effort on diplomacy within the United Nations Security Council, where Russia and China have blocked the imposition of stringent penalties on the Assad government. And he stressed that he did not support any military intervention. "I want to continue to close the space around the Syrian regime, to allow the Syrian people to resolve this with their own values and their own strength," he said.
As for your point about treating him as a public official instead of a religious figure, he is the first Islamist freely elected as an Arab head of state. His inauguration is a defining moment for a movement that has struggled in the shadows for more than eight decades to try to remake the Arab world and its relations to the West. So I would expect continued media attention to the Islamic character or aspects of his agenda. - David Kirkpatrick 
 Q. 
 I wish you had asked the following questions: 
1. What is Morsi's opinion of [Sayyid] Qutb's writings and their role in defining the ideology of the Muslim Brotherhood. Does he reject Qutb's assessment of the inherent conflict between the Muslim world and the cosmopolitan West or does he accept them?
2. Hamas in the Gaza Strip is an affiliate of the Muslim Brotherhood. Would Morsi criticize any moves Hamas has taken since gaining control of Gaza, such as harassing Western nongovernmental aid organizations, and even some Christian congregations?
3. Morsi attended graduate school in the United States for his Ph.D. in materials science, and yet has endorsed the 9/11 deniers' belief that the World Trade Center towers collapse was due to explosives planted by parties other than the Al Qaeda terrorists. Indeed, Morsi has expressed skepticism that amateur pilots could have flown the planes into the towers. Does Morsi still believe this?
4. In his years in the U.S., Morsi undoubtedly was exposed to the First Amendment and the importance of free speech to Americans. Yet after the Cairo embassy attack, Morsi's first reaction was to call for the American government to place the filmmakers of the "Innocence of Muslims" on trial. Why did Morsi demand this, and did he expect the U.S. government to comply? Thanks. - Dubbmann | Albuquerque 
 A. 
 I see you are following Egypt closely! And these are also questions that come up often.
Sayyid Qutb was a historically significant and widely influential midcentury Islamist thinker. And he was a part of the Brotherhood during the revolution that brought Gamal Abdel Nasser to power. But he is now best remembered for his most radical and militant ideas. Those ideas were always controversial within the Brotherhood, whose founder, Hassan el-Banna, emphasized inclusiveness. And the Brotherhood has disavowed militancy or violence since at least Nasser's revolution in 1952.
But I find Qutb often looms larger in the West these days than he does in Egypt or the Middle East, because his later ideas became the foundation of a different, far more militant and antidemocratic strain of Islamist thinking that led to Al Qaeda. The Muslim Brotherhood has never endorsed terrorism or Al Qaeda. And when Al Qaeda took responsibility for the terrorist attack of Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. Morsi - then a leader of the Brotherhood's political arm and its parliamentary minority - was quick to denounce it.
We tried briefly to ask Mr. Morsi about Hamas's rule in Gaza, and, in a polite way, he told us it was a silly comparison. Egypt is a giant and far more diverse. It has an established Christian minority whose rights are at least written into the law, and it has a relatively strong tradition of respecting the rule of law, compared to some of its neighbors. But I regret that we did not get a chance to ask him exactly your question.
We did not ask Mr. Morsi about 9/11, but, despite his engineering degree in materials science, his aides tell me he does indeed question the official United States government account of what happened to the buildings. 
I know that a lot of Egyptians question the official story but at the same time think the attacks were a horrendous crime. I suspect part of the explanation is that many Egyptians, probably including Mr. Morsi, deeply distrust the United States for some of the reasons that he tried to articulate. And I think another part of the explanation is that Egyptians have been lied to by their own government and its official media for at least 60 years (and the privately owned media is not so accurate either). I sometimes have to explain to Egyptians that The New York Times is not owned or controlled by the United States government.
Mr. Morsi's first response to the attack on the United States Embassy here did condemn the violence. It is not true that he first called for legal actions against the makers of the video mocking the prophet.
But his reaction was more than a day late. The Muslim Brotherhood, which is allied with Mr. Morsi, had called for a nonviolent protest against the film in advance of the day the protest took place, and afterward it continued to call for criminalizing such films. And when Mr. Morsi and the Brotherhood both condemned the violence, their statements were mixed with criticism of the video. Many Egyptians seem to believe that it is possible to criminalize grave insults to established religions without intruding too much on freedom of expression - an idea utterly alien to the United States' legal tradition. - David Kirkpatrick 
 A. 
 I wish we had asked some of those questions, too, especially on Qutb. Morsi was clearly put off by the sexual freedom the United States, as Qutb was, but clearly to a significantly less violent degree. Even the 9/11 hijackers were both fascinated and repelled by parts of the American lifestyle. But I think a vast majority of Muslim visitors, even from conservative backgrounds, take it in stride. As Morsi said, couples living together out of wedlock is something legal and tolerated by American society. He does not admire it, he said. But his point was a fairly simple one: not all cultures are the same.
Singapore's Lee Kwan Yew often talked of "Asian values" as different from Western values on social issues as well as issues of human rights. And Beijing's leaders are very aggressive in stating the same thing. Mr. Morsi is breaking no new ground here.
I am sorry not to have asked the question about 9/11, though I'm sure he would have had an answer prepared, as he did for questions about Egypt's delay in ousting demonstrators from the U.S. Embassy.
In general I would say I found Mr. Morsi warm, affable and guarded. He was well prepared and conscious of the importance of the interview for his visit to the United States. I had in the past met Mr. Mubarak and Omar Suleiman, and my sense for the moment is that Mr. Morsi is a man with a lot of good will, with an extraordinarily difficult task in front of him - a country of more than 80 million people, with rising prices and high unemployment, with enormous expectations that the Arab Spring and Egypt's new leadership will deliver a new more prosperous life for all, and quickly.
Respect and a little patience seem to me modest things to ask. - Steven Erlanger 
 Q. 
 Please ask President Morsi how the U.S. should assist the Palestinians in achieving self-rule when Hamas, by its very charter, denies Israel's right to exist. Or phrased slightly differently, can there be a two-state solution when one of the states denies the other's right to exist? A third variation on the same question would be to ask President Morsi for his vision of an Israeli-Palestinian peace. - Pete | New Jersey 
 A. 
 Thank you for your question, which touches on a concern of many readers about Egyptian and Palestinian relations with Israel.
You were curious about President Morsi's long-term view of relations between Egypt and the Palestinians, particularly since Hamas does not recognize Israel's right to exist. I wish we had more opportunities to speak directly to President Morsi and at more length, so we could press him on all these things! 
But I have had a chance to speak to others in Mr. Morsi's Freedom and Justice Party, the political arm of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, about their view of these things. Hamas, as you may know, is a Palestinian offshoot of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, and its parent organization has traditionally argued that Hamas was exercising a legitimate right to resist against a foreign occupation. The Brotherhood was sharply critical of the Western-backed Fatah faction that controls the Palestinian Authority for agreeing to work with Israel without receiving any real guarantees about an end to settlements or genuine statehood.
Since coming to power in Egypt, however, the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood says that it has changed its stance and feels an obligation to play a more neutral role as an arbiter between Hamas and Fatah. The party's stated position is that Palestinian unity will advance the cause of a peaceful two-state solution. That means pressing Hamas to accept the fact of Israel's existence, if not Israel's moral right to exist. Analysts who follow Hamas closely tell me it has sometimes hinted of its willingness to do this, if it received enough recognition in return.
When I asked if a Brotherhood-led Egypt might provide weapons or military support to Hamas, a senior Brotherhood official responded with something close to shock at the idea; he said the overarching goal was regional peace and stability and the Brotherhood would never condone the militarization of the region.
The stated goal is putting more pressure on Israel to ensure Palestinian self-rule - not wiping Israel off the map.
That seemed to be President Morsi's thinking as well. He approached the question of the Palestinians in the framework of the Camp David accord, which also envisions two states living side by side in peace. He has met with leaders of both Palestinian factions. When asked about his agenda, his advisers speak earnestly and almost exclusively about reviving the Egyptian economy, and they acknowledge that requires tranquil borders.
In my view of the Egyptian political scene, it will be a long time before any politician (secular or Islamist) starts talking publicly about an abstract moral "right" for Israel to exist. But by the same token there is not much appetite in the Egyptian public for efforts to challenge the fact of Israel's existence. - David Kirkpatrick 
 Q. 
 I am neither a Jew nor a Muslim. I've spent a great deal of time in the Middle East. I can appreciate Egypt's position on Palestine and Israel's position on Iran. I would have asked President Morsi if he would renounce Iran's position regarding the destruction of Israel if and when substantive progress were made on a Palestinian State. 
Let's hope that all players in the Middle East's drama begin thinking more of what they can do for their grandchildren and less of what their parents did to one another. - Old | Boston 
 A. 
 Mr. Morsi made it clear he would try engagement with Iran, especially on Syria, and said that the U.S. and others gave him the green light to do so, to try to arrange a regional solution. But there is no doubt that Iran remains a rival to Egypt for supremacy in the region, that the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran shakes Egyptians as well as the Gulf Arabs, that the Sunni-Shiite rivalry remains hot and hostile, and that Mr. Morsi intends for a newly democratic Egypt, led by a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, to take a more assertive leadership role. And that includes firm opposition to the continuing rule of the Assads in Syria, but also opposition to any outside military intervention. - Steven Erlanger 
 Q. 
 "On the eve of his first trip to the United States as Egypt's new Islamist president, Mohamed Morsi said the United States needed to fundamentally change its approach to the Arab world, showing greater respect for its values and helping build a Palestinian state, if it hoped to overcome decades of pent-up anger." And this seems to anger many readers, a great many saying Egypt has no business telling the U.S. how to interact with his country. They also suggest that the U.S. can cut off funding if Egypt does not act as they think it should. 
As usual we see ignorance of history by these conservative commentators. They do not know the history of the Aswan Dam and the Russian financing. The Russians were quite happy to step in and give aid and arms to Egypt which made the U.S. sit up and take notice; you just cannot go pushing people around because they can use your financial aid. There are others willing to take your place, and Egypt is the largest and most influential country in the Arab world. Arabia my have more money, but Egypt has more resources.
He is not dictating to the U.S. how to treat them, he is saying what a great many of you do not want to hear. There is pent-up anger and the U.S. has to change its approach to dealing with the Arab world, and many of you do not seem to be able accept this. Well, get over it. He and his government are in charge there, and they can do without U.S. financing, they have before and can do so again. So listen to what he says. - David Underwood | Citrus Heights
 A. 
 Thank you for your perspective. It is not for me to judge whether his comments were appropriate. But there are two things worth noting: Egypt's view of the U.S. aid money. First, in my experience the Egyptian military and political elite seem to feel like Egypt holds a lot of leverage here. Egypt is the linchpin of peace with Israel and stability in the region. Egypt controls the Suez Canal at the crossroads of three continents. And by virtue of its size and military strength, it is a major player in the Arab world. Egyptian leaders often feel that the United States is getting more than its money's worth if its aid buys Egypt's allegiance. "The U.S. got Egypt cheap," is how one retired general put it to me.
Second, most Egyptians feel that all United States aid delivered before the revolution did not go to them. It went to Hosni Mubarak and his government. So when readers say, "We want our money back!," most Egyptians would say: "Please! See if you can get it back from those crooks, but don't look at us! You helped prop up a corrupt autocrat who left his country's economy in a shambles, so our feelings about your past financial support are ambivalent - but this is no take it away." - David Kirkpatrick 
Q.
 How great is it that people from all over the world, including President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt, chose to come to universities in the United States for their higher education. They bring their skills home again, but they also take with them cross-cultural understanding that serves them well when they become leaders back home. Of course Arab Spring is about beginning a path toward democracy and the U.S. played a certain role in 2011, but give some credit to our education system and visa opportunities that bring future leaders to the U.S. in their early years. - Marc Seltzer | Los Angeles
 A. 
 I agree. During the cold war, we used to joke that the best way for the Soviet Union to lose future allies was to let their students come to Moscow to study. But the American university system, though varied by state, represents a major source of American soft power. Mr. Morsi had high praise for the California higher education he received, for his professors and for the way students organized themselves, including providing help to the disabled. He admired, he said, the openness and inclusiveness of America, and he admired, too, he said, the way that Americans worked hard and managed their time. - Steven Erlanger 
 Q. 
 My first impression is that Mr. Morsi sounds a lot more agreeable, logical, sensible and more contemplative than his counterpart in Israel. We back Israel blindly to our detriment. Notice his response to the "ally" question -- it's spot on. I perceive in Mr. Morsi a real window of opportunity for the United States to move past its often myopic view of the Middle East and reset its relationship to that world, with Mr. Morsi potentially acting as our ambassador of that good will. I think he's got the street cred we need to make it work, if we can prove that we are serious about it. 
Frankly, I'm a little tired of being barked at by what seems to me to be a completely ungrateful and unapologetic Netanyahu. And I feel that Mr. Morsi presents a refreshing new view and with it new possibilities. Hopefully, this opportunity won't be wasted. - Chicago Guy
 Q. 
 Mr. Morsi enjoyed American freedoms and saw equality at work while he was living here. Yet, as a leader he would discriminate against both females and Christians. It would seem that Mr. Morsi only chooses to remember the scientific things that he learned here. 
It is time for the U.S. to do now with Arab countries like Egypt that call us neither enemy or ally, as President Reagan did in Lebanon after our Marines were killed in an unprovoked attack. We withdraw taking all of our aid, support, and materials that we have provided in the past until such time as leaders like Mr. Morsi decide if their countries will be enemy or ally of the U.S. If we compare the actions of Libya and Egypt after the attacks on the U.S. embassies in those countries, there is little doubt which country we can count on as an Ally and which one fits in one of the other categories. We should give aid only to those countries who openly claim to be allies of the U.S.
Mr. Morsi knows full well the game he is playing. The question seems to be what does he hope to gain by playing the way he is now and will he be sent home knowing that he played and lost it all? His popularity at home will quickly decline as the consequences of complete loss of U.S. aid starts to spread through Egypt.
Egypt may have been a valuable ally at one time. With the election of Mr. Morsi, Egypt is nothing more than the sum of its most recent actions. - Merlin8735 | Oklahoma 
 A. 
 Mr. Morsi is very much aware of the context in which he spoke. The relationship with the U.S. is very important to him and to Egypt, not simply for aid - which the U.S. has been slowly diminishing - but for future investment and stability. He has a huge unemployment problem among young people, a considerable factor in the Egyptian revolt against Hosni Mubarak, and Egypt needs to provide young people, especially those with an education, better jobs. It is easier in Egypt to get a job without education than with it; clearly that has to change.
Also a point on aid: a lot of what the U.S. gives to Egypt is military aid - in Israel's case, all or nearly all of it now is. And a lot of that goes to buy American-made equipment.
It seems to me, at least, that the United States has an important opportunity to rebalance its relationships with the Arab world itself, to deal with the new realities of shaky but more democratic governments and a wide variety of so-called Islamists. President Obama obviously feels himself constrained by electoral politics from reaching out too forcefully to Mr. Morsi, who knows enough about America to understand why. But beginning with President George W. Bush, the U.S. is committed formally to a Palestinian state living alongside Israel, while guaranteeing Israel's security; Mr. Obama supports the same ends.
Egypt matters enormously to U.S. interests and that is well understood in Washington, at the White House, State Department and Pentagon. The peace treaty with Egypt and a quiet Egyptian border are one of Israel's main security requirements, and Mr. Morsi and the Egyptian military give no indication that they want to overturn matters with Israel.
Mr. Morsi knows that the Sinai is a large and sometimes lawless place and that security has slipped since the Tahrir Square uprising. He says he intends to keep order there, and diplomats suggest the Egyptians and Israelis are in regular contact about Sinai, Gaza and possible radical Islamic groups and possible terrorists there. Hamas, too, is worried about being outflanked on the so-called right - by the Salafis and the Al Qaeda wannabes. But Morsi also made clear that Egypt has begun to shut down tunnel activity between the two Rafahs, which the military council did little about before his election.
I say good luck to that. The conditions of life in Gaza remain a sore point for Egyptians, but at the same time, Egypt itself is wary of opening up to Gaza so much that it allows Israel to wash its hands of Gaza entirely and Cairo becomes responsible for it.
Menachem Begin offered Gaza to Anwar Sadat in their peace-treaty negotiations; Sadat said no, thank you. The position in Cairo is unlikely to have changed. - Steven Erlanger

HEADLINE: The Economics of Law School

BYLINE: By STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF. 
Steven M. Davidoff, writing as The Deal Professor, is a commentator for DealBook on the world of mergers and acquisitions.

 BODY:
Law schools have come under fire during these tough economic times, with critics saying that they leave too many graduates in debt, chasing too few employment opportunities. But it could be worse. Consider the plight of veterinarians.
The average tuition and expenses for a veterinary degree at a private school has doubled in the last 10 years to over $200,000, well above the typical cost of law school. Yet their pay remains moribund at an average of $66,469 - much less than lawyers.
But unlike law schools, veterinary school is not regularly being called a scam or bubble. In fact, applications to veterinary schools were up about 2 percent last year.
Meanwhile, the number of applicants to law school is down 13.7 percent for this year's class after a 10 percent drop from 2011, according to the Law Students Admissions Council. 
Perhaps today's youth are more eager to defend animals than people. Or maybe lawyers are better at voicing their dissatisfaction.
Regardless, the trend away from law schools has prompted much discussion about what structural changes may be needed. Should law schools charge less? Should they strip down their programs? Should they abandon their collegiate ivory towers in favor of a trade-school approach by having "real world" lawyers teach practical skills?
None of these solutions, however, are likely to improve the economics of law school.
I believe that law students do need more training in practical skills, but a focus on that is probably only going to make law school more expensive.
A single law professor can easily teach 70 students in one contracts law class, but a clinical professor is limited to six to 10 people a class. If reducing costs is the goal, then more clinical education will only increase it.
A second alternative is to pay professors less, or replace them with practitioners who would also be paid less. The average senior law professor who is not at a top-ranked school makes $130,000 to $150,000 according to a survey by the Society of American Law Teachers. It's a nice salary, but certainly not comparable to what a law firm partner earns.
This year, the law school at Ohio State University, where I teach, hired a former editor in chief of The Michigan Law Review and a Supreme Court clerk. Both could be paid far more in the private sector, where the hiring bonus alone for a Supreme Court clerk can be $280,000. If the salaries for their positions are even further reduced to make Ohio State's law school cheaper, they are likely to be replaced by less qualified people.
For this reason, good practitioners are likely to be even more expensive than law professors. After all, the average partner at a big law firm can make well over a million dollars a year.
So what if universities hire less qualified, lower-paid practitioners instead, you may ask? Well, quality matters.
U.S. News & World Report lists 15 law schools where tuition is currently less than $15,000 a year. CUNY School of Law, in New York City, has an in-state tuition of $12,090 and is ranked in the third tier by U.S. News. But there is not a flight of applications to these lower-cost schools from higher-paying ones. Instead, students still flock to top-tier schools with the highest-quality professors. In 2011, CUNY's applications were down from the year before.
Creating less expensive law schools with less-qualified staff may give graduates a degree, but that may not better qualify them for jobs. This points to another inherent problem with critiques of law schools - all are lumped together. This points to another inherent problem with critiques of law schools - all are lumped together.
There is, however, a qualitative difference between the top 15 law schools and the rest. These elite schools charge sky-high tuition that can exceed $50,000 a year. But graduates have a good chance of securing a coveted job with a starting salary of $165,000 a year - a salary that is likely to improve as the economy does. For a 26-year-old, that's certainly good money. Duke, for instance, which was No. 11 on the U.S. News rankings, said its graduates had a 95 percent employment rate last year, with an average private sector salary of $160,000.
There may be valid criticism about lower-ranked law schools, particularly those U.S. News places in the third and fourth tier. Such private schools often charge significant tuition but do not obtain the same employment outcomes. The question is whether changes can be made to lower their costs, and whether this will lead to better opportunities for their graduates.
The problem of law school is one that is ubiquitous to higher education - the current model is inherently expensive but even today, lower-priced alternatives don't seem to meet the standards or be desired by many students.
It is here where revolutionary technologies like online learning may come into play. If it becomes accepted that many basics like contracts law can be easily taught by one professor online to thousands of students, then a law school can charge a lot less. But this is still mostly a theoretical change embraced by those outside academia that has yet to sweep universities. Even with one online course, some local presence will be needed to facilitate learning, particularly if there is skills training involved.
It may not be simple enough to just pin the blame on the costs of law school education. For 2011 law school graduates, as of nine months after graduation, only 65.4 percent were employed in jobs requiring passage of the bar. And law schools should learn to be more innovative, as other types of graduate programs are doing.
Law schools have also hurt themselves badly by failing to fully disclose certain statistics, including their employment rates. It is clear that the number of lawyers in the United States will fall as fewer people apply to law school. But this trend will probably shrink enrollment, not decrease the number of schools over all.
In the longer term, the question is whether there will be a recovery in law jobs as the economy heals. There is hope that will be the case. One study has found that the average lawyer will earn about $4 million - or twice as much as someone with a bachelor's degree - over their lifetime of employment. In addition, law school provides a general education that is useful in other areas. Both presidential candidates have law degrees, as do the chief executives of a substantial number of companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
A hard look at reform appears to be a worthy goal, but any changes should consider whether they will actually reduce costs, and provide something students want. The problem of law school is thus the problem that all schools of higher education, even veterinary school, face.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: As Wall Street Fights Regulation, It Has Backup on the Bench

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
Deep in enemy territory, Wall Street has found a powerful ally.
An appeals court in Washington has become ground zero for legal challenges to financial reform. Over the years, judges have rejected several major rules, saving financial firms millions of dollars in compliance costs and exposing government regulators to further litigation.
As regulators once again take aim at Wall Street with the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul, the financial industry is racing to fill the docket of its favorite court.
The latest legal attacks are largely aimed at the Securities and Exchange Commission. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia last year struck down the agency's so-called proxy access rule, a Dodd-Frank plan that would have empowered shareholders to oust company directors. The court is also expected to hear lawsuits over the S.E.C.'s new corporate whistle-blower program and the so-called Volcker Rule. 
The flurry of litigation will play out on friendly political turf for Wall Street. Noted for its conservative credentials and harmonious culture, the appeals court is stacked with judges who enjoy rock-star status in Republican circles.
But Wall Street's winning streak reflects more than partisan ideology, lawyers say. The rulings, which often hinge on whether a regulator fully studied the costs of a rule, are also rooted in the court's philosophy to keep government watchdogs on a short leash.
"I think it's a court that sees one of its responsibilities as regulating how agencies discharge their duties," said Eugene Scalia, a prominent corporate lawyer who has defeated the S.E.C. four times before the Washington court.
Dodd-Frank is under attack from multiple directions. Congressional Republicans and banking lobbyists are picking apart the overhaul with some success, but the lawsuits present a greater threat.
Lobbyists can create the occasional loophole, but courts can halt new regulations and reshape the financial industry with one swing of the gavel.
Bracing for the worst, the S.E.C. and other regulators are scrambling to safeguard their rules. The cautious approach, which has delayed new regulation, raises questions about the government's ability to rein in banks four years after the financial crisis.
"The court has given tremendous power to business groups, causing the agencies to operate out of fear," said Harvey Goldschmid, a law professor at Columbia and a former S.E.C. commissioner. By virtue of its perch in Washington, the circuit court is seen as the second most important court in the country. It is akin to a farm system for the Supreme Court, producing four current justices, including the chief, John Roberts.
Though corporate groups routinely file lawsuits in the Washington circuit, this court was not always so business friendly. Under a landmark Supreme Court ruling, judges must defer to a government agency when its authority is ambiguous - so long as its approach is reasonable. But the Washington circuit court in recent years reversed nearly 23 percent of the rules it reviewed, up from 14 percent in the early 1980s. This year, the court overturned an air pollution rule and a crackdown on cigarette advertising.
The lawsuits against Wall Street regulation enjoy special advantages. For one, financial regulators are often facing off against Mr. Scalia, a seasoned litigator at Gibson Dunn and the son of Justice Antonin Scalia.
Gibson Dunn often represents the United States Chamber of Commerce, which defeated the S.E.C.'s proxy access plan and twice persuaded the court to knock down a mutual fund rule.
The rulings also coincided with a conservative makeover of the court. Of the court's 13 members, nine are Republican presidential appointees. George W. Bush selected four judges, including Brett Kavanaugh, who advised Mr. Bush on the 2000 election recount in Florida. The court has three vacancies, but none of President Obama's picks have received Congressional approval.
"There's very little true resistance to the conservative power of the court," said Thomas C. Goldstein, a partner at Goldstein & Russell and the founder of Scotusblog, a Web site dedicated to the Supreme Court.
But the court's decisions, Mr. Goldstein said, stem only in part from partisan ideology. The circuit has overturned the S.E.C. six times in seven years, including in the proxy access case. In all but one instance, the court was tossing aside a Bush administration rule. The cases were unanimous decisions, with the court's liberal bloc siding with conservatives each time.
The decisions reflect the collegial dynamic among the judges. The court became deeply polarized in the 1980s, but under Harry T. Edwards, a Democratic appointee who became chief judge in 1994, peace became a priority.
It began with Judge Edwards sending handmade birthday cards to fellow jurists. The good will then spilled into their work. The court rarely reconsiders cases en banc anymore, a somewhat contentious procedure in which the entire court will gather to second-guess a ruling of a three-judge panel.
"I felt we were becoming a broken court, and I wanted to bring us together on a professional and personal level," Judge Edwards, who now sits as a senior judge, said in an interview. "It became a matter of great pride."
The court also regards itself as an expert check on regulatory power. While Washington circuit receives a smaller number of cases than most appeals courts, its complex workload requires judges to review the minutiae of administrative rules.
"You don't want to deny the agency the right to be wrong on occasion," Judge Edwards said. "But when it goes too far, we're supposed to tell them to do it right."
Dodd-Frank is particularly vulnerable. After the success of the proxy case, Wall Street groups twice sued the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in cases likely destined for the appellate court's docket. The industry is now weighing another potential lawsuit against the Volcker Rule, a still-uncompleted plan to stop banks from trading with their own money.
"It's common-sense litigation 101," said Paul Clement, the former solicitor general under President Bush who is now a partner at Bancroft P.L.L.C. "If you keep winning, you keep going back."
Rather than attack a rule on the merits or constitutionality, Wall Street is building lawsuits around the costs a rule will impose on the economy.
The challenges are largely rooted in a 1996 law that requires the S.E.C. to examine the effect of a new rule upon "efficiency, competition and capital formation." The S.E.C. is merely required to "consider" the costs, not write a formal study.
The strategy has worked. In the proxy case, the court ruled that the S.E.C.'s policy "failed adequately to consider" its economic effects, even though the agency drafted a roughly 60-page cost-benefit analysis.
Proponents of regulation fear that the court created an impossible standard. In a 2012 report, the advocacy group Better Markets noted that the S.E.C.'s "pre-eminent duty" is to "protect investors." The group also argued that the S.E.C.'s cost-benefit analyses should account for the cost of government bailouts that might result from lax regulation.
For its part, the S.E.C. has hired additional economists to scrutinize rules and published guidelines for evaluating regulations. "The S.E.C. is finally starting to figure it out," said Michael Livermore, executive director of the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University Law School. "The new approach just might save Dodd-Frank."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Big Law Steps Into Uncertain Times

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
The legal profession sits at the nexus of dealmakers' worlds, from Wall Street to Silicon Valley to Washington. As regulations change and the threat of litigation rises, the importance of lawyers has never been greater.
Yet the legal industry itself has been confronting great pressures. The collapse of Dewey & LeBoeuf exposed the potentially fatal flaws in the bigger-is-better mantra that has swept through Big Law in recent decades. And business - throttled by the financial crisis - is still not booming.
Some big blue-chip firms, like Cravath, Swaine & Moore; Debevoise & Plimpton; and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton have managed to navigate the industry's challenges successfully by sticking to their traditional ways, as Peter Lattman describes. (My fellow New York Times columnist, James B. Stewart, has a poignant related essay, reflecting upon his time as an associate at Cravath in the 1970s.) 
So all is not bleak. Still, a more sweeping transformation may be on the horizon. And it may look a lot like Axiom Law.
Axiom is a firm founded by Mark Harris, a former lawyer at the white-shoe firm Davis Polk & Wardwell. Mr. Harris is trying to rewrite the law firm business model. His firm, with some 900 lawyers, has no partners. The goal is to undercut the prices of the bigger firms on large cases and projects that require tens of thousands of hours. He hires lawyers of all stripes: some, from the biggest New York firms, do not have the drive or passion to become partners; others are lawyers who work from home.
Mr. Harris likens the difference between his firm and others to that between McKinsey & Company, the high-priced strategic consulting firm, and the consulting arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers. Cravath is like McKinsey, he says; Axiom is like PricewaterhouseCoopers. In the future, he imagines that companies will still hire the likes of Cravath for the biggest, most complicated work. But they will hire Axiom to trudge through projects that involve millions of pages of documentation and do not need to be done by an associate just out of law school billing $400 an hour. The law firms in the middle are likely to be squeezed.
"The legal industry is about to go through a transformational moment," Mr. Harris says.
Perhaps change cannot come soon enough. Clients are unhappy, feeling overbilled and underserved. Lawyers are similarly miserable, feeling underpaid and overworked.
What happened to the legal industry?
The problem, many lawyers say, is "P.P.P." (Some firms call it P.E.P.) P.P.P. stands for profit per partner. (P.E.P. is shorthand for profit per equity partner.) It has become the ultimate metric for measuring success among law firms. When American Lawyer magazine began publishing a ranking based on profit per partner in the early 1980s, it revolutionized the industry, but it also arguably led to a dangerous race among firms that left clients as a secondary priority.
Indeed, says Mr. Harris of Axiom, about three decades ago "the interests of law firms went from serving the clients to serving themselves."
As Michael H. Trotter, a partner at Taylor English Duma in Atlanta, says in his book "Declining Prospects" that there are only a few ways to increase profit per partner. One way is for firms to "charge their clients more for what they do"; another is for them to "do more work for their clients by working more hours or using more lawyers"; a third is to acquire more clients; and the last option is for firms to "reduce their overhead by paying less rent, restraining the compensation of their lawyer-employees and other personnel."
None of those options appear to be in the client's interest at all.
This is not a new lament.
A decade ago, Robert E. Hirshon, then president of the American Bar Association, declared that "the billable hour is fundamentally about quantity over quality, repetition over creativity."
He explained that "because a lawyer's time is not an elastic variable, increased billable-hour requirements are squeezing out other aspects of what it means to be a lawyer."
The focus on profits per partner is one reason so many companies have increasingly tried to move legal work away from big firms and have hired internal lawyers. And that means, Mr. Trotter says, that "the leverage that law firms have utilized to generate profits will go down and they aren't going to need as many associates."
Depending on how the industry transforms its business model, an old joke may need to be rewritten.
A prospective client calls a lawyer, asking, "How much would you charge for answering three simple questions?"
The lawyer says, "A thousand dollars."
"A thousand dollars!" the prospective client shouts. "That's very expensive, isn't it?"
"It certainly is," the lawyer replied. "Now, what's your third question?"
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Scandals Fill Lawyers' Pockets

BYLINE: By AZAM AHMED

 BODY:
As Wall Street has faced a string of scandals, bank executives, investors and customers have suffered. But one group is thriving: lawyers.
Called upon to navigate crisis after crisis, the white-collar bar is having a banner year with cases like the collapse of the futures brokerage firm MF Global, a multibillion-dollar trading blunder at JPMorgan Chase and suspicions of money laundering at HSBC.
The global investigation into the manipulation of a crucial benchmark interest rate known as the London interbank offered rate has emerged as the most profitable for the legal profession. 
While many of the recent scandals have been relatively isolated, the scope of the rate-rigging scandal has been vast, encompassing 16 banks. More than 10 government authorities around the world are looking into whether the banks reported false rates, potentially affecting trillions of dollars of financial products like mortgages and student loans.
The investigation is still in its early days, but experts say it is likely to drag on for years. Authorities could arrest traders this year, and more cases against big banks are expected. Earlier this year, Barclays agreed to pay $450 million to settle accusations that it had reported false rates.
Every major bank under investigation has hired a major law firm to represent it. An army of white-collar defense lawyers has been assembled to defend individuals. Plaintiffs' lawyers have filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the big banks, claiming damages on behalf of institutions, pensions and municipalities like the City of Baltimore.
"This is looking like a full employment act for the corporate bar," said Samuel W. Buell, a professor at Duke Law School. "It's very hard to see how you draw a tight circle around this issue."
Over the last few decades, white-collar law has transformed from a boutique business into a major focus for the biggest law firms. As firms expand globally and the federal government makes corporate prosecutions a higher priority, the practice has become a profit center.
Companies do not like to scrimp with civil and criminal cases. The stakes are too high.
In the last decade, a number of major cases have engulfed corporate America - and by extension, white-collar lawyers. The stock options backdating scandal, which emerged in 2006, swept up more than 100 companies and many executives. The cases provided much work for lawyers, including internal investigations at major companies and notable criminal defense efforts. A few years earlier, accounting scandals at companies like Enron and WorldCom generated similarly handsome legal fees.
Not all white-collar crackdowns are the same. Consider the federal government's insider-trading cases. The charges affect a handful of people and do not require the machinery of an entire legal institution. One former prosecutor in the Southern District of New York who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the conversations had been private said that defense lawyers jokingly complained that the hedge funds and other traders affected by the investigation tended to be low-margin clients.
With the interest-rate-fixing case, law firms started seeing the dividends in 2008. When the investigation got under way, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the American regulator, asked a handful of major banks to conduct internal inquiries. The goal was to figure out the extent of potential manipulation, focusing on a crucial benchmark known as the London interbank offered rate, or Libor.
At the time, the banks hired outside counsel to review the e-mails and documents as well as to conduct interviews. Barclays, the hardest-hit institution to date, hired Sullivan & Cromwell, which is led by H. Rodgin Cohen. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison is representing both Citigroup and Deutsche Bank.
The firms put dozens of top lawyers to work unearthing the worst of what had transpired, then gave their findings to regulators. Those reports form the backbone of the cases against the banks.
In the midst of the internal investigations, banks began identifying individuals who may have improperly tried to influence interest rates. Those employees are entitled to counsel, paid for by the banks. The bank's law firm will usually refer the individuals to other white-collar lawyers, since the interests of the banks and the employees may differ. Despite the effort to reduce conflicts, the referrals can be problematic because the banks are paying the bills.
"Sometimes you may be best served by going with a lawyer who has established relationships with the people who represent the company," said Charles D. Weisselberg, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law and co-author of a recent study examining white-collar practices at major law firms. "Or sometimes you may want someone more independent of the company lawyers who may not be looking to them for a referral in the future."
The referral system has been big business in the Libor case.
Dozens of individuals have hired lawyers, according to interviews with lawyers. Andrew J. Levander, the Dechert lawyer who represents former Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey in the MF Global matter, has been retained by Robert E. Diamond Jr., a former Barclays chief executive. Ira Lee Sorkin, who represented the Ponzi scheme mastermind Bernard L. Madoff, has been retained by a former trader at Barclays.
The most damaging aspects of the case could be traders' efforts to manipulate the index to squeeze more money from clients. After one exchange, a rate submitter at Barclays told a trader, "Always happy to help. Leave it with me, sir," according to regulatory documents. Another responded, "Done ... for you big boy."
"The tenor of the exchanges reflects a relentless indifference to the rights and interests of their clients," said Michael Hausfeld, a plaintiff's lawyer in the Libor case. He said it could take a long time to sift through the evidence. "There are a lot of nuances here that still have to be studied, but it's clear there was widespread disruption caused in the market."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: With Smartphone Deals, Patents Become a New Asset Class

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
David Berten has spent his legal career as a mercenary student of technological change. He has educated himself in one field after another: chemical coatings, genetics, navigation systems, semiconductors and digital communications software.
Keeping up is a constant challenge. This month, the 48-year-old lawyer was in his Chicago office, discussing past cases while scanning news Web sites and technology blogs for details on Apple's iPhone 5, which was being introduced in San Francisco that day.
"We have to know what's in it," Mr. Berten said. "In patent law, you're at the cutting edge of everything, and that's shifting all the time."
His firm, the Global IP Law Group, is a sign of the fast-emerging patent marketplace. Global IP, founded in 2009, is one of several boutique firms specializing in patent legal and advisory work that have cropped up recently. Silicon Valley is home to a cluster of them, including Inflexion Point Strategy, Epicenter IP Group and 3LP Advisors. 
Though created by lawyers, these companies are hybrids: more merchant banks than law firms. They have legal expertise, but focus on valuing and selling patents and giving strategic advice.
Global IP made its name as an adviser to Nortel Networks, a bankrupt Canadian telecommunications maker that sold its 6,000 patents for $4.5 billion to a group of six companies led by Apple.
The high price paid for the Nortel portfolio set off a bull market in patents that can claim some snippet of smartphone technology. By one estimate, as many as 250,000 patents may touch a modern smartphone. So patents have become defensive and offensive weapons in the smartphone wars, with the major companies suing one another in courtrooms around the world.
A few months after the sale, the big loser in the Nortel auction made its move. Google agreed to buy Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, and about $5.5 billion of that was the value of Motorola's patents, Google said in a government filing this year. Smartphones made by Samsung and other companies are powered by Google's Android software, making Google and Apple archrivals in smartphone technology.
The smartphone patent megadeals may be over now that the two main adversaries have armed themselves. An attempt by the bankrupt Eastman Kodak to sell 1,000 digital imaging patents stumbled recently, as bids from potential buyers like Apple and Google came in far below the $2.2 billion to $2.6 billion Kodak had said the patents were worth.
But the huge deals, while exceptional, were made possible by a broader trend: patents have become a new asset class.
Traditionally, patents sat on corporate shelves and were occasionally used as bargaining chips in cross-licensing deals with competitors. But that began to change in the 1990s, when technology companies like Texas Instruments and I.B.M. started to regard their patent portfolios as sources of revenue, licensing their intellectual property for fees.
Today, companies routinely buy and sell patents, mostly in deals that draw little attention, for millions of dollars instead of billions. The question, experts say, is how big the market will become.
"Patents are a tricky asset to trade," said Josh Lerner, an economist at the Harvard Business School. "But there is clearly a huge amount of value in intellectual property. And I think what we're seeing is the beginning of a lot more monetization and trading of intellectual property rights."
A sizable specialist industry has developed to build the marketplace for trading ideas. The players include patent aggregators like Intellectual Ventures and RPX, patent brokers like Ocean Tomo and ICAP, hedge funds, investment banks and law firms.
Yet boutique firms like Global IP play an important role, offering specialized expertise and an entrepreneurial approach. "We take patents and try to make money from them in all ways known to man - sales, licensing and litigating, if necessary," Mr. Berten said.
Global IP opened in 2009 with two lawyers, Mr. Berten and Steven Steger. The firm now has 10 lawyers. About two-thirds of its business is selling patents, and it is working on more than two dozen portfolios. Most work is done on a contingency basis, with a sliding scale of fees that can reach 40 percent on projects that involve litigation, Mr. Steger said.
In the Nortel project, Mr. Berten and his team built a vast database of the Nortel patents, tracking the history of each through the government patent office, citations in other patent applications, uses in license agreements and filings in other countries. "It was a boatload of work," said George Riedel, former chief strategy officer at Nortel.
Mr. Berten and Mr. Riedel, along with Nortel's bankers from Lazard, made presentations to companies in Silicon Valley and Europe. Mr. Riedel said Mr. Berten showed an impressive grasp of detail, down to individual patents and claims, when challenged by lawyers at the major technology companies.
His job, Mr. Berten said, was to "identify the value of patents and then demonstrate that value to potential buyers."
The auction was run by Nortel's bankruptcy lawyers at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton. The winning bid of $4.5 billion was well above the $2 billion to $3 billion projected. "Sure, I was surprised," Mr. Riedel said. "We were fortunate to be in the midst of an ecosystem battle in smartphones."
In the Kodak bankruptcy, Global IP was brought on in a very different role: as an outside adviser to the unsecured creditors, including Wal-Mart Stores and Sony Pictures Entertainment. Its job was to determine if the proposed auction was undervaluing the patents, and to advise the creditors if they might be better off taking another approach, like licensing the patents.
The very different experiences of Nortel and Kodak point to the many factors that go into pricing patents. Timing, competitive forces, regulation and court rulings all have an effect, said Ronald S. Laurie, managing director of Inflexion Point Strategy.
"Patents are a volatile, spot market," he said. "This is a market, but a market that is more like art than stocks or oil."
Ron Epstein, chief executive of Epicenter IP Group, agreed that pricing patents, especially large portfolios, was difficult. But he said he thought corporate trading in patents would become more commonplace, and pricing more routine. Someday, he predicted, patent acquisition costs may be a standard line item in corporate earnings statements.
"By fits and starts, we are moving to a more efficient marketplace for innovation," Mr. Epstein said.
Calling patents an asset class is shortsighted, said Kevin Rivette, a founder of 3LP Advisors. The larger value of a portfolio, he said, can be as a strategic tool to negotiate lower costs from a supplier or to alter a rival's product plans.
"You can use patents to change the competitive landscape," he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Conservative 'Super PACs' Sharpen Their Synchronized On-Air Message

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Independent political groups have long been the guerrilla warriors of presidential elections, tossing explosive advertisements into the middle of a campaign like hand grenades, with little regard for the strategy of the candidate they support.
But this year, in a tight race that leaves very little room for error, the conservative ''super PACs'' and other outside entities working to defeat President Obama have reached a consensus: Going off message is simply too risky.
So they operate largely from the same playbook, sharing polling data and focus group research to develop many of the same lines of attack. And they are being careful to keep their efforts consistent with the themes being emphasized by Mitt Romney's campaign.
The result is a striking degree of symmetry. To see many of the anti-Obama ads that have run on television recently, it would be easy to conclude that they were made in the same studios, by the same producers working for the same campaign. 
From the numbers they throw out (23 million people looking for work, $5 trillion in new debt), to the illustrations they use (a squiggly red line, plunging steeply), they are often indistinguishable except for the disclaimer saying who approved this message.
''Dishonest on taxes because he failed on jobs,'' says a recent ad from Crossroads GPS, the group run with the help of Karl Rove and other top Republican strategists.
''Barack Obama wasted $800 billion on a failed stimulus,'' says another produced by Restore Our Future, a pro-Romney super PAC.
It is no accident that the theme driving these ads -- Mr. Obama is a failed leader -- is also a major component of the Romney campaign's message. An ad released last week by the campaign declares that the president is ''failing American families.''
This sharpened message is providing the Romney campaign crucial cover as it works to raise more money to pay for advertising of its own and recover from its recent stumbles. And by coordinating their advertising purchases, the outside groups are maintaining a continuous presence on the air for the next few weeks while plugging many of the holes in Mr. Romney's ad schedule. Over the last two weeks, these groups have allowed Mr. Romney to keep pace on the air, roughly matching what Mr. Obama and his supporters have spent. This week they will ensure Mr. Romney has the advantage by several million dollars in competitive states.
The implications for Mr. Obama, who has been able to prevent Mr. Romney's poll numbers from rising in swing states like Ohio and Florida in part because of his heavy spending on attack ads, are considerable. He now faces the full force of the Republican message machine -- with more than $100 million at its disposal -- coming at him in lock step.
''Outside groups have to view themselves in a supportive and amplifying role, not as some rogue enterprise trying to score their own points,'' said Steven J. Law, president of Crossroads GPS and its sister super PAC, American Crossroads. ''In the past, groups would go off on their own and come up with what they thought was a great idea. And they could potentially do significant harm.''
He added that the groups are careful now to keep one another in the loop. ''There's a great deal of sharing,'' he said.
And as long as they do not coordinate with Mr. Romney's strategists, everything is perfectly legal. Though campaigns and outside groups are prohibited from collaborating, they are free to amplify and emulate each other.
''All of us have come to our own conclusions, but we have all come to the same conclusion,'' said Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, the advocacy group financed in part by Charles and David Koch. ''To defeat the president, the public needs to understand the utter failures of his economic policies.''
A change in pitch in the message that Americans for Prosperity was using is just one example of the way independent political groups have gotten on the same page. The group started out by focusing on the Solyndra scandal, attacking the president as a corrupt figure who granted his cronies lucrative government contracts.
But their latest television campaign -- featuring real voters describing how they feel let down by the president and will not support him again -- borrows a page from the American Crossroads playbook, which found that more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger critiques of Mr. Obama worked better with swing voters than ads with a hard edge.
''The tone is crucial,'' Mr. Phillips said. ''Our ads don't call anyone names. They're very measured.''
Independent groups have long been the attack dogs and provocateurs of modern politics. The ads they produce -- about a convict on furlough named Willie Horton or Swift Boat veterans -- have become synonymous with dirty politics.
That is not likely to change. But their tactics have become more deliberate, reflecting how difficult it is to develop a hard-hitting message against a president who remains well liked.
Republicans today seem to have less tolerance than ever for going off message. In May, a conservative group led by Joe Ricketts, the billionaire founder of T. D. Ameritrade, ignited a furious backlash after word leaked that it was considering an ad campaign that would have tied Mr. Obama to the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. and the minister's ''black liberation'' theology. The proposal, called ''The Defeat of Barack Hussein Obama,'' died a quick death, condemned by strategists in both parties.
''Look at all the controversy that erupted before even a single ad had been cut,'' said John Sides, a political science professor at George Washington University. ''They realize that more different kinds of messages that are in ads, the more their message is diluted.''
Last week Mr. Ricketts's group announced a new $10 million ad campaign. But rather than use a slash-and-burn approach, the ads feature interviews with ordinary Americans who explain in measured terms how they will not be voting for Mr. Obama again.
Message is not the only aspect these groups can coordinate. They have also worked to supplement one another's advertising purchases and fill in gaps for Mr. Romney.
While Mr. Romney's campaign has booked just around $5 million in airtime this week, American Crossroads and a similarly minded conservative group called Americans for Job Security are picking up the slack, reserving more than $8 million worth of advertising combined. About $6 million of that is from Americans for Job Security, the rest from American Crossroads. And next week the two groups will switch off, with American Crossroads putting about $6 million into ads and Americans for Job Security spending about $2 million.
The result is that Mr. Romney and his allies will outspend Mr. Obama and pro-Democratic independent groups on the air in most battleground states this week, including Colorado, Florida, Iowa and Virginia. And the Romney super PAC Restore Our Future is carrying all the weight in Wisconsin, where it is outspending Mr. Obama and his allies by four to one this week.
These groups are also looking at ways they can work together to do more than just dent Mr. Obama's popularity with attack ads. Mr. Law of American Crossroads said he and the other groups were likely to begin producing more commercials that play up Mr. Romney's experience for swing voters rather than focusing mostly on attacking Mr. Obama to motivate conservative voters.
''An advantage that Republicans have is that our base is energized,'' said Charles Spies, a founder of Restore Our Future. ''We don't need to be targeting the base with personal attacks or hard-hitting ads. Swing voters are already concerned about Obama's economic record, and we just need to reinforce that he has been a failure on jobs and the economy.''

HEADLINE: In Arab Spring, Obama Finds A Sharp Test

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and ROBERT F. WORTH

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Hosni Mubarak did not even wait for President Obama's words to be translated before he shot back.
''You don't understand this part of the world,'' the Egyptian leader broke in. ''You're young.''
Mr. Obama, during a tense telephone call the evening of Feb. 1, 2011, had just told Mr. Mubarak that his speech, broadcast to hundreds of thousands of protesters in Tahrir Square in Cairo, had not gone far enough. Mr. Mubarak had to step down, the president said.
Minutes later, a grim Mr. Obama appeared before hastily summoned cameras in the Grand Foyer of the White House. The end of Mr. Mubarak's 30-year rule, Mr. Obama said, ''must begin now.'' With those words, Mr. Obama upended three decades of American relations with its most stalwart ally in the Arab world, putting the weight of the United States squarely on the side of the Arab street. 
It was a risky move by the American president, flying in the face of advice from elders on his staff at the State Department and at the Pentagon, who had spent decades nursing the autocratic -- but staunchly pro-American -- Egyptian government.
Nineteen months later, Mr. Obama was at the State Department consoling some of the very officials he had overruled. Anti-American protests broke out in Egypt and Libya. In Libya, they led to the deaths of four Americans, including the United States ambassador to Libya, J. Christopher Stevens. A new Egyptian government run by the Muslim Brotherhood was dragging its feet about condemning attacks on the American Embassy in Cairo.
Television sets in the United States were filled with images of Arabs, angry over an American-made video that ridiculed the Prophet Muhammad, burning American flags and even effigies of Mr. Obama.
Speaking privately to grieving State Department workers, the president tried to make sense of the unfolding events. He talked about how he had been a child abroad, taught to appreciate American diplomats who risked their lives for their country. That work, and the outreach to the Arab world, he said, must continue, even in the face of mob violence that called into question what the United States can accomplish in a turbulent region.
In many ways, Mr. Obama's remarks at the State Department two weeks ago -- and the ones he will make before the General Assembly on Tuesday morning, when he addresses the anti-American protests -- reflected hard lessons the president had learned over almost two years of political turmoil in the Arab world: bold words and support for democratic aspirations are not enough to engender good will in this region, especially not when hampered by America's own national security interests.
In fact, Mr. Obama's staunch defense of democracy protesters in Egypt last year soon drew him into an upheaval that would test his judgment, his nerve and his diplomatic skill. Even as the uprisings spread to Libya, Yemen, Bahrain and Syria, the president's sympathy for the protesters infuriated America's allies in the conservative and oil-rich Gulf states. In mid-March, the Saudis moved decisively to crush the democracy protests in Bahrain, sending a convoy of tanks and heavy artillery across the 16-mile King Fahd Causeway between the two countries.
That blunt show of force confronted Mr. Obama with the limits of his ability, or his willingness, to midwife democratic change. Despite a global outcry over the shooting and tear-gassing of peaceful protesters in Bahrain, the president largely turned a blind eye. His realism and reluctance to be drawn into foreign quagmires has held sway ever since, notably in Syria, where many critics continue to call for a more aggressive American response to the brutality of Bashar al-Assad's rule.
Mr. Obama's journey from Cairo to the Causeway took just 44 days. In part, it reflected the different circumstances in the countries where protests broke out, despite their common origins and slogans. But his handling of the uprisings also demonstrates the gap between the two poles of his political persona: his sense of himself as a historic bridge-builder who could redeem America's image abroad, and his more cautious adherence to long-term American interests in security and cheap oil.
To some, the stark difference between the outcomes in Cairo and Bahrain illustrates something else, too: his impatience with old-fashioned back-room diplomacy, and his corresponding failure to build close personal relationships with foreign leaders that can, especially in the Middle East, help the White House to influence decisions made abroad.
A Focus on Respect
In many ways, Mr. Obama's decision to throw American support behind change in the Arab world was made well before a Tunisian street vendor set himself on fire and ignited the broadest political challenge to the region in decades.
Mr. Obama, whose campaign for the presidency was in part set in motion by his early opposition to the Iraq war, came into office in January 2009 determined that he would not repeat what he viewed as the mistakes of his predecessor in pushing a ''freedom agenda'' in Iraq and other parts of the Arab world, according to senior administration officials.
Instead, he focused on mutual respect and understanding. During a speech to the Arab world in 2009 from Cairo, the president did talk about the importance of governments ''that reflect the will of the people.'' But, he added pointedly, ''there is no straight line to realize this promise.''
Two weeks later, as large street protests broke out in Iran after disputed presidential elections, Mr. Obama followed a low-key script, criticizing violence but saying he did not want to be seen as meddling in Iranian domestic politics.
Months later, administration officials said, Mr. Obama expressed regret about his muted stance on Iran. ''There was a feeling of 'we ain't gonna be behind the curve on this again,' '' one senior administration official said. He, like almost two dozen administration officials and Arab and American diplomats interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity.
By the time the Tunisian protests broke out in January 2011 -- an angry Mr. Obama accused his staff of being caught ''flat-footed,'' officials said -- the president publicly backed the protesters. But the real test of the new muscular posture came 11 days later, when thousands of Egyptians converged on Tahrir Square in Cairo for a ''day of rage.''
Mr. Obama felt keenly, one aide said, the need for the United States, and for he himself, to stand as a moral example. ''He knows that the protesters want to hear from the American president, but not just any American president,'' a senior aide to Mr. Obama said. ''They want to hear from this American president.'' In other words, they wanted to hear from the first black president of the United States, a symbol of the possibility of change.
If the president felt a kinship with the youthful protesters, he seems to have had little rapport with Egypt's aging president, or, for that matter, any other Arab leaders. In part, this was a function of time: he was still relatively new to the presidency, and had not built the kind of cozy relationship that the Bush family, for instance, had with the Saudis.
But Mr. Obama has struggled with little success to build better relations with key foreign leaders like Hamid Karzai, the Afghan president, and King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia.
In any case, after an awkward phone call between the American and Egyptian presidents on Jan. 28, Mr. Obama sent a senior diplomat with long experience in Egypt, Frank G. Wisner, to make a personal appeal to the Egyptian leader. But Mr. Mubarak balked. Meanwhile, the rising anger in Cairo's streets led to a new moment of reckoning for Mr. Obama: Feb. 1.
That afternoon at the White House, top national security officials were meeting in the Situation Room to decide what to do about the deteriorating situation in Egypt. Thirty minutes into it, the door opened and the president walked in, crashing what was supposed to be a principals' meeting.
Attending were Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton; Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates; the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, Adm. Mike Mullen; and the national security adviser, Tom Donilon. Margaret Scobey, the ambassador in Cairo, appeared on the video conference screen.
The question on the table would have been unthinkable just a week before. Should Mr. Obama call for Mr. Mubarak to step down?
Midway through the meeting, an aide walked in and handed a note to Mr. Donilon. ''Mubarak is on,'' he read aloud.
Every screen in the Situation Room was turned to Al Jazeera, and the Egyptian leader appeared, making a much-anticipated address. He said he would not run again, but did not offer to step down. ''This is my country,'' he said. ''I will die on its soil.''
In the Situation Room, there was silence. Then the president spoke. ''That's not going to cut it,'' he said.
Seeing the Inevitable
If this were Hollywood, the story of Barack Obama and the Arab Spring would end there, with the young American president standing with the protesters against the counsel of his own advisers, and hastening the end of the entrenched old guard in Egypt. In the Situation Room, Mr. Gates, Admiral Mullen, Jeffrey D. Feltman, then an assistant secretary of state, and others balked at the inclusion in Mr. Obama's planned remarks that Mr. Mubarak's ''transition must begin now,'' arguing that it was too aggressive.
Mr. Mubarak had steadfastly stood by the United States in the face of opposition from his own public, they said. The president, officials said, countered swiftly: ''If 'now' is not in my remarks, there's no point in me going out there and talking.''
John O. Brennan, chief counterterrorism adviser to Mr. Obama, said the president saw early on what others did not: that the Arab Spring movement had legs. ''A lot of people were in a state of denial that this had an inevitability to it,'' Mr. Brennan said in an interview. ''And I think that's what the president clearly saw, that there was an inevitability to it that would clearly not be turned back, and it would only be delayed by suppression and bloodshed.''
So ''now'' stayed in Mr. Obama's statement. Ten days later, Mr. Mubarak was out. Even after the president's remarks, Mrs. Clinton was still publicly cautioning that removing Mr. Mubarak too hastily could threaten the country's transition to democracy.
In the end, many of the advisers who initially opposed Mr. Obama's stance now give him credit for prescience. But there were consequences, and they were soon making themselves felt.
Angry Reactions
On Feb. 14, in the tiny island monarchy of Bahrain, Internet calls for a ''day of rage'' led to street rallies and bloody clashes with the police. The next day at a news conference in Washington, Mr. Obama seemed to suggest that this revolt was much like the others. His message to Arab allies, he said, was ''if you are governing these countries, you've got to get out ahead of change.''
But in the following weeks, Mr. Obama fell silent. Away from the public eye, he was coming under assault from leaders in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, even Israel. Angry at the treatment of Mr. Mubarak, which officials from the Gulf states feared could forecast their own abandonment, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates drew a line in the sand. Some American and Arab diplomats say that response could have been avoided if Mr. Obama had worked quietly to ease Mr. Mubarak out, rather than going public.
On March 14, White House officials awoke to a nasty surprise: the Saudis had led a military incursion into Bahrain, followed by a crackdown in which the security forces cleared Pearl Square in the capital, Manama, by force. The moves were widely condemned, but Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton offered only veiled criticisms, calling for ''calm and restraint on all sides'' and ''political dialogue.''
The reasons for Mr. Obama's reticence were clear: Bahrain sits just off the Saudi coast, and the Saudis were never going to allow a sudden flowering of democracy next door, especially in light of the island's sectarian makeup. Bahrain's people are mostly Shiite, and they have long been seen as a cat's paw for Iranian influence by the Sunni rulers of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. In addition, the United States maintains a naval base in Bahrain that is seen as a bulwark against Iran, crucial for maintaining the flow of oil from the region.
''We realized that the possibility of anything happening in Saudi Arabia was one that couldn't become a reality,'' said William M. Daley, President Obama's chief of staff at the time. ''For the global economy, this couldn't happen. Yes, it was treated differently from Egypt. It was a different situation.''
Some analysts credit Mr. Obama for recognizing early on that strategic priorities trumped whatever sympathy he had for the protesters. Others say the administration could have more effectively mediated between the Bahraini government and the largely Shiite protesters, and thereby avoided what has become a sectarian standoff in one of the world's most volatile places.
If Mr. Obama had cultivated closer ties to the Saudis, he might have bought time for negotiations between the Bahraini authorities and the chief Shiite opposition party, Al Wefaq, according to one American diplomat who was there at the time. Instead, the Saudis gave virtually no warning when their forces rolled across the causeway linking Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, and the ensuing crackdown destroyed all hopes for a peaceful resolution.
The lingering resentment over Mr. Mubarak's ouster had another apparent consequence. Mrs. Clinton's criticism of the military intervention in a Paris television interview angered officials of the United Arab Emirates, whose military was also involved in the Bahrain operation and who shared the Saudis' concern about the Mubarak episode.
The Emiratis promptly threatened to withdraw from the coalition then being assembled to support a NATO-led strike against Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader. The Emiratis knew they were needed to give the coalition legitimacy. They quickly named their price for staying on board, according to Arab and Western diplomats familiar with the episode: Mrs. Clinton must issue a statement that would pull back from any criticism of the Bahrain operation.
The statement, hastily drafted and vetted by Emirati and American officials, appeared soon afterward, in the guise of a communiqué on Libya.
The tensions between Mr. Obama and the Gulf states, both American and Arab diplomats say, derive from an Obama character trait: he has not built many personal relationships with foreign leaders. ''He's not good with personal relationships; that's not what interests him,'' said one United States diplomat. ''But in the Middle East, those relationships are essential. The lack of them deprives D.C. of the ability to influence leadership decisions.''
A Lack of Chemistry
Arab officials echo that sentiment, describing Mr. Obama as a cool, cerebral man who discounts the importance of personal chemistry in politics. ''You can't fix these problems by remote control,'' said one Arab diplomat with long experience in Washington. ''He doesn't have friends who are world leaders. He doesn't believe in patting anybody on the back, nicknames.
''You can't accomplish what you want to accomplish'' with such an impersonal style, the diplomat said.
Mr. Obama's advisers argue that when he does reach out, he is more effective -- as in a phone call last week to Mohamed Morsi, the new president of Egypt. After Mr. Morsi's initial tepid response to the attacks on the embassy in Cairo, a fed-up Mr. Obama demanded a show of support. Within an hour, he had it.
''Were he to be calling all the time, it would run counter to our assertion that we won't dictate the outcome of every decision in every country,'' said Benjamin J. Rhodes, a top national security aide. Limiting his outreach, Mr. Rhodes said, ''heightens the impact of presidential engagement'' when Mr. Obama does get on the phone.
Still, there remains concern in the administration that at any moment, events could spiral out of control, leaving the president and his advisers questioning their belief that their early support for the Arab Spring would deflect longstanding public anger toward the United States.
For instance, Mr. Feltman, the former assistant secretary of state, said, ''the event I find politically most disturbing is the attack on Embassy Tunis.'' Angry protesters breached the grounds of the American diplomatic compound there last week -- in a country previously known for its moderation and secularism -- despite Mr. Obama's early support for the democracy movement there. ''That really shakes me out of complacency about what I thought I knew.''

HEADLINE: In Bolivian Amazon, a Yardstick for Modern Health

BYLINE: By JEAN FRIEDMAN-RUDOVSKY

 BODY:
SANTA MARÍA, Bolivia -- There seems to be little that distinguishes the indigenous Tsimane of northern Bolivia from dozens of other native Amazonian peoples. They still live in small communities, fishing daily, hunting and relying on subsistence farming. They remain relatively isolated from the outside world. They still have large families and fall victim to parasites, worms and infectious diseases. And until a decade ago, few had contact with doctors.
Yet since 2002, when the Tsimane Health and Life History Project was founded, the Tsimane (pronounced chee-MAH-nay) have become arguably the most intensely studied indigenous people in the Western Hemisphere, and perhaps the world.
More than 50 Bolivian and American researchers, doctors and students have participated in the health project, generating an array of landmark studies. The population of 13,000, which stretches along the Maniqui River, has become the scientific community's 21st-century ''traditional man.'' 
Research on the Tsimane led to the finding in 2009 that cardiovascular disease is probably an ill of modern societies. Studies of the group also provided the most conclusive data supporting the idea that high levels of physical activity drastically reduce the risk of diabetes, obesity and hypertension.
Ongoing Tsimane research explores links between testosterone and infection, diet and the nutritional value of breast milk, and DNA and life span.
There have been 42 studies with results published, and at least 33 more are under way. ''This is the most productive research site in anthropology today,'' Ray Hames, an anthropologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, said.
Samuel Bowles, of the behavioral sciences program at the Santa Fe Institute, said, ''The Tsimane will soon become a basic point of reference for everyone studying small-scale societies.''
Michael Gurven, an anthropologist at University of California, Santa Barbara, who is a founder and a director of the project, said the primary focus of the Tsimane studies was aging. ''We look at what's different and what's similar between the Tsimane and Western populations,'' he said.
The Tsimane were chosen because of their numbers; of all Amazonian indigenous groups still living relatively traditionally, the Tsimane are one of the most numerous. ''Thirteen thousand is a better data pool than 800,'' Dr. Gurven said.
The Tsimane also have the advantage of variety within that population, said Hillard Kaplan, an anthropologist at the University of New Mexico and the project's other founder and director. A small number of the Tsimane live in or around San Borja, the area's only town; they own motorcycles and use cellphones. The farther up the Maniqui River from San Borja you go, the more traditional the way of life.
In Puerto Yucumo, a village of thatched huts in plantain groves, women sit in groups at midday, their legs outstretched, attending to babies (the average family has nine children), cooking or weaving. They chatter in their native tongue; few speak Spanish and fewer have finished primary school. Their feet are flat, wide and thick, the sign of a lifetime spent barefoot.
''My people are tied to the land and their way of life,'' said Jorge Añez, mayor of San Borja, the highest elected seat a Tsimane has held in Bolivia.
The contrast to the modern world provides a fascinating basis for study, with ''real public health significance for us,'' said John C. Haaga, a program officer at the National Institutes of Health, which has supported the Tsimane studies for years.
The studies have required time and personnel. Thesis students live in communities for up to a year. A roving medical unit visits almost all 90 Tsimane villages at least once a year.
The infiltration of doctors and anthropologists has had some effect on the culture, the researchers acknowledge, but not as much as might be expected.
''The world is changing around the Tsimane, and they are changing with it, regardless of our presence,'' said Dr. Kaplan. He said the Tsimane lifestyle was altered much more by government stipends for the children and the elderly, altering the subsistence economy.
Nevertheless, the researchers had a threshold moment as they began the study. Could they, in good conscience, send doctors into the villages to study the population without also providing the Tsimane with basic medical care?
They decided they could not. ''The depth of our science and the depth of our helping are two sides of the same coin,'' Dr. Kaplan said. His field team offers basic medical exams for anyone who shows up, provides free medicine for common ailments like stomach parasites, and does on-the-spot analysis of blood, urine and fecal samples.
''It would be unethical not to do this,'' Jane Lancaster, editor of the journal Human Nature, said. ''If you are performing research and bothering these people, the least you can do is provide medical care.''
Still, officials at one of the project's supporters, the National Science Foundation, wondered: How can you study health conditions while simultaneously altering them? Dr. Kaplan and Dr. Gurven said they convinced the foundation and others that the kind of medical care they administer -- sporadic treatment for parasites, ibuprofen for headaches, stitches for machete wounds -- does not taint data on chronic, long-term disease.
Indeed, far along the Maniqui River, it's clear that intermittent medical care goes only so far. ''Yesterday we had eight kids, now we have seven,'' said Damiana Vie Cari, 33, of the village of San Joaquin, whose 3-month-old baby had died after lying out in the field while she worked. ''Too much sun,'' she said.
About 4 to 6 percent of the Tsimane die before age 1, according to the project's unpublished estimates. (That's down from 12 percent in 2002, when Dr. Kaplan and Dr. Gurven began their work; reductions in child and maternal mortality have been the team's most notable public health contribution.) About 15 percent die before age 5.
And they still fall ill from parasites and worms, and infectious diseases like dengue, leishmaniasis and tuberculosis.
Mr. Añez, the mayor, said the Tsimane were appreciative of the free health care. Indeed, as soon as the roving medicos alight in a village, mothers with sickly children slung on their backs converge on the teams.
Families go to the San Borja clinic aboard the project's shuttles, which are meant only to transport Tsimane adults age 40 and older for the full work-ups that are part of the studies, including echocardiograms, lung function tests, white blood cell counts, and lifestyle surveys.
Dr. Gurven said the researchers repeatedly explain what they are doing. Every patient must give oral consent, and all are shown a video about where their blood goes for testing.
Yet helping the Tsimane understand the groundbreaking medical findings they are assisting has not been easy.
Melanie Martin, a doctoral student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, remembers returning excitedly to her research village to report her recent findings: Compared with breast milk produced by Western women, Tsimane women's milk is higher in omega-3 fatty acids, which are critical for brain development. She was met with ''a lot of blank stares,'' she said. ''So, do we need medicine?'' one villager asked.
The researchers nevertheless believe that they are in a race for time. ''The Tsimane are not going to stay this way forever,'' Dr. Gurven said.

HEADLINE: Mayor of an Ailing Indiana Mill Town Turns to a Chicago Veteran for Advice

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- When Karen Freeman-Wilson was elected the mayor of Gary, Ind., last year, she found herself confronting some grim truths about her hometown. Revenues in an already emaciated city budget were shrinking by millions of dollars. About a quarter of the buildings, she said, were empty. All the while, people were moving away.
For years, leaders of a place once known as the ''Magic City'' have made all kinds of attempts -- a baseball team, gambling, an arts center, grants -- to somehow reverse the spiral in Gary, a declining steel town of 80,000. 
Now Ms. Freeman-Wilson is trying something else. She has turned to a former big-city mayor, Richard M. Daley, who ran Chicago for decades, and she now finds herself getting help from a team of graduate students from the University of Chicago's Harris School of Public Policy Studies, where Mr. Daley has been teaching.
''It's almost exhausting to describe,'' Ms. Freeman-Wilson, a former state attorney general and a Harvard-educated lawyer, said the other day, when asked to outline the struggles of Gary, where the steel mills once drew more than 170,000 residents.
In recent decades, a downtown shopping district has been largely boarded over and neighborhoods are dotted with shuttered homes. ''You can come to Gary and you can see the problems, but you don't really understand the nature of the multifaceted problems until someone really brings you in,'' she said.
So, months ago, Mayor Freeman-Wilson called Mr. Daley, 30 miles away along the edge of Lake Michigan. His mayor-to-mayor advice, in Ms. Freeman-Wilson's memory: think outside the box and remember that change will not come overnight.
Along the way, graduate students began examining Gary's abandoned buildings, studying its budget, assessing an airport. University officials this week will announce a new fund, to be housed at the University of Chicago, to support the students' work on Gary. Outside donors are being sought.
''Gary has really been forgotten for 15 years,'' Mr. Daley, who left office in 2011 and is now of counsel to the Chicago law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman as well as a distinguished senior fellow at the Harris School, said in an interview. ''We should really not forget any part of America.''
For the students, the proposition removes any whiff of the theoretical. Gary has nothing but real-world problems: a budget shortfall, revenues that have dropped by $30 million since 2006, according to Ms. Freeman-Wilson, and a national economic downturn that only aggravated problems in a city already deeply troubled. Foreclosure rates have risen, she said, even as property tax collections have fallen to about 70 percent of what is owed.
''They love it,'' Mr. Daley said of the students. ''They're very creative -- they've got great suggestions. And some far-off ideas too.'' Broad recommendations, though, are not expected for several months.
Founded as a steel mill town in 1906, Gary grew and grew, until the 1960s. Later, jobs shrank and white flight emptied it.
Today, about a third of residents live below the poverty level and the median household income is about $28,000, far less than the statewide median. It has, in the past, been dubbed a ''murder capital'' for its high crime rates.
Still, Gary has gotten outside advice before -- not all of it appreciated. Yet Ms. Freeman-Wilson said she has heard no complaints about the input from Mr. Daley and the students -- only some among many whose advice she has sought so far.
''What we understand is that we have challenges that cannot be solved by ourselves,'' she said. ''You think you know a lot as a candidate, and then you get in here and you're like, 'Wow, wait a minute.' But I am still hopeful.''

HEADLINE: While U.N. Beckons Clinton to Talks, Obama Starts by Taking In 'The View'

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
President Obama on Monday flew up to New York from Washington, rode in his motorcade to ABC's studios and sat down for an interview on ''The View.'' Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was not far away, in the Waldorf-Astoria, meeting with President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan.
As dozens of world leaders gathered for the annual opening of the United Nations General Assembly -- choking Manhattan's streets with motorcades and barricades -- the contrast between Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton could not have been starker. 
Mr. Obama, his re-election campaign in full swing, continued to make his pitch to American voters, avoiding for the most part world leaders arriving at the United Nations. The president will address the General Assembly on Tuesday but, breaking with tradition, has no meetings set with his counterparts.
That task he delegated to Mrs. Clinton, who churned through the first of dozens of meetings she will have over the next week. They deal with some of the most pressing foreign policy crises the administration has faced since taking office in 2009, like the deadly protests in the Islamic world and the confrontation between Japan and China over a handful of unpopulated islands.
Mrs. Clinton met President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan (''It's been a difficult time for all of us,'' he told her after riots protesting a video made in the United States that denigrates the Prophet Muhammad) as well as Mr. Karzai. By the end of a 12-hour day, she had also met with President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt, with whom she discussed issues including the security of the American Embassy in Cairo, relations with Israel and Egypt's economy.
The meeting seemed to repair possible hard feelings over President Obama's recent refusal to call Egypt either a friend or an enemy despite decades of close ties. ''We moved past that,'' a senior administration official said late Monday night.
Earlier, another administration official said much the same thing about Pakistan, describing Mrs. Clinton's meeting with Mr. Zardari and Pakistan's foreign minister, Hina Rabbani Khar, as representing a ''re-energized dialogue at the highest levels'' -- if not the very highest level, with Mr. Obama.
In between, Mrs. Clinton held an emotional meeting with President Mohamed Magariaf of Libya, who reiterated his apologies for the Sept. 11 killings of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans in Benghazi. He noted the counterprotests, held in Benghazi and other Libyan cities on Friday, that expressed support for the United States.
''Madam Secretary,'' he said, speaking softly in a conference room at the American suite in the Waldorf-Astoria, ''I also seize this opportunity to reaffirm that what happened on 11th of September towards these U.S. citizens does not express in any way the conscience of the Libyan people, their aspirations, their hopes or their sentiments towards the American people.''
Meanwhile, Mr. Obama was filming a segment for ''The View,'' the talk show hosted by Whoopi Goldberg and a quartet of sharp-tongued television celebrities. Mr. Obama arrived on the set with a basket of gifts, including home-brewed White House beer for the co-host Barbara Walters, whose birthday is Tuesday.
With his wife, Michelle Obama, by his side, the president was quipping with the six women in no time: ''I told folks I'm just supposed to be eye candy here for you guys.'' He chatted about not-so-weighty topics like the first couple's 20th wedding anniversary on Oct. 3, the night of the first presidential debate with Mitt Romney.
Mr. Obama said he had wisely decided to celebrate with his wife the following Saturday.
A moment of foreign policy gravitas occurred when Mr. Obama, asked whether the attack in Libya was an act of terrorism, said: ''There's no doubt that the kind of weapons that were used, the ongoing assault, that it wasn't just a mob action.'' In what may have been a preview of his General Assembly speech, he added: ''The overwhelming majority of Muslims, they want the same things that families here want. They want opportunity, kids want an education, they want jobs, they want peace. But there are extremist strains that are there.''
White House aides, who have been getting an earful for the past few days about the president's light schedule, sought to focus attention on Mr. Obama's speech on Tuesday. Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, told reporters that Mr. Obama would address anti-American protests that have been unfolding in the Arab world.
''I would expect the president to address the recent unrest in the Muslim world and the broader context of the democratic transitions of the Arab world,'' Mr. Carney said.
He added that the speech would also give Mr. Obama another opportunity ''to underscore that Iran must not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon.''
Mr. Obama was scheduled to attend a reception for world leaders at the United Nations on Monday night. But a campaign adviser acknowledged privately that in this election year, campaigning trumped meetings with world leaders. ''Look, if he met with one leader, he would have to meet with 10,'' the aide said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

HEADLINE: Ex-Regulator Has Harsh Words for Bankers and Geithner

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS and PETER EAVIS

 BODY:
Sheila C. Bair, who tormented Wall Street and its Washington allies as a banking regulator, is taking a fresh swipe at her foes in retelling the dark days of the financial crisis.
In a book to be released on Tuesday, the former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation takes aim at the bankers she blamed for the crisis. She also criticized fellow regulators, including current Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, for their response to the problems.
Ms. Bair painted Mr. Geithner, the former head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as an apologist for Wall Street, opposing some postcrisis reforms. She questioned whether his effort to inject billions of dollars into nine big banks masked a rescue intended solely for Citigroup, a theory that other government officials have rejected.
"Participating in these programs was the most distasteful thing I have ever done in public life," said Ms. Bair, in the book, "Bull By the Horns: Fighting to Save Main Street from Wall Street and Wall Street from Itself." 
People close to Mr. Geithner note that he issued early warnings about Wall Street risk-taking and championed a regulatory crackdown on big banks.
Lee Sachs, a former top Treasury Department official, said on Monday that Mr. Geithner never acted to protect Citigroup or any single institution, but rather the entire system. In 2004, the New York Fed under Mr. Geithner ordered Citigroup to pay $70 million for consumer lending violations.
"If anything, he was quite focused on the pain the country was suffering," Mr. Sachs said.
Another government official who attended some of the meetings with Ms. Bair and Mr. Geithner said she was overstating the animus. A Treasury Department spokeswoman declined to comment on Ms. Bair's attacks because officials had not read the book.
In a statement, a Citigroup spokeswoman defended the bank, whose bailout earned a profit for taxpayers. "Since Vikram Pandit became C.E.O. during the financial crisis, Citi has executed a strategy based on returning to the basics of banking and building a culture of responsible finance. It is a simpler, smaller, safer and stronger institution than it was five years ago and this record speaks for itself."
Drawn from personal e-mails and notes, Ms. Bair's book joins the growing collection of financial crisis histories. While the book contributes a few revelations to the annals of Wall Street, Ms. Bair mostly notably highlights the challenge of being the only woman in the room. At crucial times during the crisis, she said, Mr. Geithner and other top regulators kept her in the dark.
"Maybe the boys didn't want Sheila Bair playing in their sandbox," she wrote.
A Kansas native, Ms. Bair portrayed herself as a lifelong Republican with a populist streak. She was among the first regulators to sound the alarms about the subprime mortgage bubble. When the crisis emerged, she pushed for banks to replenish their capital cushions.
Ms. Bair, who is now senior adviser to the Pew Charitable Trusts, spent much of the book criticizing the go-go attitude that fueled the crisis. She also delivered blistering assessments of several crisis-era chiefs. She said, for example, that the deal-making skills of Kenneth D. Lewis, then Bank of America's chief, "were clearly wanting."
But she saved the sharpest critique for Mr. Geithner, calling him the "bailouter in chief."
When the F.D.I.C. was negotiating the contours of a plan to guarantee bank debt, she said that Mr. Geithner pushed the agency to charge banks only a "minimal" fee in return for the government support. Mr. Geithner and other regulators argued that it was counterproductive to assign hefty costs at a time when the industry needed saving.
"Geithner just couldn't see things from my point of view," Ms. Bair wrote.
Over her five-year tenure, Ms. Bair struggled to break into the clubby nature of high finance, detailing in the book how Mr. Geithner and others shut her out of major decisions. The F.D.I.C., for example, was not involved in picking which banks would receive the first round of bailout funds. One regulator circulated an e-mail questioning "the audacity of that woman."
Much of the book is devoted to the regulators' dealings with just one company, Citigroup, which received more government support than any other bank. Ms. Bair fleshed out her frustrations with Mr. Geithner and his desire, in her eyes, to treat a dysfunctional bank with kid gloves.
She even suggested that the industrywide bailouts were meant mainly to help Citigroup. Other commercial banks were in considerably better shape, she noted, and beleaguered investment banks like Morgan Stanley had secured private investments.
"How much of the decision-making was being driven through the prism of the special needs of that one, politically connected institution?" Ms. Bair wrote.
Other players in the crisis will most likely criticize her concerns as reductive, especially in light of major problems at Bank of America, which required two bailouts. While other banks were healthier than Citi, regulators opted for an across-the-board plan to instill confidence in the industry and the economy.
Even so, Ms. Bair laid out new details in the book suggesting that regulators went further than previously thought to protect Citigroup.
Early on in the crisis, she said, Mr. Geithner wanted Ms. Bair's agency to financially support Citigroup's planned $1-a-share acquisition of Wachovia. In turn, the F.D.I.C. would receive $12 billion in preferred stock and warrants.
Mr. Geithner and Citigroup held private talks about the deal without telling Ms. Bair, according to her account. Regulators then planned to allow Citigroup to count the stock as capital, a boost to the bank's "sagging capital ratios."
When Wells Fargo swooped in with a higher offer that required no government backing, Ms. Bair indicated her support for the new deal. Mr. Geithner, she said, was "apoplectic" and wanted the F.D.I.C. to stand behind Citigroup, which then raised its bid. The Fed ultimately approved the Wells Fargo deal and Citigroup required two infusions of government capital.
As Citi continued to suffer in 2009, Ms. Bair pressed for the bank to put its troubled assets into a "bad bank" supported by private money. Ms. Bair said she received no support from other regulators, who feared it would unnerve the markets.
In the book, Ms. Bair also scrutinized Mr. Geithner's approach to reforming Wall Street. Detailing new elements of the debate over the Dodd-Frank act, she argued that Mr. Geithner worked with Republican lawmakers to "water down" new regulations like the so-called Volcker Rule. Other people close to the Dodd-Frank debate recall that Mr. Geithner supported the rule but agreed to exemptions to secure Republican votes.
When Ms. Bair and other officials mentioned to lawmakers their concerns about a draft version of the legislation, she said Mr. Geithner summoned regulators to deliver an "expletive-laced tongue lashing."
For her part, Ms. Bair acknowledged her own temper flare-ups. When preparing for Congressional testimony one night, she recalled having stomped out of the room in a fit of exhaustion. Ms. Bair, who received a security detail after threats on her safety, also lashed out at journalists who she felt were unfair, underscoring her sensitivity to the glare of the spotlight.
"I get cranky when sleep-deprived," she wrote.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Praises Central Banks, but Sees Slowing Ahead

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned on Monday that the institution would probably cut its estimates of global growth yet again this year because of the tepid recovery in the United States, a slowdown in emerging economies and continued troubles in the euro zone.
Still, she praised the world's central banks for taking decisive action to ease financial conditions and aid the global recovery in recent months. 
''It may well be that central banks will have played and will be recognized to have played a significant role in pulling the global economy out of this great recession,'' Ms. Lagarde said at a meeting at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington-based research group. ''But we should not get ahead of ourselves.''
Ms. Lagarde said that the fund would most likely trim its growth estimates in a periodic update to its economic forecasts, to be delivered at a joint meeting of the World Bank and the I.M.F. in Tokyo next month. In its last estimate, made in July, the fund forecast global economic growth of 3.5 percent in 2012 and 3.9 percent in 2013. The global economy grew about 4 percent in 2011.
''Clearly, downside risks continue to loom large, importantly reflecting risks of delayed or insufficient policy action,'' the fund said in its last estimate.
Ms. Lagarde warned that uncertainty continued to plague the global economy, depressing growth in both high- and low-income countries. She repeated her often-delivered message that European policy makers still had much work to do to forge a banking union and ease credit conditions in countries like Spain.
She also delivered a stark warning to American political leaders about the uncertainty over the so-called fiscal cliff, a spate of tax increases and spending cuts that some economists say are large enough to throw the economy into recession next year.
''It's not a threat just for the United States of America, it's a threat for the global economy,'' Ms. Lagarde said. ''We all hope that despite political calendars, which anywhere in the world entail a degree of uncertainty and unpredictability, there will soon be enough political clarity and no political games in order to actually focus on removing this uncertainty and making sure that both the issue of the fiscal cliff and the issue of the debt ceiling are addressed rapidly.''
Financial markets have cheered recent actions from the world's central banks to help the economy. But Ms. Lagarde's comments and other recent reports underscore the continuing weakness.
On Friday, the World Trade Organization slashed its forecasts for global trade, cutting its estimate of trade growth in 2012 to 2.5 percent from 3.7 percent. It also slashed its 2013 estimate, to 4.5 percent from 5.6 percent.
''It seems likely that world trade will grow by less than world G.D.P. this year,'' said Andrew Kenningham of Capital Economics, a global consultancy, in a note to clients. ''If so, this would be at least a temporary reversal of the globalization process which has seen trade rise more rapidly than G.D.P. over the past few decades.''
The slowdown in global trade -- because of sluggish growth in many emerging economies like China, weakness in the United States and the persistent financial turbulence in Europe -- poses a particular threat for an American recovery driven in part by export growth.

HEADLINE: Primed and Polished

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
Hotel owners in the United States are increasing their spending on improvements to their properties this year, upgrading guest rooms, restaurants, technology and other amenities.
A new survey of owners estimated that spending would reach $5 billion this year, the most since 2008 and up from $3.75 billion last year, said Bjorn Hanson, divisional dean of the Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University and author of the survey. Capital expenditures fell to $3.3 billion in 2009, in the depths of the recession, and dropped further, to $2.7 billion, in 2010, he said.
These estimates do not include spending for hotel expansions or major changes that result from moves like switching brands. 
The slowdown in improvements came at a price. According to J. D. Power & Associates' 2012 North America hotel guest satisfaction index study, released in July, guest satisfaction with hotel rooms had fallen to 752 points on a 1,000-point scale, from a high of 770 in 2007, while satisfaction with ''hotel facilities'' was 758, a seven-year low.
Many factors account for the increased spending in brands like Crowne Plaza, Courtyard by Marriott, Staybridge Suites, Hyatt and Westin. With the industry's continuing recovery -- occupancy this year is at its highest since 2007 and rates are at their highest since 2008 -- owners can more easily afford upgrades.
Henry Harteveldt, a travel analyst and co-founder of Atmosphere Research Group, said hotel owners were also investing now because travelers were no longer beholden to a particular brand. An Atmosphere study last year found that only three in 10 American travelers were loyal to any hotel company. Hotel owners, Mr. Harteveldt said, ''know they have to start investing in guest rooms, restaurants and public spaces if they want to sustain price increases and hopefully achieve more.''
Also, travelers now expect to find hotel rooms equipped with the same amenities that they have at home, whether it is a flat-screen television, Wi-Fi or broadband Internet access, said Steven Kent, lodging analyst at Goldman Sachs.
And the growing popularity of social media puts more pressure on owners to properly maintain their investments. ''Social media make all flaws public,'' Mr. Harteveldt said. ''There's no hiding behind an out-of-style dust ruffle anymore.''
In fact, Mr. Hanson said, the decline in capital expenditures by owners in recent years was unusual. Although management companies like Marriott, Starwood and the InterContinental Hotels Group normally require owners to invest in their hotels to maintain or meet new brand standards, after 2008, they ''waived many new and existing requirements for capital expenditures, to help owners through this period of decreased financial performance,'' he said.
While the industry as a whole eased off on improvements for several years, some brands, particularly I.H.G.'s Holiday Inn and Starwood's Sheraton, continued to upgrade their hotels. A three-year, $1 billion global overhaul of Holiday Inn and Holiday Inn Express hotels was completed in 2010, while a multibillion-dollar global upgrade of Sheraton hotels that began in 2008 was finished last year.
Hyatt officials said the company actually used the downturn to its advantage. They said it was a good time to start projects because construction and design costs were low, and with low occupancy rates, fewer guests were inconvenienced. As a result, they said, Hyatt in the last few years has fixed up some hotels it owns, like the Grand Hyatt New York, which underwent a $130 million total renovation that was finished last year.
Several Fairmont hotels are in the middle of improvements this year, including the Fairmont Copley Plaza in Boston, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary with upgrades of guest rooms and the executive lounge, and opening a new restaurant, the OAK Long Bar & Kitchen. Guest rooms at its hotel in Dallas are being improved, while the Fairmont Washington DC recently refurbished its meeting and event spaces.
I.H.G. last year began a multiyear initiative to upgrade its Crowne Plaza hotels, while the real estate investment trust Hospitality Properties Trust, owner of 77 Staybridge and Candlewood Suites extended-stay hotels, is spending $165 million this year on improvements.
Courtyard by Marriott hotels continue to upgrade their lobbies, installing special seating, media booths, a bistro restaurant and a 24-hour shop selling snacks and sundries. This program began in 2008 and is set to be complete by 2014. To cater to younger travelers, Marriott hotels continue to convert their lobbies into spaces suitable for socializing and working.
Like Hyatt, Starwood is investing in hotels it owns. It is spending $45 million on the Westin Peachtree Plaza in Atlanta to renovate hallways of guest room floors and over 1,000 guest rooms. Work is to be completed by November.
Starwood will spend an additional $30 million over the next two years to refurbish the meeting space, restaurants and public areas of the Westin Peachtree Plaza. All guest rooms and many public spaces at the Hyatt Chicago Magnificent Mile are in the middle of a $25 million redesign. Work is scheduled to be completed next spring.
Loews will spend some $80 million on a total upgrade of its flagship Regency Hotel in New York next year, and an additional $20 million on improvements on its Philadelphia hotel, starting in November.
Last June, Starwood announced that it and other W hotel owners would invest over $100 million through 2013 in 11 hotels in the United States and Canada, to upgrade guest rooms, restaurants and bars, lobbies and meeting rooms.
Mr. Hanson said he expected capital expenditures would continue to climb beyond 2013, reaching the record 2008 levels by 2015 at the latest.

HEADLINE: A German Job Problem Is Finding the Workers

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
INGOLSTADT, GERMANY -- More than a quarter of the work force in Spain or Greece is without jobs, but this city on the Danube north of Munich has the opposite problem: not enough workers.
Patrick Schulter, 21, weighed three offers recently before choosing a work-study training program at Schabmüller Automobiltechnik, which makes components for Audi and other vehicle manufacturers.
He is not unusual. One of his fellow Schabmüller trainees, 18-year-old Rebecca Hartl, said ''None of my friends have any problem getting a job.''
Ingolstadt, with a population of 128,000, provides perhaps the best example of the turnaround that has occurred in the German job market since an overhaul of labor regulations in 2005. Unemployment in Ingolstadt and the surrounding region is just 2.2 percent, the lowest rate in the country. In Eichstätt, a neighboring town, the jobless rate is an almost impossibly low 1.3 percent. 
The changes that helped create full employment, and then some, in parts of Germany are often held up as an example that other European countries should emulate.
And yet, as many low-paid Germans would attest, employment and affluence are not necessarily synonymous -- as the country's growing income gap makes clear. Nor are all of those jobs necessarily secure. What is more, a visit to Ingolstadt shows that the low jobless rate is also a result of factors that may not be so easy to duplicate elsewhere.
Even Germany is not immune to Europe's economic problems. The Ifo business climate index, considered a reliable gauge of the mood in German industry, fell for a fifth month in September, according to data released Monday by the Ifo Institute in Munich. German managers are concerned that the euro zone crisis is depriving them of sales in other parts of Europe.
Like companies all over Germany, though, those in Ingolstadt have prospered from exports beyond Europe -- to emerging markets and a general surge in the number of affluent consumers worldwide. Volkswagen's Audi unit, which is based in Ingolstadt and is by far the biggest employer, now sells more of its high-end cars in China than in Germany or the United States.
The effects of the labor reforms are impossible to disentangle from the results of sound corporate strategy. ''It's hard to say because at the same time the economy recovered,'' said Thomas Sigi, a member of the management board at Audi who is in charge of personnel. ''German industry prepared itself at the right time for emerging markets.''
Since 2005, when the revamp in labor laws took effect, the jobless rate in Germany has fallen from 13 percent to less than 7 percent. A big factor was a steep cut in jobless benefits that put pressure on people to take even low-wage jobs, and changes that made it easier for companies to hire temporary workers with fewer protections against dismissal.
That is why the country's job miracle is regarded with curious ambivalence by many Germans. It came at the expense of the comfortable but costly social benefits many Germans treasured.
People had to give up the security of a guaranteed long-term income if they became unemployed. They faced more pressure to take jobs they did not want. Even better-paid workers had to make do with meager pay raises.
As a result, labor costs in Germany have barely budged in the past decade. The wage restraint helped German companies become more competitive on world markets, preventing the loss of manufacturing jobs to Eastern Europe or China. But it also created a bigger gap between rich and poor.
Gerhard Schröder, the chancellor who pushed through the changes in labor rules in the face of bitter opposition within his own center-left party, subsequently lost a re-election bid to Angela Merkel. He has since become a figure of some ridicule because of his business ties to the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin.
Mr. Schröder's fate has not been lost on officials in countries like Spain and Italy, who have often dragged their feet on removing sclerotic labor rules. Such changes are unpopular and typically take years to bear fruit, by which time the officials responsible have been kicked out of office.
But for all the drawbacks, by most measures Ingolstadt has undergone a remarkable transition. It was once regarded as a somewhat blighted corner of Bavaria, perhaps most famous as the place where the fictional Dr. Frankenstein attended medical school and stitched together a monster from body parts he scavenged from graveyards.
In 2005, the jobless rate in Ingolstadt was more than 7 percent, three times the current level. The city is not opulent like Munich to the south. Ingolstadt has a historic city center surrounded by old fortress walls, but there are several empty storefronts. And many neighborhoods consist of slab-like concrete apartment blocks, where the predominant language is often Turkish or Russian.
For now, Audi continues to thrive, reporting a 13 percent increase in unit sales through August. But some people in town worry that Audi could begin suffering the slump now afflicting most other European carmakers. Besides employing 35,000 people in Ingolstadt, the company supports a huge network of suppliers.
The German economy is slowing down, which could affect Audi and other Ingolstadt businesses. ''We are very concerned about what would happen if Audi had a sales problem,'' said Bernhard Stiedl, deputy head of the IG Metall union in Ingolstadt, which represents Audi workers. ''It would have a massive effect on us.''
The first to suffer would be temporary workers. As part of the 2005 changes in the labor market, Germany made it easier for companies to use workers supplied by staffing companies to deal with fluctuations in demand.
''Flexibility in production is essential, and temporary workers definitely play a role,'' said Janina Kugel, senior vice president for human resources and executive development at Osram, the lighting division of Siemens, which has a factory in Eichstätt.
Despite the 2005 overhaul, most German workers continue to enjoy far more protections than those in the United States. Permanent workers can usually be laid off only after lengthy negotiations with employers that typically include hefty severance payments. German politicians remain reluctant to tamper with these legal barriers to dismissal.
Temp workers, though, are formally employed by the staffing companies. They can be released in an instant from their temporary employers.
''Temporary work has boomed, but there is a high degree of insecurity,'' said Rolf Zöllner, head of the Federal Labor Agency in Ingolstadt. Staffing agencies account for about 40 percent of the positions offered through the labor agency, he said.
For now, few workers are complaining. Ingolstadt has problems many cities would envy. While many communities are suffering from declining population because of low birthrates, Ingolstadt is adding 1,000 residents a year and construction companies are busy putting up housing. Financially strapped cities elsewhere are closing schools and public swimming pools; Ingolstadt is building new ones. Audi has sponsored new sports stadiums and professional soccer and hockey teams.
The people suffering the most in Ingolstadt may be employers desperate to find enough workers, particularly small enterprises that cannot afford to pay as much as Audi.
At the Espresso Café Boulevard in the city's pedestrian zone, the owner, Kristin Zinser, had two large chalkboards set up on the cobbled street recently. One advertised the lunch special (meat with gravy and a small salad) and the other sought counter help
Ms. Zinser said it was tough to find workers and hard to keep them. ''They're students,'' she said. ''They go after a while.''
Even at the entry level, wages are rising. Schabmüller, the auto components maker, has raised the stipend it pays to student trainees to &#x20ac;510, about $660, a month from &#x20ac;400, and they can earn an additional &#x20ac;150 a month if they maintain the equivalent of a B average in school.
Despite the labor shortage, there has not yet been an influx of workers from countries with high unemployment like Spain, Greece or Italy. One exception is Osram, the lighting unit of Siemens, which has imported workers from Poland and the Czech Republic for some of its Bavarian factories. But language skills have been an obstacle for southern Europeans, Mr. Zöllner of the labor agency said, though he added they might start to arrive in Germany as the Continent's economic problems continue.
Otherwise, Germany's tight labor market could become a brake on growth. ''I can't buy a new machine if I don't have someone to operate it,'' said Christian Stöhr, a manager at Schabmüller who is in charge of recruiting and training apprentices.
The job market has even vacuumed up people who used to be considered unemployable. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ingolstadt was a destination for many ethnic Germans in places like Kazakhstan that, under German law, had a right to citizenship.
But many did not speak German or have marketable skills and were blamed for a rise in crime. That problem has all but disappeared, said Herbert Lorenz, head of the Ingolstadt economic development office. ''The best social policy,'' he said, ''is full employment.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Lincoln Center's President To Leave

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
Reynold Levy, the president of Lincoln Center who shepherded an ambitious redevelopment of its 16-acre campus during hard economic times, will step down at the end of next year.
Mr. Levy, who assumed the post in 2002, informed the board on Thursday, explaining that he was leaving mainly because his work was done; the last piece of the center's redevelopment project will be completed on Oct. 1, when the new pedestrian bridge spanning West 65th Street opens to the public. The move was announced on Monday afternoon.
Lincoln Center's trustees will use the bridge to pay tribute to him; it will be called the President's Bridge: In Honor of Reynold Levy. 
Supporters say part of Mr. Levy's legacy will be the collaborative spirit he built, using diligence and diplomacy, among the complex's 11 historically contentious constituent groups, including the New York Philharmonic, the Metropolitan Opera and New York City Ballet.
''Reynold's contribution cannot be overstated,'' said Katherine G. Farley, the chairwoman of Lincoln Center. ''He works harder than any human being I know. The way he fulfills the job is really grueling.''
The center was able to raise $1.3 billion over the course of his tenure, much of it a result of a schedule that put him at work at 6:15 a.m. and regularly had him staying on till 11 p.m. for events.
Nearly every weekday meal on those days was spent with a board member, colleague or prospective donor: sometimes he had two breakfasts in one day.
And Mr. Levy has always made it a point to do his homework on people and to pay attention to details. He recalled in an interview one frigid winter morning, for example, when he took Raymond J. McGuire -- a top Citibank executive and prospective Lincoln Center trustee -- to breakfast. Mr. McGuire ordered sliced banana with his oatmeal, but the restaurant was out of bananas. So Mr. Levy excused himself, hustled out and came back with two bananas.
Mr. McGuire joined the board.
Mr. Levy, 67, said that his one solid plan for his future involved ''beaches and books'' -- although he intends to write some of those books as well as read them. (He has written one on the job: ''Yours for the Asking: An Indispensable Guide to Fund-Raising and Management.'') ''I will enjoy the freedom associated with a relatively unscheduled day,'' he said.
By all accounts, Mr. Levy has been a master schmoozer, though you wouldn't know it to look at him; he doesn't have the smooth salesmanship of a Glenn D. Lowry, director of the Museum of Modern Art, or the understated gravitas of a Frank A. Bennack Jr., Lincoln Center's former chairman. Slightly stooped, with glasses and gray hair and often wearing a brown suit, Mr. Levy appears more like a rumpled professor than like the polished frontman for the country's largest performing arts institution. He can wax lyrical about improvements to the central mechanical plant.
This gentle, wonky first impression is disarming to many and belies a fierce passion for his cause and the capacity to close the deal. ''He has an inner toughness,'' said Blair W. Effron, a trustee.
Mr. Levy is credited with developing new revenue streams for Lincoln Center that have helped create balanced or surplus budgets during his tenure, including rentals for New York Fashion Week, a new studio for Channel 13, new restaurants, a publishing imprint and a new performing arts consulting business -- with China as the first client. ''We make as much money with new ventures as we made in ticket sales when he first got there,'' Mr. Effron said.
Mr. Levy said ''changing the economic model at Lincoln Center'' was essential today -- ''finding sources of recurring revenue that have nothing to do with ticket prices.''
The campus's physical transformation -- designed by Diller Scofidio & Renfro -- is visible. Alice Tully Hall has a new auditorium with translucent wood veneer walls and a restaurant that has just been taken over by the star chef Marcus Samuelsson (to open on Friday). The Film Society has a new home with two new theaters and a cafe. Lincoln Center Theater has a new experimental theater and a marquee.
Lincoln Center has numerous new public spaces with free Wi-Fi, like the grandstand opposite Alice Tully, the updated fountain plaza and the sloped grass roof above the new restaurant, Lincoln.
West 65th Street now contains the entrances to Lincoln Center Theater, the Film Society and the Juilliard School. And the nearby David Rubenstein Atrium has become like a Lincoln Center commons, attracting 750,000 people since it opened in 2009 with free performances, discount tickets and food by 'wichcraft.
''There is a new vibe here, you can feel it,'' Mr. Levy said. ''You hang out and see thousands more people walking the campus.''
Mr. Levy also pointed to recent programming choices that he said reflected well on the direction he has set, citing, among others, Cate Blanchett's ''Uncle Vanya,'' Alan Cumming's ''Macbeth'' and ''The Clock'' video installation at the Atrium, which drew 18,000 visitors.
With a strong staff and board, Mr. Levy said he was leaving Lincoln Center in good hands. ''I think,'' he said, ''it's dangerous to conflate yourself with the institution.''

HEADLINE: Shares Post Small Losses On Fears Over Europe

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The stock market posted modest losses on Monday as concerns about Europe overshadowed recent optimism about central banks' efforts to revive the global economy.
An index of business confidence in Germany, the biggest economy in Europe, fell for a fifth consecutive month. Many economists had expected it to at least remain flat. Some think Germany is headed for a recession.
The threat of the years-old European debt crisis has seemed less immediate in recent weeks as the Federal Reserve and other central banks introduced measures aimed at encouraging investment and bolstering economic growth. The German report reignited those fears. 
Stocks had risen strongly in recent weeks as traders anticipated, then received, help from the Fed in the form of an open-ended bond-buying program. The Fed will buy roughly $40 billion in mortgage bonds a month until the economy has improved.
''It's not unusual after big moves for the market to, in essence, go quiet and wait for the next catalyst,'' said Quincy Krosby, market strategist with Prudential Financial. The next catalyst, Ms. Krosby said, would be third-quarter earnings, which companies will begin to announce next month.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 20.55 points, or 0.15 percent, at 13,558.92. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 3.26, or 0.2 percent, to 1,459.89. Its two strongest groups were utilities and telecommunications, safer stocks that tend to do well in a weaker economy.
The Nasdaq composite index dropped 19.18 points, or 0.6 percent, to 3,160.78, dragged lower in part by Apple, whose sales of the new iPhone 5 failed to meet analysts' expectations, even though five million iPhones were sold in three days. Shares of Apple fell $9.30, or 1.3 percent, to $690.79.
Doug Cote, chief market strategist at ING Investment Management, said that if the recent weakness in manufacturing was any guide, traders would be disappointed next month by companies' quarterly financial results.
''It will be a sea change -- the first time in three years that we've had negative earnings growth,'' Mr. Cote said. He said China's abrupt economic slowdown was adding to corporate America's problems.
If that happens, Ms. Krosby said, it could drive the market lower. Without enough positive surprises from companies this quarter, the Fed program probably will not be enough to extend the rally, she said. ''There's an uneasy feeling surrounding the market,'' she said.
Traders are looking for more good news from the housing market, which appears to be bouncing back after being stuck in a rut for years. The latest data on new and pending home sales will be released later in the week.
Lennar on Monday became the latest builder to post surprisingly strong earnings. A rise in orders and the number of homes delivered, adding to a big tax benefit, had the Miami homebuilder quadrupling profits. KB Home on Friday did almost as well.
But on Monday, Lennar closed down 55 cents, or 1.5 percent, at $36.96. KB Home fell 63 cents, or 4.1 percent, to $14.63.
The UnitedHealth Group was down slightly on its first day in the Dow, which shuffled its lineup of stocks to reflect health care's growing importance in the economy. UnitedHealth, the nation's largest health insurer, replaces Kraft Foods in the Dow. Its stock fell 0.4 percent, to $55.98.
In the bond market, interest rates eased. The price of the 10-year Treasury note rose 11/32, to 99 6/32. Its yield fell to 1.72 percent from 1.76 percent late Friday.

HEADLINE: We Are the 96 Percent

BYLINE: By SUZANNE METTLER and JOHN SIDES. 
Suzanne Mettler is a professor of government at Cornell and John Sides is an associate professor of political science at George Washington University.

 BODY:
WHEN Mitt Romney told the guests at a fund-raiser in Florida in May that America is divided between people who pay no income taxes and depend on government and pretty much everyone else, he missed the deeper truth. It is not just that most of the 47 percent Mr. Romney talked about do pay payroll taxes and that many of them have paid income taxes in the past. The reality he glossed over is that nearly all Americans have used government social policies at some point in their lives. The beneficiaries include the rich and the poor, Democrats and Republicans. Almost everyone is both a maker and a taker.
We have unique data from a 2008 national survey by the Cornell Survey Research Institute that asked Americans whether they had ever taken advantage of any of 21 social policies provided by the federal government, from student loans to Medicare. These policies do not include government activity that benefits everyone -- national defense, the interstate highway system, food safety regulations -- but only tangible benefits that accrue to specific households. 
The survey asked about people's policy usage throughout their lives, not just at a moment in time, and it included questions about social policies embedded in the tax code, which are usually overlooked.
What the data reveal is striking: nearly all Americans -- 96 percent -- have relied on the federal government to assist them. Young adults, who are not yet eligible for many policies, account for most of the remaining 4 percent.
On average, people reported that they had used five social policies at some point in their lives. An individual typically had received two direct social benefits in the form of checks, goods or services paid for by government, like Social Security or unemployment insurance. Most had also benefited from three policies in which government's role was ''submerged,'' meaning that it was channeled through the tax code or private organizations, like the home mortgage-interest deduction and the tax-free status of the employer contribution to employees' health insurance. The design of these policies camouflages the fact that they are social benefits, too, just like the direct benefits that help Americans pay for housing, health care, retirement and college.
The use of government social policies cuts across partisan divides. Some policies were used more often by members of one party or the other. Republicans were more likely to have used the G.I. Bill and Social Security retirement and survivors' benefits, while more Democrats had taken advantage of Medicaid and unemployment insurance. Overall, 82 percent of Democrats and 64 percent of Republicans acknowledged receipt of at least one direct social benefit. More Republicans (92 percent) than Democrats (86 percent) had taken advantage of submerged policies. Once we take both types of policies into account, the seeming distinction between makers and takers vanishes: 97 percent of Republicans and 98 percent of Democrats report that they have used at least one government social policy.
The majority of individuals from households at every income level have used at least one direct social policy. Low-income people have used more of the direct policies than have the affluent: the average household with income under $10,000 per year used four of them, compared to only one by the households at $150,000 and above. But the proportions were reversed in the case of the submerged policies: wealthy families had typically used three of them, and the poor just one.
There were also few partisan differences in how long individuals had benefited. Among policies used by similar percentages of Democrats and Republicans, like the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit and tax credits for college tuition, members of both parties received the benefits for the same average amount of time. The same was true for policies that benefited one group of partisans more than the other. For example, although the mortgage-interest deduction was claimed by more Republicans and the earned-income tax credit by more Democrats, both claimed the benefits for two to five years on average. Similarly, Republicans who relied on the G.I. Bill did so for about as long as did Democrats who claimed unemployment insurance benefits.
Where Americans actually differ is in how they think about government's role in their lives. A major driving factor here is ideology: conservatives were less likely than liberals to respond affirmatively when asked if they had ever used a ''government social program,'' even when both subsequently acknowledged using the same number of specific policies.
These ideological differences were on display at the party conventions. When Gov. Chris Christie, Republican of New Jersey, noted that his father, who ''grew up in poverty,'' had used the G.I. Bill to become the first in his family to graduate from college, it was in the context of a speech criticizing our ''need to be coddled by big government.'' By contrast, Michelle Obama credited student loans with making her and her husband's college educations possible and then argued that ''when you've worked hard, and done well, and walked through that doorway of opportunity, you do not slam it shut behind you.''
Throughout our lives, almost all of us help sustain government social policies through our tax dollars and, at some point, almost all of us directly benefit from these policies. Because ideology influences how we view our own and others' use of government, Mr. Romney's remarks may resonate with those who think of themselves as ''producers'' rather than ''moochers'' -- to use Ayn Rand's distinction. But this distinction fails to capture the way Americans really experience government. Instead of dividing us, our experiences as both makers and takers ought to bind us in a community of shared sacrifice and mutual support.

HEADLINE: A Call for Caution on Antipsychotic Drugs

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. FRIEDMAN, M.D.. 
Dr. Richard A. Friedman is a professor of psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medical College in Manhattan.

 BODY:
You will never guess what the fifth and sixth best-selling prescription drugs are in the United States, so I'll just tell you: Abilify and Seroquel, two powerful antipsychotics. In 2011 alone, they and other antipsychotic drugs were prescribed to 3.1 million Americans at a cost of $18.2 billion, a 13 percent increase over the previous year, according to the market research firm IMS Health.
Those drugs are used to treat such serious psychiatric disorders as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and severe major depression. But the rates of these disorders have been stable in the adult population for years. So how did these and other antipsychotics get to be so popular?
Antipsychotic drugs have been around for a long time, but until recently they were not widely used. Thorazine, the first real antipsychotic, was synthesized in the 1950s; not just sedating, it also targeted the core symptoms of schizophrenia, like hallucinations and delusions. Later, it was discovered that antipsychotic drugs also had powerful mood-stabilizing effects, so they were used to treat bipolar disorder, too. 
Then, starting in 1993, came the so-called atypical antipsychotic drugs like Risperdal, Zyprexa, Seroquel, Geodon and Abilify. Today there are 10 of these drugs on the market, and they have generally fewer neurological side effects than the first-generation drugs.
Originally experts believed the new drugs were more effective than the older antipsychotics against such symptoms of schizophrenia as apathy, social withdrawal and cognitive deficits. But several recent large randomized studies, like the landmark Catie trial, failed to show that the new antipsychotics were any more effective or better tolerated than the older drugs.
This news was surprising to many psychiatrists -- and obviously very disappointing to the drug companies.
It was also soon discovered that the second-generation antipsychotic drugs had serious side effects of their own, namely a risk of increased blood sugar, elevated lipids and cholesterol, and weight gain. They can also cause a potentially irreversible movement disorder called tardive dyskinesia, though the risk is thought to be significantly lower than with the older antipsychotic drugs.
Nonetheless, there has been a vast expansion in the use of these second-generation antipsychotic drugs in patients of all ages, particularly young people. Until recently, these drugs were used to treat a few serious psychiatric disorders. But now, unbelievably, these powerful medications are prescribed for conditions as varied as very mild mood disorders, everyday anxiety, insomnia and even mild emotional discomfort.
The number of annual prescriptions for atypical antipsychotics rose to 54 million in 2011 from 28 million in 2001, an 93 percent increase, according to IMS Health. One study found that the use of these drugs for indications without federal approval more than doubled from 1995 to 2008.
The original target population for these drugs, patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, is actually quite small: The lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia is 1 percent, and that of bipolar disorder is around 1.5 percent. Drug companies have had a powerful economic incentive to explore other psychiatric uses and target populations for the newer antipsychotic drugs.
The companies initiated dozens of clinical trials to test these drugs against depression and, more recently, anxiety disorders. Starting in 2003, the makers of several second-generation antipsychotics (also known as atypical neuroleptics) have received F.D.A. approval for the use of these drugs in combination with antidepressants to treat severe depression, which they trumpeted in aggressive direct-to-consumer advertising campaigns.
The combined spending on print and digital media advertising for these new antipsychotic drugs increased to $2.4 billion in 2010, up from $1.3 billion in 2007, according to Kantar Media. Between 2007 and 2011, more than 98 percent of all advertising on atypical antipsychotics was spent on just two drugs: Abilify and Seroquel, the current best sellers.
There is little in these alluring advertisements to indicate that these are not simple antidepressants but powerful antipsychotics. A depressed female cartoon character says that before she starting taking Abilify, she was taking an antidepressant but still feeling down. Then, she says, her doctor suggested adding Abilify to her antidepressant, and, voilà, the gloom lifted.
The ad omits critical facts about depression that consumers would surely want to know. If a patient has not gotten better on an antidepressant, for instance, just taking it for a longer time or taking a higher dose could be very effective. There is also very strong evidence that adding a second antidepressant from a different chemical class is an effective and cheaper strategy -- without having to resort to antipsychotic medication.
A more recent and worrisome trend is the use of atypical antipsychotic drugs -- many of which are acutely sedating and calming -- to treat various forms of anxiety, like generalized anxiety disorder and even situational anxiety. A study last year found that 21.3 percent of visits to a psychiatrist for treatment of an anxiety disorder in 2007 resulted in a prescription for an antipsychotic, up from 10.6 percent in 1996. This is a disturbing finding in light of the fact that the data for the safety and efficacy of antipsychotic drugs in treating anxiety disorders is weak, to say nothing of the mountain of evidence that generalized anxiety disorder can be effectively treated with safer -- and cheaper -- drugs like S.S.R.I. antidepressants.
There are a small number of controlled clinical trials of antipsychotic drugs in generalized anxiety or social anxiety that have shown either no effect or inconsistent results. As a consequence, there is no F.D.A.-approved use of an atypical antipsychotic for any anxiety disorder.
Yet I and many of my colleagues have seen dozens of patients with nothing more than everyday anxiety or insomnia who were given prescriptions for antipsychotic medications. Few of these patients were aware of the potential long-term risks of these drugs.
The increasing use of atypical antipsychotics by physicians to treat anxiety suggests that doctors view these medications as safer alternatives to the potentially habit-forming anti-anxiety benzodiazepines like Valium and Klonopin. And since antipsychotics have rapid effects, clinicians may prefer them to first-line treatments like S.S.R.I. antidepressants, which can take several weeks to work.
Of course, physicians frequently use medications off label, and there is sometimes solid empirical evidence to support this practice. But presently there is little evidence that atypical antipsychotic drugs are effective outside of a small number of serious psychiatric disorders, namely schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and treatment-resistant depression.
Let's be clear: The new atypical antipsychotic drugs are effective and safe. But even if these drugs prove effective for a variety of new psychiatric illnesses, there is still good reason for caution. Because they have potentially serious adverse effects, atypical antipsychotic drugs should be used when currently available treatments -- with typically fewer side effects and lower costs -- have failed.
Atypical antipsychotics can be lifesaving for people who have schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or severe depression. But patients should think twice -- and then some -- before using these drugs to deal with the low-grade unhappiness, anxiety and insomnia that comes with modern life.

HEADLINE: Romney And the Forbes 400

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
Last week, sandwiched between Monday's leak of the video in which Mitt Romney dismissed ''the 47 percent'' and Friday's release of the Romneys' 2011 tax returns -- showing that they had paid an effective tax rate of 14 percent -- Forbes magazine published its annual list of the 400 wealthiest Americans.
There weren't a lot of surprises on the Forbes 400. Bill Gates, with an estimated net worth of $66 billion, remains the wealthiest man in the country. He is a whopping $20 billion richer than his pal Warren Buffett, who came in at No. 2, according to Forbes. All the usual suspects were there: Michael Bloomberg; George Soros; the Koch brothers; various descendants of Sam Walton, the founder of Walmart; and on and on. 
What was illuminating was not so much who was on the list but what they collectively told us about the state of the richest of the rich. Thirty years ago, when Forbes published its first Forbes 400, a net worth of $75 million would get you on the list. Today it takes $1.1 billion. In the last year alone, the cumulative net worth of the wealthiest 400 people, by Forbes's calculation, rose by $200 billion. That compares with a 4 percent drop in median household income last year, according to the Census Bureau. One would be hard pressed to find a clearer example of how powerfully income inequality has taken root.
Like Romney, Forbes magazine is a little defensive about this -- and, like Romney, Forbes has adopted a self-justifying narrative. Luisa Kroll, one of the magazine's ''wealth editors,'' nods toward ''concerns'' about income inequality in her introduction to the list, but she goes on to write that ''a deeper analysis instills confidence that the American dream is still very much alive.'' In fact, it does nothing of the sort.
The fundamental reason the Romneys pay so little in taxes is that the bulk of their income comes from investments and thus is taxed at the capital gains rate of 15 percent. Although Romney himself isn't close to being rich enough to join the Forbes 400, his reliance on capital gains is a trait he shares with most of the ultrawealthy. It is the thread that ties together the Forbes 400.
Financiers, who make up a large percentage of the Forbes 400, long ago found ways to convert their compensation to capital gains, for instance. Romney, of course, did the same thing when he was running Bain Capital, a private equity firm. But even those who are not on Wall Street rely on capital gains. A large number of the Forbes 400 -- ''roughly 40 percent,'' according to a group called United for a Fair Economy -- inherited their wealth. Many others on the list -- people who started companies that they've since left -- are classified by Forbes as investors.
Even many of the corporate executives on the Forbes 400 are likely paying a lower tax rate. Many of them get minimal cash compensation and rely on stock options for the bulk of their wealth. Or they maneuver to take their companies through a leveraged buyout, which reaps them huge potential capital gains. In 2009, according to recent Congressional testimony by Leonard E. Burman, a professor at Syracuse University, the 400 highest-income taxpayers reaped an astounding 16 percent of all capital gains.
All of which would be justifiable if the country got some benefit in return. On ''60 Minutes'' Sunday night, when Romney was asked about the justification for his low tax rate, he said what most conservatives say, that a low capital gains rate is ''the right way to encourage economic growth, to get people to invest, to start businesses, to put people to work.''
This is also what Forbes means when it links its list to ''the American dream.'' Except that there is no evidence that it's true. In 1986, when Ronald Reagan was president, the differential between capital gains and ordinary income was eliminated -- and the economy soared. The capital gains rate was higher during the Bill Clinton years than in the George W. Bush years, yet the economy did better under Clinton than under Bush.
In the printed copy of his Congressional testimony, Burman has a chart that plots the ups and downs of the economy since the 1950s with changes in the capital gains rate. There is no correlation between the two. The idea that a lower capital gains rate spurs economic growth is one of the enduring myths of conservative thought.
The American dream exists not because of the capital gains differential but in spite of it. It is the tax break that most glaringly exists to benefit the wealthy. If you have any doubts about that, all you need to do is read the latest Forbes 400.

HEADLINE: At Carnegie, Ripples of a Chicago Strike

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
Opening night at Carnegie Hall is one of the biggest musical events of the season, and this year the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and its star music director, Riccardo Muti, received the plum assignment.
Now that luster may fade to black: the orchestra musicians have gone on strike. It is another labor action, though a more rarefied one, in Chicago, where 26,000 teachers recently walked off the job.
The 101 orchestra players, whose contract expired on Sept. 16, ''withheld their services,'' to use an industry term, on Saturday, hours before a concert, in a dispute over wages and health insurance costs at one of the richest and most successful orchestras in the country. Both sides had agreed to negotiate while the players worked, but talks broke down. 
A negotiating session was scheduled for Monday afternoon. Rehearsals were to begin on Tuesday, ahead of concerts on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday; the Symphony Ball gala on Saturday; and the Carnegie concerts on Oct. 3, 4 and 5.
Clive Gillinson, Carnegie's executive and artistic director, said in an interview that the strike had caught him by surprise. He said he would be in daily contact with Chicago's management before deciding what to do.
''You don't cancel opening night,'' he said. ''You've got to find a way of making it happen.'' He declined to discuss contingency plans.
The musicians' committee denied that the timing of the strike, less than two weeks before a major New York appearance, was designed to maximize pressure on management.
''There's never a good time,'' said Stephen Lester, the chairman of the orchestra committee and a double bassist. ''Our concern is to get back to work and to play the concerts ahead of us, and that includes Carnegie Hall.''
Deborah Rutter, the orchestra's president, declined to speculate on the timing but said missing Carnegie would be ''extraordinarily unfortunate.''
The work stoppage is the most visible event in a season of discontent on the orchestra labor front. Musicians of the Atlanta Symphony have been locked out. Contracts at the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra and the Minnesota Orchestra expire on Sunday, and management and musicians are far apart in both cases. The Indianapolis Symphony, where the contract expired on Sept. 3, canceled the first two weeks of its season amid a bitter dispute.
While each circumstance is different, orchestras' managements are generally trying to reduce salaries or hold the line on raises and cut the costs of benefits, citing a dip in donations and lower yield from endowments because of the recession. They say the survival of the orchestras is on the line.
The musicians argue that cutting compensation would damage artistic quality and that managements should do more to raise money and reduce administrative costs. Some also argue that managements are capitalizing on what they say is an anti-union mood in the country.
In Chicago the situation is somewhat different. The orchestra is coming off record fund-raising years but is still reporting modest deficits. The players have long had among the best orchestra salaries and benefits in the country. They make a minimum of $144,820 a year, as well as extra payments and overtime. Principals can make far more, bringing the average to $173,000, management said. Management's last offer would have brought the base to $151,320 over three years.
The musicians argue that increased medical costs to them in the management proposal would erase salary increases in many cases, a claim that Ms. Rutter denies. They also say that the pay offer would put them second to the highest-paid orchestra, the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Such erosion in salaries, Mr. Lester says, would ultimately put the orchestra's artistic quality at risk.
''Any arts organization that takes steps backward admits that we want to be pretty good, but we don't want to be as good as things used to be,'' he said. ''How can you raise money with that?''
Ms. Rutter argues that salaries and benefits simply cannot rise at the rates they have. ''The real issue here,'' she said, ''is to make sure our organization is healthy over the long term.''

HEADLINE: Why Romney Is Slipping

 BODY:
Mitt Romney said in an interview aired on Sunday that his campaign ''doesn't need a turnaround.'' He told CBS News's ''60 Minutes'' that he is tied with President Obama; he has a ''very effective campaign; it's doing a very good job;'' and all he needs to do to win is keep repeating his plan to restore economic freedom. 
That's an outright denial of political reality, but Mr. Romney's willingness to stray from the truth is at the root of what's really going on. His campaign has been losing ground since the two political conventions. All the reliable national polls now show Mr. Obama ahead, and in two cases substantially so -- beyond the margin of error. A variety of polls also shows Mr. Obama with growing leads in most of the important swing states.
To some extent, Mr. Romney's diminishing stature is because of two recent statements that revealed his deficiencies to a newly interested audience. He falsely suggested that the Obama administration was sympathetic to the violent Muslim protests in Libya and Egypt, illustrating his ignorant and opportunistic critique of foreign policy. And he was caught on video belittling nearly half the country for an overreliance on government handouts.
These moments, though, were not fumbles or gaffes. They were entirely consistent with the dismissive attitude Mr. Romney has routinely shown toward non-Americans or the nonrich. Now even long-undecided voters are starting to catch on and dismiss him.
In Wisconsin, for example, a hotly contested state that has veered Republican in recent elections, Mr. Obama leads Mr. Romney by 17 points when voters are asked who cares about their needs and problems, according to a Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS News poll published last week of likely voters. The poll found that only 10 percent of voters said his policies would favor the middle class. (This poll was taken before the video showing his disdain for 47 percent of the country.)
Voters don't react positively when a candidate speaks incomprehensibly about taxes, as Mr. Romney did on ''60 Minutes.'' He said he would lower everyone's tax rate by 20 percent but that everyone would wind up paying essentially the same taxes because he would limit unspecified deductions and exemptions. Even on its face, that makes little sense. If everyone will pay the same taxes, how does that stimulate growth or reduce unfairness? In fact, tax experts say the rate cut is such a huge benefit for the rich that it can't be balanced by curbing their deductions. But listeners don't have to do the math to calculate how fundamentally hollow the proposal is.
Asked about the government's responsibility to the 50 million Americans without health insurance, Mr. Romney said they already have access to health care: in emergency rooms. That, of course, is the most expensive and least effective way of providing care, as someone who once advocated universal care has reason to know. But it also reeks of contempt for those left behind by the current insurance system, suggesting that they must suffer with illness until the point where they need an ambulance.
Mr. Romney is free to pursue this shallow, cavalier campaign for six more weeks, but he shouldn't be surprised if voters increasingly choose not to pay attention.

HEADLINE: Cowboys Vs. the Mob In Las Vegas Of the '60s

BYLINE: By MIKE HALE

 BODY:
It's a tight race, but my vote for the drabbest and least informative title among the new fall television shows goes to CBS's ''Vegas'' over some tough competition, including ''Arrow,'' ''Revolution,'' ''Elementary,'' ''Partners'' and ''Nashville,'' which is at least the entire name of a city.
(I imagine a conversation in which a development executive asks, ''Wasn't there a show on a different network, not too long ago, called 'Las Vegas'?,'' and another answers, ''It's O.K., we're dropping the 'Las.' '') 
In some ways the title doesn't do justice to the show, which has an amusing premise -- cowboys versus mobsters, or ''High Noon'' meets ''The Godfather,'' with chorus girls -- and a high-class actor, the often underrated veteran Dennis Quaid, making his debut as a TV series star.
In another way, however, the title fits, because beneath the period details and despite a cast that includes Michael Chiklis, Carrie-Anne Moss and Jason O'Mara, ''Vegas'' is something profoundly ordinary: a CBS crime procedural, with all the professionalism and limited ambition that tends to imply.
The pilot on Tuesday gets off to a brisk start, with Mr. Quaid on horseback charging across the dusty runways of the Las Vegas airport in 1960, running down the plane that has spooked his cattle. He's a rancher and a former military policeman, and his character is based -- extremely loosely, you would guess -- on Ralph Lamb, who was sheriff of Clark County, Nev., through the 1960s and '70s.
The hardheaded fictional Lamb gets into a dust-up with some airport employees and catches the eye of a Chicago mobster, Vincent Savino (Mr. Chiklis), who's just debarked from the plane and is on his way into town to capture as big a share of the new casino action as he can.
It's an elegant, economical opening that sets up the show's battle lines: the cowboy sheriff will fight the city-slick gangster, as well as corrupt officials and greedy businessmen, for Las Vegas's soul. There's an element of romantic fatalism, since Lamb appears to be against development in general -- he just wants to get back to his ranch -- and we know how that will work out.
Of course, he still needs to be named sheriff, a formality the show accomplishes by the end of the first episode. A relative of the governor is murdered, and the mayor (Michael O'Neill), looking for someone he can trust, enlists Lamb to help with the investigation. During the entirely routine, inconsequential case, we're introduced to the rest of the cast that will help Lamb solve future whodunits: his rancher brother (Mr. O'Mara) and son (Taylor Handley), and a female prosecutor (Ms. Moss of the ''Matrix'' films) who feels out of place in this frontier tale but looks great in snug wool suits.
Lamb moves across a colorful landscape of location desert scenery and soundstage re-creations of casinos and the old Fremont Street gambling strip in downtown Las Vegas. It's fun to look at, as are the costumes and the vintage cars and airplanes. A scene in which Lamb and his brother track down Lamb's son (just before an angry husband takes a potshot at him) is jolting for its view of a spanking-new cookie-cutter subdivision.
It's all just window dressing on a standard crime drama, however, and while the pilot sets up running story lines involving the gangster and the officials he controls, they feel squeezed and a little perfunctory. It's the CBS quality-control bargain: ''Vegas'' won't be a wreck like NBC's ''Playboy Club'' last season (to pick another show that tried to capitalize on a swinging 1960s backdrop), but the chances that its storytelling will be out of the ordinary are reduced.
The weight of making ''Vegas'' into something distinctive is probably on Mr. Quaid: can he prosper in the latter-day Bat Masterson role the way Timothy Olyphant has in FX's ''Justified,'' and Robert Taylor has in A&E's ''Longmire''? It's hard to tell from one episode -- Lamb mostly comes across as uptight, marked by an unsettling squint.
But I wouldn't bet against Mr. Quaid's relaxing into the role and turning in one of the more watchable performances of the new season, even if he is playing just another TV detective.

HEADLINE: Visionary Entrepreneurs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
David Brooks's argument in ''Temerity at the Top'' (column, Sept. 21) that ''prosperity is often driven by small enclaves of extraordinary individuals that build new industries and amass large fortunes'' sounds attractive, but is facile and isn't supported by history. 
The period dominated by Carnegie, Rockefeller, Ford and Edison was not marked by great prosperity for everyone. On the contrary, our greatest economic expansion occurred after World War II, when there were few like them.
Of course, the fact that we were the only industrial country not devastated by the war had a lot to do with it, but it was the rise of the labor movement and our tax policies that ensured that the benefits of our favorable economic position were distributed across the expanding middle class and did not simply accrue to those ''enclaves of extraordinary individuals.''
STEVE GOLDMAN New York, Sept. 21, 2012
To the Editor:
David Brooks is right that this country can use more visionary entrepreneurs. The fallacy is in thinking that lowering tax rates at the top will generate such people. Do you really think that slightly greater take-home pay is what motivates Elon Musk of Zip2, PayPal, Everdream, SpaceX and Tesla fame?

HEADLINE: After U.S. Inquiries, Discover Agrees to Refund Some Credit Protection Fees

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Discover Financial Services has agreed to pay $200 million in refunds to more than 3.5 million cardholders who bought credit protection services over the phone, plus an additional $14 million in civil penalties to banking regulators.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation jointly investigated Discover over deceptive telemarketing and sales practices, including misleading customers into thinking the services, like identity theft protection and credit score tracking, were free. 
While neither admitting nor denying the allegations, Discover agreed to not engage in similar acts in the future and to fully inform potential customers of all of the costs and conditions of telemarketed or otherwise advertised products and services. The company also agreed to strengthen its compliance and audit programs.
The agencies said that from December 2007 through August 2011, Discover marketed the products, which included payment protection and wallet protection services, to its credit card customers by implying that they were being offered a free benefit rather than having to pay for a service.
Discover billed the fees for the services directly to the customers' credit cards.
Those actions violated Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and portions of the Consumer Financial Protection Act, which was part of the Dodd-Frank financial regulation law enacted in response to the financial crisis. The F.D.I.C. also charged Discover with engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices.
The enforcement action is the second by the consumer bureau since it started in July 2011. The bureau and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in July jointly charged Capital One, the bank and credit card company, with similar deceptive practices. Capital One agreed to pay a total of $150 million in customer refunds and $60 million in fines to the two regulators.
Richard Cordray, the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said that the agency expected that more such enforcement actions would follow. ''We are signaling as clearly as we can that other financial institutions should review their marketing practices to ensure that they are not deceiving or misleading consumers into purchasing financial products or services,'' he said.
David W. Nelms, chairman and chief executive of Discover, said in a statement: ''We have worked hard to earn the loyalty of our card members and we are committed to marketing our products responsibly. As always, we will continue to strive to deliver the highest standards of customer service and satisfaction.''
Discover announced the enforcement action and tentative settlement on Friday afternoon, and the consent order was approved by the agencies Monday.
Current and former Discover customers will not have to take any action to receive the refunds, the regulatory agencies said. Current cardholders will receive a refund directly to their account, and former cardholders will receive a check or have any outstanding balance reduced by the amount of the refund.
The amounts of the refunds will depend on when customers purchased and how long they held the included products, the agencies said. Customers who were enrolled in a product for less than one year will receive the total amount of product fees charged, while those enrolled for more than one year will receive 90 days of fees. Only those customers who were charged for the services but did not use them are eligible.
The agencies said that Discover sold the products to about 4.7 million customers; about 3.5 million of those are eligible for refunds.
Regulators said that Discover customers were charged $9.99 a month for identity theft protection, $7.99 a month for credit score tracking and $2.99 per month for wallet protection. The debt payment protection service was priced at 89 cents per $100 of credit card debt, the agencies said.

HEADLINE: Mayor's Tale of Recovery Hasn't Been Reality for Some

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL. 
E-mail: powellm@nytimes.com; Twitter: @powellnyt

 BODY:
''Four years ago, New York City was the epicenter of the financial collapse. But since then -- despite being burdened with huge job losses on Wall Street -- we have been the epicenter of the national economic recovery.''
-- Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, in a speech to the Economic Club of Washington, D.C., this month. 
New York's leaders and titans are a wonderfully self-congratulatory lot. To listen to them and watch their posturing, you might guess that the recession was a summer thunderhead long ago blown out to sea.
There's the ubiquitous Bruce C. Ratner, the developer who convinced New Yorkers to deeply subsidize his new luxury arena in Downtown Brooklyn without so far having produced a single apartment of the affordable housing he promised. He draws loud cheers from the artisanal-cheese-munching, Russian-oligarch-digging, Jay-Z-loving, ''Please, please boost my property values'' set.
There are the college presidents, of Cornell and New York University and Columbia, competitive men about town who find themselves in a gold rush as they attempt to turn the East Village, Roosevelt Island and West Harlem into dormitories with sidewalks.
And there is, of course, our mayor, a billionaire of rapidly appreciating net worth, who felt compelled to travel to Washington to lecture Democrat and Republican alike on why they need to pay closer heed to New York City, where jobs flow like vintage cabernet.
The mayor's claims would come as a revelation to Stephanie Rosario, 20, and Woodeleine Beaujour, 19, two young women strolling down Newkirk Avenue in Flatbush, Brooklyn, on Sunday. They appeared well shielded from the bright light of our economic miracle.
Ms. Rosario offers the personal economics of headache. She has a two-year college degree and works as a day care teacher in Park Slope, earning a touch over $8 an hour -- poverty wages -- with no sick days. If a little darling gives her the flu? Put up with it or go without pay. (A majority on the City Council favor a bill to mandate sick leave for New Yorkers. But Christine C. Quinn, the Council speaker, a former tenant organizer intent on becoming mayor, is keeping that bit of annoyance to business interests under lock and key).
Ms. Beaujour, 19, works at a pharmacy; the mathematics of her life differ little from Ms. Rosario's.
Neither woman is a class warrior. They would rather have a condo than a revolution. They speak of lives without dinners out; they listen to Jay-Z on iPods, not in person. ''I've been at the day care center a year, and no one is talking about raises,'' says Ms. Rosario, whose smile is broad.
As a raft of data washed through the city last week, it became clear that their lives resemble those of growing millions of New Yorkers, for whom the city economy is a floor collapsing.
Fully 21 percent live below the poverty line; median income declined in nearly every group; 1.8 million New Yorkers now rely on food stamps.
Manhattan offers a sub-Saharan level of income inequality. As my colleague Sam Roberts has noted, it has the second biggest income gap of any county in the nation, with the top fifth of earners (with a median income of $371,754) making more than 40 times as much as the bottom fifth ($9,845).
The Bronx, with 1.4 million people, has an unemployment rate north of 13 percent, as does Brooklyn. Those are the worst rates in the entire state.
As for the mayor's claim that New York has turned itself around on smarts and gumption? It's certainly true that the mayor and city officials have labored hard to diversify the economy.
But the larger bootstrap narrative is a fantasy told around a City Hall camp fire.
In the worst, howling days of the Great Recession, the city survived because Washington turned it into a Keynesian love child. The Fed and Congress pumped billions upon billions of federal bailout dollars into banks and finance houses and hedge funds.
New York officials, too, had the wisdom to scoop up stimulus dollars. Mr. Ratner may have so far failed to make good on his sugarplum promises, but the city continues to build affordable housing in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, thanks to these dollars. If the Second Avenue subway someday rumbles, the mayor may bow deeply toward Washington and President Obama, whose stimulus will help finish the job.
Back in Flatbush, Ms. Beaujour carefully plans her life. She wants to become a nurse, not the least because it is the relatively rare job in New York that provides health benefits. ''Life is really, really tight,'' she says. ''You have to think about it.''
Her words perhaps resonate truer and deeper than the boasts of a mayor sweetly in love with his own fables.

HEADLINE: Polls Show Movement Of Boomers To Obama

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP

 BODY:
Mitt Romney has just come off a couple of rough news weeks in his quest for the presidency, but if Clyde Tennyson, 62, of Hampton, Va., is as typical of the baby boom generation as polling data seem to suggest, there is more bad news to come.
Mr. Tennyson, a designer at the shipyard in nearby Newport News, voted for Senator John McCain in the 2008 presidential election. In that election, the boomers split their vote down the middle, giving Mr. McCain and Barack Obama 49 percent each. 
This time, Mr. Tennyson says he's voting for President Obama, a shift that a sizable number of his fellow boomers are making, according to recent polling data.
He's angry about the Republicans' talk of changing Medicare from government sponsored to a private voucher program. Though Mr. Romney swears it's not so, Mr. Tennyson also fears that the Republicans will alter Social Security. ''I'm going to need Medicare and so are my kids,'' said Mr. Tennyson, who has three children ages 29 to 39. ''I've been paying money into Social Security the last 40 years, and it's all I'm going to have to retire on -- I don't want to hear a word about privatization. Not Medicare, not Social Security.''
Mr. Tennyson is one of the 78 million Americans born between 1946 and 1964, known as the baby boom generation. In the most recent New York Times/CBS News poll, likely voters in roughly that age group favored Mr. Obama by 9 percentage points. In a Pew Research Center poll of likely voters, Mr. Obama is ahead, 50 to 44 percent, within that age group.
''This is a significant change, and that generation's vote counts for a lot,'' said Scott Keeter, director of survey research for Pew. The boomers, who range in age from 48 to 66, account for 37 percent of all voters, according to Pew. Generation X -- roughly 31 to 46 -- makes up 26 percent. The youngest voters, ages 18 to 30, and the oldest, over 65, make up 17 percent each.
The apparent shift could be offset by a softer level of support for Mr. Obama among the youngest voters, in the 18-to-29 age group, of whom 66 percent went for him in 2008, and potentially lower turnout.
What is moving the baby boom voters? It may be Medicare.
On Friday, at the AARP convention in New Orleans, the Republican vice presidential candidate Paul D. Ryan was widely booed when he mentioned repealing ''Obamacare'' and privatizing Medicare.
The Great Recession had a major impact just as the older boomers were approaching retirement. The typical household income for those 55 to 64 has dropped nearly 10 percent since the recession, to $55,748 from $61,716, the biggest decrease of any age group.
Lark McDonald, 51, who owns a small business in the Denver area, says he voted for Mr. McCain last time, and usually votes a straight Republican ticket, but is leaning toward Mr. Obama. He worries that the Republicans are moving too far right, he said, but he is also concerned they will dismantle the Obama health care program and make major changes in Medicare. ''I take care of my father's medical issues,'' he said. ''He relies on Medicare, and if we go to a voucher system, it will make everything harder to do.''
According to the Pew poll, 69 percent of boomers say Medicare is ''very important'' to their vote, which is surpassed only by those 65 and older. Also, 54 percent of likely voters in that age group, according to the Times/CBS News poll, believe that Mr. Obama is doing a better job of handling Medicare, compared with 42 percent for Mr. Romney.
And 30 percent ''strongly approve'' of the president's health care program, the most of any age group.
In the last election, Howard Litvack, 53, a finance manager of a car dealership in Franklin, Tenn., backed Ralph Nader, as a protest vote. This time, he says, he's voting for Mr. Obama. ''It's more important this time to have my vote count,'' he said. ''There's more at stake.''
He is particularly concerned about the Republicans' proposal for privatizing Medicare, which would apply to people under 55, including him. ''It absolutely plays into this,'' Mr. Litvack said. ''I'm interested in how this will affect me, and believe me, it will affect me negatively.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Coulda Been Worse

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Given that it was terrible. 

 BODY:
Josh Lehner does something I've been meaning to do: he compares US economic performance since the financial crisis with other episodes of major financial crisis. And guess what? We actually look better than most (sorry about the small print):
This comparison actually tells us quite a lot.
First of all, it makes immediate nonsense of the talking point that Obama must be doing terrible damage to our economy by threatening universal health care, or looking at businessmen funny, or something. Listening not just to Republican politicians but to a fair number of credentialed economists, you'd think that our protracted economic weakness is a puzzle to be explained - and that it somehow must reflect the alleged leftist tilt of the current administration. In fact, however, protracted weakness is normal after a big financial crisis, and if anything we're doing better than average, probably thanks to fiscal and monetary stimulus.
That said, we should have done even better: if stimulus works, and the evidence says that it does, we should have done more, and made the slump even shorter and shallower.
In this context, look at Japan. People always ask whether we'll do as badly as Japan; so far, at least, we're doing far worse. I think you can make a good case that Japan was highly effective in its use of fiscal stimulus to limit the damage from financial crisis; where it failed was in not pursuing expansionary monetary policy during the good years to lift itself out of deflation.
So thanks to Josh Lehner for this. The truth about our crisis is not what everyone says.

HEADLINE: Antibiotic Prescription? It May Depend on Where You Live

BYLINE: ANAHAD O'CONNOR


HIGHLIGHT: Older men and women in the South are more often prescribed antibiotics than older Americans elsewhere, suggesting greater rates of antibiotic overuse in that part of the country. 

 BODY:
A new study has found that older men and women in the South are more often prescribed antibiotics than older Americans elsewhere, even though there is no evidence that the South has higher rates of pneumonia and other diseases for which antibiotics are necessary. The findings suggest there are greater rates of antibiotic overuse in that part of the country. 
Many experts have expressed concerns that antibiotics are being overprescribed and overused, leading to unnecessary spending on prescription medicines as well as more widespread bacterial resistance to the drugs. In the elderly, who are more likely to suffer adverse side effects and reactions from antibiotics, the health consequences can be amplified. 
Despite this vulnerability, antibiotic use among seniors has not been as closely studied as it has been among younger Americans. So a team of researchers looked at prescribing patterns among men and women over 65 across the country, comparing rates over a period of several years and doing breakdowns quarterly. Their research, published in Archives of Internal Medicine, showed that during a typical three-month period, about 21.4 percent of older Americans in the South used an antibiotic, compared with about 17.4 percent in the West. The rate in the Midwest was 19.2 percent, and in the Northeast it was 18.2 percent.
The researchers adjusted their findings for health status, demographics, insurance coverage and other differences that could have influenced the findings. Even after controlling for these variables, the rate in the South remained higher. The study was not designed to determine specifically whether antibiotics in the South are overprescribed, but the data point to overuse as a likely explanation, said Dr. Yuting Zhang, an author of the study and assistant professor of health economics at the University of Pittsburgh. 
"We don't know the exact reason," she said, "but what we can say is that antibiotic use is higher in the South, and this is consistent with previous research that shows the quality of prescribing is poorer in the South compared to other regions."
Dr. Zhang and her colleagues found that there were also seasonal variations in antibiotic use. Regardless of region, antibiotic prescription rates tended to peak in the first quarter of the year, from January through March, and then drop to a nadir during the third quarter, from July through September. The seasonal peak is probably related to the rise in respiratory infections during the winter months, Dr. Zhang said. But since many people are infected by cold and flu in the winter months and these viral infections are not susceptible to antibiotics, the seasonal trends may reflect further evidence of poor prescribing patterns.
The findings were based on Medicare data collected from the beginning of 2007 through the end of 2009. The data was based on about one million patients per year. 
Though antibiotic overuse remains common in all areas, one lesson from the findings is that it may be worthwhile to target the South with programs aimed at reducing unnecessary antibiotic use, Dr. Zhang and her colleagues noted, using rates in low-prescribing areas like the West as a goal. 
An accompanying editorial from public health experts went further, calling the persistence of antibiotic overprescribing "a failure to translate national public health priorities and evidence into local practice and policies."
"We need to find better ways to compel individuals and organizations to address the significance of the problem of antibiotic overuse," they wrote. "Strategies to achieve transformation at these levels may need to differ substantially from the current educational approaches that have been in use among patients and clinicians thus far."

HEADLINE: Comparing the Job Losses in Financial Crises

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: When shown alongside the track records of other financial crises, the American job losses caused by the recent financial crisis don't look so terrible. 

 BODY:
For a while I was regularly updating a chart each month showing how far employment plummeted in the latest recession and how little ground has been recovered since the recovery began in June 2009. Compared with other recent recessions and recoveries, the last few years have looked especially disastrous:
But that may be the wrong comparison to make.
As the Harvard economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff have written, financial crises are always especially disastrous. Over the course of a dozen financial crises in developed and developing countries going back to the Great Depression, the unemployment rate rose an average of 7 percentage points over 4.8 years, they found.
And actually, when shown alongside the track records of other financial crises, the American job losses caused by the recent financial crisis don't look quite as horrifying:
The chart above was put together by Josh Lehner, an economist for the state of Oregon. The red line shows the change in employment since December 2007, when the most recent recession officially began.
As you can see, drastic as American job losses have been in recent years, they were far worse and lasted much longer in the aftermath of the financial crises that struck, for example, Finland and Sweden in 1991 and Spain in 1977, not to mention the United States during the Great Depression.
Looking at unemployment rates (which refer to the share of people who want to work but can't find jobs, as opposed to just the total number of jobs) also shows that things in the United States could have been much worse:
In the United States, the unemployment rate rose from an average of 4.5 percent in the year before the crisis to a peak of 10 percent. In other words, the jobless rate more than doubled. After previous financial crises, however, some countries saw their unemployment rates triple, quadruple, even quintuple.
It's not clear why the United States came out of this financial crisis relatively less scathed than history might predict.
Mr. Lehner attributes this to "the coordinated global response to the immediate crises in late 2008 and early 2009," referring to both monetary and fiscal stimulus. He notes that the United States and the global economy had been tracking the path of the Great Depression in 2008-9, until we saw a number of major government interventions kick in.

HEADLINE: Oil and Nature: A Landscape Reconfigured

BYLINE: EMMA BRYCE


HIGHLIGHT: An exhibition at the Aperture Gallery explores how the petrochemical industry has reshaped the Mississippi River Corridor in Louisiana. 

 BODY:
In the stark white space of the Aperture Gallery in Chelsea, billboard-size photographs present an array of haunting scenes. A chemical plant with a cemetery in the foreground. An empty basketball court alongside a turreted oil refinery. A lush swamp filled with trees, one of which has a Shell Oil sign nailed to it.
The exhibition, "Petrochemical America," and an accompanying book of the same title are the product of a collaboration between the photographer Richard Misrach and the landscape architect Kate Orff, an assistant professor at Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. Together, they chronicle the history and the environmental and social impacts of the petrochemical industry in the Mississippi River Corridor in Louisiana, between Baton Rouge and New Orleans.
Louisiana has the highest density of oil and gas operations in the Western Hemisphere, partly as a result of tax policies favorable to the industry, Mr. Misrach and Ms. Orff relate. Many of them are clustered in economically disadvantaged areas. With Mr. Misrach's photographs and Ms. Orff's "throughlines" - explanatory displays that collate data, maps and images to tell a story - the two make the case that petrochemicals have irrevocably shaped the region and the nation and are deeply embedded in American culture. 
"No where else in the world is there such a juxtaposition of everyday life and the enormous scale of this industry," Ms. Orff said in an interview.

While oil refineries dot the the banks of the Mississippi in the corridor -- known to some as Cancer Alley -- the bulk of the industry revolves around chemical plants that feed off the network of pipes funneling gas and oil from the Gulf of Mexico. Since the 1930's, one photo caption explains, roughly 26,000 miles of pipeline have been threaded through southern coastal wetlands. (Roughly 40 percent of the nation's wetlands lie in Louisiana.) This intermingling of nature and industry is a theme that wends its way through the show.
A man fishes at nighttime as a gargantuan light-spangled oil tanker drifts by; plants flourish along the river's banks as a refinery looms in the background. Between the photographs, Ms. Orff presents explanatory markers about oil reserves in the gulf, the spread of oil rigs and pipelines and how gas is refined into isolated chemicals. 
"I think Americans think oil and gasoline is what we put in our gas tanks," she said. "But a huge part of the picture" is "disposable waste."
Her throughlines also delve into social impacts like the displacement of poorer communities as the petrochemical industry advanced through the region. Inhabitants of towns with forgotten names -- Reveilletown, Sunrise, Morrisonville -- were relocated either as industries moved in or as environmental contamination intensified. 
Ultimately the illustrations paired with the photographs forge a connection between crude oil and everyday modern products like plastics, paint, cleaning liquids, clothing and even the thickening agents in milkshakes.
Ms. Orff views Mr. Misrach's photograph of a shopping cart abandoned in an empty parking lot. as a kind of end point for the book. For her, it evokes a generic quality that has taken hold in the American landscape as consumerism has become entwined with a reliance on oils and chemicals. 
"We're all landscape architects even if it's by default, because we have made and remade the landscape in the last 100 years, in this era of big oil," she said.
While the notion of damage wrought by petrochemicals and the chain of consumption is not a new one, it gains potency with images of swamps fenced off as toxic waste sites and maps depicting the spread of dead zones as channels dug for oil pipes funnel saltwater into freshwater wetland systems. 
Ms. Orff will be at the gallery (547 West 27th Street, Chelsea) on Tuesday evening for a panel discussion that begins at 6:30. The exhibition runs through Oct. 6.

HEADLINE: La Vida Latina: Celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month With The New York Times

BYLINE: ANNISSA HAMBOUZ and MICHAEL GONCHAR


HIGHLIGHT: Ideas for teaching with Times articles, photos, videos and infographics about the ways, large and small, that Hispanic Americans have helped shape the United States. 

 BODY:
To celebrate National Hispanic Heritage Month, which started on Sept. 15 and ends on Oct. 15, we've gathered together some of our favorite articles and resources in The Times that celebrate the contributions and cultures of Hispanic-Americans.
In curating our selection, we tried to emphasize both the famous alongside the not-so-famous. We were excited when we discovered inspiring neighborhood stories as much as coverage of nationally recognized leaders. So, below you will find both Justice Sonia Sotomayor's seminal lecture "A Latina Judge's Voice" and a video about what it means to be Garifuna in the United States.
Our intention is to help show, in ways large and small, how Hispanic-Americans have helped shape the United States and make it into the diverse and dynamic nation it is today.

We invite you to share any additional resources you recommend in your comments below.
 Ways to Celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month With Your Students 
 1. Learn about famous Hispanic or Latino Americans. Research notable figures, past and present, and write short biographies or create visual presentations about their accomplishments, like a Glog. For inspiration, here is a short list of some important people covered in Times reporting:

        
Cesar Chavez, civil rights leader
        
, United States Secretary of Labor 
        
Mario Molina, Nobel Prize-winning chemist
        
Jennifer Lopez, actress, singer and businesswoman 
        
Roberto Clemente, professional baseball player
Or for fun, students can challenge themselves with our Hispanic Heritage Crossword.
 2. Explore cuisine or, better yet, prepare a meal. Check out one or more of the following New York Times sources to discover how Hispanic-Americans are helping to redefine what meals look like in the United States. You may even be inspired to plan and serve food together as a class.

        
Slide Show: A Taste of Home at Sunday Market

 3. Examine the diversity of Hispanic identity. What does it mean to be Hispanic? When it comes to identity, how do culture, ethnicity and race intersect? How are Hispanics portrayed and perceived in mass media? You might also reflect on your own heritage or examine why ethnic and racial categories, like Hispanic, are rejected by some. Below is a video about Garifunas, who are part African, part Caribbean and part Central American.
 4. Travel to Latin America or your local Latino neighborhood. Research and create a travel itinerary that focuses on Hispanic heritage sites in your local community or elsewhere. Use New York Times Travel sources, Latin America Through a Lens and as your inspiration.
 5. See Hispanic-American art. Watch the slide show from the Museo del Barrio's "Testimonios: 100 Years of Popular Expression" exhibit or"Quiet Riot | The Art of Wilfredo Prieto." Or read Rescuing the Stories Behind Latino Art, an article about a Houston museum's creation of a digital archive to preserve the stories behind Latin American and Latino art. Or, get involved in the debate about whether there should be a National Latino Museum on the National Mall.
 6. Read literature by Hispanic-American writers. As a class, in book groups or independently, students can read works by Latino authors, like Isabel Allende, Sandra Cisneros and Oscar Hijuelos. In response to the literature, students can write their own book reviews, modeled after Times reviews, like this recent review of Junot Diaz's latest short story collection, "This Is How You Lose Her."
 7. Listen to Latin music. Play music from South America, Central America and the Caribbean, and have students listen closely to the sounds they hear. Ask students, what emotions does the music evoke? How would they describe the rhythm, instruments and vocals? Then, follow with a discussion about how Latin music is influencing music all across the United States. Some related Times resources that can help enrich the discussion are:

        
To Hear Mexican Ballads, Take the D Train and its accompanying video Playing the Subways, about a growing community of subway musicians who play Norte music
        
Crowd Joins In on Latin Traditions Old and New, about a performance that merged Dominican merengue and bachata music at Central Park's SummerStage
        
Slide Show: The Red Carpet at the Billboard Latin Music Awards
        
Slide Show: Rhythm City and related article "Overflowing Latin Festival," about the Latin Alternative Music Conference
 8. View and discuss photography about the experience of Hispanic-Americans. Learn how one artist uses his work to explore Puerto Rican cultural identity. Or, view "Life on Both Sides of the Border," a series of photographs about life for Mexicans on both sides of the Mexico-U.S. border, by Joseph Rodriguez. 
 9. Study how Latinos are reshaping the political landscape. Read any combination of the following New York Times resources and write expository essays on the shifting electorate and role of Latino voters. 

        
Room for Debate | Securing the Hispanic Vote

HEADLINE: As the People's Priest, He Fought for the Forgotten of the Bronx

BYLINE: WINNIE HU


HIGHLIGHT: The Rev. John C. Flynn, who was revered as an advocate for neighborhoods and people in South Bronx, died on Monday at 83. 

 BODY:
The Rev. John C. Flynn could have been a monsignor, but as he told the story in later years, he refused the elevation because he already held a title more to his liking: the people's priest.
Father Flynn, 83, who spent a half-century championing the poor, the disadvantaged and the forgotten of the Bronx, died on Monday at the Schervier Nursing Care Center in Riverdale after a long debilitating illness, according to his family.
"He did not need any title, he did not need any accolades, he just wanted to be a parish priest," said Heidi Hynes, the executive director of the Mary Mitchell Family and Youth Center, who used to receive regular visits from Father Flynn asking what could be done to help the needy.
Tall and lanky with bright blue eyes, Father Flynn reached into the seediest corners of the Bronx and offered a helping hand, relatives and friends said. He started a campaign called Save a Generation to give education and job training to high school dropouts; walked the streets trading crucifixes for guns in an optimistic but futile effort to make neighborhoods safer; and attended hundreds of meetings to lobby for a better life for families, by building more low-cost housing or saving community gardens.
In the late 1970s, when the South Bronx was awash in crime and despair, he joined with local activists to help tenants who were living without heat or hot water for weeks at a time. He showed them how to stand up for themselves and reclaim their neighborhoods.
"These were human beings and not pieces of furniture to be thrown out," said the Rev. Neil Connolly, who worked alongside Father Flynn in the Bronx and is now pastor of St. Mary's Church in the Lower East Side. "All of us knew we would not be forever in the South Bronx, so there had to be not only development of buildings and property but also the development of people. Our way was not to do things for people but to help them do things for themselves."
Father Flynn was the second oldest of four children of a civil engineer and a homemaker, both Catholics, and he grew up in Crestwood, a middle-class enclave in Yonkers. Even as a youngster, he had the makings of a future priest, recalled his sister, Mary Ellen Loveless, who still lives in Crestwood. "As children, he would give me sermons and we would sit there like we were in church," Ms. Loveless, 77, said. "He would give communion."
He had severe asthma and spent some of his childhood living with family friends in Saranac Lake, N.Y., where the air was easier on his lungs, his sister said. After returning home to Yonkers, he graduated from Roosevelt High School, and later attended Saint Joseph's Seminary. 
Father Flynn, who was ordained in 1955, was dispatched as a new priest to Pocantico Hills, in Westchester County, where one of his duties was visiting patients at a nearby hospital, Ms. Loveless said. He later went to the Bronx and worked at the Church of Saint Raymond in Parkchester in the 1960s and '70s.
In a 2010 interview, Father Flynn recalled that his efforts to integrate the church in what was then a largely Irish neighborhood with black and Hispanic parishioners met resistance. He recalled being told, "If you love them so much, why don't you go live with them?"
That led to his moving to Venezuela, where he spent several years ministering to poor families and learning Spanish before returning to the Bronx.
At his last parish, St. Martin of Tours in Crotona, his daily rounds included ministering to drug dealers, drug addicts and working-class families who had fallen on hard times. Just about the only time that Father Flynn was not walking the neighborhood, former parishioners said, was on Mondays, when he played golf.
"Greatness takes many forms,'' said Mark Naison, a professor at Fordham University who worked with Father Flynn at Save a Generation. "It is not always associated with wealth and power and fame. In the Bronx, it may have reached its highest point in the person of a parish priest who walked the street with the lost boys of the community while bullets were flying. And who those boys learned to love as much as everyone else who knew him."
In 2010, Father Flynn retired to a residence for priests in Riverdale and later moved to the Schervier nursing home. Even then, he continued visiting his old neighborhoods to check on the poor; he was particularly concerned that they not be displaced by rising rents and a bad economy. 
Ms. Hynes recalled that Father Flynn would tell her, "I can't remember my name and address but I can remember we are supposed to be helping poor people."
At the nursing home, Father Flynn would minister to other patients and bless them. In his room was a handwritten note that he had scrawled, with much difficulty, sometime in the last year, Ms. Loveless said.
It read: "Priest of the people - To bring my relatives to be lovers of Jesus Christ who prepares us to follow Him into Heaven filled with united love for each other like a family - Become united and loving God and each other."
Father Flynn had written July 28, 1929 - his birth date - both at the top and bottom of the note.
"I guess,'' his sister said, "that is what he figured his life was supposed to be."

HEADLINE: Republicans Champion 'Voluntary Taxes'

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: Republicans will do anything to avoid raising taxes, and their latest bill to encourage voluntary contributions is nothing more than a distraction, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Bruce Bartlett held senior policy roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul. He is the author of "The Benefit and the Burden: Tax Reform - Why We Need It and What It Will Take." 
The Republican-controlled House of Representatives took a break last week from doing nothing to pass a bill to facilitate voluntary taxation. Almost simultaneously, Mitt Romney released his final tax return for 2011, showing that he voluntarily overpaid his taxes by taking less of a deduction for his charitable contributions than he was permitted.
The legislation was H.R. 6410, "The Buffett Rule Act of 2012." Those not acquainted with the misleading titles often given to Congressional bills might at first glance think this one has something to do with raising taxes on the ultrawealthy. 
Of course, Republicans would never actually raise taxes on the ultrawealthy; they think, or at least assert publicly, that the deficit results from too many poor people not paying taxes. But it would be very helpful to them to have a fig leaf that looks as if they had found a way of getting the rich to pay more. That is by encouraging them to voluntarily pay more, as Mr. Romney did.
Named for the billionaire Warren Buffett, what came to be known as the "Buffett rule" is a proposal by Democrats that all those with incomes of $1 million or more pay at least 30 percent of their income in federal income taxes.
Mr. Romney and his wife had an effective federal income tax rate of just 14 percent, including the voluntary overpayment, on incomes over $13 million in each of the years 2010 and 2011, the only ones for which they have released tax returns.
In April, Senate Republicans filibustered an effort by Democrats to enact a real Buffett rule. Thus there was no chance that Congress would actually legislate higher taxes on the wealthy this year. But apparently, House Republicans feel pressured by voters to respond to the low effective tax rates that many rich people pay, which contribute significantly to historically low federal revenues as a share of the gross domestic product and, hence, to the deficit and the debt.

Republicans recognize that the Buffett rule is politically popular. An April Gallup poll found that Americans favor the Buffett rule by 60 percent to 37 percent, an Ipsos/Reuters poll in March found people supporting it by 64 percent to 30 percent, and a February Associated Press/GfK poll found 65 percent in favor of the Buffett rule and only 26 percent opposed.
H.R. 6410, which was introduced on Sept. 14 and passed the House by voice vote on Sept. 19 with no hearings and just a few minutes of debate, would allow taxpayers to designate on their tax returns a contribution to the federal government, over and above their tax liability, for deficit reduction. Of course, the Treasury has had a fund since 1843 to accept gifts, so the new legislation doesn't really do anything. So far this year, $7.6 million has been donated.
Representative Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, characterized the Republican legislation as a "pretty please" bill. As he put it, "Pretty please, Warren Buffett, pretty please, Mitt Romney, won't you help contribute a little bit more toward reducing our deficit?"
One could perhaps take the Republican proposal more seriously if it also required a statement on application forms for Social Security and Medicare that those qualified should consider voluntarily forgoing benefits to reduce the deficit. The forms that farmers use to apply for agricultural subsidies could suggest that they put deficit reduction ahead of their personal interest, and so on.
The political reality is that Republicans don't really support taxation at any level. Of course, none will go on the record saying that they favor abolition of all taxation; they just support every single tax cut and oppose every single tax increase. I have not heard any Republican in recent years acknowledge that the deficit results in any way from lower revenues; rather, they say, the deficit is caused only by excessive spending on everything except the military. Implicitly, therefore, the only kind of taxation a Republican can support is voluntary taxation. 
Extreme libertarians, such as the novelist Ayn Rand, have long held that this is the only legitimate form of taxation. As she wrote in a 1964 essay reprinted in her book "The Virtue of Selfishness":
In a fully free society, taxation - or, to be exact, payment for government services - would be voluntary. Since the proper services of a government - the police, the armed forces, the law courts - are demonstrably needed by individual citizens and affect their interests directly, the citizens would (and should) be willing to pay for such services, as they pay for insurance.
As we know, the Republican vice-presidential nominee Paul D. Ryan has expressed admiration for Rand's views, and many Republicans in Congress, influenced by the Tea Party movement, support abolition of important government programs along with more tax cuts for the rich.
Interestingly, there actually are instances of voluntary taxation. The New York Times reports that the mayor of Bogotá, Colombia, once asked his citizens to voluntarily pay more taxes and 63,000 of them did. The Times has also reported that cities now often ask tax-exempt organizations to make voluntary payments in lieu of taxes and are turning to parents groups to fill holes in school funding and to community groups to take over park maintenance and other tasks.
Other examples of voluntary methods of financing governmental services include the bond drives of World War II, lotteries, tontines and political campaign contributions. Public universities often solicit private funds to pay for new buildings or programs and remittances by migrants living abroad are a kind of private foreign aid. And of course private charities often engage in social welfare, as well as providing facilities like hospitals and museums (some of which are also provided by government).
While there is no doubt that there are creative methods by which local governments might be able to raise additional revenue and encourage the private sector to take over some of their responsibilities, there is little, if any, scope for this by the federal government. Too much of what it does falls into the category of pure public goods that government must provide, like national defense, or entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare.
Realistically, voluntary taxation is not a viable alternative to broad-based taxes. Those who oppose raising taxes on the wealthy and are concerned about the number of people exempt from federal income taxes ought to consider a national sales tax, as every other major country has. As Alexander Hamilton explained in Federalist 21, one virtue of consumption taxes is that they are to some extent voluntary.

HEADLINE: Adding Up the Government's Legal Bills for Fannie and Freddie

BYLINE: PETER J. HENNING


HIGHLIGHT: The government faces years of legal bills to defend Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac executives accused of misleading investors about subprime mortgages. 

 BODY:
The government's takeover of the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2008 may turn out to be a very expensive proposition.
The bailouts of the two have already cost taxpayers about $185 billion. And it appears that the legal fees from lawsuits involving former executives from the two companies continue to pile up.
A decision last week by Richard J. Leon of the United States District Court for the District of Columbiato dismiss a shareholder lawsuit against the former Fannie Mae chief executive Franklin D. Raines may provide a little bit of relief from the legal bills.
But more recent cases will require the government to pay to defend executives accused of misleading investors about subprime mortgages on the companies' books that in all likelihood will take years to resolve.
Lawsuits and government investigations involving Mr. Raines and two other former Fannie Mae executives were the result of accounting irregularities at the company. This problem surfaced while the company was still profitable - that is, before it was crippled by the collapse in the housing market. Mr. Raines and the other executives resigned in 2004 and settled with the government in 2008, but the private litigation has dragged on for another four years.
Like most public companies, Fannie Mae had a broad indemnification policy requiring it to advance the legal fees for executives accused of misconduct based on their work for it. When the government took over the company in September 2008, it affirmed that position and has continued to pay for the lawyers.
A report issued in February by the inspector general of the Federal Housing Finance Administration, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, estimated that the legal fees paid on behalf of Mr. Raines and the other executives totaled $97 million to that point, of which the government had paid approximately $37 million.
In his opinion dismissing the securities fraud claims, Judge Leon concluded that the evidence showed "at best, that Raines acted negligently in his role as the company's chief executive and negligently in his representations about the company's accounting and earnings management practices." Securities fraud requires proof of intentional conduct or at least recklessness, so Mr. Raines was released from the case.
That does not necessarily spell the end to the government's obligation to pay legal fees.
Judge Leon has not yet decided whether to dismiss the case against the two other Fannie Mae executives. In addition, plaintiffs can appeal his decision on Mr. Raines, so the legal bills can certainly continue to add up.
Legal claims against former executives arising from financial crisis that led to the government's takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are just getting started. There is the distinct possibility that costs from those cases will far exceed what was spent defending Mr. Raines and others.
The Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil securities fraud charges in December 2011 against six executives from the two companies, including the former chief executives Daniel H. Mudd of Fannie Mae and Richard F. Syron of Freddie Mac. The S.E.C. has accused the executives of misleading investors about the companies' exposure to subprime mortgages that caused severe financial losses triggering the government's takeover. Private lawsuits have also been filed against the companies and corporate officers making claims that are similar to the S.E.C. charges.
The case against Mr. Mudd and the other Fannie Mae executives cleared its first hurdle in August when Paul A. Crotty, a federal district judge in Manhattan, rejected a motion to dismiss the complaint. The defendants had argued that the company came under an exemption from the federal securities laws because it was a governmental entity, and that their disclosures about subprime loans were not misleading.
The standard for deciding a motion to dismiss at this stage is quite low: all that the S.E.C. has to show is it could prove the charges if the case goes to trial. Judge Crotty found that Fannie Mae was a private company and not an "independent establishment" of the government that would exempt it from the securities laws.
In his assessment, Judge Crotty found that there was a basis for concluding the company's statements were misleading based on how it classified mortgages made to borrowers who were less creditworthy. That is enough to let the case proceed.
The defendants in the Freddie Mac case also filed a motion to dismiss their case with Richard J. Sullivan, a federal district judge in Manhattan, raising similar issues regarding the S.E.C.'s charges. He has not yet ruled, but winning a motion to dismiss at this stage is difficult, so there is a good chance the case will also move forward.
After a judge rejects a defense motion to dismiss, the discovery process commences in earnest, with each side conducting depositions and exchanging documents. In the private litigation involving Mr. Raines, Judge Leon noted that discovery generated 67 million pages of documents and 123 depositions.
The cases against the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac executives could easily reach those proportions. This is when the meter on the legal bills looks like it is spring loaded because of the legion of lawyers required to gather and analyze the evidence.
Generating that volume of information also takes an enormous amount of time, so discovery is likely to drag on for at least another year or two. On the bright side, once the parties dig into the evidence, the likelihood of a settlement grows because of the toll the process takes on each side.
But even if the S.E.C. settles its case against the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac executives, the private litigation will march on. The private case against Mr. Raines lasted nine years, barring a successful appeal that would stretch it out even further. So the government will be paying for lawyers for quite a while yet.

The Future of Big Law | With business still tepid in the aftermath of the financial crisis, and with the industry reeling from the failure of Dewey & LeBoeuf, DealBook looks at the future of lawyering in a special section, "Big Law Steps Into Uncertain Times." That future may involve an entirely new business model, one without any partners, writes Andrew Ross Sorkin in his column.
A trio of white shoe law firms - Cravath, Swaine & Moore, Debevoise & Plimpton and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton - have found success by keeping things old school, paying partners according to a strict lock-step system, writes DealBook's Peter Lattman. At Cravath, a former Obama administration lawyer, Christine A. Varney, had to meet all 83 partners before she could join the firm - and she received no signing bonus or special deal when she was voted into the partnership.
Cravath has long been a place where money seemed less important than love of the work, writes James B. Stewart, who joined the firm out of law school 36 years ago. The realization that Cravath partners were emotionally invested in what they did is what finally moved him to leave the legal profession for a career in journalism, Mr. Stewart says:
"This came as a profound revelation. Of course they worked long hours, because it didn't feel like work to them. They took great satisfaction in the services they rendered their clients. You couldn't fake this. The partners seemed to have some sixth sense. I enjoyed my work. But I had to admit I didn't love it the way they did."
So where can a lawyer find work these days? For the white collar bar, a string of Wall Street scandals has provided steady business, reports Azam Ahmed. For instance, the Libor scandal, which touches 16 banks and spans more than 10 government authorities, "is looking like a full employment act for the corporate bar," said Samuel W. Buell, a professor at Duke Law School. Still, white collar work can pose ethical quandaries. Companies being scrutinized for misconduct often hire a law firm to conduct an investigation, but that practice "raises significant questions about conflicts of interest," writes Peter J. Henning, the White Collar Watch columnist.
Lawyers for Wall Street have found a friendly reception at an appeals court in Washington, which has a philosophy of keeping government watchdogs on a short leash, reports Ben Protess.
A London-based law firm, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, has responded to the global economic slump by emphasizing its international reach - a strategy that has put it on top of the league tables for the first half of 2012, with $162 billion of announced deals, reports Mark Scott. And another firm, the Global IP Law Group, has carved out a niche in patent legal and advisory work, as companies increasingly see patents as an asset class, reports Steve Lohr.
For aspiring lawyers, law school, with sky-high tuition and job prospects that remain uncertain, can seem like a losing proposition. Steven M. Davidoff, DealBook's Deal Professor, writes:
"The problem of law school is one that is ubiquitous to higher education - the current model is inherently expensive but even today, lower-priced alternatives don't seem to meet the standards or be desired by many students. It is here where revolutionary technologies like online learning may come into play."
Sheila Bair Strikes Again | The former chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has some choice words for bankers and fellow regulators, including Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, in her new book. DealBook reports that Ms. Bair portrays Mr. Geithner in the book as an apologist for Wall Street, and she suggests that his effort to bail out nine big banks may have masked a rescue intended just for Citigroup (a theory that other government officials have rejected).
"Participating in these programs was the most distasteful thing I have ever done in public life," writes Ms. Bair in the book, "Bull By the Horns: Fighting to Save Main Street from Wall Street and Wall Street from Itself," set to be released on Tuesday.
On the Agenda | Banco Santander is expected to take its Mexican unit public today after the market closes. The I.P.O. will amount to a test both of investors' appetite for Latin American banks and their willingness to invest in an institution closely tied to Europe's crisis. With the results of stress tests of Spanish banks coming on Friday, The Wall Street Journal writes that German banks have a particularly high amount of exposure to their Spanish rivals.
The media mogul Barry Diller, chairman of IAC/InterActiveCorp, is on CNBC from 8 to 9 a.m. James S. Chanos, the founder of the hedge fund Kynikos Associates, is appearing on Bloomberg TV at 8 a.m. The former prime minister of Greece, George A. Papandreou, is on Bloomberg TV at 9:35 a.m. 
With the housing market showing signs of a recovery, the S&P/Case-Shiller home price index, coming at 9 a.m., will offer a portrait of the market in July. Another crucial gauge, the Conference Board's index of consumer confidence, is coming out at 10.
Tim Pawlenty's About-Face | Mr. Pawlenty is an odd choice to lead the Financial Services Roundtable, one of Wall Street's most influential lobbying shops, considering that the former Republican governor of Minnesota opposed the financial industry on a range of issues while running for president, Andrew Ross Sorkin says in the DealBook column. "His appointment is the clearest sign yet of the flexible ethic that makes the revolving door in Washington spin faster," Mr. Sorkin writes.
Jeffrey Gundlach Wants His Art Back | The bond investor, of DoubleLine Capital, is offering a reward of as much as $1.7 million for information leading to the recovery of the artwork, including pieces by Piet Mondrian, Jasper Johns and Joseph Cornell, that was stolen from his home in Santa Monica, Calif. Mr. Gundlach's "emotions are pretty raw right now," reports New York magazine's Kevin Roose, citing an unidentified person close to the investor.

HEADLINE: Santander's Mexican Unit Sells U.S. Shares at $12.18 in Dual Listing

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The Mexican arm of Banco Santander priced the U.S. portion of its initial public offering at about $12.18 on Tuesday, according to a person briefed on the matter, within its expected price range as the lender held one of the biggest stock sales ever by a Mexican company. 

 BODY:
The Mexican arm of Banco Santander priced the American portion of its initial public offering at $12.18 on Tuesday, within its expected price range, according to a person briefed on the matter who declined to be identified.
The unit, Grupo Financiero Santander México, sold additional shares on the Mexican Stock Exchange at 31.25 pesos each, at the middle of that offering's expected range. The lender hoped to raise up to $4.2 billion through the dual listing, one of the biggest stock sales ever by a Mexican company.
When it begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday under the ticker symbol BSMX, Santander México will become the only Mexican lender listed on the Big Board. The offering was largely seen as a way to tap into Mexico's growth prospects as investors hunt for ways to gain greater exposure to international markets.
The offering for the unit was also seen as a test for investors on a number of fronts. Its size, trailing only Facebook's $18 billion stock sale for the year, was seen as potentially daunting at a time when the I.P.O. market has stagnated. The number of initial offerings priced this year has slid nearly 50 percent from 2011, according to data from Renaissance Capital.
And Santander México will still be closely tied to its parent, one of Spain's biggest banks and a closely watched proxy of that country's financial health. Banco Santander is expected to control about 75 percent of the company, raising the prospect that it may flood the market with additional shares if it needs to raise more capital.
Neither its size nor its Spanish parent appeared to be a major hurdle for investors. Santander México's offering was about two times oversubscribed, according to Scott Sweet, the senior managing partner of IPO Boutique.
"Originally, I was concerned about the size," Mr. Sweet said. "But as the road show took place, the conversion rates on orders was excellent."
Investors appeared to be enticed by Santander México's financial performance, which has outstripped that of the parent company. Its profit for the first half of the year rose 14.4 percent, to 556 million euros, as it benefited from improvements in the Mexican economy.
"There are very few quality banks that hit the I.P.O. front, whether they be in the U.S. or abroad," Mr. Sweet said.
Profit at its parent, Santander, slid 51 percent in the first half from the year-ago period, to 1.7 billion euros, as it continued to grapple with Spain's depressed economy.
Underwriters for Santander México sold about 20 percent of the bank's shares in Mexico; the rest were sold internationally.
Santander has already taken its Brazilian arm public, raising about $7.5 billion, and said that it planned to hold I.P.O.'s for all of its biggest foreign subsidiaries within the next five years.
The Mexican stock sale is expected to bolster Santander's capital ratios by about half of a percentage point.
The offering was led by Santander, UBS, Deutsche Bank and Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch.

HEADLINE: A Hedge Fund's Complex Scheme May Cost It Millions

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: After the Telus Corporation proposed converting its nonvoting shares into voting shares, Mason Capital Management made a bet against the proposal in a gamble that could now fail. 

 BODY:
Hedge funds are supposed to be the smart money, but sometimes even they can be outsmarted.
Take the case of Mason Capital Management and the Telus Corporation, a large Canadian telecommunications company. Mason Capital, a New York and London hedge fund with about $8 billion in assets under management, has made a complex bet in Telus stock that looked shrewd at first, but that may now lose tens of millions of dollars.
Telus has two classes of shares, one that is voting and trades only in Canada and another that is nonvoting and trades in Canada and the United States. The nonvoting shares traditionally trade at a discount to the voting shares, but Telus is proposing to convert the shares on a one-for-one basis, giving a windfall to the holders of nonvoting shares.
Mason has taken a complex trading position in opposition to the proposal. In April, the hedge fund announced that it had acquired 19 percent of Telus's voting stock, worth 1.9 billion Canadian dollars, or $1.8 billion.
Mason was able to finance this position by setting up a roughly equivalent short position in Telus's nonvoting common stock, betting that those shares would fall. Basically, for every dollar that Mason earned on the voting shares, it would lose a dollar on the nonvoting shares. Since Mason is almost perfectly hedged, this was a bet that Telus's proposal would fail, causing the nonvoting stock to lose value and the voting stock to gain.
Pretty clever, right?
Mason has no real economic interest in the future of the company because of its offsetting positions, but it can still vote its 19 percent against the share conversion proposal. This anomaly has led Telus to claim that Mason is an "empty voter" - voting shares in which it has no economic interest "at the expense of other shareholders."
The hedge fund has argued that Telus is seeking to hand the nonvoting shareholders free money by collapsing the shares at a 1-to-1 ratio instead of at the traditional discount.
According to Mason, "over the past 13 years, Telus voting shares have traded at an average premium of 4.83 percent relative to the nonvoting shares; the premium has been as high as 15.23 percent." The hedge fund also argues that the Telus directors who approved this transaction are conflicted because 89 percent of their total holdings are in the nonvoting shares.
In response, Telus claims that the lack of a discount is justified because the voting shares would get additional liquidity.
Mason won Round 1 of this argument in May, when Telus withdrew its proposal.
At the same time, Telus also planted the seeds to thwart Mason's trade. The company announced that it would try again to collapse the shares at some future time. This gave price support to the nonvoting shares and prevented Mason from cashing out its position.
Mason reportedly hired the Blackstone Group to look at strategic alternatives for its Telus stake, but was unable to sell it.
In August, the fund sought to press the issue by calling a shareholder meeting to amend Telus's charter to prevent the nonvoting shares from being converted into voting shares without a discount.
This started Round 2.
Telus again proposed that the shares be collapsed. But in a twist, the company has structured the transaction so that only a majority of the voting shares are needed to approve it, instead of the 66 2/3 vote initially required. The reduction in the number of necessary votes gives the proposal a much better chance of passing despite Mason's 19 percent holding.
Telus also refused to hold a special meeting. The battle came before the Supreme Court of British Columbia, and on Sept. 11, the court rejected on technical grounds Mason's effort to force Telus to hold the meeting. But in an aside, the court heavily criticized the hedge fund for its voting strategy, calling it "empty voting." The court stated that "the practice of empty voting presents a challenge to shareholder democracy ... when a party has a vote in a company but no economic interest in that company, that party's interests may not lie in the well-being of the company itself." Mason has appealed the ruling.
Unless a higher court intervenes, the share collapse is heading to a shareholder vote on Oct. 17. Given that only a majority vote is needed, Telus may have the votes necessary to push the measure through.
And with the decision of the Canadian court, other hedge funds appear to have closed out their positions in Telus, further narrowing the spread between the share classes.
On paper, Mason's trade was a deliciously clever scheme that made perfect sense. But once the trade went public, its position in Telus raised eyebrows. Mason has argued that it is not an empty voter because its interests are aligned with the voting shareholders; the conversion will be at their expense. That message may make sense, but the messenger has been viewed with suspicion. As a result, Mason has had a hard time persuading Canadian shareholders to support it.
And with the nonvoting shares still holding on to their earlier gains, Mason finds itself boxed in. Telus's total market value has increased by $2 billion since February. Mason would have made much more money - hundreds of millions, in fact - had it simply taken a long position.
Lost in all of this maneuvering are the economic merits of Telus's share collapse and the fact that nonvoting shares do appear to be getting a significant benefit that may be inappropriate.
According to sources close to Mason, the trade is currently profitable. But Mason is finding that its ingenious trade may lose it millions, thanks to the equally adroit maneuvering of Telus. Who said Canadians were too nice?

HEADLINE: Which Presidential Candidate Is Better for College Applicants?

BYLINE: TANYA ABRAMS


HIGHLIGHT: Mark Kantrowitz, an expert on paying for college, explains how the 2012 presidential election could affect college applicants. 

 BODY:
 If you're a college-bound student who has been (loosely) following the 2012 presidential campaign, this is an excellent time to tune in (and catch up). 
President Obama and former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts fielded education-related questions on Tuesday during NBC's Education Nation Summit in New York City. Mr. Romney spoke live with Brian Williams at the New York Public Library, and Mr. Obama appeared in a video Q. and A. with Savannah Guthrie of the "Today" show. (The candidates also gave speeches at the Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting, though the focus was not on education.)
To help college-bound students make sense of the presidential candidates' positions on higher education, The Choice related the candidates' positions on the costs of education to Mark Kantrowitz of the Web site FinAid.org. An edited version of that exchange, conducted via e-mail, appears below. - Tanya Abrams
 Q. 
 How important is the student vote in this election? 
 A. 
Students were a swing vote in the previous election and are likely to be a swing vote in the current election. The student vote matters not just for the presidential election, but also for the Congressional races. Students tend to vote when they are personally affected by the outcome of an election. The major concerns of college students and their families include persistent high unemployment, decreases in college affordability, increases in the student loan burden and possible cuts in college grants and education tax benefits. These issues, along with other clear contrasts between the candidates, may stimulate increases in the student vote.
 Q. 
 How might federal spending plans in an Obama-Biden or Romney-Ryan administration affect college students and their families over the next four years? 
 A. 
 Neither candidate is calling for bold new increases in spending on federal student aid. Rather, the trade-off is between cuts to student aid programs on one side and continuing the current programs on the other side.
If elected, Mr. Romney will likely cut student aid spending by repealing several initiatives of the Obama administration. For example, the Romney-Ryan ticket supports repealing the improvements in the income-based repayment plan and opposes loan forgiveness programs.
Mr. Romney has said that he would restore the role of private lenders in making new federal education loans. Some of Mr. Romney's proposals lack specifics, but it is likely that he would end subsidized loans to undergraduate students, cut some grant, loan and education tax benefit programs to simplify student aid, and tighten eligibility for the remaining programs.
If re-elected, Mr. Obama's proposals mostly focus on maintaining the status quo. For example, he would make the American Opportunity Tax Credit permanent, instead of allowing it to expire at the end of 2012. Mr. Obama is also committed to preserving the Pell Grant program.
Mr. Obama has proposed to expand campus-based aid - such as the Federal Perkins Loan Program and federal work-study program. He also wants to make a college's eligibility for increased funding dependent on their ability to keep costs low and limit increases in the net price of a college education. Mr. Obama has also said that he will cut tuition inflation in half over the next decade, but it is unclear how he will accomplish this.
 Q. 
 How do the president and Mr. Romney differ in the aid they would provide directly to colleges and universities over the next four years? 
 A. 
 Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney do not agree about the regulation of for-profit higher education.
Mr. Obama's administration proposed and implemented new gainful employment rules, which establish affordable debt restrictions on for-profit colleges and universities. Colleges and university programs that do not comply with these rules will lose eligibility for federal student aid.
Mr. Romney has been vocal in his support of for-profit colleges, often using Full Sail University as an example in his speeches, and opposes the gainful employment rules.
Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney disagree about the role of banks and other financial institutions in the federal education loan programs. From 1993 to 2010, there were two parallel federal education loan programs: the federally-guaranteed student loan program, also known as the Federal Family Education Loan program (or F.F.E.L.) and the federal direct loans program. Both programs offered the same loans, but differed in the source of funds for the loans. The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 repealed the F.F.E.L. program, so that all new federal education loans starting July 1, 2010 are made through the direct loan program, thereby saving the federal government tens of billions of dollars. While private lenders no longer make new federal education loans, several still participate as servicers in the direct loan program.
Mr. Romney has said that he would restore the F.F.E.L. program, but has not discussed how he would pay for the higher cost of the program. Mr. Romney supports a switch to fair value accounting for federal student loan programs, which would reduce but not eliminate the savings from the switch to 100 percent direct lending. 
Mr. Obama would like to make the American Opportunity Tax Credit permanent, while Mr. Romney supports allowing it to expire. 
Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney also disagree about the Dream Act, which would allow some undocumented students who arrived in the United States more than five years ago as minors to normalize their immigration status. During a six-year conditional residency period, they would be eligible for student loans and federal work-study but not the Pell Grant. The Dream Act would also allow states to grant in-state tuition to undocumented students who are state residents. Mr. Obama supports passage of the Dream Act while Mr. Romney opposes it. 
 Q. 
 How might the value of the Pell Grant change over the next four years, depending on who is president? 
 A. 
 The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 set the maximum Pell Grant through the year 2020, with five years of no increases and five years of increases at the consumer inflation rate. Although these increases are anemic compared with previous increases, increases are better than cuts. Unfortunately, Congress did not fully fund the increases, putting the Pell Grant program under significant financial pressure. 
The Pell Grant program is protected from the automatic cuts that will be triggered in FY2013, since the Budget Control Act of 2011 specified funding levels for the Pell Grant program in FY2012 and FY2013. In FY2014 and subsequent years, however, the Pell Grant program will be subject to sequestration and will face automatic cuts of about 8 percent along with other student aid programs.
These budgetary problems increase the likelihood that the Pell Grant program will fail to keep pace with increases in college costs under either candidate. There are also very few remaining champions for the Pell Grant program in Congress. Even if the Pell Grant program is not cut, maintaining the program may require cuts in other student aid programs.
Mr. Obama has proposed an $85 increase in the maximum grant to $5,635 in 2013-14. Mr. Romney has proposed keeping the maximum Pell Grant unchanged and tightening eligibility for the Pell Grant program in order to ensure "sustainability."
Mr. Romney would also switch the funding of the Pell Grant program from a mix of discretionary and mandatory funding to entirely discretionary funding, which would make it easier to cut the program in subsequent years. The Pell Grant program would lose buying power under either candidate, but to a greater extent under a Romney administration. 
 Q. 
 Is there anything that the candidates agree on, in terms of their plans for college access and affordability? 
 A. 
 Both Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney agree that something must be done to restrain increases in the rising cost of a college education. They disagree, however, in their approach. Mr. Romney believes in the Bennett hypothesis, which argues that increases in federal student aid lead to increases in college costs. Mr. Obama prefers to reward colleges for improvements in college affordability and college completion.
Both candidates want to help families make more informed decisions about the trade-offs between college costs and college quality. Both want to help make consumers more informed about colleges available to students, although there are some differences in the types of data each would provide.
Under Mr. Obama's administration, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the U.S. Department of Education created a model financial aid offer form. This financial aid shopping sheet provides clear, correct and comparable information about a college's net price and estimated debt at graduation, along with information about graduation rates and loan default rates. Mr. Romney has called for providing families with information about college "completion and persistence, loan repayment rates, future earnings, and other indicators to intelligently weigh the risks and benefits of the many options available to them." 
Mr. Obama led a campaign to block the doubling of the interest rate on subsidized Stafford loans to undergraduate students. When it became clear that this issue was energizing students, Mr. Romney announced that he supported extending the current interest rate. The political pressure on both candidates led to Congress enacting a one-year extension to the 3.4 percent interest rate. The low interest rate is unlikely to be extended to new loans beyond the end of the 2012-13 academic year.
 Q. 
 Regardless of who is president, do you predict that the cost of an undergraduate education is likely to increase for most families over the next four years, and if so, by a range of about how much? 
 A. 
 One of the simplest ways to predict tomorrow's weather is to look out the window. And to quote the Morton motto, "When it rains, it pours."
The prospects for major improvements in college costs and financial aid are slim to none. College costs will increase by about one-fifth to one-third over the next four years. Grants will continue to fail to keep pace with increases in college costs, causing a severe decline in college affordability. This will lead to increases in education debt.
It will also lead to shifts in student enrollment from higher-cost colleges to lower-cost colleges, especially among low- and moderate-income students. Shifting enrollments from four-year colleges to two-year colleges and from private nonprofit colleges to public colleges will lead to declines in bachelor's degree attainment. Low-income students will increasingly be priced out of a college education. 
The prospect of low or limited increases in student aid funding will lead to infighting among colleges, since more money for one college will mean less money for others. Politicians will also play the blame game, where they will criticize colleges for increases in college costs and deflect their own responsibility for per-capita cuts in the inflation-adjusted buying power of federal and state grants. Cuts in state support of postsecondary education will also continue to be the primary cause of public college tuition inflation. 
Many will call for improvements in the efficiency of student aid programs. But tens of billions of dollars of the savings will be diverted to deficit reduction instead of increasing funding for the more effective programs. Cuts and changes aimed at improving college completion rates will sacrifice college access by low- and moderate-income students while leading to a decline in the number of students graduating from college, despite improvements in a variety of specious metrics of college performance. 
Online education will be trumpeted as a magical solution to the college affordability crisis. But despite the hype, online education cannot currently solve the scalability problems without sacrificing quality. Average college student-faculty ratios are the same today as they were a century ago because learning is fundamentally interactive and hands-on. It will take decades, if not longer, before technology will develop to the point where it can substitute for teaching assistants, tutorial sessions, office hours and study sessions with fellow students. An education requires more than passively watching videotaped lectures and answering a few multiple-choice questions. 
Dysfunction will continue to reign on Capitol Hill, with politics trumping policy. Ideology will dominate debates, leading to stalemate and little progress in addressing the nation's problems. 
 Stay tuned. On Thursday, Mr. Kantrowitz will revisit our virtual Guidance Office to answer any questions you may have about scholarships and financial aid.

HEADLINE: How Many Government Programs Have You Benefited From?

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Research from Cornell University says that 96 percent of us have used one or more of these 21 government programs. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney stirred up a hornet's nest with his comments about the 47 percent of Americans who he thinks are dependent on the government.
It turns out, according to 2008 data from the Cornell Survey Research Institute reported Monday in a Times opinion piece, that 96 percent of Americans have taken part in government benefit programs in one form or another.
Listed below are 21 programs referenced by the researchers. Numbers 1 through 13 are "direct," meaning that the aid comes directly from the government; the remainder are considered "submerged," in that they come indirectly, through government tax policies. (For instance, the money you put in your workplace 401(k) plan grows tax-deferred).

        
Head Start
        
Social Security Disability
        
Social Security Retirement and Survivors Benefits
        
Supplemental Security Income (SSI)
        
Medicaid
        
Medicare
        
Welfare (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or T.A.N.F.)
        
G.I. Bill
        
Veterans' benefits
        
Pell Grants
        
Unemployment Insurance
        
Food Stamps
        
Government Subsidized Housing
        
Home Mortgage Interest Deduction
        
Hope and Lifetime Learning Tax Credits
        
Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit
        
529 accounts (qualified tuition programs) or Coverdell education savings account (Education I.R.A.'s)
        
Earned-income tax credit
        
Employer subsidized health insurance
        
Employer subsidized retirement benefits
        
Federal student loans
In an e-mail, Suzanne Mettler, a professor of government at Cornell, explained a bit more about the two forms of employer benefits (Numbers 19 and 20), saying they "are even more submerged than the other policies in that group, because unlike with the others, people take no actual steps to claim the government benefit. As long as one is acquiring those employer-provided benefits, one simply gets the tax benefit - if the employer put the same money in people's paychecks, they would have to owe taxes on it."
I personally have benefited from student loans, the home mortgage deduction and employer health and retirement benefits, and my children have 529 education savings plans. My dad went to college (proudly) on the G.I. Bill. My upbringing was middle class.
Take a look at the list and let us know: How many of these have you received or relied on? Are you poor, working class, middle class, upper middle class, or part of the 1 percent?

HIGHLIGHT: The N.F.L. is willing to tarnish its reputation for the price of a 30-second commercial during the Super Bowl. 

 BODY:
Oh, the horror: on the greatest national stage we have, in the last second of a close game, a bunch of replacement referees from the Lingerie Football League and other far outposts of the sport took a game away from the rightful winners.
All because an incredibly prosperous cartel wants its longtime workers to take a cut in pension benefits - this at a time when the cartel is earning more money than at any time in its history, and has the greatest audience in American television.
But the "inaccurate reception," as they're calling the interception-that-became-a-touchdown Monday night, could spur many of the couch-dwelling citizens of Football Nation to give Mitt Romney's Bain-style corporate economics a hard look. It's worked so well for the rest of the United States, this wealth gap, this creative destruction on behalf of the noble job creators. Now look what it's doing to the true national pastime.

Just look at who wants to get the union referees back on the job today: Scott Walker, the union-busting governor of Wisconsin, and Paul Ryan, Romney's union-dissing running mate. "Just give me a break!" Ryan tweeted. "It's time to get the real refs."
So what's at stake in an economics parable that goes to heart of our true passion?About $3 million and change. That's it. The refs, who earn between $78,000 and $139,000 annually for part-time work, are holding out to preserve their pensions, among other sticking points. The National Football League, which took in more than $9 billion in revenue last year and owned 23 of the 25 most watched telecasts last year, wants to cut the pension contribution by about 60 percent, moving the refs from a defined benefit into something closer to a 401(k).
What's $3 million to the N.F.L.? It's the price of a 30-second commercial during the Super Bowl. So, to be clear, the most popular entertainment commodity in the land is willing to seriously tarnish its name, its reputation and the validity of its games for the price of a single half-minute ad.
Of course, it's usually hard to find sympathy for the zebras. But by bringing in such an incompetent crew, and standing hard for greed over credibility, the football owners have roused a nation to the side of the faceless vice principals and other officious types who wear the stripes. Monday night's game took over the Twitterverse, and even prompted another plea from President Obama to bring the refs back.
And while I should be joyous that my feisty, young, oft-overlooked Seattle Seahawks have now beaten the evil Dallas Cowboys and the perennially likable and publically owned Green Bay Packers, I can't exult.
No, not with that lousy call that gave my boys the game in the last second, fresh in the mind. Two headlines, from the two states, said it all.
"Grand Larceny: Packers Get Robbed of Win in Seattle." That from the OshKosh Northwestern.
"Hawks Steal One." The Seattle Times.
 On Tuesday, the N.F.L. said the final score would stand - no further reviews. 
But nobody wants to win on the backs of incompetents, particularly here in Seattle, a proud union town.

HEADLINE: For Tesla Motors, One Supercharger to Bind Them

BYLINE: JIM MOTAVALLI


HIGHLIGHT: Elon Musk, the company's chief executive, said he envisioned the high-voltage units installed throughout much of the United States in the next two years. 

 BODY:
On Monday night at its design studios in Hawthorne, Calif., Tesla Motors introduced its Supercharger, a glittering monolith capable of bringing the battery of a Model S sedan from flat to full in about an hour.
Elon Musk, chief executive of Tesla, has always known how to manufacture excitement around the company's products, and the introduction of the 480-volt Supercharger was attended by enough smoke and lasers to suit a reunion of Spinal Tap. Mr. Musk said the chargers would dispense free electricity generated without emissions through a partnership with SolarCity, a builder and installer of photovoltaic equipment led by Peter and Lyndon Rive, cousins of Mr. Musk. The Tesla executive is also SolarCity's chairman.
The Supercharger will be installed at solar carports loosely resembling filling stations and are capable of charging several vehicles simultaneously, as well as returning surplus power to the grid. Khyati Shah, a spokeswoman for SolarCity, wrote in an e-mail that two of the six Superchargers already installed had solar capability, with the others running off of grid power. One solar unit is 24 kilowatts and the other is 26.
Mr. Musk said the Supercharger network would address some anxieties that might be inhibiting wide consumer adoption of electric vehicles, including concern about power-plant emissions related to charging; the cars' inability to travel long distances; and operational costs. The Supercharger will charge at 100 kilowatts and eventually up to 120 kilowatts, he said. "What it means is that you can drive for three hours, stop for less than half an hour, recharge, and be ready to go again," Mr. Musk said. A Model S would reach a state of half-charge in 30 minutes.
The system is not compatible with existing Level III fast chargers. It complements elements of the company's charging system unveiled earlier, including the high-power wall unit and plug design the company demonstrated for Wheels last year.
Tesla has six Superchargers in operation, all in California, with more to come in the state by the end of the year. The first stations are expected to be opened to the public in coming weeks.
Mr. Musk said the company intended to have Superchargers installed across much of the United States in the next two years and to have the entire country, and the lower part of Canada, covered in four or five years.
The ability to connect to the Supercharger will be standard on Model S cars with the 85-kilowatt-hour battery, the highest-capacity battery marketed by Tesla, and would be optional for buyers of the sedan fitted with the 60-kilowatt-hour pack. That said, Model S sedans equipped with the 40-kilowatt-hour batteries, and the existing fleet of Tesla Roadsters, will be excluded from using the Supercharger.
Mr. Musk said Model S customers with the necessary equipment would "travel for free, forever, on pure sunlight. It's pretty hard to beat that." Not one to understate the company's accomplishments, he said the Supercharger's introduction was likely to "go down as being quite historic, at least on par with SpaceX docking with the Space Station earlier this year," a reference to his space-freight venture. "I really think this is important."

HEADLINE: Romney at the Clinton Global Initiative

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: The candidate has fine ideas on foreign aid. But they're not exactly new. 

 BODY:
The Republican nominee's speech at the Clinton Global Initiative was surprisingly reasonable. Granted, Mr. Romney got in a few digs at President Obama, but they were subtle and almost funny. And he was a bit light on details, but the occasion didn't really call for granularity.
Mr. Romney actually endorsed the general concept of foreign aid, hardly popular in this year's Tea-Party steeped climate. He also argued that traditional methods for doling out money are lacking.
"The aim of a much larger share of our aid must be the promotion of work and the fostering of free enterprise," he said.

Those are laudable goals, and I doubt he'll get any argument from the Obama administration. Like the Bush administration before it, the Obama administration has linked aid to human rights benchmarks and directed funds to businesses. For instance, the Wall Street Journal noted that "U.S. economic aid to Middle East nations that were part of the Arab Spring revolutions was designed to be channeled as business incentives that could run decades, ultimately helping U.S. exports."
Mr. Romney also said he would "focus our efforts on small and medium-sized businesses." After the fall of European Communism, the United States created enterprise funds that gave seed loans to businesses starting up in the post-Soviet era. These were successful, in some cases actually turning a profit, and have largely faded from the scene. If Mr. Romney wants to bring those back, it seems like a good idea.
Pushing the envelope a bit, Mr. Romney said that the United States should make foreign aid conditional on countries' lowering barriers to entrepreneurship and trade with the United States. In return, he said, "developing nations will receive U.S. assistance packages focused on developing the institutions of liberty, the rule of law and property rights." The problem here, as The Journal pointed out, is that "some of the largest recipients of U.S. economic aid-such as Afghanistan, Ethiopia and Haiti-have barely developed private sectors."
Foreign aid is a tiny part of the U.S. budget. The total for fiscal year 2012, according to the Congressional Research Service, was $37.7 billion, or 1 percent of the total budget. 
Of the total, the CRS says, only $4.4 billion goes to "economic growth." The rest goes to humanitarian, health and education assistance, and the biggest chunk, $10.56 billion, to military aid, virtually all of which is spent on American-made military products. Egypt gets $1.2 billion-$2 billion a year, and Israel gets about $3 billion.
The aid to Egypt and Israel, by the way, is tightly bound to the Camp David peace accord between those two countries. Mr. Romney, like Mr. Obama, often mentions holding Egypt to that agreement.
If a President Romney tries to maintain but revamp foreign aid, his problem won't be with liberals. It will be with the right wing of his own party, elements of which are already trying to kill all aid to Egypt and Libya, and have never liked foreign aid in general. It's pretty unpopular with voters, according to opinion polls, who mostly seem to think it represents a larger fraction of the budget than it really does.

HEADLINE: Obama and Romney Talk Foreign Policy

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: At the U.N. General Assembly, the president seemed to respond to his right-wing critics. 

 BODY:
Today was foreign policy day on the campaign trail, as President Obama addressed both the United Nations General Assembly and the Clinton Global Initiative, and Mitt Romney addressed the latter group. And what a day it was not.
When Mr. Romney discusses the economy, he extolls small and medium-sized businesses. And, what do you know, at the Clinton Global Initiative, he said a Romney administration would focus foreign aid efforts "on small and medium-sized businesses." Mr. Romney implied he'd handle foreign aid differently from the Obama administration, but mostly endorsed policies already in place-like using aid money to foster free enterprise.
In other words, Mr. Romney used a speech on foreign policy to remind voters, who surely don't need the reminder, that he's a market-oriented guy. Meanwhile, Mr. Obama used a speech on foreign policy to react, indirectly but unmistakably, to the Republican attack of the moment. He addressed the U.N. General Assembly, but it often sounded as though he were responding to his right-wing critics.

The Romney campaign likes to say that Mr. Obama projects weakness to hostile foreign powers, a claim it's emphasized since the death of Ambassador Stevens. Here's what Paul Ryan said in Lima, Ohio yesterday: "They're burning our flags in capitals all around the world. They're storming our embassies. We've lost four of our diplomats. And what is the signal that our government is sending the rest of the world? We're being equivocal on our values, we're being slow to speak up for -- for individual rights, for human rights, for democracy. We're seeing countries stifle freedom in Iran, in Russia, in all these other areas. And we're saying we're going to gut our national security, our military."
So I don't think it's a coincidence that, at the United Nations, Mr. Obama vigorously defended free speech rights. He denounced the stupid anti-Muslim video that sparked riots in some Muslim countries, and then denounced the violence that grew out of the video in strong terms. "There is no speech that justifies mindless violence," he said. "There are no words that excuse the killing of innocents. There's no video that justifies an attack on an embassy."
Mr. Obama pledged American support for democracy movements in the Middle East and vowed to bring to justice those who killed the American diplomats in Libya. He called on leaders of Muslim countries to permit freedom of expression despite its costs.
He also had some rough words for Iran, saying the United States "will do what we must to prevent Iran from obtaining" the bomb.
There's no telling how Tehran will respond to that promise. But certainly Mr. Obama's toughness didn't convince anyone on the Romney campaign. Dan Senor, a Romney adviser, told Andrea Mitchell today that Mr. Obama's speech contained "nothing new" and that there had been "no progress" on many issues.
But it's hard to say what, if anything, Mr. Romney would do differently. Asked if Mr. Romney would actually go to war with Iran, Mr. Senor answered: "Gov. Romney has not advocated military action and any suggestion that he has by the president or his surrogates is a mischaracterization. What Gov. Romney's concern is, is a weak posture in the region makes war more likely."
Sometimes it sounds like the Romney camp is actually arguing that the mere fact of Mr. Romney's victory would turn things around all over the world. "We need a strong national security," his running mate, Paul Ryan, said recently. "If we project weakness, they come. If we are strong, they, our adversaries will not test us and our allies will respect us."

 3:39 p.m. | Updated Mitt Romney laid out the broad outlines of his plan to foster work opportunities and free enterprise in developing nations on Tuesday morning, suggesting during a speech at the Clinton Global Initiative in New York that he would make foreign aid conditional on progress on these fronts.
Mr. Romney's speech at the conference came a few hours before President Obama appeared at the event, where he spoke at length about the fight against human trafficking.
It was a rare instance of the two presidential candidates on the same stage, albeit at different times.
Referring in his remarks to a hypothetical program he called "Prosperity Pacts," Mr. Romney talked about his desire to use aid initiatives, like the ones President Clinton's group supports, to encourage lasting change in the Middle East and other developing regions. 
"Working with the private sector, the program will identify the barriers to investment and trade and entrepreneurialism in developing nations," he said. "In exchange for removing those barriers and opening their markets to U.S. investment and trade, developing nations will receive U.S. assistance packages focused on developing the institutions of liberty, the rule of law, and property rights."
He added: "The aim of a much larger share of our aid must be the promotion of work and the fostering of free enterprise. Nothing we can do as a nation will change lives and nations more effectively and permanently than sharing the insight that lies at the foundation of America's own economy - and that is that free people pursuing happiness in their own ways build a strong and prosperous nation."
Mr. Romney said his aid proposal would focus its efforts on small and medium-size businesses abroad, using microfinance techniques.
Mr. Romney described what he believes are the three objectives of foreign aid - to address humanitarian needs, like treating those suffering from HIV and AIDS abroad; to foster the strategic interests of the United States abroad, be it military, diplomatic or economic; and to create conditions for long-term progress and tangible results in countries that receive the aid.
This third goal - "aid that elevates people and brings about lasting change in communities and nations" - he said, would be "a much higher priority in a Romney administration."
In his address, Mr. Romney also made sure to praise Mr. Clinton, who, at the Democratic National Convention, offered a forceful warning against returning Republicans to the White House. Referring to Mr. Clinton's widely lauded speech, Mr. Romney joked: "If there's one thing we've learned in this election season, by the way, it is that a few words from Bill Clinton can do any man a lot of good. All I've got to do now is wait a couple of days for that bounce to happen."
In his address, President Obama, who also spoke at the United Nations General Assembly earlier in the day, said human trafficking "must be called by its true name, modern slavery."
"When a man desperate for work finds himself in a factory or on a fishing boat or in a field, working, toiling for little or no pay and beaten if he tries to escape, that is slavery," he said. "When a woman is locked in a sweatshop or trapped in a home as a domestic servant, alone and abused and incapable of leaving, that's slavery. When a little boy is kidnapped, turned into a child soldier, forced to kill or be killed, that's slavery. When a little girl is sold by her impoverished family -- girls my daughters' age -- runs away from home, or is lured by the false promise of a better life and then imprisoned in a brothel and tortured if she resists, that's slavery. It is barbaric and it is evil, and it has no place in a civilized world."
Listing several steps the administration has taken to confront the problem, he added that "for all the progress that we've made, the bitter truth is that trafficking also goes on right here in the United States." The State Department's annual report on the problem now covers the United States as well as the rest of the world, he said. Law enforcement agencies are doing more to target trafficking networks, and "last year we charged a record number of these predators with human trafficking."

HEADLINE: Bipartisan Agreement: Bring Back N.F.L. Officials

BYLINE: NICK CORASANITI


HIGHLIGHT: Following the latest, and perhaps most egregious, disputed call by the replacement officials in the Green Bay-Seattle game Monday night, politicians from both parties are echoing many fans' frustrations and calling for an end to the lockout. 

 BODY:
Few events transcend politics, especially in a campaign year. The National Football League's lockout of its game officials appears to be one of them. 
Following the latest, and perhaps most egregious, disputed call by the replacement officials in the Green Bay-Seattle game Monday night, politicians from both parties are echoing many fans' frustrations and calling for an end to the lockout. 
In a personally signed Twitter message from his campaign account, President Obama expressed hope for a quick end to the lockout. 
NFL fans on both sides of the aisle hope the refs' lockout is settled soon. -bo
- Barack Obama (@BarackObama)25 Sep 12
Later, according to pool reports, ABC's Devon Dwyer shouted "Packers" to Mr. Obama as he exited Marine One and headed toward the White House. The one-word question was enough to make Mr. Obama stop to talk to the press. 
"Terrible," Mr. Obama said of the game. "I've been saying for months, we've gotta get our refs back." 
Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who has made his battle against unions a staple of his tenure, took to Twitter to call for the return of the unionized officials. 
After catching a few hours of sleep, the #Packers game is still just as painful. #Returntherealrefs
- Governor Walker (@GovWalker)25 Sep 12
Jon Erpenbach, a Democratic state senator from Wisconsin who has clashed in the past with Mr. Walker, agreed with the governor on Twitter.
If tonights game doesnt make the NFL settle with the real refs this season will be a joke.
- Jon Erpenbach (@JonErpenbach)25 Sep 12
And former President Bill Clinton, who is enjoying an all-time high in popularity, is using his rediscovered national microphone to express his dismay at the N.F.L. 
"The Packers will wake up this morning and just sort of shake their head and say, 'We should have won by two touchdowns,' " Mr. Clinton said on Tuesday with MSNBC's "Morning Joe." The former president continued his criticism in an interview with CNN's Piers Morgan, arguing that "we need to get the strike over and get more experienced people in there."
But that doesn't mean some aren't politicizing it.
In a town hall meeting in Cincinnati on Tuesday, Representative Paul D. Ryan, a devoted Green Bay Packers fan, likened the much-maligned officials to Mr. Obama's budget staff. 
"I half-think these refs work part time for the Obama administration in the Budget Office," Mr. Ryan said. "They see the national debt clock staring them in the face, they see a debt crisis and they just ignore and pretend it didn't even happen." 
Later in the speech, he tweaked a well-worn line from his standard stump speech, saying, "Unlike the Seattle Seahawks last night, we want to deserve this victory, we want to earn this victory."
For those N.F.L. fans hoping for executive intervention from the Sports Fan in Chief, Mr. Obama doesn't appear to have a phone call scheduled to the N.F.L. commissioner, Roger Goodell. Last week, in a radio interview with Bill Willis, of WTAM-AM in Cleveland, the president said, "But one thing I got to say, though, is it just me or do we have to get our regular refs back?," before adding, "I can't get involved in it, but I'm just expressing my point of view as a sports fan."

HEADLINE: Candidates Address Class Size and Teachers' Unions at Education Forum

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: The issue of class size in schools was injected into the presidential race as Mitt Romney said that while governor of Massachusetts, he was able to do more with less during an economic downturn. 

 BODY:
Though education has not been a major focus in the presidential campaign, the charged issue of class size was injected into the race on Tuesday as Mitt Romney said that while governor of Massachusetts, he was able to do more with less during an economic downturn. 
He repeated assertions made during the Republican primary campaign that slightly larger classes -- a result of cuts in Massachusetts state aid to schools in 2003 and 2004 -- were not as important in student learning as the quality of teachers. 
President Obama's campaign quickly responded with a video featuring a former Massachusetts school superintendent attacking the cuts and a fifth-grade teacher saying, "Come be in a classroom with fifth graders and tell me class size doesn't matter.'' 
Education - mainly given lip service in the national campaign - received detailed attention as Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama wedged in appearances at an education forum on Tuesday around more high-profile speeches in New York City on foreign affairs.
Mr. Romney also attacked teachers' unions for opposing merit pay tied to testing and for supporting Democrats who negotiate contracts with them. He criticized the role of Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama's former chief of staff, who negotiated with the teachers' union in the recently ended Chicago strike.
"I don't mean to be terribly partisan, but I kind of am,'' Mr. Romney said at the forum, Education Nation, sponsored by NBC News, drawing laughs. 
In July, Mr. Romney laid out a detailed agenda for education, including vouchers and restoring private banks to the subsidized college-loan market, but he rarely mentions these on the campaign trail, preferring to speak in generalities. Before an audience of educators and policy mavens, however, he returned to specifics, including his support for A-to-F grades for public schools and for transforming $25 billion in federal aid to schools into a program of vouchers for poor and disabled students.
Mr. Obama, who spoke in a taped interview, accused Mr. Romney and his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, of teacher-bashing and of favoring deep cuts in government aid to education.
"They talk a good game about reform, but when you actually look at their budgets, they are talking about slashing our investment in education by 20 percent, 25 percent,'' Mr. Obama said. 
Behind the debate over class size, school choice and other education issues is a traditional left-right fight over public spending, although these days many Democratic reformers, including the president, have embraced parts of the Republican agenda. 
Research from the 1980s showed students in early grades in classes of 13 to 17 performed significantly better than students in classes of 22 to 25. Many states passed laws limiting class size.
But since then some economists have argued that an effective teacher has more of an impact on learning. One Democrat who has expressed support for the cost-effectiveness argument is Arne Duncan, Mr. Obama's secretary of education. Mr. Romney praised Mr. Duncan at Education Nation, but he dodged a question about whether he would reappoint him in a Romney administration.

HEADLINE: An Electric Carmaker Struggles as Its Production Lags

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: To ease a financial crisis, Tesla, the maker of a high-performance electric car, said it had renegotiated the terms of an energy loan from the government. 

 BODY:
As Tesla Motors, a maker of electric cars, burns through cash and misses production targets, it is turning to investors and taxpayers for extra financial help.
On Tuesday, Tesla announced plans to sell five million shares to raise cash. The federal government agreed earlier to waive some conditions of a $465 million loan, easing pressure on the company over the next couple of quarters. The moves raised questions about the long-term viability of the company.
In recent months, Tesla has been ramping up production of its main vehicle, a high-performance sedan called the Model S that goes from zero to 60 miles per hour in 4.4 seconds. Tesla has started rolling out the first cars, but was four to five weeks behind on delivering the vehicles to customers. In the meantime, it is consuming cash at a rapid rate and cut its revenue forecast on Tuesday.
 "Tesla's story is starting to show some serious cracks," said Carter Driscoll, an analyst at CapStone Investments. "This shows that capital raising is a necessity, not a luxury, as the company had maintained."
Tesla's problems could also spark criticism of the government's energy loan program, which has been heavily promoted by the Obama administration. The program came under fire after Solyndra, a solar-panel maker, collapsed in 2011 owing taxpayers $535 million.
In Tesla's case, the moves suggested that cash was getting tight.
Under the new terms of the loan, Tesla received extra time to make a future payment, and will not have to pass a test this quarter that compares short-term assets with short-term liabilities.
But the Energy Department extracted a concession that by the end of October, Tesla must submit a plan for early repayment of the loan.
Deepak Ahuja, Tesla's chief financial officer, said the changes to the loan were "purely a normal course of events" because Tesla's business model had evolved.
Tesla is now entering a critical phase. The company has fully drawn down the government loan, and shareholders may not be happy with additional stock offerings. Its share price fell $3, or 10 percent on Tuesday, to $27.66 a share, down from a 12-month high of $38.01 in April.
Amid the financial pressure, investors will look for signs that sales of the Model S will lead to strong cash flows.
Mr. Ahuja said that he expected Tesla's operations to produce positive cash flows soon. In the first six months of this year, Tesla showed a cash drain of $111 million.
Mr. Driscoll, the Capstone analyst, asked: "When do people start to question their ability to execute?"
Tesla will also test customers' loyalties. Some early customers who have received their Model S cars are extremely pleased. Rob Stelling, a clinical laboratory scientist in St. Helena, Calif., who got car his earlier this month, said it had exceeded his expectations.
"I give more than 10 rides a day," Mr. Stelling said. "I think I've sold at least five."
Buyers are paying a hefty sum to reserve the Model S. The deposit on the basic model, which sells for about $57,400 before tax credits, is $5,000. Souped-up versions require larger deposits.
Such payments have been a big source of cash for the company. At the end of June, Tesla was holding $133.4 million of reservation payments. But if production delays worsen, customers may question the wisdom of making substantial reservation payments to Tesla.
"I wish Tesla could meet the production target, because it's better for the company," said John Griswell, a computer engineer from Austin, Tex., who put down $5,000 for a Model S but had not yet received it. "But it's also important that they get the product right."
In the end, Tesla's fortunes will depend on the size of the market beyond the enthusiastic early buyers.
"People are going to want these cars because they're great," Mr. Griswell said.

HEADLINE: Obama Without Romney

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: What if the choice on Nov. 6 was just to vote up or down on the president's performance? 

 BODY:
Imagine, for a moment, that the 2012 election really was the pure referendum that Mitt Romney's campaign strategists apparently expected it to be. Imagine that both the Republican challenger and his party were completely invisible on the campaign trail, that the press was allowed only to cover the incumbent, and that on Nov. 6 the choice was whether to vote "up" or "down" on President Obama's performance. How would the last three weeks have played out for the president?
Not necessarily all that well. They started with Obama's lackluster convention speech, which seemed to put a ceiling on the bounce that the rest of the Democratic National Convention had created for him. They continued with another mediocre jobs report, followed by the Federal Reserve's announcement that it would make a third attempt to stimulate the still-stagnant economy with massive bond purchases - a decision that boosted stocks and consumer confidence but also served as an implicit indictment of this administration's economic stewardship. 
Then came a week's worth of grim news from the Middle East and North Africa, during which time the White House - whose Libya policy has been sold with evasions and dishonesties from the beginning - alternately stonewalled and dissembled on what exactly happened at the American consulate in Benghazi. This unrest in the Arab world coincided with the official end of the Obama-ordered American surge of forces in Afghanistan, which attracted little press coverage but probably deserved more: the surge was one of the president's biggest foreign policy gambles, and it produced few obvious benefits at a high cost in lives. 
Finally the president took to the airwaves for a pair of interviews - with Univision and 60 Minutes - that included a number of awkward moments: a weird attempt to distance himself from his own negative ads; a weirder suggestion that he's learned as president that "you can't change Washington from the inside"; and a too-casual dismissal of Middle Eastern unrest and American deaths as mere "bumps in the road."
There was more than enough material, in other words, to tell the story of a president adrift: overshadowed by Bill Clinton and Ben Bernanke at home; uncertain how to respond to strategic failures abroad; and lacking any obvious vision for what a second term might offer the country beyond a continuation of the current large-deficit, slow-growth slog. ("This is not the time," David Axelrod said on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" when asked about the White House's plans to deal with Social Security's looming shortfalls.)
But instead the story of the last few weeks has been all about Mitt Romney - his campaign's infighting, his weakening swing-state numbers, his muddled message, his dismissal of 47 percent of Americans as pathetic supporting characters in an Ayn Rand melodrama.
Is this focus just a case of media bias, as many conservatives have alleged? Yes, in the sense that the White House has been getting too free a pass on its absentee domestic policy and shifting foreign policy narratives. As Howard Fineman of the Huffington Post noted this week, Obama is campaigning for re-election "without having to seriously and substantively defend his first-term failed promises or shortcomings, and without having to say much, if anything, about what, if anything, he might do substantially differently if he is fortunate enough to win again." Yes, too, in the sense that the horse race coverage has sometimes helped ratify the sense that 8 percent unemployment and trillion-dollar deficits are a new normal for which the current president doesn't actually bear that much responsibility.
But no, in the sense that Romney could have avoided almost all of his current difficulties, media bias or no, through the simple expedient of running a modestly more competent and creative campaign.
Instead, the Republican nominee seems to be running to prove two points about political science and the presidency. First, that every presidential campaign is actually a referendum on the challenger as well as on the incumbent, and second, that it's entirely possible for voters to ultimately reject a challenger even when they think the incumbent might deserve to be defeated.
In the second point, though, lurks the only remaining hope for the Republican ticket: Their dislike for Romney notwithstanding, voters really are still open to the possibility that Obama might not deserve re-election. This is why 2012 still looks more like 1976 and 2004, when the country split almost down the middle on the question of whether the incumbent should be returned, than it does like the re-election cakewalks of Reagan, Clinton, Nixon, Johnson or Ike.
Romney trails - but only by a few points. Obama leads - but with approval and "re-elect" numbers that are only brushing up against the necessary 50 percent. The country has been tilting toward the Democrats - but only for a few short weeks.
There are six weeks to go. In 2004, John Kerry made up about 4 points in the polls between late September and election day. In 2000, George W. Bush gained a similar amount of ground between the conventions and November. Since 1968, Sean Trende points out, in presidential races featuring an incumbent president, the polls have moved an average of 3.7 points toward the challenger between the incumbent's convention and the actual vote.
As of this writing, Romney trails in the RealClearPolitics polling average by almost exactly that figure - 3.8 points. He has squandered almost two seasons' worth of opportunities and allowed his failures as a candidate to eclipse his opponent's failures as a president. But as he prepares for the debates that offer his last best chance, he has one reason to be hopeful: The case he has failed to make is still there to be made.
 An earlier version of this column misstated the status of the American diplomatic outpost that was attacked in Benghazi; it was an American consulate, not the American embassy.

HEADLINE: As the People's Priest, He Fought for the Forgotten of the Bronx

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
The Rev. John C. Flynn could have been a monsignor, but as he told the story in later years, he refused the elevation because he already held a title more to his liking: the people's priest.
Father Flynn, 83, who spent a half-century championing the poor, the disadvantaged and the forgotten of the Bronx, died on Monday at the Schervier Nursing Care Center in Riverdale after a long debilitating illness, according to his family.
"He did not need any title, he did not need any accolades, he just wanted to be a parish priest," said Heidi Hynes, the executive director of the Mary Mitchell Family and Youth Center, who used to receive regular visits from Father Flynn asking what could be done to help the needy. 
Tall and lanky with bright blue eyes, Father Flynn reached into the seediest corners of the Bronx and offered a helping hand, relatives and friends said. He started a campaign called Save a Generation to give education and job training to high school dropouts; walked the streets trading crucifixes for guns in an optimistic but futile effort to make neighborhoods safer; and attended hundreds of meetings to lobby for a better life for families, by building more low-cost housing or saving community gardens.
In the late 1970s, when the South Bronx was awash in crime and despair, he joined with local activists to help tenants who were living without heat or hot water for weeks at a time. He showed them how to stand up for themselves and reclaim their neighborhoods.
"These were human beings and not pieces of furniture to be thrown out," said the Rev. Neil Connolly, who worked alongside Father Flynn in the Bronx and is now pastor of St. Mary's Church in the Lower East Side. "All of us knew we would not be forever in the South Bronx, so there had to be not only development of buildings and property but also the development of people. Our way was not to do things for people but to help them do things for themselves."
Father Flynn was the second oldest of four children of a civil engineer and a homemaker, both Catholics, and he grew up in Crestwood, a middle-class enclave in Yonkers. Even as a youngster, he had the makings of a future priest, recalled his sister, Mary Ellen Loveless, who still lives in Crestwood. "As children, he would give me sermons and we would sit there like we were in church," Ms. Loveless, 77, said. "He would give communion."
He had severe asthma and spent some of his childhood living with family friends in Saranac Lake, N.Y., where the air was easier on his lungs, his sister said. After returning home to Yonkers, he graduated from Roosevelt High School, and later attended Saint Joseph's Seminary.
Father Flynn, who was ordained in 1955, was dispatched as a new priest to Pocantico Hills, in Westchester County, where one of his duties was visiting patients at a nearby hospital, Ms. Loveless said. He later went to the Bronx and worked at the Church of Saint Raymond in Parkchester in the 1960s and '70s.
In a 2010 interview, Father Flynn recalled that his efforts to integrate the church in what was then a largely Irish neighborhood with black and Hispanic parishioners met resistance. He recalled being told, "If you love them so much, why don't you go live with them?"
That led to his moving to Venezuela, where he spent several years ministering to poor families and learning Spanish before returning to the Bronx.
At his last parish, St. Martin of Tours in Crotona, his daily rounds included ministering to drug dealers, drug addicts and working-class families who had fallen on hard times. Just about the only time that Father Flynn was not walking the neighborhood, former parishioners said, was on Mondays, when he played golf.
"Greatness takes many forms,'' said Mark Naison, a professor at Fordham University who worked with Father Flynn at Save a Generation. "It is not always associated with wealth and power and fame. In the Bronx, it may have reached its highest point in the person of a parish priest who walked the street with the lost boys of the community while bullets were flying. And who those boys learned to love as much as everyone else who knew him."
In 2010, Father Flynn retired to a residence for priests in Riverdale and later moved to the Schervier nursing home. Even then, he continued visiting his old neighborhoods to check on the poor; he was particularly concerned that they not be displaced by rising rents and a bad economy.
Ms. Hynes recalled that Father Flynn would tell her, "I can't remember my name and address but I can remember we are supposed to be helping poor people."
At the nursing home, Father Flynn would minister to other patients and bless them. In his room was a handwritten note that he had scrawled, with much difficulty, sometime in the last year, Ms. Loveless said.
It read: "Priest of the people - To bring my relatives to be lovers of Jesus Christ who prepares us to follow Him into Heaven filled with united love for each other like a family - Become united and loving God and each other."
Father Flynn had written July 28, 1929 - his birth date - both at the top and bottom of the note.
"I guess,'' his sister said, "that is what he figured his life was supposed to be."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Hedge Fund's Complex Scheme May Cost It Millions

BYLINE: By STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF.

 BODY:
Hedge funds are supposed to be the smart money, but sometimes even they can be outsmarted.
Take the case of Mason Capital Management and the Telus Corporation, a large Canadian telecommunications company. Mason Capital, a New York and London hedge fund with about $8 billion in assets under management, has made a complex bet in Telus stock that looked shrewd at first, but that may now lose tens of millions of dollars.
Telus has two classes of shares, one that is voting and trades only in Canada and another that is nonvoting and trades in Canada and the United States. The nonvoting shares traditionally trade at a discount to the voting shares, but Telus is proposing to convert the shares on a one-for-one basis, giving a windfall to the holders of nonvoting shares. 
Mason has taken a complex trading position in opposition to the proposal. In April, the hedge fund announced that it had acquired 19 percent of Telus's voting stock, worth 1.9 billion Canadian dollars, or $1.8 billion.
Mason was able to finance this position by setting up a roughly equivalent short position in Telus's nonvoting common stock, betting that those shares would fall. Basically, for every dollar that Mason earned on the voting shares, it would lose a dollar on the nonvoting shares. Since Mason is almost perfectly hedged, this was a bet that Telus's proposal would fail, causing the nonvoting stock to lose value and the voting stock to gain.
Pretty clever, right?
Mason has no real economic interest in the future of the company because of its offsetting positions, but it can still vote its 19 percent against the share conversion proposal. This anomaly has led Telus to claim that Mason is an "empty voter" - voting shares in which it has no economic interest "at the expense of other shareholders."
The hedge fund has argued that Telus is seeking to hand the nonvoting shareholders free money by collapsing the shares at a 1-to-1 ratio instead of at the traditional discount.
According to Mason, "over the past 13 years, Telus voting shares have traded at an average premium of 4.83 percent relative to the nonvoting shares; the premium has been as high as 15.23 percent." The hedge fund also argues that the Telus directors who approved this transaction are conflicted because 89 percent of their total holdings are in the nonvoting shares.
In response, Telus claims that the lack of a discount is justified because the voting shares would get additional liquidity.
Mason won Round 1 of this argument in May, when Telus withdrew its proposal.
At the same time, Telus also planted the seeds to thwart Mason's trade. The company announced that it would try again to collapse the shares at some future time. This gave price support to the nonvoting shares and prevented Mason from cashing out its position.
Mason reportedly hired the Blackstone Group to look at strategic alternatives for its Telus stake, but was unable to sell it.
In August, the fund sought to press the issue by calling a shareholder meeting to amend Telus's charter to prevent the nonvoting shares from being converted into voting shares without a discount.
This started Round 2.
Telus again proposed that the shares be collapsed. But in a twist, the company has structured the transaction so that only a majority of the voting shares are needed to approve it, instead of the 66 2/3 vote initially required. The reduction in the number of necessary votes gives the proposal a much better chance of passing despite Mason's 19 percent holding.
Telus also refused to hold a special meeting. The battle came before the Supreme Court of British Columbia, and on Sept. 11, the court rejected on technical grounds Mason's effort to force Telus to hold the meeting. But in an aside, the court heavily criticized the hedge fund for its voting strategy, calling it "empty voting." The court stated that "the practice of empty voting presents a challenge to shareholder democracy ... when a party has a vote in a company but no economic interest in that company, that party's interests may not lie in the well-being of the company itself." Mason has appealed the ruling.
Unless a higher court intervenes, the share collapse is heading to a shareholder vote on Oct. 17. Given that only a majority vote is needed, Telus may have the votes necessary to push the measure through.
And with the decision of the Canadian court, other hedge funds appear to have closed out their positions in Telus, further narrowing the spread between the share classes.
On paper, Mason's trade was a deliciously clever scheme that made perfect sense. But once the trade went public, its position in Telus raised eyebrows. Mason has argued that it is not an empty voter because its interests are aligned with the voting shareholders; the conversion will be at their expense. That message may make sense, but the messenger has been viewed with suspicion. As a result, Mason has had a hard time persuading Canadian shareholders to support it.
And with the nonvoting shares still holding on to their earlier gains, Mason finds itself boxed in. Telus's total market value has increased by $2 billion since February. Mason would have made much more money - hundreds of millions, in fact - had it simply taken a long position.
Lost in all of this maneuvering are the economic merits of Telus's share collapse and the fact that nonvoting shares do appear to be getting a significant benefit that may be inappropriate.
According to sources close to Mason, the trade is currently profitable. But Mason is finding that its ingenious trade may lose it millions, thanks to the equally adroit maneuvering of Telus. Who said Canadians were too nice?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Taxes Threaten Community Descended From Slaves

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
SAPELO ISLAND, Ga. -- Once the huge property tax bills started coming, telephones started ringing. It did not take long for the 50 or so people who live on this largely undeveloped barrier island to realize that life was about to get worse.
Sapelo Island, a tangle of salt marsh and sand reachable only by boat, holds the largest community of people who identify themselves as saltwater Geechees. Sometimes called the Gullahs, they have inhabited the nation's southeast coast for more than two centuries. Theirs is one of the most fragile cultures in America.
These Creole-speaking descendants of slaves have long held their land as a touchstone, fighting the kind of development that turned Hilton Head and St. Simons Islands into vacation destinations. Now, stiff county tax increases driven by a shifting economy, bureaucratic bumbling and the unyielding desire for a house on the water have them wondering if their community will finally succumb to cultural erosion.
''The whole thing just smells,'' said Jasper Watts, whose mother, Annie Watts, 73, still owns the three-room house with a tin roof that she grew up in. 
She paid $362 in property taxes last year for the acre she lives on. This year, McIntosh County wants $2,312, a jump of nearly 540 percent.
Where real estate is concerned, history is always on the minds of the Geechees, who live in a place called Hog Hammock. It is hard for them not to be deeply suspicious of the tax increase and wonder if, as in the past, they are being nudged even further to the fringes.
Theirs is the only private land left on the island, almost 97 percent of which is owned by the state and given over to nature preserves, marine research projects and a plantation mansion built in 1802.
The tobacco heir R. J. Reynolds Jr. bought the mansion and most of the island during the Great Depression, persuading the Geechees who owned the rest to move to 400 swampy inland acres. Today, Hog Hammock is not much more than a collection of small houses and a historic cemetery, with a dusty general store and a part-time restaurant, Lula's Kitchen, where shrimp and sausage are transformed into a low-country boil, a classic example of Sea Islands cooking.
That kind of history makes it hard for people to believe county officials who say there is no effort afoot to push them from the land. The county has offered 15 percent reductions in tax bills until the appeals that most people have filed can be heard. But it is going to be a challenge to pay even the reduced rate. While there is work cooking and cleaning for visitors to the plantation house, maintaining state research facilities or renting space to vacationers, money is difficult to find.
The relationship between Sapelo Island residents and county officials has long been strained, especially over race and development. In July, the community relations division of the Justice Department held two meetings with residents to address charges of racial discrimination. A department spokesman said the meetings were confidential and would not comment.
Neither would the chief tax appraiser, Rick Daniel, or other elected county officials. But Brett Cook, who manages the county and its only city, Darien, says local government does a lot to support the Geechee culture.
''It's a wonderful history and a huge draw for our ecotourism,'' he said.
This summer, he pointed out, the county worked with the Smithsonian to host a festival that culminated in a concert with members of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and the Geechee Gullah Ring Shouters, who practice a style of singing and hand claps developed by slaves.
The issue, said Mr. Cook and other county officials who would speak only if their names were not used, is not one of cultural genocide. They are just trying to clean up years of bad management and correct property taxes that were kept artificially low by questionable policies.
McIntosh County has a history of bureaucratic mistakes and election corruption. Its rocky political landscape was the subject of a book, ''Praying for Sheetrock,'' by Melissa Fay Greene, which detailed its racial segregation and the 1970s fight between a domineering white sheriff and people who wanted to elect the first black government official.
The county, which has about 14,000 year-round residents and thousands more with vacation homes, had for years put off reviewing its taxable property. An outside firm did the last valuation in 2004. Paul Griffin, the chairman of the Board of Tax Assessors, called the work ''very, very sloppy'' at a June meeting covered by The Darien News.
In 2009, the county was in the process of updating its tax digest when the state froze property taxes to help stanch the effects of the recession. Instead of continuing its work, the county stopped the process until this year.
Meanwhile, property was sold -- some of it to wealthy people interested in vacation homes on the mainland and some on Sapelo Island. Those sales never made it to the tax records until now.
''We're rural, we're on the coast and we're desirable,'' Mr. Cook said. ''When the market got hot six or seven years ago, a lot of individuals holding $15,000 or $20,000 lots on the marsh could sell them for $100,000 or $150,000.''
The county also started a new garbage pickup service and added other services, which contributed to the higher tax rates, he said. Sapelo Island residents, however, still have to haul their trash to the dump.
''Our taxes went up so high, and then you don't have nothing to show for it,'' said Cornelia Walker Bailey, the island's unofficial historian. ''Where is my fire department? Where are my water resources? Where is my paved road? Where are the things our tax dollars pay for?''
Here, where land is usually handed down or sold at below-market rates to relatives, Ms. Bailey has come to hold four pieces of property. She lives on one, which is protected from the tax increases by a homestead exemption. The rest will cost her 600 percent more in property taxes. ''I think it's an effort to erode everyone out of the last private sector of this island,'' she said.
Government systems have been devised to try to save Sapelo Island's Geechee culture. Hog Hammock is on the National Register of Historic Places, and the state created a Sapelo Island Heritage Authority in 1983, which the governor oversees. But critics contend that the authority could serve as a vehicle to more development.
State lawmakers have discussed creating a trust that would protect land from development but allow residents who could not afford to keep their property to stay. But that is still just an idea.
The National Park Service recently released a 272-page management plan for the Gullah Geechee Cultural Heritage Corridor, which stretches from Wilmington, N.C., to Jacksonville, Fla. It calls for creative solutions to preserving Gullah land, said Michael Allen, the service's foremost expert on the community, of which he is also a member.
But it says nothing about how to fight the tax collector.
State Senator William Ligon, who represents the county and is a real estate lawyer, suggests that residents file a lawsuit if they do not get relief.
''In an economy where property values have been declining, I think I would want to look very, very closely at what had been done at the county level,'' he said.
None of that offers immediate relief to residents who have tax bills piled up on kitchen tables and in desk drawers.
Sharron Grovner, 44, is one of them. Her mother, Lula Walker, runs the little restaurant on the island. Ms. Grovner buried her father not too long ago. Her family has more than four acres of property and faces more than $6,000 in taxes. Like most, they have appealed. ''You can do the best you can do for a year, but then you are going to need some kind of help,'' she said.
Still, they are not going to let go of the land. ''It's like this,'' she said. ''People like me don't sell their property.''

1912 Balkan Peril Called Serious
VIENNA -- Count Berchtold, Austro-Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs, in his speech yesterday [Sept. 25] to the Foreign Affairs Commission of the Hungarian Delegations stated that events in the Balkans were absorbing to an increased extent the attention of Austria-Hungary. Austria-Hungary, he said, had taken the initiative in obtaining an exchange of views between the Powers in regard to the situation in the Balkans. Her object had been to give time, and, if desired, advice calculated to aid in realization of the policy and the re-establishment of order. 
1937 Spending Pace to Be Reduced
GARDINER, Montana -- After seven speeches from the rear platform of his private train, President Roosevelt broke his Journey to the Pacific Coast today [Sept. 25], to pass the week end with Mrs. Roosevelt, at Yellowstone National Park. Speaking at Casper, Wyo., the President promised that the pace of Federal spending would be reduced, thus giving strength to reports from Washington that the Administration is making drastic efforts to attain a balanced budget. He said a reduction of expenditures was now possible ''because there isn't anything like the unemployment today that existed when I first came into office.'' The President said constitutional democracy was succeeding ''despite the obstacles thrown in its way.''
1962 Mao Views Thais As Neutral
SAIGON -- Cambodia's head of state, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, has revealed that China's Chairman Mao Tse-tung had advised him to keep on good terms with Thailand because there was a possibility that the government would break its alliance with the United States and adopt a neutral policy. At the same time, according to Prince Sihanouk, Mr. Mao told him that Cambodia could ''punish'' South Vietnam at any time, and that if Cambodia did so it could count on China's support. Prince Sihanouk made this disclosure in the weekly ''Réalités Cambodgiennes.'' His theme was that Cambodia owes its survival to the balance of great-power rivalries in Southeast Asia. Because of this rivalry, Prince Sihanouk has been able to invoke the aid of Red countries against Thailand and South Vietnam.

HEADLINE: Olympus and Ex-Executives Plead Guilty in Accounting Fraud

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Japanese camera and medical equipment maker Olympus Corporation and three of its former executives pleaded guilty on Tuesday over charges related to a $1.7 billion accounting cover-up in one of Japan's biggest corporate scandals. 
The scandal was exposed last October by Olympus's chief executive, Michael C. Woodford, who was fired by the company's board after asking about deals that were later found to have been used to conceal the losses.
Revelations of the accounting fraud revived calls for more outside scrutiny of its boardrooms but have failed to result in sweeping corporate governance reforms similar to those introduced a decade ago in the wake of scandals such as that at Enron in the United States.
''The full responsibility lies with me and I feel deeply sorry for causing trouble to our business partners, shareholders and the wider public,'' the former chairman, Tsuyoshi Kikukawa, told the Tokyo district court at the start of the trial nearly a year after the cover-up first came to light.
''I take full responsibility for what happened.''
Prosecutors charged Mr. Kikukawa; a former executive vice president, Hisashi Mori; and a former internal auditor, Hideo Yamada, with inflating the company's net worth in financial statements for five fiscal years to March 2011.
The three former executives had been identified by an investigative panel, commissioned by Olympus, as the main suspects in the fraud seeking to delay the reckoning from risky investments made in the late-1980s bubble economy.
The indictment did not specify what penalties the prosecutors would seek, but lawyers have said the former executives could face up to 10 years in jail and fines of up to 10 million yen (about $128,000). The company could be fined more than 100 million yen, according to the Japanese media.
What if any impact the company's guilty plea will have on Olympus will depend on what sentence, including a possible fine, the court hands down, said Tsuyoshi Oshima, a spokesman for the company. That decision could be several months away, he said.
''Lawsuits from shareholders are possible,'' Mr. Oshima said. The drop in Olympus's share price has already spurred 12 lawsuits, including 11 in Japan, he said.
Mr. Woodford campaigned to win his job back, but has given up, blaming cozy ties between management and big Japanese shareholders and citing the strain on his family.
Olympus has already admitted it tried to conceal investment losses by using improper accounting under a scheme that began in the 1990s.

HEADLINE: Europe Solar Group Seeks Wider China Trade Inquiry

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- Solar manufacturers called on European Union regulators on Tuesday to expand an investigation in China because of concerns that it unfairly subsidizes its clean energy industry.
The complaint is the second by EU ProSun, a group of European solar equipment manufacturers. Because of an earlier allegation by the group, the European Commission is already investigating whether Chinese manufacturers sold solar equipment for less than the cost of making it. 
That so-called antidumping investigation is the biggest case of its kind in terms of value, covering imports from China worth 21 billion euros, or $27 billion.
In the new complaint, EU ProSun asked the commission to look into whether Chinese state banks and the central government offered support that was illegal under World Trade Organization rules.
''For example, Chinese banks implement government policy by giving very low interest rates to solar manufacturers, and if the borrower cannot pay back the loan, it may be written off, extended indefinitely or paid off by other government-controlled entities,'' Milan Nitzschke, president of EU ProSun and a vice president of SolarWorld, a German company, said in a statement. ''This makes it easier, cheaper and a lot less risky for Chinese solar companies to obtain financing.''
EU ProSun also said that Chinese regions and localities granted subsidies by paying interest, electricity costs, transaction costs for land and value-added taxes, and by offering credit guarantees.
The growth of the Chinese solar equipment industry is a result in large part to the billions of euros in government subsidies that the European Union and national governments have put in place to promote installation of solar panels for homes and businesses.
Because the complaint was publicized after business hours in Beijing, the Chinese government will probably not have a reaction until later in the week.
This month, Shen Danyang, a spokesman for the Chinese Commerce Ministry, said the commission's decision to investigate the dumping allegations would hurt not only Chinese and European industry, but also the global development of clean energy.
The commission has 45 days to decide whether to start an investigation.
John Clancy, a spokesman for the European trade commissioner, Karel De Gucht, said he could not confirm the existence of the complaint, citing legal reasons.
The European case is already four or five times larger by value than a similar investigation under way in the United States, because the European Union is the biggest export market for Chinese solar panels.
But the United States case is more advanced. In May, the Commerce Department imposed preliminary antidumping tariffs of at least 31 percent on Chinese solar panels, added to preliminary antisubsidy tariffs of 2.9 percent to 4.73 percent imposed in March.
Ben Hill, president of Trina Solar Europe, which is part of one of China's largest solar equipment manufacturers, said state support for the solar industry was not exclusive to China.
''The entire solar industry worldwide, in China as well as in the E.U., has been benefiting from some sort of public support driven by the policy goal of promoting renewable energy,'' Mr. Hill said in a statement.
He added that the industry was going through a ''consolidation phase,'' and that a large number of Chinese solar companies had gone bankrupt over the last 18 months.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Germany Is Expected to Act to Increase Limits on High-Speed Trades

BYLINE: By MELISSA EDDY and JAMES KANTER; Melissa Eddy reported from Berlin and James Kanter from Brussels. Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt and Nathaniel Popper from New York.

 BODY:
BERLIN -- Germany intends to be one of the first countries to try to put the brakes on high-frequency trading, the computer-driven force that has been rattling stock markets across the globe.
Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is expected to approve draft legislation on Wednesday that would impose additional controls on such trading. The proposed measures include requiring that all high-frequency traders be licensed, requiring clear labeling of all financial products traded by powerful algorithms without human intervention and limiting the number of orders that may be placed without a corresponding trade. Traders who violate the limits, which would be set once the law took effect, would face a fine.
''The goal of the German law is to limit the risks linked to high-frequency trading,'' a government official said here Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity because the government had not yet approved the legislation. 
The legislation, which is subject to approval by both houses of Parliament, was written with an eye toward similar legislation being discussed in Brussels that could eventually apply across the European Union, which has 27 member nations, the official said.
Steps to pass the broader legislation on high-frequency trading are expected to proceed Wednesday, when the influential Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament will vote on how to update the law that governs securities trading to take account of new technologies.
The Europeans are not alone in their concern about high-speed computerized trading, which has led to several notorious market disruptions in recent years.
The latest occurred in early August in the United States, when problems with newly installed software caused the Knight Capital Group, a New Jersey broker that specializes in computer-driven trading, to lose $440 million. The problem led Knight's computers to rapidly buy and sell millions of shares in more than 100 stocks for about 45 minutes after the markets opened on a Wednesday. Those trades pushed the price of many stocks up, and Knight lost money when it had to sell the shares back into the market at a lower price the next day.
The Knight episode raised alarms on Wall Street and in Washington, but no new curbs have yet been proposed for high-frequency trading in the United States.
In Berlin, German officials have acknowledged that the technological advances of recent years have led to irrevocable changes in the nature of trading and that the fast pace must be accepted. By adopting tighter controls, they say they hope to protect the interests of all market participants.
The German draft legislation ''is deliberately arranged so that the Finance Ministry has the capability of making things more precise through provisions, and the stock markets are required by the law to be aware when the next trick from high-frequency traders pops up,'' said the official who spoke anonymously.
While high-frequency trading firms are unlikely to welcome tighter rules, Deutsche Börse, the main German stock exchange, based in Frankfurt, said it would welcome the greater supervisory powers that regulators would have under the proposed law.
''It is good for all parties acting on the German financial market that we now have legal certainty how to deal with high-frequency traders,'' the exchange said last week.
The European legislation under discussion, if approved in committee, is expected to become the basis for talks between representatives from the European Parliament and individual governments. Upon completion of that process, the draft measure would need the approval of the full European Parliament and all 27 of the European Union's members before becoming law.
The legislation would seek even tighter controls on fast trading than the German proposal. Among the most closely scrutinized aspects of the European measure are rules aimed at limiting the ability of algorithm-driven trading to exaggerate volatility in financial markets.
Markus Ferber, the lawmaker appointed by the European Parliament to report on the proposal, has recommended including rules to slow trading by a half-second, require all trading venues to institute ways to halt trading immediately and make it more expensive for traders to cancel large volumes of orders.
Those rules were needed to ''curb mere volumes brought by high-frequency trading'' and ''to restore genuinely liquid, orderly and fair markets,'' said Benoît Lallemand, a senior research analyst at Finance Watch in Brussels. ''Only such markets can serve the real economy.''
Mr. Lallemand said he expected the committee to approve Mr. Ferber's recommendations on Wednesday. ''The focus then should be that governments come up with an equally ambitious proposal,'' he said, though he said the legislation still could be watered down.

HEADLINE: Santander's Mexican Unit Sells U.S. Shares at $12.18 in Dual Listing

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
The Mexican arm of Banco Santander priced the American portion of its initial public offering at $12.18 on Tuesday, within its expected price range, according to a person briefed on the matter who declined to be identified. 
The unit, Grupo Financiero Santander México, sold additional shares on the Mexican Stock Exchange at 31.25 pesos each, at the middle of that offering's expected range. The lender hoped to raise up to $4.2 billion through the dual listing, one of the biggest stock sales ever by a Mexican company.
When it begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday under the ticker symbol BSMX, Santander México will become the only Mexican lender listed on the Big Board. The offering was largely seen as a way to tap into Mexico's growth prospects as investors hunt for ways to gain greater exposure to international markets.
The offering for the unit was also seen as a test for investors on a number of fronts. Its size, trailing only Facebook's $18 billion stock sale for the year, was seen as potentially daunting at a time when the I.P.O. market has stagnated. The number of initial offerings priced this year has slid nearly 50 percent from 2011, according to data from Renaissance Capital.
And Santander México will still be closely tied to its parent, one of Spain's biggest banks and a closely watched proxy of that country's financial health. Banco Santander is expected to control about 75 percent of the company, raising the prospect that it may flood the market with additional shares if it needs to raise more capital.
Neither its size nor its Spanish parent appeared to be a major hurdle for investors. Santander México's offering was about two times oversubscribed, according to Scott Sweet, the senior managing partner of IPO Boutique.
"Originally, I was concerned about the size," Mr. Sweet said. "But as the road show took place, the conversion rates on orders was excellent."
Investors appeared to be enticed by Santander México's financial performance, which has outstripped that of the parent company. Its profit for the first half of the year rose 14.4 percent, to 556 million euros, as it benefited from improvements in the Mexican economy.
"There are very few quality banks that hit the I.P.O. front, whether they be in the U.S. or abroad," Mr. Sweet said.
Profit at its parent, Santander, slid 51 percent in the first half from the year-ago period, to 1.7 billion euros, as it continued to grapple with Spain's depressed economy.
Underwriters for Santander México sold about 20 percent of the bank's shares in Mexico; the rest were sold internationally.
Santander has already taken its Brazilian arm public, raising about $7.5 billion, and said that it planned to hold I.P.O.'s for all of its biggest foreign subsidiaries within the next five years.
The Mexican stock sale is expected to bolster Santander's capital ratios by about half of a percentage point.
The offering was led by Santander, UBS, Deutsche Bank and Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Vitality Reborn, New Orleans Draws Developers

BYLINE: By SHAWN KENNEDY

 BODY:
It has been seven years since Hurricane Katrina brought New Orleans to its knees and a month since Isaac threatened to push the city down again.
But the region's new $14 billion levee system held back the tide and within hours of Isaac's departure the city sprang back to life to host Labor Day visitors.
A deeper sign of the city's resilience can be found in the national developers and retailers now coming to town as first-time investors. 
Among them is the Howard Hughes Corporation, which is based in Dallas and plans a $70 million renovation and expansion of Riverwalk, a struggling riverfront shopping and entertainment complex. In July, the Fresh Market, an upscale food chain based in North Carolina, opened a 24,800-square-foot grocery store in a historic building on St. Charles Avenue. And at the opposite end of the retail spectrum, Costco, the national warehouse chain, has committed to open its first store in Louisiana in another part of New Orleans.
Taken together, these completely different retail projects demonstrate a new confidence by outside developers and retailers in New Orleans's post-Katrina economic strength. It also underscores the city's ability to successfully woo badly needed retail businesses. The newcomers say they have been drawn to the city's economic and cultural vitality, its considerable need for retail at all levels and a more welcoming atmosphere in which to do business.
Mark Bulmash, senior vice president for development at Hughes, said the company experienced opportunity not only in the city's robust travel industry but also in the thriving downtown where residents live, work and play.
The city has seen a surge in the annual number of visitors since Katrina, rising to 8.7 million last year, up significantly from 3.7 million in 2006, the first year after the storm, according to the New Orleans Convention and Visitors Bureau. Moreover, in 2011, travelers spent $5.47 billion, a record.
''The volume is so compelling.'' Mr. Bulmash said. He added that the Riverwalk mall's location near the French Quarter and the city's walkable downtown also figured in the decision to invest in the mall's makeover. Hughes plans to turn the complex into a high-end outlet mall.
Mr. Bulmash said Hughes would not be relying solely on visitors to support the new outlet mall. The company expects to attract shoppers from the New Orleans area and beyond.
Hughes, which also owns the South Street Seaport complex in New York, will add approximately 50,000 square feet to the two-story mall, bringing it to 250,000 square feet. Developers plan to call it the Outlet Collection at Riverwalk, and say it will be the first outlet mall located downtown.
Mr. Bulmash declined to name new tenants but said many would be opening their first stores in the New Orleans region. The retail mix will include some local stores as well as dining. The mall will be closed later this year and work will start by the end of the year, with plans for a reopening in late 2013.
It took the Fresh Market, a grocery store chain with 125 stores in 24 states, five years to settle on space the company now leases on St. Charles Avenue, in a space vacated by a Borders when the bookstore company went under last year.
''People in Louisiana really appreciate food and we've been looking in New Orleans for a long time,'' said Randy Kelley, senior vice president for real estate and development at the Fresh Market, adding that the company's stores in Baton Rouge, Lafayette and Mandeville have all done well.
Mr. Kelley said the New Orleans location was chosen because of ''the high traffic counts, great visibility, access to parking and the old New Orleans architecture'' of its building. The store, in an antebellum-style mansion at the edge of the Garden District, had been a well-known funeral home before it became a bookstore.
Asked if hurricanes like Isaac figured into the company's development strategy, Mr. Kelley said, ''Storms do not affect our business.'' He went on to say that insurance and a good distribution system allowed the company to reopen stores as soon as possible after storms.
Even before Katrina wiped out a lot of neighborhood stores, New Orleans was ripe for retail investment. ''New Orleans has long had a retail market gap,'' said Rodrick Miller, president and chief executive of the New Orleans Business Alliance. ''We have about 30 percent less retail than other cities of similar size.''
The Business Alliance, a partnership between the business community and city government, was established about two years ago to attract business, generate jobs and smooth the way for businesses looking to invest in the city. Mr. Miller said the shortage of stores not only deprived residents of the convenience of shopping close to home, but robbed the city of an estimated $400 million a year in sales.
That loss of revenue was among the reasons the city's economic development team and the Business Alliance put on a full-court press to bring Costco to town. Officials at Costco would not discuss the New Orleans project, but Aimee Quirk, economic development adviser to Mayor Mitch Landrieu, confirmed details of the $45 million development as well as the financial assistance package that made the investment feasible. The 148,000-square-foot store is expected to open in fall 2013.
The city will put up about $2 million in street and infrastructure improvements and will forgo up to $3.3 million in sales taxes during the store's first five years of operation.
''It made a lot of sense,'' Ms. Quirk said. ''We knew the site was in need of street improvements and Costco was facing some extraordinary costs for site elevation to meet FEMA requirements.''
Despite the success of several retail initiatives, including commitments from Walmart and Winn Dixie to increase their number of stores in the city, most investments so far have been in the most populated and prosperous parts of town. To help correct the retail imbalance, earlier this year the city embarked on a loan and grant program intended to encourage the reopening or development of grocery stores in neighborhoods where shopping opportunities are sparse.
''Several areas are not part of any new plans,'' Mr. Miller of the Business Alliance said. ''We need to do what we can to correct that.''

HEADLINE: City Is Sued Over Approval of N.Y.U. Expansion Plan

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Eleven groups have filed suit against New York City for approving a plan to expand New York University's footprint in Greenwich Village, a move that critics say could destroy the university's historic neighborhood. 
The lawsuit, filed Monday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, accuses government decision makers, including both the City Planning Commission and the City Council, of illegally turning over public land to facilitate the university's plans. It also claims that the approval process lacked transparency and denied the public a chance for meaningful input.
The suit asks the court to reverse the city's approval. It also seeks to prevent the university from starting any construction.
The City Council gave final approval to the plan in July despite opposition from neighborhood groups and preservationists, who warned that it could change the character of a beloved neighborhood that has nurtured artistic and social movements throughout the decades.
The area includes row houses and carriage houses dating from the 1820s to the 1850s. In the early 1920s and 1930s, the Greenwich Village Follies gave Martha Graham and Cole Porter their start. Among the artists who eventually lived or worked there were Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Allen Ginsberg, Andy Warhol and Keith Haring.
The expansion plan calls for four new buildings in the area around Washington Square Park and the demolition of two low-rise buildings. After objections from residents and university faculty, the proposal was reduced by about 20 percent to 1.9 million square feet of new classroom space, and other facilities for the more than 50,000 students that attend N.Y.U., the nation's largest private university.
Supporters have argued that the university's ability to attract top students boosts the city's economy because many stay in the area after graduating.
Plaintiffs in the lawsuit include the university's faculty members, Greenwich Society for Historic Preservation, the Historic Districts Council, Washington Square Village Tenants' Association, the East Village Community Coalition and others.
The city's Law Department said it was reviewing the suit.

HEADLINE: Polls Show Obama Is Widening His Lead in Ohio and Florida

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG and JEFF ZELENY; Jim Rutenberg reported from Columbus, and Jeff Zeleny from Tampa, Fla. Reporting was contributed by Allison Kopicki, Megan Thee-Brenan, Marina Stefan and Dalia Sussman from New York.

 BODY:
COLUMBUS, Ohio -- For weeks, Republicans in Ohio have been watching with worry that the state's vital 18 electoral votes were trending away from Mitt Romney. The anxiety has been similar in Florida, where Republicans are concerned that President Obama is gaining the upper hand in the fight for the state's 29 electoral votes.
Those fears are affirmed in the findings of the latest Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS News polls of likely voters in both states, which show that Mr. Obama has widened his lead over Mr. Romney and is outperforming him on nearly every major campaign issue, even though about half said they were disappointed in Mr. Obama's presidency.
The polls, along with interviews with supporters and advisers in the nation's two largest battleground states, lay bare an increasingly urgent challenge facing Mr. Romney as he prepares for his next chance to move the race in his favor, at the first debate with Mr. Obama next week. Mr. Romney's burden is no longer to win over undecided voters, but also to woo back the voters who seem to be growing a little comfortable with the idea of a second term for Mr. Obama. 
As Mr. Romney arrived in Ohio on Tuesday for a two-day bus tour and the president was set to campaign here on Wednesday, the poll also found potential openings where Mr. Romney could gain support. More voters say he would be better than Mr. Obama at tackling the budget deficit -- the only major issue where he had such an edge -- and a majority agree with his assertions that the government is doing too much of what should be left to individuals and businesses.
But Mr. Romney is facing mounting hurdles in these two critical states, which hold nearly as many electoral votes as the rest of the swing states combined. Mr. Romney's lead among older Americans has shifted toward an advantage for Mr. Obama; his competitiveness with Mr. Obama on who would better handle the economy has dipped into slightly negative territory; more view Mr. Romney unfavorably than favorably -- the opposite is true for the president -- and majorities say Mr. Romney does not care about the problems of people like them.
Here in Columbus, where both campaigns are advertising heavily, the sense that Mr. Romney is still failing to connect with average, working-class voters is causing concern among some supporters.
At the Maranatha Baptist Church, which sits in the middle of an industrial area on the outskirts of town, the Rev. Timothy Kenoyer said that even though he believed Mr. Obama was auguring an era of ''socialism'' -- and that an economic malaise had set into his neighborhood -- he was pessimistic about Mr. Romney's chances.
''If Romney was a middle-class man, or not incredibly wealthy, that would be a contributor to a greater degree of accessibility,'' Mr. Kenoyer said in an interview at his office. Accusing the mainstream news media of favoring Mr. Obama, he said he would vote for Mr. Romney, based more on the Republican Party platform. He added, ''He doesn't fire me up.''
That tracked with the survey results that found that 48 percent of likely Romney voters in Ohio supported him with reservations or because they dislike Mr. Obama, compared with 51 percent who said they strongly favored him. Mr. Obama is strongly favored by two-thirds of his likely voters, with 33 percent saying they favor him with reservations or because of dislike of Mr. Romney.
The New York Times, in collaboration with Quinnipiac University and CBS News, is tracking the presidential race with recurring polls in six states. In Ohio -- which no Republican has won the presidency without -- Mr. Obama is leading Mr. Romney 53 percent to 43 percent in the poll. In Florida, the president leads Mr. Romney 53 to 44 percent in the poll.
The surveys, which had margins of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for each candidate, also included a Pennsylvania poll, where Mr. Obama is leading Mr. Romney by 12 percentage points.
The polls were conducted as the Romney campaign grappled with fallout last week from the release of his tax returns and remarks he made at a fund-raiser in which he bluntly suggested that 47 percent of Americans saw themselves as victims who are dependent on the government. That was the latest in a string of setbacks for the campaign that appears to be sapping the optimism of some of his supporters.
''Romney needs a PR person,'' Natalie McGee, a law student at Ohio State University who supports Mr. Romney, lamented during an interview on campus, where Obama volunteers were working to register voters and rally supportive students.
With 41 days remaining until the election, aides to Mr. Romney acknowledge that they are not leading in either state, but dispute the characterization that the race has shifted toward Mr. Obama. The political director, Rich Beeson, told reporters aboard Mr. Romney's plane that the campaign's internal data showed a closer race, saying, ''The public polls are what they are.''
In Florida, a month after Republicans from across the country went to Tampa for their national convention, about half of the voters have an unfavorable opinion of the party. Several Republican strategists in Florida said that they believe Mr. Obama has an advantage, but disputed it was as wide as the poll suggested. Some polls have shown the race in Florida to be tighter, although Mr. Obama has consistently had an edge in nearly a dozen recent polls.
With an unemployment rate of 8.8 percent in Florida, some Democrats said they were surprised that the state had seemed to be steadily trending in their direction. Democrats have a voter registration advantage over Republicans in the state of about 445,000, or 10 percent, slightly less than four years ago.
In the Florida poll, among the those who say they are ''definitely'' going to vote, more respondents identified themselves as Democrats (36 percent) than those who identified themselves as Republicans (27 percent); independents were 33 percent. The Florida poll found that Mr. Obama holds nearly a 20-point lead among women, while Mr. Romney's edge among men is about 3 points. The Obama campaign intends to increase its advertising, aides said, to try to keep pushing Florida away from Mr. Romney as early voting begins next week.
Sharon Whalen, 56, a former travel agent from Dade City who said she and her husband voted for Senator John McCain of Arizona, the Republican nominee, in 2008, said she had developed ''a very bad impression of Romney.'' She said she intended to support Mr. Obama and was troubled by the Republican ticket's plan for Medicare.
''There's just something about him I don't trust,'' said Ms. Whalen, a poll respondent who spoke in a follow-up interview. ''It's not so much that I don't believe what he is saying, but I just don't think he's for the middle and lower class. He's more for helping the rich.''
In interviews in Florida, some Republicans expressed frustration with Mr. Romney and the difficulty his campaign has had seizing on the dissatisfaction with the president. They said that they hoped Mr. Romney adhered to an economic message in the closing stretch of the race.
''Every day of the campaign that goes by that the unemployment rate, the deficit and the size of government isn't talked about is a day lost for the Romney campaign,'' said Justin Sayfie, a Florida co-chairman of the Romney campaign. ''I hope we can figure out new and different ways to talk about these issues.''
Yet the polls in these two states found Mr. Romney vying closely with Mr. Obama among voters who call themselves independents. And half of likely voters say they are somewhat or very disappointed in Mr. Obama's presidency, leaving an opening for Mr. Romney.
Here in Ohio, Mr. Romney's aides have argued that economic pain is still plentiful around the state and that Mr. Obama's rising poll ratings are unsustainable. As Mr. Romney's campaign seeks to play off of economic pessimism, he is navigating a mixed picture.
The state's unemployment rate of 7.2 percent in August was below the national average, though some areas are doing better than others. And some independents said Mr. Romney still had work to do to close the sale with them.
''I think my major reservation is that I just don't have a whole lot of information about Romney,'' Mike Warburton, 47, and an independent of Akron, said in a follow-up interview.
Mr. Romney's comments about the ''47 percent'' of Americans seemed to be undercutting him with other working-class voters here. ''This last thing, where he was going on about the 47 percent who are dependent on government, is hard to swallow,'' said Kenneth Myers, a Republican who lives in Mansfield and is unemployed. ''I think I'm part of the 47 percent he is talking about. But I don't want to be dependent on the government.''

HEADLINE: Spreading The Wealth Won't Stop

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
Mitt Romney may be right about President Obama's Robin Hood tendencies. Future historians could well conclude that Mr. Obama led the biggest redistribution of wealth in decades.
The Affordable Care Act, which levies new taxes on the wealthy to expand access to health care for the near poor, seems on track to become the biggest increase in government redistribution since the Johnson administration.
According to the Tax Foundation, it will raise $52,000 in new taxes on average from families in the richest 1 percent of the population, to pay for some $250 to $2,000 in benefits on average for American families in the bottom half of income by 2016.
The Obama fiscal stimulus also did much to assist the most vulnerable Americans. It expanded the food stamp program and the earned-income tax credit. It extended unemployment insurance and sent $800 checks to poor and middle-class families. Over all, the Congressional Budget Office found that total government taxes and transfers reduced the nation's income inequality by more than a quarter in 2009, the most in at least 30 years. 
As Mr. Romney outlines on the campaign trail, his administration would veer sharply from this strategy. He would repeal health care reform and not only make permanent the tax cuts on high earners passed by President George W. Bush, but also reduce tax rates further.
This would require deep cuts in government spending. And the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center has predicted that for Mr. Romney to fulfill his promises, he would have to raise taxes on the middle class and the poor.
''Redistribution'' has recently taken center stage in the presidential campaign, presented as a choice between Mr. Obama's demand that millionaires pay a higher tax rate than their secretaries do and Mr. Romney's impatience with moochers waiting for a government handout. Yet the discourse overstates the difference between what an Obama administration and a Romney administration would do to reduce the income gap.
A Republican administration would most likely choose fewer taxes and less spending than a Democratic one. Still, demographics alone suggest that regardless of who is the next president, and the one after that, the government is going to wind up distributing more of the nation's wealth than it does today.
The debate about income inequality has grown louder as the nation's income gap has widened over the last three decades. But it is hardly new.
When Mr. Romney criticized Mr. Obama for wanting to redistribute income, he was channeling Ronald Reagan, who quipped back in 1964: we ''can't see a fat man standing beside a thin one without coming to the conclusion that the fat man got that way by taking advantage of the thin one.''
Yet, in fact, governments throughout our history -- Republican and Democratic -- have used taxes and transfers to subsidize the poor with money from the better off. At the end of the administration of George W. Bush in 2008, taxes and government spending trimmed the Gini index -- a common measure of inequality that ranges from 0 when everybody has the same to 1 when a single person hogs everything -- to 0.444, from 0.579, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Redistribution by government doesn't always fit our expectations. President Reagan was indeed set against a broad redistribution of wealth. By the time he left office, the federal government was doing far less to close the gap on income inequality than when he arrived.
Since then, however, there have been some surprising turns. President Bill Clinton, for instance, redistributed less than his predecessor, George H. W. Bush. When Mr. Clinton took the reins of government in 1993, taxes and transfers reduced the Gini index measure of inequality by 23 percent, according to the budget office. When he left office in 2000, income inequality was much greater than when he started. Yet government closed the gap by only 21 percent.
Even George W. Bush did more. He slashed taxes on the rich and tried to privatize Social Security. But by the end of his administration, taxes and government spending closed the income gap by 23 percent.
Administrations face constraints, of course. An attempt to compromise with Congressional Republicans led President Obama to extend his predecessor's tax cuts, rather than repeal them as he had proposed, sending less money from the rich to the poor than he had promised.
Despite his distaste for redistribution, Mr. Romney has staunchly defended at least a part of it: opposing some $700 billion worth of cuts to the Medicare program.
Beyond political limitations, the amount of redistribution by government is shaped largely by outside factors: in the short term, the economic cycle, and in the long term, demographic change.
The amount of money that the government moves from the rich to the poor will jump almost automatically in a recession because of rising unemployment payments.
Unemployment insurance accounts for much of the growth in government transfers that made such a big dent in income inequality in the first year of the Obama administration.
But there are long-term forces that will help determine how much wealth the government redistributes in the future. One is globalization. It increases demands for a bigger social safety net to protect workers from the uncertainty of a hypercompetitive open world economy, but also reduces the government's ability to raise the money to finance it.
Some economists worry that globalization makes it too difficult to raise money to redistribute. Corporate taxes, for instance, have dropped sharply as a source of revenue since the 1950s as corporate tax rates have been trimmed and companies have adopted more sophisticated financial tools to reduce their liability. As capital becomes easier to move across borders, corporate income may become even more difficult to tax.
The other powerful driver is demographic change. Specifically, we are getting older.
As the population ages, government spending on health care is expected to mushroom.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that spending on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid is on track to consume 16.5 percent of our national economic output by 2037, nine percentage points more than the average since the 1970s. This means the government will need to raise much more money. And though government spending on health also benefits the middle class and the rich, the money will flow mostly to the poor.
Take it from Alan Viard, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who worked in the administration of George W. Bush. Mr. Viard is no spendthrift. He advocates trimming benefits -- requiring that high-income Americans pick up more of the tab for their own health care. But he acknowledges that meeting our demographic challenge will require more spending, too.
The American public will not really accept the kind of drastic cuts in benefits that would be needed to solve the entitlement crisis.
The additional money won't all come from the rich, of course. The ''middle class,'' defined by the president as families earning less than $250,000, will need to chip in, too, to pay for the larger government in our future. Yet the result is almost certainly much more redistribution of wealth than we have today. Mr. Viard puts it well: ''It seems that a larger share of our economic resources will be redistributed.'' That's regardless of who occupies the White House.

HEADLINE: Obama's Speech to the United Nations General Assembly -- Text

 BODY:
Following is a text of President Obama's speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, as released by the White House:
Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General, fellow delegates, ladies and gentleman: I would like to begin today by telling you about an American named Chris Stevens.
Chris was born in a town called Grass Valley, California, the son of a lawyer and a musician. As a young man, Chris joined the Peace Corps, and taught English in Morocco. And he came to love and respect the people of North Africa and the Middle East. He would carry that commitment throughout his life. As a diplomat, he worked from Egypt to Syria, from Saudi Arabia to Libya. He was known for walking the streets of the cities where he worked -- tasting the local food, meeting as many people as he could, speaking Arabic, listening with a broad smile.
Chris went to Benghazi in the early days of the Libyan revolution, arriving on a cargo ship. As America's representative, he helped the Libyan people as they coped with violent conflict, cared for the wounded, and crafted a vision for the future in which the rights of all Libyans would be respected. And after the revolution, he supported the birth of a new democracy, as Libyans held elections, and built new institutions, and began to move forward after decades of dictatorship. 
Chris Stevens loved his work. He took pride in the country he served, and he saw dignity in the people that he met. And two weeks ago, he traveled to Benghazi to review plans to establish a new cultural center and modernize a hospital. That's when America's compound came under attack. Along with three of his colleagues, Chris was killed in the city that he helped to save. He was 52 years old.
I tell you this story because Chris Stevens embodied the best of America. Like his fellow Foreign Service officers, he built bridges across oceans and cultures, and was deeply invested in the international cooperation that the United Nations represents. He acted with humility, but he also stood up for a set of principles -- a belief that individuals should be free to determine their own destiny, and live with liberty, dignity, justice, and opportunity.
The attacks on the civilians in Benghazi were attacks on America. We are grateful for the assistance we received from the Libyan government and from the Libyan people. There should be no doubt that we will be relentless in tracking down the killers and bringing them to justice. And I also appreciate that in recent days, the leaders of other countries in the region -- including Egypt, Tunisia and Yemen -- have taken steps to secure our diplomatic facilities, and called for calm. And so have religious authorities around the globe.
But understand, the attacks of the last two weeks are not simply an assault on America. They are also an assault on the very ideals upon which the United Nations was founded -- the notion that people can resolve their differences peacefully; that diplomacy can take the place of war; that in an interdependent world, all of us have a stake in working towards greater opportunity and security for our citizens.
If we are serious about upholding these ideals, it will not be enough to put more guards in front of an embassy, or to put out statements of regret and wait for the outrage to pass. If we are serious about these ideals, we must speak honestly about the deeper causes of the crisis -- because we face a choice between the forces that would drive us apart and the hopes that we hold in common.
Today, we must reaffirm that our future will be determined by people like Chris Stevens -- and not by his killers. Today, we must declare that this violence and intolerance has no place among our United Nations.
It has been less than two years since a vendor in Tunisia set himself on fire to protest the oppressive corruption in his country, and sparked what became known as the Arab Spring. And since then, the world has been captivated by the transformation that's taken place, and the United States has supported the forces of change.
We were inspired by the Tunisian protests that toppled a dictator, because we recognized our own beliefs in the aspiration of men and women who took to the streets.
We insisted on change in Egypt, because our support for democracy ultimately put us on the side of the people.
We supported a transition of leadership in Yemen, because the interests of the people were no longer being served by a corrupt status quo.
We intervened in Libya alongside a broad coalition, and with the mandate of the United Nations Security Council, because we had the ability to stop the slaughter of innocents, and because we believed that the aspirations of the people were more powerful than a tyrant.
And as we meet here, we again declare that the regime of Bashar al-Assad must come to an end so that the suffering of the Syrian people can stop and a new dawn can begin.
We have taken these positions because we believe that freedom and self-determination are not unique to one culture. These are not simply American values or Western values -- they are universal values. And even as there will be huge challenges to come with a transition to democracy, I am convinced that ultimately government of the people, by the people, and for the people is more likely to bring about the stability, prosperity, and individual opportunity that serve as a basis for peace in our world.
So let us remember that this is a season of progress. For the first time in decades, Tunisians, Egyptians and Libyans voted for new leaders in elections that were credible, competitive, and fair. This democratic spirit has not been restricted to the Arab world. Over the past year, we've seen peaceful transitions of power in Malawi and Senegal, and a new President in Somalia. In Burma, a President has freed political prisoners and opened a closed society, a courageous dissident has been elected to parliament, and people look forward to further reform. Around the globe, people are making their voices heard, insisting on their innate dignity, and the right to determine their future.
And yet the turmoil of recent weeks reminds us that the path to democracy does not end with the casting of a ballot. Nelson Mandela once said: ''To be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others.''
True democracy demands that citizens cannot be thrown in jail because of what they believe, and that businesses can be opened without paying a bribe. It depends on the freedom of citizens to speak their minds and assemble without fear, and on the rule of law and due process that guarantees the rights of all people.
In other words, true democracy -- real freedom -- is hard work. Those in power have to resist the temptation to crack down on dissidents. In hard economic times, countries must be tempted -- may be tempted to rally the people around perceived enemies, at home and abroad, rather than focusing on the painstaking work of reform.
Moreover, there will always be those that reject human progress -- dictators who cling to power, corrupt interests that depend on the status quo, and extremists who fan the flames of hate and division. From Northern Ireland to South Asia, from Africa to the Americas, from the Balkans to the Pacific Rim, we've witnessed convulsions that can accompany transitions to a new political order.
At time, the conflicts arise along the fault lines of race or tribe. And often they arise from the difficulties of reconciling tradition and faith with the diversity and interdependence of the modern world. In every country, there are those who find different religious beliefs threatening; in every culture, those who love freedom for themselves must ask themselves how much they're willing to tolerate freedom for others.
That is what we saw play out in the last two weeks, as a crude and disgusting video sparked outrage throughout the Muslim world. Now, I have made it clear that the United States government had nothing to do with this video, and I believe its message must be rejected by all who respect our common humanity.
It is an insult not only to Muslims, but to America as well -- for as the city outside these walls makes clear, we are a country that has welcomed people of every race and every faith. We are home to Muslims who worship across our country. We not only respect the freedom of religion, we have laws that protect individuals from being harmed because of how they look or what they believe. We understand why people take offense to this video because millions of our citizens are among them.
I know there are some who ask why we don't just ban such a video. And the answer is enshrined in our laws: Our Constitution protects the right to practice free speech.
Here in the United States, countless publications provoke offense. Like me, the majority of Americans are Christian, and yet we do not ban blasphemy against our most sacred beliefs. As President of our country and Commander-in-Chief of our military, I accept that people are going to call me awful things every day -- (laughter) -- and I will always defend their right to do so.
Americans have fought and died around the globe to protect the right of all people to express their views, even views that we profoundly disagree with. We do not do so because we support hateful speech, but because our founders understood that without such protections, the capacity of each individual to express their own views and practice their own faith may be threatened. We do so because in a diverse society, efforts to restrict speech can quickly become a tool to silence critics and oppress minorities.
We do so because given the power of faith in our lives, and the passion that religious differences can inflame, the strongest weapon against hateful speech is not repression; it is more speech -- the voices of tolerance that rally against bigotry and blasphemy, and lift up the values of understanding and mutual respect.
Now, I know that not all countries in this body share this particular understanding of the protection of free speech. We recognize that. But in 2012, at a time when anyone with a cell phone can spread offensive views around the world with the click of a button, the notion that we can control the flow of information is obsolete. The question, then, is how do we respond?
And on this we must agree: There is no speech that justifies mindless violence. There are no words that excuse the killing of innocents. There's no video that justifies an attack on an embassy. There's no slander that provides an excuse for people to burn a restaurant in Lebanon, or destroy a school in Tunis, or cause death and destruction in Pakistan.
In this modern world with modern technologies, for us to respond in that way to hateful speech empowers any individual who engages in such speech to create chaos around the world. We empower the worst of us if that's how we respond.
More broadly, the events of the last two weeks also speak to the need for all of us to honestly address the tensions between the West and the Arab world that is moving towards democracy.
Now, let me be clear: Just as we cannot solve every problem in the world, the United States has not and will not seek to dictate the outcome of democratic transitions abroad. We do not expect other nations to agree with us on every issue, nor do we assume that the violence of the past weeks or the hateful speech by some individuals represent the views of the overwhelming majority of Muslims, any more than the views of the people who produced this video represents those of Americans. However, I do believe that it is the obligation of all leaders in all countries to speak out forcefully against violence and extremism.
It is time to marginalize those who -- even when not directly resorting to violence -- use hatred of America, or the West, or Israel, as the central organizing principle of politics. For that only gives cover, and sometimes makes an excuse, for those who do resort to violence.
That brand of politics -- one that pits East against West, and South against North, Muslims against Christians and Hindu and Jews -- can't deliver on the promise of freedom. To the youth, it offers only false hope. Burning an American flag does nothing to provide a child an education. Smashing apart a restaurant does not fill an empty stomach. Attacking an embassy won't create a single job. That brand of politics only makes it harder to achieve what we must do together: educating our children, and creating the opportunities that they deserve; protecting human rights, and extending democracy's promise.
Understand America will never retreat from the world. We will bring justice to those who harm our citizens and our friends, and we will stand with our allies. We are willing to partner with countries around the world to deepen ties of trade and investment, and science and technology, energy and development -- all efforts that can spark economic growth for all our people and stabilize democratic change.
But such efforts depend on a spirit of mutual interest and mutual respect. No government or company, no school or NGO will be confident working in a country where its people are endangered. For partnerships to be effective our citizens must be secure and our efforts must be welcomed.
A politics based only on anger -- one based on dividing the world between ''us'' and ''them'' -- not only sets back international cooperation, it ultimately undermines those who tolerate it. All of us have an interest in standing up to these forces.
Let us remember that Muslims have suffered the most at the hands of extremism. On the same day our civilians were killed in Benghazi, a Turkish police officer was murdered in Istanbul only days before his wedding; more than 10 Yemenis were killed in a car bomb in Sana'a; several Afghan children were mourned by their parents just days after they were killed by a suicide bomber in Kabul.
The impulse towards intolerance and violence may initially be focused on the West, but over time it cannot be contained. The same impulses toward extremism are used to justify war between Sunni and Shia, between tribes and clans. It leads not to strength and prosperity but to chaos. In less than two years, we have seen largely peaceful protests bring more change to Muslim-majority countries than a decade of violence. And extremists understand this. Because they have nothing to offer to improve the lives of people, violence is their only way to stay relevant. They don't build; they only destroy.
It is time to leave the call of violence and the politics of division behind. On so many issues, we face a choice between the promise of the future, or the prisons of the past. And we cannot afford to get it wrong. We must seize this moment. And America stands ready to work with all who are willing to embrace a better future.
The future must not belong to those who target Coptic Christians in Egypt -- it must be claimed by those in Tahrir Square who chanted, ''Muslims, Christians, we are one.'' The future must not belong to those who bully women -- it must be shaped by girls who go to school, and those who stand for a world where our daughters can live their dreams just like our sons.
The future must not belong to those corrupt few who steal a country's resources -- it must be won by the students and entrepreneurs, the workers and business owners who seek a broader prosperity for all people. Those are the women and men that America stands with; theirs is the vision we will support.
The future must not belong to those who slander the prophet of Islam. But to be credible, those who condemn that slander must also condemn the hate we see in the images of Jesus Christ that are desecrated, or churches that are destroyed, or the Holocaust that is denied.
Let us condemn incitement against Sufi Muslims and Shiite pilgrims. It's time to heed the words of Gandhi: ''Intolerance is itself a form of violence and an obstacle to the growth of a true democratic spirit.'' Together, we must work towards a world where we are strengthened by our differences, and not defined by them. That is what America embodies, that's the vision we will support.
Among Israelis and Palestinians, the future must not belong to those who turn their backs on a prospect of peace. Let us leave behind those who thrive on conflict, those who reject the right of Israel to exist. The road is hard, but the destination is clear -- a secure, Jewish state of Israel and an independent, prosperous Palestine. Understanding that such a peace must come through a just agreement between the parties, America will walk alongside all who are prepared to make that journey.
In Syria, the future must not belong to a dictator who massacres his people. If there is a cause that cries out for protest in the world today, peaceful protest, it is a regime that tortures children and shoots rockets at apartment buildings. And we must remain engaged to assure that what began with citizens demanding their rights does not end in a cycle of sectarian violence.
Together, we must stand with those Syrians who believe in a different vision -- a Syria that is united and inclusive, where children don't need to fear their own government, and all Syrians have a say in how they are governed -- Sunnis and Alawites, Kurds and Christians. That's what America stands for. That is the outcome that we will work for -- with sanctions and consequences for those who persecute, and assistance and support for those who work for this common good. Because we believe that the Syrians who embrace this vision will have the strength and the legitimacy to lead.
In Iran, we see where the path of a violent and unaccountable ideology leads. The Iranian people have a remarkable and ancient history, and many Iranians wish to enjoy peace and prosperity alongside their neighbors. But just as it restricts the rights of its own people, the Iranian government continues to prop up a dictator in Damascus and supports terrorist groups abroad. Time and again, it has failed to take the opportunity to demonstrate that its nuclear program is peaceful, and to meet its obligations to the United Nations.
So let me be clear. America wants to resolve this issue through diplomacy, and we believe that there is still time and space to do so. But that time is not unlimited. We respect the right of nations to access peaceful nuclear power, but one of the purposes of the United Nations is to see that we harness that power for peace. And make no mistake, a nuclear-armed Iran is not a challenge that can be contained. It would threaten the elimination of Israel, the security of Gulf nations, and the stability of the global economy. It risks triggering a nuclear-arms race in the region, and the unraveling of the non-proliferation treaty. That's why a coalition of countries is holding the Iranian government accountable. And that's why the United States will do what we must to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.
We know from painful experience that the path to security and prosperity does not lie outside the boundaries of international law and respect for human rights. That's why this institution was established from the rubble of conflict. That is why liberty triumphed over tyranny in the Cold War. And that is the lesson of the last two decades as well.
History shows that peace and progress come to those who make the right choices. Nations in every part of the world have traveled this difficult path. Europe, the bloodiest battlefield of the 20th century, is united, free and at peace. From Brazil to South Africa, from Turkey to South Korea, from India to Indonesia, people of different races, religions, and traditions have lifted millions out of poverty, while respecting the rights of their citizens and meeting their responsibilities as nations.
And it is because of the progress that I've witnessed in my own lifetime, the progress that I've witnessed after nearly four years as President, that I remain ever hopeful about the world that we live in. The war in Iraq is over. American troops have come home. We've begun a transition in Afghanistan, and America and our allies will end our war on schedule in 2014. Al Qaeda has been weakened, and Osama bin Laden is no more. Nations have come together to lock down nuclear materials, and America and Russia are reducing our arsenals. We have seen hard choices made -- from Naypyidaw to Cairo to Abidjan -- to put more power in the hands of citizens.
At a time of economic challenge, the world has come together to broaden prosperity. Through the G20, we have partnered with emerging countries to keep the world on the path of recovery. America has pursued a development agenda that fuels growth and breaks dependency, and worked with African leaders to help them feed their nations. New partnerships have been forged to combat corruption and promote government that is open and transparent, and new commitments have been made through the Equal Futures Partnership to ensure that women and girls can fully participate in politics and pursue opportunity. And later today, I will discuss our efforts to combat the scourge of human trafficking.
All these things give me hope. But what gives me the most hope is not the actions of us, not the actions of leaders -- it is the people that I've seen. The American troops who have risked their lives and sacrificed their limbs for strangers half a world away; the students in Jakarta or Seoul who are eager to use their knowledge to benefit mankind; the faces in a square in Prague or a parliament in Ghana who see democracy giving voice to their aspirations; the young people in the favelas of Rio and the schools of Mumbai whose eyes shine with promise. These men, women, and children of every race and every faith remind me that for every angry mob that gets shown on television, there are billions around the world who share similar hopes and dreams. They tell us that there is a common heartbeat to humanity.
So much attention in our world turns to what divides us. That's what we see on the news. That's what consumes our political debates. But when you strip it all away, people everywhere long for the freedom to determine their destiny; the dignity that comes with work; the comfort that comes with faith; and the justice that exists when governments serve their people -- and not the other way around.
The United States of America will always stand up for these aspirations, for our own people and for people all across the world. That was our founding purpose. That is what our history shows. That is what Chris Stevens worked for throughout his life.
And I promise you this: Long after the killers are brought to justice, Chris Stevens's legacy will live on in the lives that he touched -- in the tens of thousands who marched against violence through the streets of Benghazi; in the Libyans who changed their Facebook photo to one of Chris; in the signs that read, simply, ''Chris Stevens was a friend to all Libyans.''
They should give us hope. They should remind us that so long as we work for it, justice will be done, that history is on our side, and that a rising tide of liberty will never be reversed.
Thank you very much.

HEADLINE: Behind a Restaurant Emergency, a Troubleshooter

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
ON a hot and humid Thursday, Brian Follander found himself in a familiar position, sprawled on a restaurant kitchen floor, staring into the nether regions of a stove that would not light.
A dispatcher from Kitchen Repair Specialists, his employer, had sent Mr. Follander to ABC Kitchen, just north of Union Square, after receiving a distress call. The oven had been acting up for days. Now it stubbornly refused to work, and the first diners were starting to show up for lunch.
After testing the burners with a blowtorch, Mr. Follander removed the front panel from the bottom of the stove, hugged the floor and saw the problem, a common one in hard-used restaurant stoves. The thermocouple, a fail-safe device governing the flow of gas to the burners, had given up the ghost. As scurrying workers tried not to step on his head, he yanked the defective part and put in a new one. 
''That's the hero call, when one of the main ovens goes off, you replace the thermocouple and get out of the way in 20 minutes,'' he said, hoisting a fat tool bag over his shoulder. ''It doesn't matter to the people at the restaurant that it's easy to fix. They just know that the oven won't go on. And that's pretty much my day. Just rinse and repeat.''
Dozens of troubleshooting technicians like Mr. Follander roam New York every day, dispatched by companies like Kitchen Repair Specialists, Kitchen Works and All Service, and their counterparts who repair refrigeration equipment, companies like Day and Nite and Americold.
They have carved out a niche in New York's restaurant economy by administering the equivalent of cardiopulmonary resuscitation to malfunctioning equipment that can sabotage a dinner service -- or ruin thousands of dollars' worth of food in refrigerated walk-ins. ''If the oven goes, you can't cook, but you don't lose your entire inventory,'' said Bob Levine, the president of Americold, which installs and maintains refrigeration units.
The emergency lines ring more often than one might think. ''The heat lamps, where the food goes out, those break every month,'' said Jason Lawless, the executive chef at Tocqueville. ''The salamander shorts out about four times a year.''
That's when the call goes out and technicians like Mr. Follander race to the scene. Most of the time they encounter routine problems that can be addressed in a matter of minutes: crud clogging the hole that lets gas reach the pilot light, a shorted-out switch or (most embarrassing, this) a plug that has been knocked loose by the night cleaning crew. Other problems keep them on the phone for hours on the tech-support lines that manufacturers provide -- vital now that big combination gas and convection ovens are run by computer boards.
Refrigeration techs, too, address problems that range from five-minute fixes like loose gaskets or defective control valves, to all-out armageddons.
Most busy restaurants sign service contracts that cover regular maintenance calls and the labor for emergency repairs. The price varies factoring in the frequency of scheduled visits and the number and the condition of appliances to be maintained. Noncontract calls are billed at an hourly rate.
Kitchen Works offers a basic contract for Manhattan restaurants for $425 a month, which puts it on call 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. When it was open, Tavern on the Green paid $1,000 a month. Like Kitchen Repair Specialists, also a mom-and-pop operation, Kitchen Works, based in Freeport, N.Y., has about 10 trucks that cover the five boroughs and Long Island. Techs can field up to 10 calls a day.
Day and Nite and All Services, two divisions of the same company, are family run but much larger, with 70 technicians; it services corporate cafeterias and hotels as well as stand-alone restaurants. Refrigeration contracts cost about the same as contracts for stoves and appliances. Balthazar, for example, pays Americold a little more than $500 a month. Each quarter, a technician checks temperatures in walk-ins and low boys (the low-slung refrigerated cabinets with working surfaces on top), evaporators, condenser coils, oil and refrigeration levels and hardware like gaskets.
The work can be dangerous, especially on the hot side. Electricity, heat and water make for a volatile combination. Unsuspecting technicians have been scalded by bubbling veal stock tipped over by a careless line cook or blasted by steam, the most dreaded form of heat. Daniel Fowley, the general manager for Kitchen Works, said his father, the founder of the company, spent two months in a burn unit after a steam door exploded in front of him.
Daniel Carroll, who runs Kitchen Repair Specialists with his partner, Jason Southard, now spends his days in the company's offices in Merrick, N.Y., but has put in his time as a technician. He has the scars to prove it. ''At Gramercy Tavern, the chef pulled a valve from the oven to show me what was wrong and I heard the hissing sound of gas escaping,'' he said. ''Just when I turned around to plug the hole with my finger, I got a fireball that melted my hair.''
The hazards are legion. ''Meat slicers get jammed,'' said Wade Burch, the executive chef for the Merchants Hospitality restaurants in Manhattan. ''Deep fryers ignite, blow the doors off and shoot out flames like a dragon. There's some scary stuff.''
Before arriving at ABC Kitchen, Mr. Follander had already scraped and drilled the small gizmo that channels gas to the pilot light in a Garland stove (''official diagnosis: schmutz in the pilot pinhole,'' he said); recalibrated the temperature knob on a Southbend convection oven at Heartland Brewery and Chophouse in Times Square; and lubricated a sticky, worn brass knob controlling the pilot, safety and thermostat on the main oven at Gramercy Tavern.
Later that day, his bosses made a special visit to Oceana to check on a problem that had given the restaurant the fits for weeks, a new Alto-Shaam oven that refused to kick into its self-cleaning cycle. The problem, it turned out, was a programming error.
Hard use and accumulating dirt account for many service calls. But most problems come courtesy of the overnight workers who scrub down the kitchen and can wreak more havoc than the sorcerer's apprentice. Splashing water causes electrical shorts, a major issue with computer boards, which can cost more than $2,000 to replace. Some workers bend the oven doors by standing on them to get extra reach. The catalog of infamy goes on and on. ''Without the cleaning crews, we'd go out of business,'' Mr. Fowley said.
For a restaurant full of customers, it doesn't matter who did what when. The food needs to get out of the kitchen. Mr. Lawless of Tocqueville said, ''No matter how talented you are as a chef, no matter how good your team is, if the stove goes out, you're nothing.''

HEADLINE: Staples to Close More Stores

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Staples said on Tuesday that it would close more stores, change some leadership and invest in its online unit as the largest American office supply chain looks for ways to cut expenses and grow in a struggling economy. 
It expects to take charges of up to $1 billion as a result of the changes, the company said. Staples said it planned to close 45 stores in Europe by the end of fiscal 2012 and cut its retail space in North America by about 15 percent by the end of fiscal 2015.
As part of that plan, Staples is accelerating the closing of approximately 15 stores in North America.
The company is also uniting its retail and Staples.com businesses, and increasing investment in online and mobile units.
The plan is expected to generate annualized pretax cost savings of about $250 million by the end of fiscal year 2015, Staples said.

HEADLINE: More Children in Homeless Shelters

 BODY:
Almost 20,000 children now go to bed every night in New York City's homeless shelters, up from 16,000 last year. If homelessness is hard on adults, for the young, it can be disastrous, starting a slide into a lifetime of problems. Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Gov. Andrew Cuomo could reduce these numbers by restarting programs that help homeless families move from shelters to permanent rental housing. 
In 2005, Mr. Bloomberg promised that he would cut the city's homeless population of 33,000 by two-thirds by 2009. It hasn't happened; the total homeless population has reached almost 46,000 this year. He often blames the economy, which is certainly a factor in rising homelessness. But he and the governor have eliminated important programs that helped shift people out of shelters. It is time to restore the cuts and reinstate those programs.
The Bloomberg administration unwisely ended priority referrals for homeless families to public housing and for federal rent subsidies, which have very long waiting lists. The mayor should find a way to give destitute families quicker access to public housing and rental vouchers.
The New York City Council and Speaker Christine Quinn have also been working on a new rental support program similar to one called Advantage, which helped 25,000 families get permanent housing over a four-year period. Mr. Cuomo cut the state's $65 million annual contribution to the Advantage program in 2011, which resulted in a loss of $27 million in matching federal funds.
The Bloomberg administration also decided to cancel the city's $48 million annual contribution, arguing that the city could not afford to pay for the program on its own. The governor and Mr. Bloomberg should restore the state and city funds for an Advantage-like program and reapply for more federal money.
Advocates for the poor say New York City now has the highest number of homeless children since the Great Depression. That is an emergency Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Cuomo cannot afford to ignore.

HEADLINE: A Different Class Warfare

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
Though education has not been a major focus in the presidential campaign, the charged issue of class size was injected into the race on Tuesday as Mitt Romney said that while governor of Massachusetts, he was able to do more with less during an economic downturn. 
He repeated assertions made during the Republican primary campaign that slightly larger classes -- a result of cuts in Massachusetts state aid to schools in 2003 and 2004 -- were not as important in student learning as the quality of teachers.
President Obama's campaign quickly responded with a video featuring a former Massachusetts school superintendent attacking the cuts and a fifth-grade teacher saying, "Come be in a classroom with fifth graders and tell me class size doesn't matter.''
Education - mainly given lip service in the national campaign - received detailed attention as Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama wedged in appearances at an education forum on Tuesday around more high-profile speeches in New York City on foreign affairs.
Mr. Romney also attacked teachers' unions for opposing merit pay tied to testing and for supporting Democrats who negotiate contracts with them. He criticized the role of Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama's former chief of staff, who negotiated with the teachers' union in the recently ended Chicago strike.
"I don't mean to be terribly partisan, but I kind of am,'' Mr. Romney said at the forum, Education Nation, sponsored by NBC News, drawing laughs.
In July, Mr. Romney laid out a detailed agenda for education, including vouchers and restoring private banks to the subsidized college-loan market, but he rarely mentions these on the campaign trail, preferring to speak in generalities. Before an audience of educators and policy mavens, however, he returned to specifics, including his support for A-to-F grades for public schools and for transforming $25 billion in federal aid to schools into a program of vouchers for poor and disabled students.
Mr. Obama, who spoke in a taped interview, accused Mr. Romney and his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, of teacher-bashing and of favoring deep cuts in government aid to education.
"They talk a good game about reform, but when you actually look at their budgets, they are talking about slashing our investment in education by 20 percent, 25 percent,'' Mr. Obama said.
Behind the debate over class size, school choice and other education issues is a traditional left-right fight over public spending, although these days many Democratic reformers, including the president, have embraced parts of the Republican agenda.
Research from the 1980s showed students in early grades in classes of 13 to 17 performed significantly better than students in classes of 22 to 25. Many states passed laws limiting class size.
But since then some economists have argued that an effective teacher has more of an impact on learning. One Democrat who has expressed support for the cost-effectiveness argument is Arne Duncan, Mr. Obama's secretary of education. Mr. Romney praised Mr. Duncan at Education Nation, but he dodged a question about whether he would reappoint him in a Romney administration.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Is the Highest In 7 Months

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Consumer confidence rose in September to the highest level in seven months, the Conference Board said on Tuesday, in a sign that Americans might be ready to loosen their spending. 
The Conference Board, an industry group, said its index of consumer attitudes rose to 70.3 from an upwardly revised 61.3 in August. It was the highest since February and topped economists' expectations of 63, according to a Reuters survey.
With consumer spending accounting for two-thirds of economic activity, analysts are eager to see the improving attitudes translate into more buying.
''It does bode well for spending down the road,'' said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington.
The expectations index rose to 83.7, from 71.1, and the present situation index to 50.2 from 46.5.
Consumers were more optimistic on both the current and short-term outlook for the labor market, and had a more favorable view of their income prospects in the next six months.
Consumers also felt better about price increases, with expectations for inflation in the next 12 months down to 5.8 percent from 6 percent.

HEADLINE: Home Prices Rise Again, This Time on the Low End

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN and NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
The housing market continues to gather strength, and the biggest gains in price now appear to be among the least expensive homes, whose values fell the most in the downturn and have weighed against any would-be recovery.
Over all, the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller index showed an annual gain of 1.2 percent in the price of single-family homes across 20 cities in July, according to data released Tuesday. In addition, all 20 cities showed price increases from the previous month, the third monthly gain in a row, supporting the idea that the nation's housing market has bottomed out and, some analysts said, contributing to an unexpected bump in consumer confidence.
Luxury homes lost less value in the housing crisis and began to rebound more quickly, but lower-price homes are catching up, rising slightly faster in value than homes in the middle and upper tiers, according to an analysis of the Case-Shiller data by Patrick Newport and Michelle Valverde of IHS Global Insight, a private research firm in Lexington, Mass. 
The typical lower-price home rose at an annualized rate of 1 percent from June to July on a seasonally adjusted basis. The middle tier posted a one-month gain of 0.4 percent, and the highest tier inched up by 0.1 percent.
In the last three months, Mr. Newport said, the lowest tier has been rising in value more than twice as fast as the other two categories. For the least expensive homes, ''prices just shot up too fast on the way up and then went down more sharply,'' he said. ''We're seeing the correction from that.''
The price cutoffs for each tier vary widely depending on the city. The cutoff for the lowest tier ranges from $86,000 in Atlanta to $349,000 in San Francisco.
Other data supports the trend. According to a report from Zillow, a real estate Web site that divides homes into three price groups, the gap in price changes between the top and the bottom of the market is narrowing. ''It's less that the top tier is cooling than that the bottom tier is strengthening,'' said Stan Humphries, chief economist at Zillow. ''The bulk of the recovery is due to the changes in the bottom and middle tiers.''
Even in Las Vegas, where housing prices are still slightly down over the last year, lower-end homes have ticked up in value, which may be good news for sellers but can be a hurdle for buyers. Mark Graham, a youth pastor who has been looking for a house for his family there for months, said buying a home for less than $150,000 could be a challenge.
''Houses are going on the market and within a day have multiple offers already on them,'' Mr. Graham said, adding that most of the offers were from investors who did not need financing. ''It's more or less a heartbreaking market, because you get your heart set on a house, and then someone walks in with cash.''
Not every market is showing improvement on the low end, according to Case-Shiller. Atlanta and Chicago are still lagging, but in places like Boston and San Diego, the bottom third of houses are doing better.
''The majority of the cities have been more like Boston and San Diego,'' said Maureen Maitland, a vice president at S.& P. Dow Jones Indexes, which produces the Case-Shiller index.
In Phoenix, which has shown the strongest recovery in housing prices of the 20 cities surveyed, the lowest third -- homes under $127,000 -- gained 33.5 percent from July 2011 to July 2012, while the top tier -- homes above $211,000 -- posted an 11.5 percent increase in that period.
Prices have been bolstered by a decline in the number of foreclosure sales and strong interest from investors, who are buying low-price properties and converting them to rentals.
In the Sarasota, Fla., area, investor demand has driven up prices for lower-end homes, said Roxanne Moore, a real estate agent with Green Lion Realty there.
''Investors are finding properties that they used to be able to buy for $80,000 or $90,000 are now going for $100,000,'' she said. In addition, after a long absence, first-time home buyers are beginning to trickle back in.
Over all, home values in the first seven months of the year rose 5.9 percent, the best year-to-date performance in seven years. Nevertheless, the broad housing market is still nearly 30 percent below its high in 2006.
In four cities -- Atlanta, Chicago, Las Vegas and New York -- prices are lower than they were a year ago. In New York, including the surrounding suburbs, prices increased 1.2 percent from June to July, but remain 2.6 percent lower than they were in July 2011. Prices at the low end of the market -- houses below $271,000 -- have dropped 3.9 percent in the last year, while high-end homes -- $437,000 or more -- have dropped 2.5 percent.
But in an optimistic sign, consumer confidence rose in September to its highest level since February, according to a report released Tuesday by the Conference Board, a private group.
The consumer confidence index reached 70.3 points, well above economists' expectations of 63 and a significant improvement from the upwardly revised level of 61.3 in August. Some analysts attributed the bump to gains in the stock market, while others credited the improved outlook for housing.

HEADLINE: Relic of an Era, Revitalized

BYLINE: By ERIN CHAN DING

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- Once a dormant area of empty warehouses, the River North section of Chicago has evolved into a nexus of dining, night life and, most recently, an aspiring rival to Silicon Valley. Its 45 square blocks are home to the headquarters of Groupon, the Chicago offices of Google and several hundred technology start-ups.
Now River North's digital transformation is extending to one of the neighborhood's most storied -- and decidedly low-tech -- commercial addresses. The Merchandise Mart, a Depression-era behemoth of limestone, concrete and steel that has long been synonymous with fabric bolts and furniture, is becoming a destination for the city's digital set.
''River North as an area has become very tech-savvy and very tech-cool,'' said Todd O'Hara, founder and chief executive of Toodalu, an app-building start-up that moved into the building this year. ''The Merchandise Mart is definitely kind of the pinnacle of all of it because of everyone coming in.'' 
The biggest newcomer, Motorola Mobility, plans to relocate its headquarters from the suburb of Libertyville to four floors of the mart next year, as well as take up a big chunk of the building's roof space for entertaining and group events.
It is the third major technology company to sign a lease with the mart since December, and 175 or so small tech businesses like Toodalu sublet space.
With the Motorola Mobility lease -- 632,000 square feet in all -- the tech sector will occupy about half of the building's office space, said Mark Falanga, the president of Merchandise Mart Properties, which owns and manages the building and is a division of Vornado Realty Trust of New York.
Before Motorola Mobility announced its move, about 65 percent of the 25-story building was devoted to wholesale showrooms and office space for the furnishings industry -- or was vacant. Like similar locations across the country, the Merchandise Mart has lost some of its traditional tenants to the recession and sluggish recovery, as well as to the Web.
When Motorola Mobility moves in, the building will be 95 percent occupied, up from 85 percent, the lowest occupancy rate in a decade. About 55 percent of the building will still be dedicated to showrooms.
''This is an opportunity for refreshing,'' said Holly Hunt, who has operated a furniture showroom in the mart for nearly three decades and welcomes the building's tech renaissance. ''I'm hoping it's making us feel alive again.''
Though office space has always coexisted with the mart's showrooms, the contraction in the gift and residential design industries during the recession left the building with a patchwork of empty spaces, Mr. Falanga said. The lease with Motorola Mobility allows the mart to shrink the showroom space by moving the 142 businesses now on the Motorola floors. About 100 of the businesses will be moved within the mart, said Mr. Falanga, and the others will either leave the building or close.
The tech industry ''is our next wave of business,'' he said. ''It's where a lot of creative energy is being channeled and it's the new, exciting frontier, and it's also a frontier where there's a lot of growth opportunities, so we wanted to be a part of all that.''
Though Vornado has sold the mart's neighboring 350 West Mart Center, which once showcased apparel, Mr. Falanga said that expanding the mart's technology presence ''wasn't a play to better the building for a sale or anything. This was a way to make a good building better.'' The Merchandise Mart business segment earned $72.8 million last year in revenue, according to Vornado's 2011 annual report.
The mart's showroom-based floor plan is a draw for tech companies that want to encourage collaboration on one, or a few, large floors. Most floors stretch 200,000 square feet and contain a quarter-mile-long wraparound corridor.
The new tenants also cite the proximity of commuter rail lines, the abundance of parking, bike locker storage -- and the energy around the River North neighborhood. According to BuiltInChicago.org, a Web site dedicated to the tech sector, the area had nearly 7,500 tech jobs as of last month.
''This is, like, the hottest place in the city right now,'' said Kevin Willer, the chief executive of the Chicagoland Entrepreneurial Center, which manages 1871, a nonprofit digital hub that provides space to start-ups in the mart.
That hub has helped convert the 12th floor into a lively area of curving sofas and people on Razor scooters, but even the mart's new fans say the aging giant remains a place largely associated with ''a lot of dark, dreary rooms,'' as Mr. O'Hara, the Toodalu founder, said.
Opened in 1930 by Marshall Field & Company, now defunct, the mart had been owned by the Kennedy family under Joseph P. Kennedy Enterprises for more than a half century before being sold to Vornado in 1998. With 4.2 million gross square feet, it is among the largest commercial buildings in the world.
The recent influx of tech tenants has brought stark change. The designers of the tech offices have been allowed to gut and renovate spaces. (In the process, some historical gems, like a metal and brick fire door found at 1871, were left to meld with the newly designed areas.) The mart is installing a distributed-antenna system, to be finished by year-end, which will improve cellphone reception and wireless connectivity throughout the building.
Some of the tech companies are configuring their new spaces with a hopeful eye to the future.
Razorfish, the digital marketing and advertising company owned by Publicis, consolidated its disparate Chicago offices into the mart's 12th floor nearly a year ago, installing conference tables of reclaimed wood and a keg refrigerator with two rotating beers on draft.
Razorfish hired about 100 more people since opening its Chicago office, which was built for a capacity of 400, according to Lori Schram, the company's facilities manager, and plans to expand its space within the mart.
And 1871, whose name alludes to the year of the great Chicago fire and the innovation that happened during the rebuilding of the city, has so far accepted 175 companies out of 600 applications for space, Mr. Willer said. Tenants of 1871 pay monthly rent for either shared or reserved space and qualify for seminars, tech events and access to venture capital firms and angel investors in the hub.
To accommodate the coming move by Motorola Mobility, Ms. Hunt, the furniture showroom owner, is among those relocating within the building. She opened her design business in 1983 with an 8,000-square-foot showroom for residential and commercial furniture. It has grown to 40,000 square feet on two floors, in addition to expanding to five other cities nationwide.
Ms. Hunt said the mart was covering the full cost of her move to a new 30,000-square-foot showroom (she says she's taking the opportunity to shift to a more suitable size). The mart, she said, is much too spacious to make her feel that her industry was being crowded out by new tenants.
Besides, she said, the change was overdue.
''When the energy starts to die in a building, people don't even feel good coming in,'' she said. ''And I know it had begun to happen in the Merchandise Mart.''

HEADLINE: Invitation to a Dialogue: An American Paradox

 BODY:
To the Editor:
To a room full of millionaires, Mitt Romney said he will never get the votes of the 47 percent of Americans he sees as ''dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims.'' Programs that provide food, medical care or shelter are, to him, drugs that turn users into Democratic-addicted voters, their individual initiative hollowed out. 
Mr. Romney has the politics backward. Evidence suggests that regions most dependent on government payments -- places like eastern Kentucky, southeastern Missouri and northern Arkansas, Arizona, Idaho and Montana -- reliably vote Republican. It is one of the great puzzles of modern politics, best expressed by the cry ''Keep your government hands off my Medicare!''
Democrats too quickly dismiss this paradox as hypocrisy or denial. It stems instead, I suspect, from the contradictions between old American ideologies and modern economic forces. From 19th-century Horatio Alger tales to modern conservatism's up-by-your-bootstraps-ism, Americans have long cherished self-reliance.
This idea now finds itself at odds -- as it did in the Progressive Era and the Great Depression -- with the vicissitudes of modern capitalism. As more people rely on government programs, from tax credits to school lunches to mortgage relief, some respond not with gratitude but resentment, focusing their ire not on the economic forces that brought them low but on the government programs that lift them up. Do they take Mr. Romney's words seriously, and really believe themselves unable to ''take personal responsibility''?
Responding to this paradox requires an alternative to modern conservatism's individualist ideologies. For too long, liberals have sought to persuade Americans, in the face of growing evidence to the contrary, that self-sufficiency and a middle-class life are compatible.
It is time we abandon our obsession with an individualism that was always more fiction than fact. Until Americans learn once and for all to hang together, we will assuredly continue, as Benjamin Franklin once put it, to hang separately.
FRANÇOIS FURSTENBERG Montreal, Sept. 24, 2012

HEADLINE: In Need of Help, and Grateful for It

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I was moved by ''I Was a Welfare Mother,'' by Larkin Warren (Sunday Review, Sept. 23). As a New York City teacher for 34 years, I saw the good, the bad and the ugly sides of welfare but never doubted it as a valuable and necessary resource for the truly needy. 
Ms. Warren's beautifully written article highlights how this essential resource can save lives and money. If it were not for welfare (public assistance), the world, and moreover, a son, would have been deprived of this successful mother, author and thinker.
In the long run, it would have been more costly to support two people possibly unable to contribute positively to society. Stated in a way that is meaningful for certain politicians in particular, thanks to welfare, Larkin Warren is able to pay her fair share of taxes.
SANDY POLLACK-KLEIN Scarsdale, N.Y., Sept. 23, 2012
To the Editor:
I, too, was a welfare mother in the 1970s; I dropped out of college when I got pregnant, then got married and later divorced. After completing college, I started law school. When someone suggested that I apply for Aid to Families With Dependent Children, I was shocked. I was the daughter of blue-collar workers, the first woman in my family to attend college, and had been taught to take care of myself.
I graduated with honors and built two small businesses with an education that welfare helped me obtain. When conservatives talk to me about welfare, I sometimes reveal this about myself. They invariably respond, ''Oh, but you were different.''
But I was not different. I was lucky to meet someone who steered me in the direction of the safety net, and lucky that it existed.
Because I want that safety net, diminished as it now is, to continue to be available to others, I will vote for the Democratic ticket in November.
JOANNE NEALE Needham, Mass., Sept. 23, 2012
To the Editor:
Nearly 40 years ago, as Larkin Warren was returning to college and preparing to apply for what was then Aid to Families With Dependent Children, I was starting out as a public aid caseworker. Part of my job involved visiting families who were receiving welfare benefits to redetermine their eligibility.
In my years as a welfare caseworker, I saw single mothers (and some fathers) who had work histories but were temporarily unemployed. There were also some who had no experience in paid work, and would need government services (like help with child care, collecting child support, English and high school equivalency classes, grants for college and so on) to become self-sufficient.
I wonder how many people in my caseload persevered and succeeded as Ms. Warren has, and fear for those whose circumstances are similar to Ms. Warren's in the early 1970s, but whose opportunities for a better life are fewer because of the real or threatened evisceration of many of the very programs from which she benefited so long ago.
AMY LAIKEN Chicago, Sept. 23, 2012
To the Editor:
Larkin Warren's account of her journey was poignant and illustrative. Please send a laminated copy to Mitt Romney and Paul D. Ryan. Ms. Warren's America is the one I want, not theirs with its bent to social Darwinism, Randian economics or the discounted ''47 percent.''

HEADLINE: Brooklyn's Industrial Space Retools for a New Era

BYLINE: By RONDA KAYSEN

 BODY:
The hulking industrial buildings that line Sunset Park's waterfront once bustled with manufacturing and military activity. Elvis Presley deployed to Germany from the Brooklyn Army Terminal in 1958, one of three million troops to pass through the Cass Gilbert-designed building. The area was once so busy that it had its own rail line and police and fire departments.
Today, many of these historic buildings, with about 15 million square feet of light manufacturing space in Brooklyn, are antiquated and struggling to stay relevant. Built at the turn of the last century, many of them lack basic amenities like central air-conditioning and automated elevators. As New York City bleeds manufacturing jobs to cheaper markets, persuading companies to stay is, at best, difficult.
But the city, which owns more than one-third of the space, and private developers are revamping these properties to appeal to a more nimble manufacturing tenant. And in doing so, the buildings are entering a new era that may ultimately benefit this working-class neighborhood. 
Three of the area's biggest properties are undergoing makeovers: Industry City, a rambling 6.5-million-square-foot complex off the Gowanus Expressway, which has been reaching out to small food manufacturers to capture some of the energy of the Brooklyn artisanal food scene; Federal Building No. 2, now renamed Liberty View Industrial Plaza, which is in the midst of a $40 million renovation and may soon open a Bed Bath & Beyond; and the city-owned Brooklyn Army Terminal.
''It's pretty exciting stuff. We're definitely seeing some improvements,'' said David D. Meade, executive director of the Southwest Brooklyn Industrial Development Corporation, a local economic development group.
Industry City is emblematic of the plight of manufacturing here -- and its potential.
Many of the 16 buildings in the complex, which dates to 1895, have fallen into disrepair.
''After dark, it's like being in a Batman movie because the buildings are so old and massive and decayed,'' said Jennie Dundas, co-owner of Blue Marble ice cream, which moved into a 3,000-square-foot manufacturing space in Industry City in December.
Only 66 percent of the property was occupied in January 2012, according to a loan analysis by Morningstar. About 2,500 people work at Industry City, according to the owners. By contrast, when Harry Helmsley owned Industry City in the 1970s, Topps Candy, makers of Bazooka bubble gum and baseball trading cards, had its headquarters there and the complex was 95 percent occupied, with 20,000 workers.
Tenants said that until the current owners, Rubin Schron and Abraham Fruchthandler, began renovations a year ago, windows swung open, roofs leaked, hallways filled with rainwater and trash went uncollected. In December 2010, Schron and Fruchthandler failed to make payments on a $300 million loan on the property, according to the Morningstar analysis.
''I really remember it being in trouble,'' said Jean-François Bonnet, owner of Tumbador Chocolates, which has been a tenant since 2005 and provides sweets to places like the Pierre and the Mandarin Oriental. But Industry City is turning a corner. In April, the owners restructured their loan, reducing their debt and lowering their monthly payments. As part of the arrangement, they invested $30 million in the property, according to the Morningstar analysis.
They plan to repave streets, upgrade buildings, improve infrastructure and modernize elevators. ''The area's character is shifting from outdated to industrial chic,'' Bruce Federman, director of real estate at Industry City, said in a prepared statement.
The owners have recently negotiated leases with Brooklyn-based niche food manufacturers including Blue Marble, Industry City Distillery, Colson Bakery and Nunu Chocolates. In September 2011, Industry City Distillery, a new vodka producer, moved into a 6,500-square-foot space. One of the location's draws was access to the roof, where the company hopes to build a greenhouse.
''The infrastructure support that Industry City offered was great,'' said Zachary A. Bruner, a machinist and fabricator at the distillery.
But redevelopment faces deeper challenges, as manufacturing's decline has accelerated in the last decade. The vacancy rate for industrial space in Sunset Park has hovered around 8 percent since 2005. It was just 3.1 percent in 2002, and less than 1 percent in 1997, according to data from the CoStar Group, a real estate information company.
The number of manufacturing jobs has also dropped. In 2002, there were about 3,200 manufacturing jobs in the area between 31st and 63rd Streets and First and Third Avenues, according to census data. By 2010, the number had dropped by half, to 1,600. The area's overall job decline was much less, down to 17,000 from 19,000, in the same period.
''Is it getting worse? Probably not. But this is not a cyclical problem. This is a structural problem,'' says Rene Circ, director of industrial research for Co-Star, citing high rent and aging infrastructure as two factors.
While manufacturing space cost an average of $13.16 a square foot in New York City in the second quarter, it was only $4.47 nationwide and $5.14 a square foot just across the river in New Jersey, according to a report by Newmark Grubb Knight Frank, a commercial real estate adviser.
The Bloomberg administration, however, has intensified its commitment to manufacturing in Sunset Park. The city owns and operates 5.8 million square feet of the manufacturing space in the area, where about 3,400 people work at 140 companies.
Jonathan Bowles, director of the Center for an Urban Future, said the city's designation of the area as an industrial business zone was ''hugely helpful.''
In doing so, the city has pledged not to rezone the area for residential use. Business owners within the zone are also eligible for a one-time $1,000 tax credit for every worker they employ, up to $100,000.
Over the last 30 years, the city has invested $168 million in improvements at Brooklyn Army Terminal, a 1919 edifice that was the largest military supply base in the United States through World War II.
A year ago, after occupancy fell to 87 percent, the New York City Economic Development Corporation spent another $1.2 million upgrading elevators and subdividing some of the building's 40,000-square-foot floors to lure smaller tenants. In the last year, the Economic Development Corporation has signed leases with 30 new tenants. Today, the 3.1 million square feet of leasable space is 93 percent occupied, with rents from $6 to $12 a square foot.
Stanislav Didenko ran his auto parts company, Xequipped, out of his apartment until he moved into a 2,700-square-foot office and warehouse space at Brooklyn Army Terminal in June.
The biggest draw for Mr. Didenko was the windows. The other warehouse spaces he considered had none. ''We wanted the view and the light,'' he said, standing along a bank of windows that overlooked the loading docks and train rails between the two Army Terminal buildings.
Rather than seek out smaller tenants, the owners of Liberty View Industrial Plaza hope to lure a major manufacturer to their eight-story building. The 1.1-million-square-foot property, which abuts Industry City, has been vacant for a decade.
Marvin Schein and Sal Rusi of Salmar Properties bought it from the city last year for $10 million and are spending $35 million to $40 million renovating it. The deal restricts usage to light manufacturing for the first 30 years and requires Salmar to find tenants who can generate 1,300 permanent jobs.
The developers gutted it, opening up the 160,000-square-foot floors, and restored the facade. Salmar is replacing all 600 windows, automating the freight elevators, adding central air and installing a fiber optic network. It hopes that by making 1.1 million square feet of manufacturing space into a state-of-the-art facility, it will be able to attract large tenants.
''We are trying to attract a different kind of manufacturer here,'' Mr. Schein said.
But as large manufacturers continue to leave the city, it may be hard to find a few tenants interested in a century-old building.
John Reinertsen, a broker at CBRE who is marketing Liberty View, noted that ''160,000-square-foot floors are hard to come by. Conversely, 160,000-square-foot tenants are hard to come by, too.''

HEADLINE: Making Vegan A New Normal

BYLINE: By JEFF GORDINIER

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES
IT was a warm California evening in the city of West Hollywood, and Kathy Freston was sipping a martini.
''Just because you're a vegan doesn't mean you don't want to have fun,'' she said, sitting in a booth at a restaurant called Craig's. ''I'm a decadent gal. I want to drink. I want to feel full at the end of a meal. I just don't want it to have any animals in it, for a variety of reasons.''
Tall, slim and golden-tressed enough to be mistaken for a movie star, Ms. Freston is the author of books like ''Quantum Wellness'' and ''The Lean,'' and a high-profile advocate for veganism. She strives to consume nothing that can be traced back to sentient creatures: no meat, no eggs, no dairy.
But chilled vodka with extra olives? No problem. Nor did she have any qualms about eating from a menu that includes an 18-ounce bone-in rib-eye steak. 
Craig's, hatched last year by Craig Susser, an alumnus of Dan Tana's, the age-defying hangout on Santa Monica Boulevard, is not a vegan restaurant. It represents a new culinary wave that can be felt all over Southern California, that reliable ripple-generator of so many national trends: the omnivore's restaurant that courts vegans and vegetarians (particularly the glamorous and powerful ones who are a crucial engine of the dining economy here) by preparing meatless dishes that surpass the droopy steamed-vegetable platters of yore.
''You picture vegan restaurants with a lot of people with sandals and dreadlocks, drinking carrot juice,'' said Ellen DeGeneres, who stopped by with her spouse, the actress Portia de Rossi, to chat with Ms. Freston. Here at Craig's, the mood was more high heels and blond locks.
In fact, from power tables in Beverly Hills to pubs in the San Fernando Valley, the surging popularity of plant-based diets is drastically changing the dining landscape. That shift is under way in various cities around the world, but it's happening in an explosive way in and around Los Angeles: at the elite gastronome magnets, at casual gathering spots and everywhere in between.
Actors and talent agents hammer out script deals over the Kale Colossus entree at SunCafe in Studio City, a neighborhood of Los Angeles. Vegan celebrities have become such a fixture at Café Gratitude that paparazzi occasionally camp out on the sidewalk. Elegant spots like n/naka and Hatfield's have extensive, ever-changing tasting menus for vegetarians.
But the after-work crowd can also head out to Golden Road Brewing, a craft brewery that rises from a sun-baked industrial patch just off the Ventura and Golden State freeways in the Atwater Village neighborhood, for vegan Super Bowl grub (a quinoa burger, a hero with deep-fried avocado slices, meat-free chili) on a menu that makes room for a hillock of pulled pork.
''I'm not the food police, but I like opening the vegan door for people,'' said Tony Yanow, the entrepreneur behind the brewery, as well as Mohawk Bend and Tony's Darts Away, which serve dishes like a ''vegan tailgate dog'' and Buffalo-style cauliflower florets. ''People will order food like that because it tastes good.''
Vegans and carnivores used to glare at one another in militant opposition, but Southern California is reveling in a sort of can't-we-all-get-along cross-pollination that you see at Cru in the Silver Lake neighborhood, where meat lovers marvel over the pumpkinseed chorizo. At Craig's, a vegan grilled-eggplant caponata shares menu space with a dish called Jerry Weintraub's Spaghetti Clam Show, both of which might be viewed as gentle ways to woo the A-listers.
Not long ago, Ms. DeGeneres asked Mr. Susser if he would try a vegan spin on chicken parmigiana. The dish appeared on the menu in September, with a patty of Gardein, a protein substitute, standing in for chicken. ''I'm willing to do anything,'' said Mr. Susser, something of an expert in celebrity relations. ''I want them here, and I want them happy.''
Ms. Freston, who recently separated from the media executive Tom Freston after 14 years of marriage, is friendly with just about every famous vegan in Hollywood. Lately there are quite a few, and they've changed the power dynamic enough that celebrating a box-office triumph over bountiful platters of charred flesh is no longer necessarily appetizing to the stars who helped bring in the money.
''That old meat bravado is dead,'' Ms. Freston said.
It wasn't always thus -- not even in the city where Alvy Singer, the protagonist in Woody Allen's ''Annie Hall,'' winced as he ordered alfalfa sprouts and a plate of mashed yeast. When Ms. Freston began turning vegan about a decade ago, she said, ''Nobody was interested in that.
''I remember Werner Herzog yelled at me at a dinner party when I first started going that way. He totally made fun of me. In the beginning I didn't know anyone who was eating this way. It was totally uncool.''
Finding a sprouts-on-seven-grain-bread sandwich has never been a problem in Los Angeles, but even a few years ago, the vegan chef and cookbook author Tal Ronnen couldn't imagine that his specialty would go as mainstream as it has of late.
''If you had told me that I could go to a cool brewery and half of the things on the menu would be vegan, I would never have believed it,'' Mr. Ronnen, the author of ''The Conscious Cook,'' said over lunch at the brewery in August. ''There's something very progressive about what's happening here. You should see it on a weekend, man. It's so packed. You can't get a table.''
The same goes for explicitly vegan or vegetarian restaurants like Café Gratitude, Elf Cafe, Real Food Daily and SunCafe, which is chronically full of luminous-skinned sylphs who seem to have floated in from a Fashion Week catwalk.
''The popularity thing took a turn mostly when a lot of celebrities started showing up,'' said Cary Mosier, who runs the Café Gratitude outposts in Southern California with his brother, Ryland Engelhart. ''Generally, celebrities are always concerned about eating well and taking care of themselves, so it started becoming flooded with actors. And then it was all the movie executives because the actors were there. And then they were having lunches there to discuss movies.''
Think of it as a classic case of supply and demand.
For reasons having to do with health, the environment, an aversion to cruelty to animals and (let's face it) rank vanity, more and more Californians are going vegan or vegetarian. Chefs and restaurateurs want to attract them, especially the beautiful and famous, because that will draw even more customers.
''I don't think you could go to a four-star restaurant in Los Angeles and not find a vegan option,'' said Ron Russell, a chef and owner at SunCafe. ''The clientele demands it.''
And restaurateurs face stiff competition. Vegans and vegetarians know by now that they don't have to settle for a plain baked potato when there's a sublime raw pea-and-coconut soup at Cru, or parsnip bacon and rich, creamy corn ravioli at Hatfield's. (Which is not to say that cooking without meat -- or, at times, without cream and butter -- is free of challenges. ''It's hard because along the whole way you're sort of eliminating things that you know would make it taste better,'' said Quinn Hatfield, the chef who dreamed up the parsnip bacon.)
Good food blurs boundaries: Omnivores find themselves lured into trying the I Am Whole, a noble bowl of sea vegetables, kale, kimchi, carrots and stewed adzuki beans at Café Gratitude, while vegetarians can comfortably meet their friends at Vertical Wine Bistro, which serves meat, because they know they can get the roasted red-pepper risotto with asparagus and saffron.
''I'm omnivorous,'' said Gale Anne Hurd, the owner of that bistro in Pasadena and a producer of films including ''The Terminator'' and ''Aliens,'' as well as the TV series ''The Walking Dead.''
''I do eat just about anything,'' she said, ''but I also like to dine out with my friends, and a lot of my friends are strict vegetarians or vegans.''
Three years ago, when Mr. Russell and his comrades were gearing up to open SunCafe, they tested their vegan recipes with a panel of six people, two of whom were avid carnivores. ''All six had to agree that it was a great dish,'' Mr. Russell said. ''Oh, my gosh, we must've thrown out 70 recipes that were good, but not good enough. It forced us to go to higher levels.''
While raw-vegan chefs in California have become skilled at using nut butters, spicy oils and fatty smears of avocado to give their dishes unexpected depths of flavor, nonvegetarian chefs like Mr. Hatfield and Niki Nakayama have discovered that the pressure to create something succulent out of fruits, vegetables, nuts and grains has coaxed them into new territory.
Is plant-based eating the way of the future? A new fountain of youth? That's anybody's guess. But in a city where nobody wants to get old, plenty of people are willing to give pumpkinseed chorizo and parsnip bacon a try.
As Ms. Freston put it while finishing off her martini: ''These guys want to extend their lives. They want to live long.''

HEADLINE: New Limits Considered In Airwaves

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- From East Hampton to Malibu, the only limit on how much beachfront property one can own is usually however much one can afford.
Not so in the air across the continent, where the Federal Communications Commission has long set limits on how much of the airwaves one company can control.
Now, pushed by small and medium-size telecommunications companies, the government plans to begin setting new rules to govern how much of the airwaves, or spectrum, a single carrier can hold. A big goal for those small companies, which compete with the behemoths Verizon and AT&T, is a measure that would give greater importance to so-called beachfront spectrum. 
Those are the highly sought-after airwaves that travel farther between antennas and pass more easily through buildings, making them especially attractive in urban areas where the largest, most profitable clusters of mobile device users congregate.
It may sound esoteric, but the issue is known to every cellphone user who has experienced a dropped call or a smartphone browser stuck endlessly loading a Web page. After years of limiting companies to no more than one-third of the available airwaves in a given territory, the F.C.C. on Friday will begin the rule-making process on whether new technologies require limits to be redrawn, recalibrated or perhaps removed.
The F.C.C.'s decision, which probably will not be final for about a year, will have broad effects on consumers and companies. It plays a part in another matter the agency is expected to consider on Friday: rules for auctioning off newly reclaimed airwaves.
In that effort, the commission is aiming to take back portions of the airwaves used by the military or by television broadcasters. It is offering cash incentives for companies to give up their spectrum. The airwaves would be auctioned, with a portion of the proceeds going back to the original private-sector license holders.
By giving more weight to the best-performing spectrum, the F.C.C.'s overall limits could increase competition by restricting the big companies from buying too much of the airwaves, said Matt Wood, policy director for Free Press, a consumer advocacy group. ''It is not the sheer amounts that matter,'' he said. ''It is where it is located on the radio dial that makes certain spectrum more valuable to a wireless company's business.''
Some wireless company executives disagree, saying that the fact that some airwaves can travel farther than others is meaningless in a large city like New York, where so many users are congregated that a company already has to put in extra towers to keep airwaves from being overloaded. Overloading, of course, results in dropped calls.
Nevertheless, the quest for new rules is being welcomed by large and small mobile phone companies alike, each looking for a competitive advantage. Public interest groups that often oppose the companies' efforts to trade spectrum also favor changes.
''There are a lot of competing interests here,'' said Walter G. D. Reed, a partner at Edwards Wildman Palmer in Providence, R.I., who has worked on telecommunications issues. And the F.C.C.'s challenge is how to allow companies like AT&T and Verizon expand their businesses while ensuring that smaller carriers do not get shut out.
Wireless industry executives say that they would welcome almost any new standards because that would remove the uncertainty cast by the agency's past practice of weighing potential spectrum deals case by case.
''Spectrum policy in this country needs to be built on a full factual record and rational economic policy,'' Joan Marsh, vice president for federal regulatory issues at AT&T, said in an interview. ''Carriers need a clear and reliable understanding of when and under what circumstances spectrum acquisitions will be permitted, something we do not have today. This proceeding will provide the vehicle to meet both goals, and take spectrum policy out of merger-specific proceedings and place it in an industrywide rule-making, subject to judicial review.''
The F.C.C. staff has circulated its proposals to the five-member commission, but the agency would not discuss the possible outcomes before the Friday meeting.
''The FCC's goal in reviewing its spectrum holding policies is to enable a healthy and competitive wireless marketplace with clear and predictable rules of the road, so that providers can serve the needs of the growing number of mobile Internet consumers,'' Tammy Sun, an F.C.C. spokeswoman, said in a written statement.
The issue of whether to revise spectrum restrictions arose during the commission's debate over whether to approve AT&T's proposed acquisition of T-Mobile last year, and again during its consideration this summer of Verizon's purchase of spectrum assets from cable companies.
Verizon's purchase was cleared but only after it was forced to sell some spectrum to maintain wireless competition in certain areas. AT&T's dropped its effort to buy T-Mobile after the Justice Department and the F.C.C. both objected, saying it involved an overly large concentration of spectrum.
As part of those proceedings, companies like Sprint Nextel and industry associations like the Rural Telecommunications Group advocated for change in the F.C.C.'s control standards.
The best airwaves for mobile phone companies are low on the electromagnetic spectrum, around 700 megahertz. Airwaves higher on the spectrum can carry more data -- an important characteristic in the age of video-playing smartphones -- but the signals cannot go as far and therefore require more towers.
''Because of the physical characteristics of spectrum at various places in the electromagnetic spectrum, it makes no sense to use a spectrum screen that considers one megahertz to be equal to another megahertz in a completely different band,'' Sprint Nextel said in a commission filing that opposed the recent Verizon deal.
F.C.C. officials say they hope to complete the new screening limits in time to use them in the incentive auctions, which probably will not take place for two years at least. Those auctions ''will drive faster speeds, greater capacity and ubiquitous mobile coverage,'' Julius Genachowski, the F.C.C. chairman, said this month in announcing the F.C.C.'s spectrum agenda. ''As smartphones and tablets proliferate, the opportunities to benefit consumers and businesses become clearer every day.''

HEADLINE: Test for Obama As Deficit Stays Over $1 Trillion

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Four years ago, Barack Obama campaigned for president on a promise to cut annual federal budget deficits in half by the end of his term. Then came financial calamity, $1.4 trillion in stimulus measures and a maddeningly slow economic recovery.
Now, despite small annual improvements, the deficit for the fiscal year that ends on Sunday will surpass $1 trillion for the fourth straight time. Against that headline-grabbing figure, Mr. Obama's explanation -- that the deficit he inherited is actually on a path to be cut in half just a year later than he promised, measured as a percentage of the economy's total output -- risks sounding professorial at best.
The fiscal imbalance on Mr. Obama's watch, however much a result of economic and demographic factors beyond his control as well as his own policy choices, has increased the nation's accumulated debt by about 40 percent and has saddled him with one of his biggest vulnerabilities. Facing off against Mitt Romney, Mr. Obama is on the defensive over deficits and debt nearly as much as he is over unemployment.
Dealing with deficits is the one major issue in which voters in polls regularly register more confidence in Mr. Romney than in Mr. Obama. It is also a flash point in the partisan war over the size and scope of government. 
Mr. Romney and his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, often campaign with digital debt clocks ticking off the rising liabilities. Their television advertisements highlight the issue; one appeals to women about the debt burden being left to their children.
Both Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama say that fixing the nation's finances is a priority. But they approach it in very different ways.
Mr. Romney is proposing to reduce the deficit and encourage economic growth by substantially shrinking the government -- unrealistically so, in the judgment of many budget experts -- while further cutting taxes and increasing spending on the military. He would inject more private sector competition into Medicare to rein in the quickly growing costs of health insurance for older people and would limit Medicaid payments to fixed amounts to the states.
Mr. Obama wants to combine spending cuts and tax increases on upper-income households to close the fiscal hole without fundamentally reducing the role of government or altering the government guarantees at the heart of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Those programs account for 40 percent of federal spending, and they will grow to half in a decade as more baby boomers claim benefits.
Mr. Romney has not put a figure on his deficit reduction target and has not fleshed out many of the details necessary to evaluate the long-term effects of his plan, but he says he would balance the annual budget in 8 to 10 years. Mr. Obama's most recent budget proposal called for $5.3 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade.
But long-term projections are notoriously unreliable. And in any case, budget analysts say that if the nation's goal -- at a moment when the economy is still shaky -- is to start moving seriously toward fiscal balance, neither approach is likely to prove equal to the problem.
Robert D. Reischauer, a former head of the Congressional Budget Office, expressed the consensus of many independent analysts, saying, ''The proposals by Romney are politically unachievable, and the president's proposals, while achievable, are too modest.''
The plans of both, analysts say, would leave the public debt continuing to rise over the next decade as a percentage of gross domestic product, the measure that economists favor. Though Mr. Romney's plans are more difficult to judge, given his lack of specifics, by some analyses he would do less to reduce annual deficits in that time than the president would, considering his position against raising taxes, his call to increase military spending and the fact that his proposals to remake Medicare -- the largest contributor to long-term deficits -- would not kick in until after 2022.
One analysis, from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, estimated that the debt would grow to at least 86 percent of gross domestic product under Mr. Romney's plan over the next decade, from 73 percent currently. Under Mr. Obama's policies, the debt would increase slightly after a decade, to about 77 percent of gross domestic product, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Many analysts say that a nation's debt should not exceed 60 percent to 70 percent.
Mr. Romney wants to cut taxes by $5 trillion on top of the Bush-era rates and keep military spending at a level requiring $2.3 trillion more than projected in the decade. But he also pledges to offset those costs to avoid adding to deficits, paying for the tax cuts by closing tax breaks and for the military spending by cutting domestic programs. In effect, he has challenged himself to find $7 trillion in savings before he even turns to deficit reduction.
''That means you've got to make really big cuts in those areas that we have got to invest in to be competitive in a knowledge-based global economy: education, infrastructure, research,'' said Erskine B. Bowles, a Democrat who helped lead a bipartisan debt commission for Mr. Obama in 2010. ''Also, you've got to make really big cuts in the income-support programs that take care of the disadvantaged.''
Independent analyses have also outlined the difficulty Mr. Romney would face in finding enough savings in the tax code to pay for his tax cuts. For all the talk of loopholes and tax dodges, the real money is in the popular deductions and credits -- for employee health benefits, mortgage interest, charitable donations, state and local taxes, child care and college tuition -- that benefit many middle-income Americans.
But Mr. Romney has said he would not raise taxes on the middle class. His chief economic adviser, R. Glenn Hubbard, the dean of the Graduate School of Business at Columbia University, said Mr. Romney would shrink his tax cuts before he would break that promise. The Romney plan also counts on economic growth to generate some new revenue to pay for tax cuts.
Because Mr. Romney would delay his Medicare changes for a decade to exempt current beneficiaries and those nearing eligibility, the savings would not help him keep his promise to balance the budget in 8 to 10 years. That goal is two decades sooner than Mr. Ryan would reach balance in his House budget, indicating how much deeper Mr. Romney would cut domestic programs than Mr. Ryan would.
Mr. Romney has characterized his call for the repeal of Mr. Obama's health care law as a budget saving measure, but the Congressional Budget Office has said that repeal would add more than $100 billion to the deficit over the next decade. Mr. Romney's main proposal for reducing deficits in the short run is to cap all spending by the end of his term at a level equal to 20 percent of gross domestic product, the average for the 30 years before the recession, before spending on stimulus measures, unemployment aid and retiree benefits helped drive spending to the current 23 percent.
But long before the recession, forecasts had federal spending rising above 20 percent of gross domestic product in this period, largely a result of the pressures of an aging population. So the Obama camp argues that a 20 percent cap is unworkable.
More likely to get squeezed, whoever is elected, and certainly under Mr. Romney, is the wide range of domestic discretionary programs, covering education, science, law enforcement, veterans' care and more.
These programs, which Congress finances annually, get a relatively small and declining share of the federal budget as spending grows for entitlement programs, the military and interest on the debt. The bipartisan deficit deal last year called for cuts of more than $1 trillion over 10 years. Many analysts doubt that Congress can agree to those reductions, yet Mr. Romney's cuts would come on top of them.
Mr. Obama's plan, which would seek to balance spending cuts and tax increases, has been attacked from opposite sides -- from conservatives for raising taxes and from budget watchers who agree with Mr. Hubbard that the president cannot finance the government he wants simply by increasing taxes on the rich.
''We're going to have to raise taxes more than the president has proposed, and on a broader swath of taxpayers,'' Mr. Reischauer said.
Mr. Obama's budget ''comes out in a better place than we are now,'' said Robert L. Bixby, the executive director of the Concord Coalition, a budget watchdog group. ''But it's not like it's full of bold proposals. And it doesn't add up to a sustainable outlook.''

HEADLINE: Weighing In On the N.F.L.: Obama Throws Flag on Officials

BYLINE: By NICK CORASANITI

 BODY:
Few events transcend politics, especially in a campaign year. The National Football League's lockout of its game officials appears to be one of them.
Following the latest, and perhaps most egregious, disputed call by the replacement officials in the Green Bay-Seattle game Monday night, politicians from both parties are echoing many fans' frustrations and calling for an end to the lockout.
In a personally signed Twitter message from his campaign account, President Obama expressed hope for a quick end to the lockout. 
NFL fans on both sides of the aisle hope the refs' lockout is settled soon. -bo
- Barack Obama (@BarackObama) 25 Sep 12
Later, according to pool reports, ABC's Devon Dwyer shouted "Packers" to Mr. Obama as he exited Marine One and headed toward the White House. The one-word question was enough to make Mr. Obama stop to talk to the press.
"Terrible," Mr. Obama said of the game. "I've been saying for months, we've gotta get our refs back."
Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who has made his battle against unions a staple of his tenure, took to Twitter to call for the return of the unionized officials.
After catching a few hours of sleep, the #Packers game is still just as painful. #Returntherealrefs
- Governor Walker (@GovWalker) 25 Sep 12
Jon Erpenbach, a Democratic state senator from Wisconsin who has clashed in the past with Mr. Walker, agreed with the governor on Twitter.
If tonights game doesnt make the NFL settle with the real refs this season will be a joke.
- Jon Erpenbach (@JonErpenbach) 25 Sep 12
And former President Bill Clinton, who is enjoying an all-time high in popularity, is using his rediscovered national microphone to express his dismay at the N.F.L.
"The Packers will wake up this morning and just sort of shake their head and say, 'We should have won by two touchdowns,' " Mr. Clinton said on Tuesday with MSNBC's "Morning Joe." The former president continued his criticism in an interview with CNN's Piers Morgan, arguing that "we need to get the strike over and get more experienced people in there."
But that doesn't mean some aren't politicizing it.
In a town hall meeting in Cincinnati on Tuesday, Representative Paul D. Ryan, a devoted Green Bay Packers fan, likened the much-maligned officials to Mr. Obama's budget staff.
"I half-think these refs work part time for the Obama administration in the Budget Office," Mr. Ryan said. "They see the national debt clock staring them in the face, they see a debt crisis and they just ignore and pretend it didn't even happen."
Later in the speech, he tweaked a well-worn line from his standard stump speech, saying, "Unlike the Seattle Seahawks last night, we want to deserve this victory, we want to earn this victory."
For those N.F.L. fans hoping for executive intervention from the Sports Fan in Chief, Mr. Obama doesn't appear to have a phone call scheduled to the N.F.L. commissioner, Roger Goodell. Last week, in a radio interview with Bill Wills, of WTAM-AM in Cleveland, the president said, "But one thing I got to say, though, is it just me or do we have to get our regular refs back?," before adding, "I can't get involved in it, but I'm just expressing my point of view as a sports fan."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Euro Update: The Perils of Pointless Pain

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Are we reaching the point where the afflicted nations can bear no more? 

 BODY:
So, I'm in jet lag city, which means that it's time for a euro update. (I've been pretty focused on the US election, since it is, after all, my country; but still keeping an eye on the other side of the pond).
The basic story of the euro crisis remains the same: it's essentially a balance of payments crisis, misinterpreted as a fiscal crisis, and the key question is whether internal devaluation is really workable.
What? OK: the roots of the euro crisis lie not in government profligacy but in huge capital flows from the core (mainly Germany) to the periphery during the good years. These capital flows fueled a peripheral boom, and sharply rising wages and prices in the GIPSI countries relative to Germany: 
Then the music stopped.
The combination of deeply depressed peripheral economies (which meant surging budget deficits) and fears of a euro crackup turned this into an attack on peripheral-government bonds. But the root remains the balance of payments/cost problem. And any resolution must involve getting costs and prices back in line.
This is the context in which you have to see Mario Draghi's actions. Twice now -- first with the LTRO last fall, then with the plan to buy sovereign debt, he has stepped in to limit runaway bond yields, short-circuiting a possible financial "death spiral" of falling bond prices, collapsing banks, and high-speed capital flight. Here are bond yields (monthly averages, with the most recent data standing in for September):
Good for him. But you still need "internal devaluation": a sharp fall in costs and prices relative to the core. And that's a slow, painful process.
Where does austerity fit in to this story? Mostly it doesn't. Shaving an extra couple of points off the structural deficit will make very little difference to long-run solvency, nor will it do much to accelerate the pace of internal devaluation. It will, however, depress employment even further and inflict a lot of direct suffering too through cuts in social programs.
Why do it, then? Partly it's because Europe is still operating on the false theory that this is essentially a fiscal issue; partly it's to assuage the Germans, who remain convinced that those lazy Southern Europeans are getting away with something. In effect, the policy is to inflict pain for the sake of inflicting pain.
Which brings us to the question: can this go on? When do the people of the afflicted economies say that they can bear no more? 
The news from Spain, with vast protests and talk of secession, suggests that this moment may be approaching fast. Also, while Greece has long since ceased to be the epicenter, things seem to be breaking down there too.
I really do think Draghi has done very well. But he can't make internal devaluation work on his own, and he can't save Europe if its leaders continue to think that gratuitous infliction of pain is sound policy.

HEADLINE: N Ways to Apply Algebra With The New York Times

BYLINE: PATRICK HONNER


HIGHLIGHT: Is algebra necessary? An Op-Ed essay argues it isn't. We list algebraic opportunities you can find in the pages of The Times, and invite you to join the conversation. 

 BODY:
This summer, the political scientist Andrew Hacker's New York Times Op-Ed essay "Is Algebra Necessary?" set off a national debate on mathematics education. Here is how the essay begins:
A typical American school day finds some six million high school students and two million college freshmen struggling with algebra. In both high school and college, all too many students are expected to fail. Why do we subject American students to this ordeal? I've found myself moving toward the strong view that we shouldn't. 
The debate inspired us to suggest several algebraic opportunities right here in the pages of The Times. After considering them, and reading Mr. Hacker's essay in full, we invite you to tell us what you think. Is algebra necessary? 
 1. Mathematically Modeling Mortgages 
Use algebra to evaluate the housing market. Find some homes for sale in your area (for example in Atlanta), research current interest rates for mortgages and apply this formula to determine the required monthly mortgage payment. 
Experiment with different home prices, different interest rates and different mortgage lengths to explore the impact of each variable on the resulting monthly mortgage payment. Use the Real Estate section's built-in mortgage calculator to check your work.
For a given house, explore questions like "How much would you end up paying over the entire term of the mortgage, and how does this compare to the value of the house?" and "How big is the difference in monthly payments between a 15-year mortgage and a 30-year mortgage?"
Do you think it is more cost effective to rent an apartment or buy a house? Read this article and play around with this Times Interactive to explore the answer.
 2. Evaluating Colleges 
Check out how algebra is used to rank colleges. Read this article about the history of the Academic Index and then check out this informational graphic detailing the formulas that are used to create college rankings. 
Calculate and compare the Academic Index of colleges like SUNY Binghamton and by finding the appropriate data here. Are your results consistent with those of the U.S. News & World Report rankings, or those of The Princeton Review
Use other available data - like tuition, acceptance rates and faculty information - to create your own algebraic formula for evaluating colleges. Can you create a ranking system that puts SUNY Binghamton ahead of U.S.C.? Can you create a different ranking that puts U.S.C. ahead of SUNY Binghamton? Can you create a ranking that puts your favorite college at the top of the list?
 3. Calculating Car Costs 
Use data from The Times's section to create a model for how quickly cars lose their value.
Use the to collect price information on specific makes and models of cars. Select your automobile, get your list of prices (for example, there are nearly ), and create a scatter plot with "year" on the horizontal access and "price" on the vertical access.
Use the graph and your data to explore questions like "How much value does a used car lose per year?" and "When does an automobile depreciate fastest?" Use technology like a graphing calculator or a computer spreadsheet to generate a possible function that models this data. Use the model to project the value of a new car two, three or 10 years from now. Set up equations to solve questions like "After how long will the car be worth 50 percent of its original value?"
Ratchet up the reality and complexity by compensating for the differences in new car prices and inflation. Go deeper by exploring questions like "Do SUVs lose value faster than sedans?" and "Which cars are the best long-term investments?"
 4. Algebra of the Election 
To win the presidency, a candidate must secure more than half of the 538 electoral votes. Take a look at the current breakdown of electoral votes by state, and find combinations of states that add up to 270 (or more) electoral votes. Each solution to this equation (or inequality) represents a potential path to the presidency.
Compare your possibilities to those demonstrated in this Electoral Map informational graphic. Take a look at some possible situations and interact with the mathematics by moving states around and exploring other solutions to this equation. If you were running for president, where would you focus your campaign resources?
 5. Do the MetroCard Math 
Is it better to buy a card that gives you unlimited access to public transit, or should you just pay ride by ride? Check out this article on the mathematics of New York City MetroCards. Currently, a seven-day unlimited MetroCard costs $29 and a 30-day unlimited MetroCard costs $104. If a single ride costs $2.25, under what circumstances would you be better off buying the weekly unlimited? The monthly unlimited? Set up simple linear equations and inequalities to answer these questions. Who should buy the 30-day unlimited? 
Transfer over to some harder problems by factoring in the 7 percent bonus you get when you prepay for a pay-per-ride card. How does this discount affect the above calculations? And for even more real-world complexity, consider the effect that pretax commuter benefits can have on the equation. Check your numbers against the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.'s own comparisons here, and research the commuter cards in your area to find your best local options.
 6. Olympic Algebra 
Use mathematics to explore the wealth of Olympic data The Times has to offer. Take a look at the world records set this year in London, and check out the history of world records for events in track, field, swimming and more at the bottom of the page. Use simple formulas like Distance = Rate * Time to compare and contrast the average speeds of athletes over time, across events and even by gender. How much faster is the fastest sprinter now than 50 years ago? How much faster is the fastest sprinter than the fastest long-distance runner? How do swimmers, runners and cyclists compare in speed?
Pick an event, like the 100-meter freestyle swim, and take a look at the history of the world-record times. Create a scatter plot of the data with the horizontal axis representing the year and the vertical axis representing the world-record time. Experiment with some simple linear equations to find a line that fits the data, and use this equation to project the possible world-record times in 2016, or to hypothesize when the fastest time might drop below 43 seconds. If appropriate, use computing technologies to generate regression equations to compare to your own work.

 7. Redo Those Recipes 
Search this for some tasty recipes with your favorite ingredients like chicken with lemon and rosemary or midnight pasta. Suppose you had twice as many people coming for dinner: what would the new recipe look like? Turn your recipe into an algebra problem by converting all amounts into some standard measure (like grams) and creating expressions that tell you exactly how much you need for any number of people. How many grams of chicken will you need if N guests show up for dinner?
Use a to determine the number of calories per serving of your dishes. Using this United States Department of Agriculture guide, plan out meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner that keep you in the healthy range for caloric intake. Or list the 10 foods you most like to eat and find out how many calories are in each of them. Set up inequalities to figure out how many you should, or shouldn't, consume to keep within your healthy range.
 8. Solve for Stocks 
Choose some of your favorite companies and use Times resources to collect historical stock price information: for example, check out Ford Motor Company, Apple or Amazon.com. Look at the prices over some fixed period of time, say the past two years, and determine the growth of the value of the stock over that period. If you had invested $1,000 at the beginning of that time period, how much would you have at the end?
Using the formula for compound interest, A = P(1+(r/n))nt, run the numbers on some hypothetical investments of the same principle investment over the same time period, and compare the results to the performance of the stock. Did the stock do better than a 5 percent annual rate of return? How about 8 percent? Set A equal to the final value of the stock, and solve for the rate, r, to figure out the exact rate of growth of your chosen stock.
Find the rates of return for several stocks, and put together a hypothetical investment portfolio for the school year. Watch your stocks through the year and compare their performance to your calculations. Does past performance guarantee future returns?
 9. Population Growth, Football, the Economy and More 
Use existing resources to apply algebraic tools to , or even succeed in .
 10. Is Algebra Necessary? 
Read Mr. Hacker's original essay and decide for yourself. Do you use internal equations to help plan out your schedule? Or inequalities when you're spending your money? Or graphs when you are plotting your performance? Or maybe you use algebra to figure out if that frequent shopper program is worth sticking to. 
Find the algebra that's around you and write a response to Professor Hacker. Maybe algebra isn't necessary, but it sure can be useful.
This lesson addresses the following Common Core domains, standards and practices under Algebra:
 Domains 
Create equations that describe numbers or relationships.

HEADLINE: A Spotter's Guide to Five Notable Vehicles at the Paris Motor Show

BYLINE: JERRY GARRETT


HIGHLIGHT: The Range Rover, Volkswagen Golf, Jaguar F-Type, Ford Mondeo and the most powerful factory Mini ever produced will be among the closely watched introductions in Paris on Thursday. 

 BODY:
PARIS -- Organizers of the 2012 Paris motor show said more than 100 new models would be introduced on Thursday during the first of two press preview days. Although some surprises were expected among the debutantes, so many of the manufacturers have leaked details ahead of the previews that it would be possible, with some certainty, to identify at least five noteworthy debuts from automakers with global reach:
Volkswagen Golf Much is riding on the seventh-generation Golf, so much that its design falls squarely in the don't-mess-with-a-good-thing school. The look is evolutionary, not revolutionary. But the most important objective of Golf engineers was to reduce weight and consequently improve fuel economy. Judged by that criterion, the Golf succeeds, shedding as much as 220 pounds over its predecessor, according to VW.
A much sharper rendition of the Golf will be seen on Thursday in the Seat León, from the Spanish affiliate of the VW Group. The León, like so many products at this show, is intended principally for Western European consumption.
Land Rover Range Rover Weight reduction was a goal as well for Land Rover in its redesign of its flagship S.U.V. Significant savings, as much as 700 pounds, were achieved by using lightweight materials wherever possible, the brand said. From a styling standpoint, it would be difficult to mistake the new model for anything other than a 21st century Range Rover.
Jaguar F-Type It might seem Jaguar has been apologizing for canceling its sporty, elegant and powerful E-Type since it was discontinued in 1974. The company looks to sets things right with the introduction of the F-Type, a reimagining of the E-Type, according to the brand. The debut comes roughly half a century after the first E-Type was shown in 1961. That car was so exquisitely executed that Enzo Ferrari was said to have called it "the most beautiful car ever made." The F-Type, it would appear, has some big shoes to fill.
Ford Mondeo The Mondeo is a vitally important component of Ford's European lineup. The company is counting on the newest generation of its midsize sedan to help it battle back from an expected billion-dollar loss this year in its European operations. The Mondeo bears a nearly complete family resemblance to the 2013 Fusion sold in the United States. The Mondeo-Fusion twins, in turn, look a lot like the Rapide, their supermodel cousin at Aston Martin, a former Ford luxury brand.
 Mini Here's a bit of a surprise. While most heads will be turned toward the new, unboxy Mini Paceman being shown here, the hottie in the Mini lineup at Paris will be the John Cooper Works GP special edition. Though this is not the first GP special edition from Mini, it is the hottest, with its turbocharged 1.6-liter in-line 4-cylinder engine producing 218 horsepower. The base 192 pound-feet of torque can be amplified to 207 pound-feet for moments of temporary euphoria by an overboost function. That may explain how, according to Automobile magazine, this new model beat its predecessor around the Nürburgring by a full 18 seconds.
 Wheels will be reporting from the convention floor on Thursday, the first day of press previews for the 2012 Paris motor show.

HEADLINE: Labor-Market Scars Left by Redistributive Public Policy

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Redistributive public policy not only depressed the labor market but changed the composition of the work force so that it includes more people who are married and more skilled, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. 
The social safety net became more generous under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, and as a result massively altered employment patterns in the labor market.
I have explained in previous posts how public moneys have recently been used to help the unemployed, the poor and the financially distressedendure the recession, but at the same time have dramatically eroded incentives for people to maintain their own living standards by seeking, accepting and retaining jobs, as well as incentives for employers to create jobs that are attractive to workers.
My forthcoming book "The Redistribution Recession" (see the introductory chapter online) quantifies those incentives and their changes over time in terms of marginal tax rates, which refer to the extra taxes paid, and subsidies forgone, as a result of working, expressed as a ratio to the income from working.
As a result of more than a dozen significant changes in subsidy program rules, the average middle-class non-elderly household head or spouse saw her or his marginal tax rate increase from about 40 percent in 2007 to 48 percent only two years later. Marginal tax rates came down in late 2010 and 2011 as provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act expired, but still remain elevated - at least 44 percent.
Americans have different economic and family situations, and subsidy program rules are complex. As a result, the marginal tax rate changes for particular households vary significantly from the average eight-point increase. A few households even saw their marginal tax rates jump beyond 100 percent - meaning they would have more disposable income by working less.
Marital status and skill (that is, what people are capable of earning) are important determinants of the marginal tax rate and its changes over time. Married people saw their marginal tax rates increase less than average, because even when out of work theyare likely to be ineligible for a number of antipoverty programs because of amounts earned by their spouse.

Skilled people saw their marginal tax rates increase less because a number of the new subsidies were fixed dollar amounts, and a fixed dollar amount is a lesser fraction of what a skilled person can earn than it is a fraction of what an unskilled person can earn.
Little attention has been paid to marginal tax rates lately, under the Keynesian assumption that the labor market is slack during a recession and that for the time being labor supply has nothing to do with labor-market outcomes. As Paul Krugman put it: "What's limiting employment now is lack of demand for the things workers produce. Their incentives to seek work are, for now, irrelevant."
One way I tested, and rejected, the Keynesian assumption was to compare work-incentive changes and work-hours changes between 2007 and 2010 across 10 demographic groups differentiated according to their skill (five categories) and marital status (two categories). In the Keynesian view, the two changes would be correlated only by coincidence.
The group-specific incentive changes are measured (most recently in my paper "Recent Marginal Labor Income Tax Rate Changes by Skill and Marital Status") on the horizontal axis in the chart below as percentage changes in the share of what people keep from what they earn, net of taxes paid and subsidies forgone. For example, work incentives were eroded about 20 percent for unmarried household heads (red squares) in the middle of the skill distribution, while they were eroded about 12 percent among married heads and spouses (black circles) with the same level of skill.
The vertical axis of the chart measures the percentage change in hours worked per person, most of which is due to increased unemployment rates. Each tick on the vertical axis is 2 percent, which makes each tick as large as some recessions.
Among unmarried people, hours worked tended to fall more for the less-skilled groups. I explain this result as a consequence of greater incentive erosion among less-skilled unmarried people compared with more-skilled unmarried people, but others have suggested that less-skilled people experience greater demand changes during recessions or otherwise have behavior that is more sensitive to economic conditions.
Remarkably, the same skill pattern does not hold up among married people. All but the top skill group have essentially the same hours changes and are uniform in terms of their incentive changes. Also remarkable are the huge differences by marital status between hours and changes and incentive changes. For example, the married people in the lowest skill group saw their work hours fall about half of the drop for unmarried people with the same skill, which lines up with the huge difference in their incentive changes.
Keynesians can explain different labor-market experiences by demographic groups to the degree that groups differ in their propensities to work in declining industries, except in this case marital status has very little correlation with industry of employment. All of this makes sense to economists who think that labor supply still matters, because groups facing the same demand for their labor can nonetheless have different labor-market outcomes because of their varied supply situations. 
The fact that marginal tax rates rose so differently for various groups means not only that redistributive public policy depressed the labor market but has also sharply, and arbitrarily, altered the composition of the work force in the direction of people who are married and more skilled.

HEADLINE: Libor's New Masters

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: The British banking group that controls Libor is said to be preparing to give up that responsibility, Tesla Motors conceded it would be turning to investors and taxpayers for help, and the Mexican arm of Banco Santander staged one of the year's biggest I.P.O.'s. 

 BODY:
Libor's New Masters | The British banking group that controls a crucial lending rate is preparing to give up that responsibility, a person with direct knowledge of the matter tells DealBook's Mark Scott.
On Friday, Martin Wheatley, managing director of Britain's Financial Services Authority, is expected to unveil the results of an investigation into the London interbank overnight rate, or Libor, after Barclays employees were accused of trying to manipulate the rate. That scandal showed the vulnerability of the rate, which affects more than $360 trillion of financial products. Going forward, tampering with Libor may be a criminal offense.
Mr. Wheatley is also expected to recommend changes in how the rate is overseen. He has hinted at possible changes to the Libor process, saying this summer that "reform may include amendments to the technical definitions used for Libor, the associated governance framework and the role of official regulation." Another prominent regulator, Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the United States, said this week that "it is time for a new or revised benchmark."
Tesla Brought to Earth | On Monday, it was all about lasers and smoke. But on Tuesday, Tesla Motors conceded it would be turning to investors and taxpayers for help.
The electric car company plans to sell five million shares to raise cash, it said in regulatory filings, adding that the federal government agreed to waive some conditions of a $465 million loan. The moves raised questions about the company's long-term viability, DealBook's Peter Eavis reports. The company is run by Elon Musk, the mogul described as "Steve Jobs, John D. Rockefeller, and Howard Hughes rolled into one." Yet for all the hype, Tesla is four to five months behind delivering its Model S sedans to customers.
Tesla's chief financial officer, Deepak Ahuja, said the changes to the government loan were "normal" because the company's business model had evolved. But Tesla's shares fell almost 10 percent on Tuesday, at one point triggering Nasdaq's circuit breakers, according to MarketWatch.
For a look at other young companies, The Wall Street Journal plans to release a ranking of how 50 venture capital-backed start-ups have fared over the past year.
Santander Prices Mexican I.P.O. Within Expected Range | The Mexican arm of Banco Santander staged one of the year's biggest initial public offerings on Tuesday, pricing the American portion of its I.P.O. at $12.18 a share, in the middle of the expected range, a person briefed on the matter told DealBook. Shares are set to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday under the ticker symbol BSMX.
Investors didn't appear too concerned by the size of the deal, or by the high degree of control that Santander will have over its Mexican subsidiary. Profit at the Mexican lender has outstripped that of its parent, rising 14.4 percent in the first half of he year.
On the Agenda | The head of Santander's Mexican unit, Marcos Martinez, is on CNBC at 9:50 a.m. Roger C. Altman, the former deputy Treasury secretary and current executive chairman of Evercore Partners, is on Bloomberg TV at 7:48 a.m. Phil Angelides, who was the chairman of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, is on CNBC at 4:40 p.m.
Data on new home sales for August is out at 10 a.m., after Tuesday's home price data gave encouraging signs of a recovery. The Business Roundtable releases its quarterly CEO Economic Outlook Survey at 11 a.m., with the heads of companies giving their expectations for sales and hiring.
Wednesday is the four-year anniversary of the bankruptcy filing of Washington Mutual, the biggest bank failure in the nation's history.
The Squid and the Whale | A well-known diorama at New York's American Museum of Natural History became laden with irony during a charity gala this week that included employees of Goldman Sachs (derided as the vampire squid) and JPMorgan Chase (which employed a trader nicknamed the London Whale).
"I've had to sit here all night staring at a whale," said Jes Staley, JPMorgan's investment banking chairman, according to Bloomberg News. Mr. Staley, Bloomberg reports, "then suggested the whale could be replaced with the squid in the room, which, he clarified afterward, meant Goldman Sachs."
Goldman's president, Gary D. Cohn, who presided over the gala for the NYU Langone Medical Center's Hospital for Joint Diseases and Center for Musculoskeletal Care, replied in kind. "The only squid in the room is over there," he said, according to the report. "I've never been so comfortable in a roomful of JPMorgan people in my life."
Outsmarting a Hedge Fund, Canadian Style | It seemed like a clever trade when the American hedge fund Mason Capital Management bet against a proposed share conversion by the Telus Corporation, a Canadian telecommunications company, the Deal Professor writes. But things haven't turned out so well for Mason, which has found a shrewd opponent in Telus. Though the trade is said to be currently profitable, the hedge fund now faces the prospect of potentially losing millions.
Protests in Greece and Spain | The New York Times reports: "Clear signs of the political and social cost of the euro zone crisis sent financial markets tumbling Wednesday as debt-laden Greece faced a crippling 24-hour strike and Spain cleaned up after violent protests Tuesday near the country's Parliament. Spanish bond yields approached 6 percent for the first time in months, while European shares and the euro fell sharply, as developments in Greece and Spain sent a new wave of anxiety through the ranks of international investors."

HEADLINE: American Banks Undamaged by Cyberattacks

HIGHLIGHT: Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, U.S. Bancorp and PNC have been hit by cyberattacks that have caused Internet blackouts and delays to online banking sites by a group claiming Middle Eastern ties. The attacks, while a nuisance, were not technically sophisticated and did not affect companies' computer network or funds, or customers' bank accounts. 

 BODY:
Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, U.S. Bancorp and PNC have been hit by a wave of cyberattacks that have caused Internet blackouts and delays on online banking sites.
The banks have been targeted with distributed denial of service or DDoS attacks, in which hackers barrage a Web site with traffic, causing it to slow or collapse under the load. Such attacks, while a nuisance, are not technically sophisticated and typically do not affect a company's computer network - or, in this case, funds or customers' bank accounts. 
A hacker group, which calls itself the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters, took credit for the attacks in an online post to Pastebin, a Web site hackers frequently use to publicize attacks. The hackers say they will continue to target American corporations daily, as part of an operation they call Operation Ababil, until an amateurish 14-minute anti-Islam video, which mocks the Prophet Muhammad, is pulled from the Web. (Izz ad-Din al-Qassam was a Muslim holy man who fought against European forces and Jewish settlers in the Middle East during the 1920s and 1930s.) 
Last week, Bank of America, JPMorgan and Citigroup customers all experienced delays and intermittent failures on the banks' sites. On Tuesday, Wells Fargo's online banking site also periodically fell offline. 
Sara Hawkins, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman, confirmed Wednesday that customers might still be experiencing "intermittent access" to the bank's Web site and said the bank was working to resolve the problem.
In their post, the hackers called on volunteers to attack the site of U.S. Bancorp on Wednesday and PNC's on Thursday. By Wednesday afternoon, Tom Joyce, a spokesman for U.S. Bancorp, said that the company's online banking site had experienced some delays, but no failures, as a result of unexpected traffic and that the bank was working with law enforcement.
"The issues, indeed, are related to what we would call an unusual amount of coordinated, high-volume traffic that has slowed down the system very similar to what other banks have experienced," Mr. Joyce said. "These attacks were designed to slow the customer experience but their funds and data are secure."
Fred Solomon, a PNC spokesman, said that PNC's customers had also reported difficulty logging into its Web site Wednesday. 
Adrienne Senatore, a spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation's field office in New York, declined to comment. Kathleen Wright, a spokeswoman for the F.B.I. in Washington, said that as a matter of policy, the F.B.I. could not confirm whether it was investigating the attacks. 
None of the press officers would comment on the origin of the attacks. But last week, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, chairman of the homeland security committee, said in an interview with C-Span's "Newsmakers" program that the attacks on the banks had originated in Iran and were conducted in retaliation for Western economic sanctions. 
Hackers rebutted those claims in their online post, which has since been withdrawn from the Web. They said the attacks were not state-sponsored by Iran, and said they "strongly reject the American officials' insidious attempts to deceive public opinion." 
It said:
We invite all cyberspace workers to join us in this Proper Act. If America's arrogant government do not submit, the attack will be large and larger and will include other evil countries like Israel, French and U.Kingdom indeed.
Cybersecurity experts said they had witnessed an increase in activity from Iran and an increase in the number of so-called hacktivists, hackers who attack for political purposes rather than for profit. 
"We absolutely have seen more activity from the Middle East, and in particular Iran has been increasingly active as they build up their cybercapabilities," said George Kurtz, the president of CrowdStrike, a computer security company, and former chief technology officer at McAfee. "There is also a strong activist movement underfoot which should be concerning to many large companies. The threat is real and what we are seeing now is only the tip of the iceberg."
James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that in this case, the attack methods used were "pretty basic," which raised doubts about whether the attacks were state-sponsored. 
He added that if the attacks were not the work of Iran's government, the state would still be aware of them. "They extensively monitor their domestic networks, so if this is some activist group there may be at least some government knowledge."

HEADLINE: Mexico Unit of Banco Santander Rises 6% in Debut

BYLINE: EVELYN M. RUSLI


HIGHLIGHT: Shares of the unit, Grupo Financiero Santander M&#233;xico, rose 6 percent on its first day of trading to close at $12.91, amid a choppy environment for initial public offerings. 

 BODY:
 6:26 p.m. | Updated 
The Mexican unit of Banco Santander rose 6 percent on its first day of trading to close at $12.91, amid a choppy environment for initial public offerings.
Shares of the unit, Grupo Financiero Santander México, initially climbed 3.4 percent at the opening of New York Stock Exchange trading on Wednesday, but strengthened in afternoon trading.
The financial firm, one of Mexico's largest lenders, was the third-largest initial public offering this year, after Facebook and Japan Airlines.
The bank held a dual listing in Mexico and the United States, raising about $4.2 billion. On Wednesday, it priced its United States listing at $12.18, near the middle of its expected range of $10.99 to $12.70 a share. Each American depositary share is worth 5 Mexican shares, which were priced on Wednesday at 31.25 Mexican pesos.
"We're happy; things are going better than we expected," Marcos Martínez Gavica, the chief executive of Grupo Financiero Santander México, said in a telephone interview on Wednesday morning. He said that the offering was five times oversubscribed, with most of the demand coming from American and European investors.
Since the beginning of this year, 141 companies have priced their offerings, about a half fewer than last year, according to data from Renaissance Capital, an I.P.O. advisory firm. In the United States, 97 have priced so far, a slight gain from last year, but the market has been bogged down by Facebook's botched May offering and its subsequent weak stock performance.
Amid increased uncertainty, many American companies have held back. So far this year, 112 companies have filed for an initial public offering in the United States, according to Renaissance Capital, down 47.7 percent from last year. On Wednesday, ViSalus, a health and wellness consumer unit of Blythe, said it was shelving its I.P.O. plans, citing market conditions. Last week, Cortina Systems, a semiconductor company, also withdrew plans for a $100 million offering.
Santander México's debut on Wednesday indicates that investors are moving cautiously. While many new shareholders were likely to have been drawn to the stock because of its ties to the growing Mexican economy, there was also concerns about its Spanish parent company, Banco Santander, which has been dragged down by Spain's credit woes.
After the offering, the parent company will still own about three-fourths of the business. Some analysts are concerned that, faced with mounting pressure, the Spanish bank could inundate the market with additional shares or seek a higher dividend from the unit.
"The bank has continued to be well positioned in Mexico's banking system," said Arturo Sanchez, a Standard & Poor's analyst. "But we're closely monitoring that relationship - not only for Banco Santander but for the other Spanish-owned banks."
The company, whose stock is trading under the symbol "BSMX," was led in its offering by Santander, UBS, Deutsche Bank and Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch.
According to Mr. Sanchez, the risk that the parent company's problems will infect the Mexican unit are somewhat limited because of Mexico's banking regulations, which require banks to maintain a capital ratio of at least 8 percent.

HEADLINE: The Wealth of Washington

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Seeking explanations for D.C.'s influence-peddling arms race. 

 BODY:
In a post pivoting off my weekend column on Washington's extraordinary recent growth, Dylan Matthews of Wonkblog marshals data showing that the soaring wage premium for Washingtonians doesn't correlate directly with increases in the federal government's share of G.D.P. The two have spiked together in the last few years, but the D.C. economy achieved separation from national trends in the Reagan and Clinton years and lift-off under George W. Bush, a long three decade period when government's share of the national income was relatively flat. What does correlate, though, is the growth in Washingtonian wealth and the steady expansion of lobbying: As Matthews notes, "the growth in inflation-adjusted lobbying spending, as measured by OpenSecrets, tracks the D.C. wage premium's rise since the 1990s quite well."
I think Matt Steinglass of the Economist has an interesting take on this, even if though it requires complicating my column's "Hunger Games" analogy:
The government isn't spending more money now than it was 40 years ago, as a percentage of the economy, so that doesn't explain why Washington is richer than other American cities. Rather, Washington is getting richer because the intensity of the struggle for influence at the centre of power has a natural tendency to keep spiraling upwards, and influence groups have to spend more on their struggles in the capital just to stand still. This isn't a conspiracy by a unified ruling class of takers against the far-flung makers, as in the Capitol of "The Hunger Games". It's an unavoidable, never-ending political battle between powerful clans to protect their interests at court, as in King's Landing in "Game of Thrones" (pictured above). Gridlock between powerful vested interests can be very profitable for experienced, well-connected court players who can promise to preserve the gridlock.
I don't actually think these are incompatible analogies: I imagine that if we saw more of the internal politics of Panem's Capitol in "The Hunger Games," we would see more Lannister-versus-Stark style intrigue around the presidency and related offices. More importantly, I also don't think that the fact that the D.C. premium has been growing even without a steady increase in the percentage-of-G.D.P. size of government proves that size doesn't have anything to do with what's been happening in the D.C. bubble of late. Instead, I think you would expect the growth of lobbying and influence-peddling to sometimes lag the expansion of the state: First came the heroic age of liberal activism, in this reading of our 20th century history, and then over time various forms of patronage and corruption barnacled themselves onto the edifices that F.D.R. and Lyndon Johnson built - first gradually and then at an ever swifter pace, as the arms race between interest groups inevitably intensified. (This is similar to the case that Jonathan Rauch makes in his great book "Government's End," channeling Mancur Olson among others - that it isn't just size alone that makes government inefficient, but size as it interacts with the inevitable effects of time, sclerosis, and insider competition.)
What's more, our limited, post-2007 experiment with actually increasing government's share of G.D.P. correlated with a sharper-than-usual spike in the D.C. wage premium - suggesting that while Washington doesn't need further increases in government spending to keep pulling away from the rest of the country, they certainly don't hurt. That same post-2007 experience raises the possibility that D.C. has become/is becoming a kind of safe economic harbor in troubled times - a place professionals feel secure relocating to, and businesses feel safe investing in, because they know that the federal government's sheer size, borrowing power and penchant for countercyclical spending will cushion them during downturns. (The downside of centralized Keynesianism, in this sense, isn't just that the deficits it requires are a drag on long-term growth - it's that it makes rent-seeking seem more rational than risk-taking.)
Steinglass concludes his "Game of Thrones" analogy by suggesting that we "try putting Congress on the road and just sending them to a new convention centre in a different state every two years, on sort of a Mongol Golden Horde or Dothraki model." I like that idea, but in the realm of the (slightly) more realistic I think the best way to at least contain the Beltway influencers' arms races are the boring, old fashioned, conservative ones: Look for reforms that make existing programs less amenable to political and interest-group intrigue, and if you can't shrink the state's footprint at least keep it roughly where it's been these last few decades, instead of giving the D.C. area's Littlefingers another 3-5 percent of G.D.P. to work with.

HEADLINE: How Is Romney Still Competitive?

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama beats Mitt Romney in just about every issue in the polls. So how is Mr. Romney's candidacy still viable? 

 BODY:
The latest poll from Ohio shows that President Obama's lead over Mitt Romney has grown, to 10 percentage points. Mr. Romney is going to have a lot more trouble getting to the White House without winning Ohio-in fact, no Republican president has ever won the race without it. 
The poll, conducted by The Times with CBS News and Quinnipiac, shows similar gaps in Florida and Pennsylvania at a time when a solid majority of voters say they're really paying attention to the race and have pretty much made up their minds.
But here's what continues to puzzle me: Why is Mr. Romney doing even this well? 
Mr. Obama's voters are generally more enthusiastic about him than Mr. Romney's voters - by substantial margins - in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida. Mr. Romney's unfavorable rating is higher than his favorable rating in all of those states, while the opposite is true for Mr. Obama.
The president beats Mr. Romney, soundly, when voters are asked if each candidate cares about the problems of people like them. (So much for the tuna-and-pasta campaign at the GOP convention.) And voters pick Mr. Obama as more likely than Mr. Romney to properly handle issue after issue - national security, the Middle East, taxes, health care, the economy in general, Medicare, immigration. 
Mr. Obama wins on everything the pollsters asked about, in fact, except the budget deficit. 
That's one reason Mr. Romney is even competitive at this point after running an incompetent campaign, being caught expressing his disdain for the "47 percent," picking an ultra-right Tea Party darling as his running mate, and generally selling out his principles to the religious right to win the nomination.
The Republicans have had an amazing degree of success selling themselves as budget hawks, even though they have increased the deficit during all three of their presidencies since they started the whole starve-the-beast and live within your means nonsense about government under Ronald Reagan.
Mr. Romney's economic program - or rather the bare outlines on which he is running - would not even come close to solving the deficit problem. It would, however vastly increase the burden on middle-income Americans and those farther down the ladder, according to every non-partisan assessment. The ideas of his running mate, Paul Ryan, are worse.
Mr. Obama must make this case to the voters. Stubbornly clinging to the myth of bipartisanship for the first three years of his presidency does not help him now.
Then there is the housing crisis. His administration had a chance to address it early on, by at least pushing Congress to mandate mortgage principle reduction, and chose not to do it. Their excuse, as on many other things, was that it would never have made it through Congress, even when the Democrats controlled both houses.
But that was a choice, driven by financial advisers who chose helping the banks over homeowners, and by political aides who did not want to lose a big vote in Congress. That timidity has hurt the president among voters who heard him promise to fight for the middle class and have not see him do it.
The third big dynamic in this race, as it has been since Mr. Obama's inauguration, is the extreme antipathy toward Mr. Obama - personally - on the right-wing fringes of this country. Personified by the "birther" movement, it is driven to a disturbing degree by racism.
To win this race, Mr. Romney has to drive out the vote among the Obama-haters, who outnumber the Romney-likers in the polls. Mr. Obama's challenge, oddly enough, is among the Obama-likers. He has to renew the waning enthusiasm among those who supported him-and actually still do-but are disappointed so far with his presidency and may choose not to vote.

HEADLINE: McCaskill Hits Akin for 'Legitimate Rape' Comments in New Ad

BYLINE: STEVEN YACCINO


HIGHLIGHT: Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri criticizes her opponent, Representative Todd Akin over comments he made in August, and Mr. Akin gets some support from Republicans for his candidacy. 

 BODY:
When Republicans started calling for Todd Akin to bow out of the United States Senate race in Missouri last month, Senator Claire McCaskill, his Democratic opponent, tried to avoid talking about his "legitimate rape" controversy on the campaign trail. But now that the final deadline for Mr. Akin to withdraw has passed, with Mr. Akin locked in as the Republican nominee, she is swinging as expected.
A new television advertisement released by Ms. McCaskill's campaign on Tuesday threw the first punch in what is not likely to be the candidate's last mention of a comment Mr. Akin made in an August television interview that the female body naturally prevents pregnancy in instances of "legitimate rape." 
The advertisement flips through a list of Mr. Akin's "own words" on myriad issues - Social Security, Medicare, minimum wage, student loans - ending with a jab that many Democrats have been waiting for since the firestorm began. 
"And on Aug. 19, Todd Akin said only some rapes are legitimate," the 30-second spot said. "What will he say next?" 
The race in Missouri has been one of the most closely watched battles this election cycle, as Ms. McCaskill has shown vulnerabilities in her state and many see it as a crucial seat in the Republicans' effort to take control the Senate. 
Mr. Akin's defiance to stay in the race, even after losing the backing and financing of the Republican establishment, now has some Republicans reconsidering their support as high-profile endorsements from within the party emerge.
On Wednesday morning, a former Republican presidential candidate, Rick Santorum, sent an e-mail to supporters informing them that he and Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina would announce their endorsement of Mr. Akin's candidacy.
"If Republicans are to win back the Senate and stop President Obama's liberal agenda, we must defeat Senator Claire McCaskill in Missouri," the statement said. "Her support of President Obama's job-killing, big-spending policies are sending our country into an economic abyss."
Calling Mr. Akin a "principled conservative" it continued: "We support Todd Akin and hope freedom-loving Americans in Missouri and around the country will join us so we can save our country from fiscal collapse."
Showing his commitment to stay in the race on Tuesday, Mr. Akin began a bus tour across the state this week.

HEADLINE: Creams Capture the Eyes of Men

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
WHEN Lt. George Del Grande of the Belleville Fire Department in New Jersey turned 40 last month, he took it in stride because he felt as physically fit as ever and had recently earned his certification as a personal trainer.
But there are some areas that no amount of exercise can tone. 
''My wife said I was getting the old turkey's feet on the sides of my eyes, the wrinkles,'' said Lieutenant Del Grande, who works two 24-hour shifts a week. ''I also get dark circles under my eyes, and people tell me I look tired.''
Now he uses Protein Booster Eye Rescue by Jack Black ($40), which promises to combat puffiness, dark circles and fine lines. ''When I use it, I get compliments like, 'You look well-rested,' or 'You look healthier,' or 'You look like you went tanning,' '' Lieutenant Del Grande said.
A generation ago, men dismissed using anything besides shaving cream and after-shave on their faces as unmanly. But now, despite the recession, revenue from department stores for men's skin care products in 2011 grew 11 percent over 2010, according to the NPD Group, a market research firm. And within the category, men's eye creams grew even more dramatically, by 33 percent. Revenue for men's eye products was $5.4 million in 2011, up from $3.5 million in 2007.
Brian Boye, the fashion and grooming director for Men's Health, said that while ''having wrinkles was once a sign of being distinguished for men,'' those days are gone. ''Looking younger is more in the thought process,'' Mr. Boye said, ''and it's new for guys to be held to the same sort of standards of beauty and youth that women have always been held to.''
Blepharoplasty, or eyelid surgery, was the third most popular cosmetic surgery for men in 2011, according to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery. Men underwent 8.8 percent of procedures over all, but accounted for 15.5 percent of the eye surgeries. (The average cost of the procedure is $2,630, with about 10 days of down time before being presentable.)
For the scalpel-averse, there are scores of over-the-counter products.
Murphy D. Bishop II, 40, vice president for sales and marketing at Butter London, a nail products company, has been using 911 Eye Gel ($36) from Mënaji, a men's line, for more than a decade. Mr. Bishop, who lives in Seattle and travels frequently for work, keeps tubes in his briefcase and at home.
''I'm up at four or five to go to the gym and I'm constantly on flights, and I really feel like it alleviates puffiness and perks me up,'' Mr. Bishop said.
Clinique Skin Supplies for Men has both Age Defense for Eyes ($28), a cream, for fine lines, and Anti-Fatigue Cooling Eye Gel ($28), a roll-on with a stainless steel ball, for puffiness. From Anthony Logistics for Men there is Continuous Moisture Eye Cream ($33), which promises to fight signs of aging, and, under the Anthony for Men Action sub-brand, the Rescue Eye Stick ($25), for puffiness. And lower-priced brands available in drugstores include two more roll-ons, Nivea for Men Eye Roller Gel ($8) and L'Oreal Paris Men's Expert Hydra-Energetic Ice Cold Eye Roller ($11).
Sales of the men's' product Kiehl's Facial Fuel Eye De-Puffer ($20), which comes in a stick form, have increased about 30 percent each year since its introduction four years ago, said Chris Salgardo, the president of Kiehl's.
Dr. Macrene Alexiades-Armenakas, a dermatologist in Manhattan and assistant clinical professor at the Yale University School of Medicine, said her male patients seem to suffer under-eye bagginess and discoloration more severely than women.
''I don't know if it's because of an anatomical difference or a culture of neglect,'' said Dr. Alexiades-Armenakas, referring to men being less likely to use moisturizer, sunblock or concealer under their eyes. ''But the men just have these very large festoons under their eyes so they look like hound dogs.''
Many products that claim to reduce puffiness contain caffeine, which is effective at constricting vessels, resulting in decreasing the fluid in under-eye tissues, she said. (The folk remedy of putting used, cooled tea bags on eyes, it turns out, has some physiological basis.)
Perhaps the best thing for eyes is to close them.
''There's a reason it's called 'beauty sleep,' '' Dr. Alexiades-Armenakas said. ''If you don't get eight and a half hours, your eye muscles just don't rest sufficiently, and if the muscles aren't rested they don't oxygenate properly and the vessels dilate and you get puffiness and discoloration.''
But some men, like women, simply inherit prominent fat pads under their eyes or are suffering from allergies, which can cause both temporary and permanent puffiness. Dr. Alexiades-Armenakas suggests topical treatments and sometimes performs a laser treatment, which restricts vessels to reduce swelling and discoloration.
In its annual grooming-awards issue this year, Men's Health selected Lab Series Max LS Instant Eye Lift ($44) as the best eye product, and Mr. Boye, the grooming editor, said men generally are more reliant on such guidance than women are.
''Women go to the bathroom together and talk about lip color, but in my experience guys don't get together for 'Monday Night Football' and talk about what eye creams they use,'' Mr. Boye said.
Certainly Sgt. Steven Courville of the Providence Police Department, who uses eye cream to fight puffiness and dark circles that come with long shifts, does not brag about this in the squad room.
''By all means,'' Sergeant Courville said, ''I'm not going to tell other cops I use a froufrou eye cream.''
He also uses Protein Booster Eye Rescue along with several other products from the Jack Black line. ''A lot of guys' faces look like they've been run over by a truck,'' said Sergeant Courville, 43. ''I don't want to be in my 60s or 70s and look like I have a face made of leather.''

HEADLINE: Build-A-Bear Goes High Tech

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
BUILD-A-BEAR WORKSHOP stores, a children's destination for more than a decade, are moving beyond stuff, fluff, dress and accessory formulas to increase the interactive choices that children have when they create a favorite bear or other furry creature.
Now that digital gadgets are a much bigger part of children's play, Build-A-Bear is opening new stores that aim to entertain digitally adept children with more interactive options to keep them coming back. 
The company, which has sold nearly 110 million plush animals since it started in 1997, introduced its first revamped store this week, in St. Louis, and plans to open more such concept stores nationwide.
''We wanted it to be more of an experience,'' said Maxine Clark, the founder and chief executive of Build-A-Bear, which has 296 stores in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, but has had losses in two of the last three years as the tight economy and electronic games have buffeted the toy market.
''Smartphones and tablets have changed the way children play, so we wanted the stores to stay fun and relevant,'' she said.
The bright yellow stores in shopping malls gained popularity as a hands-on space for children to choose a plush bear, bunny or other animal to make their own, dressing it and giving it a personality and name.
The retailer is introducing its new technology-enhanced stores with radio and digital ads, print ads in local newspapers and television commercials. It will broaden its branding efforts to five additional markets where new stores will open starting in October, then nationwide and internationally, where it has stores in Britain and Ireland as well as franchise stores in other countries.
''We had a period of product advertising, but now we are back emphasizing our brand,'' said Ms. Clark.
The company, which had a $17 million loss last year on $394 million in revenue, did not disclose the current campaign's advertising budget. Build-A-Bear Workshop spent nearly $7.8 million on advertising last year, and $2.7 million in the first six months of 2012, according to Kantar Media, a WPP unit.
Its new strategy is the first overhaul of Build-A-Bear stores since they were begun by Ms. Clark, who worked at the former May Department Stores and then as president of Payless ShoeSource, the discount footwear retailer that May acquired then later spun off.
In her 2006 book, ''The Bear Necessities of Business,'' Ms. Clark describes how a shopping trip with a young friend to buy collectible stuffed animals gave her the idea to start a business where children could create their own huggable characters.
The retailer's core customer, Ms. Clark said, is an 8-year-old girl. The average customer visits two to three times a year to create a customized animal, or to buy outfits.
But with children engaging in more virtual play, Ms. Clark said she began thinking, ''How can we unlock a new experience each time a customer comes?''
Two years ago, the retailer began testing ideas, working with the Adrienne Weiss Corporation, a Chicago advertising agency that was part of the original brand development, to reinvent the store design.
''When the stores first opened, play patterns were fairly traditional,'' said Dave Finnegan, Build-A-Bear's chief information officer. ''So we reached out to kids and parents to articulate some ideas,'' and enlisted cub advisers -- children from 6 to 12 years old from the St. Louis area -- to test the technology, design, layout and experience. Build-A-Bear is based in St. Louis.
''What we came up with,'' said Mr. Finnegan, ''is half retail and half theme park.''
Working with Microsoft Kinect movement technology, the new stores have a large screen at the front so customers can play games by waving their hands in front of it. Customers can visit eight new technology stations intended to increase hands-on engagement.
Starting next month, 15- and 30-second commercials will be shown nationwide that promote the new choices. A separate 30-second commercial has been tailored for markets in California, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan and Virginia, where new stores are opening.
A one-minute video is being posted Thursday on buildabear.com offering a virtual tour of new features like the new ''love me'' touch screen where a child can choose a heart for his or her stuffed animal. Other new options include a customized sound chip and scents like chocolate chip or cotton candy that can be embedded in the stuffed animal.
The animal can also be dressed in numerous outfits tailored to boys and girls. In addition to a name, the animal gets a birth certificate and a bar code that allows a lost animal to be tracked and returned. That happens about 500 times a year, the company said.
The new stores will offer a separate section for boys, who make up about 30 percent of customers.
Build-A-Bear is keeping the same pricing, between $10 and $30 for a stuffed animal, and will include some new features in existing stores. At first glance, the revamped stores -- which are painted in bold primary colors -- look very similar to the existing ones, Ms. Clark said. ''Kids see our stores and run up to them,'' she said. ''We didn't want to change that.''

HEADLINE: Budget Cuts to Archives Put History Out of Reach

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
MORROW, Ga. -- The Georgia Archives, which holds both historical curiosities and virtually every important state government document ever created, is about to become nearly impossible to visit.
In November, a round of government budget cuts will reduce the staff to three, one of them the maintenance man. Thousands of documents that pour in every month are likely to languish because no one will be available to sort through them, archives officials said. People who view accurate and open government records as the bedrock of democracy are outraged.
The move will make Georgia the only state without an archives open to the public on a regular basis. But this closing is simply the most severe symptom of a greater crisis facing permanent government collections in nearly every state, professional archivists say. 
An amalgam of recession-driven budget cuts and fast-moving technological changes could result in a black hole of government information whose impact might not be understood for decades.
''When our humor gets black, we talk about this as a period of time that could be the Dark Ages for public records,'' said Vicki Walch, the executive director of the Council of State Archivists. ''Fifteen years on either side of the year 2000 is very dicey.''
Every state has an archive, which is mandated to hold the official records of government and, by default, the history of the state.
Laws governing which records must be saved and for how long vary from state to state. But all archives offer a trove of information. One can track who met with a governor, trace the history of every state law, find out whether a particular person held a professional license and pore over tax records.
Genealogy is big business for archives, too. As part of a television series, the restaurateur and cookbook author Paula Deen searched for her family history at the Georgia building here and discovered an ancestor who once owned slaves.
The records are often used to settle legal disputes. When two Georgia counties were in a fight over the sales tax revenue from a lucrative Bass Pro shop that straddled their boundaries, they turned to the state archives to settle things.
''The archives are like an insurance policy,'' said Richard Pearce-Moses, director of the archival studies program at Clayton State University, which is near the Georgia Archives Building south of Atlanta. ''There is a good chance we might never need to know where the county line is, but when we do, we really, really need to know.''
Increasingly, government records are being produced electronically, and agencies use a variety of software to collect and store them. But technology is changing so quickly that few protocols exist on how to gather and protect digital records from tampering. That applies to those once produced on paper as well as new forms of communication, like government Web sites and Facebook pages.
As a result, governments have to decide at what point an electronic birth certificate, for example, will be considered an acceptable legal document.
''A lot of this is untested in court,'' said Sarah Koonts, the director of archives and records in North Carolina. ''What kind of metadata do we need to have around an electronic record to prove it's authentic?''
As with paper, preservation is an issue, too. No one knows how today's technology may hold up and which methods of collection may go the way of the floppy disk, leaving a pile of pixels no one can read in 50 years.
State archivists are scrambling to learn how best to handle digital records just as they are absorbing the largest budget cuts in recent memory.
City and county governments are shrinking, too, so local officials are either not collecting as much information or simply sending what they do collect straight to the state repositories.
The volume of paper records held by state archives jumped to more than 3.9 million linear feet in 2012 from about 2.5 million linear feet in 2006, according to a survey by the Council of State Archivists.
''It would be one thing if the archives could say we are going to quit collecting paper and just collect electrons,'' Mr. Pearce-Moses said. ''But we are getting more digital content on top of more paper.''
In South Carolina, where the oldest document in the archives was created in 1671, W. Eric Emerson, the director of archives and history, is trying to hold on. At its peak in the 1980s, his department employed 125 people. Now there are 28. He has had to give up on conservation completely.
''Budgets are being cut and staffs are shrinking at the exact time when we need to be adapting and spending on digital infrastructure,'' he said. ''If you are in a state that thinks government should be smaller, it's just far more challenging.''
His fear, like that of other archivists, is that ''20 or 30 years from now, this will be a period in which numerous government records were lost.''
It's more than just adding server space and storing files shipped in from other agencies.
''That's like taking 200,000 documents, throwing them in a Dumpster and telling a researcher: 'What you need is in there. Go get it,' '' he said.
There are some bright spots. Gov. Nathan Deal of Georgia has said he will push to restore some financing for the state archives in the coming budget cycle, and new federal grant money is available to train archivists in electronic records.
In August, the Obama administration issued a directive aimed at overhauling the way federal agencies manage and preserve records. Many state archivists hope those protocols will inform their work.
Meanwhile, debates over what to keep and what to throw away continue.
''Is the Twitter feed of Gov. Jan Brewer in Arizona a public record? Yes. No question,'' Mr. Pearce-Moses said.
''Whether or not it has to be kept and where to keep it is another question,'' he added. ''What it really boils down to right now is triage.''

HEADLINE: Romney Ad Reaches Out to Working Class

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER; Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WESTERVILLE, Ohio -- Mitt Romney stepped up his efforts to repair the damage from his ''47 percent'' comments, releasing a new television ad on Wednesday in which he speaks directly to the camera about his compassion and tries to reassure voters that he cares about the poor and middle class.
The 60-second ad, ''Too Many Americans,'' was Mr. Romney's most aggressive effort to clean up the fallout from his secretly videotaped remarks at a May fund-raiser, where he called voters who do not pay income tax ''victims'' who are dependent on the government and feel ''entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it.'' 
But the ad came nine days after the video surfaced, a period in which Democrats have bashed Mr. Romney over the remarks, leaving him on the defensive in swing states like Ohio. The ad reflected a belief among his aides that in addition to trying to move past his ''47 percent'' comments, Mr. Romney can appeal to voters in an intimate, personal way, bonding over their economic worries. The spot, in which Mr. Romney seems to address the viewer, is an attempt, aides said, to reveal the compassion behind the policy. ''The goal is to connect with voters over their anxieties over the state of the economy, and reflect the fact that Governor Romney has a plan to fix it,'' said Kevin Madden, a senior campaign adviser.
On Wednesday, the Romney campaign reserved $3.4 million worth of advertising time in eight swing states. Nearly half of that -- more than $1.5 million -- was for Virginia. The rest was spread across Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Wisconsin. His total ad spending for the week is more than $10 million.
But the campaign's slow response also highlighted the gamble Mr. Romney is taking: a belief that the race will be decided in its closing weeks, and that much of the battering he has taken from President Obama and the Democrats will not have a permanent effect.
The ad comes on the heels of a concerted effort by the campaign to offer more of Mr. Romney's personal story, after Republican complaints that he has not done enough to sell or humanize himself to voters. ''President Obama and I both care about poor and middle-class families,'' Mr. Romney says in the ad. ''The difference is my policies will make things better for them.''
The Obama campaign continued to demand specifics in an effort to link Mr. Romney's ''47 percent'' remarks to the policies he would pursue as president. ''Mitt Romney's new ad is just more of the evasiveness that his campaign has become known for,'' said Lis Smith, an Obama campaign spokeswoman. ''He pays lip service to working Americans, but doesn't name a single policy to strengthen the middle class.''
The Democratic National Committee also released a Web video that mashed the new Romney ad with his gaffes, including the 47 percent comment.
In recent weeks, Mr. Romney's campaign has also begun showing at rallies a 10-minute biographical video -- first presented at the Republican National Convention -- that offers a compelling emotional portrait of Mr. Romney's life.
The haphazard history of the biographical spot is an example of the campaign's struggles to shape Mr. Romney's image: the video was to be shown during the prime-time televised part of the convention, but was moved for Clint Eastwood's highly criticized speech. The video was then shelved, only to reappear at rallies after donors and fellow Republicans began clamoring for it.
Even Mr. Romney admitted that he had seen the entire video for the first time last week at a fund-raiser. Referring to clips of his father, George W. Romney, he said: ''I saw my dad, and it brought a tear to my eye, and more, it touched my heart.''
The question is whether Mr. Romney's newfound emphasis on his softer side is too little, too late, coming just five weeks before Election Day. His advisers claim that most voters are just tuning in.
At a Wednesday rally in Ohio, Mr. Romney spoke about the struggling voters he has met: ''My heart aches for the people I've seen.''
In an NBC News interview on Wednesday, Mr. Romney, explaining why he could relate to middle-class voters, talked about the health care law he championed as governor of Massachusetts but rarely mentions on the campaign trail. ''Don't forget -- I got everybody in my state insured,'' he said. "One hundred percent of the kids in our state had health insurance. I don't think there's anything that shows more empathy and care about the people of this country than that kind of record.''
And at a candidate forum last week in Miami, Mr. Romney repeatedly assured voters that his campaign ''is about the 100 percent in America.''
''This is a campaign about helping people who need help,'' he said. ''And right now, the people who are poor in this country need help getting out of poverty.''
By painting himself as a compassionate conservative, Mr. Romney also seemed to be responding to his Republican critics, who have suggested that he borrow from George W. Bush's successful presidential campaign in 2000 that first used that phrase.
Mary Aggers, 65, watched the biographical video before Mr. Romney's campaign event in Bedford Heights, Ohio. ''It shows an aspect of him that the press usually doesn't bring out -- they try to make him a stiff, wealthy, cardboard figure,'' she said. ''But I like him because he's not a politician.''

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Slipped In August

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sales of new homes dipped slightly in August from July, but the median price of homes sold during the month rose by a record amount. 
New-home sales edged down to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 373,000 in August, a dip of 0.3 percent from July's revised rate of 374,000, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That had been the fastest pace since April 2010 when government tax credits were bolstering sales.
Sales in August were up 27.7 percent from the pace a year ago. But even with that gain, new-home sales remained well below the annual pace of 700,000 that economists consider healthy.
The median price of a new home jumped 11.2 percent in August to $256,900, the biggest one-month gain on record.
The median sales price was up 17 percent compared with August 2011. The $256,900 median price in August was the highest sales price since new homes sold for $262,600 in March 2007, a period when prices were coming down from the peaks reached during the housing boom.
By region of the country, sales rose by the most in the Northeast, climbing 20 percent. Sales were up 1.8 percent in the Midwest and 0.9 percent in the West. But sales in the South, which accounts for nearly half of new-home sales, dropped 4.9 percent.
Robert Kavcic, an economist at BMO Capital Markets, said the August report was ''more evidence that a recovery in U.S. housing is taking root.''
Mr. Kavcic said that the drop in sales in the South could have been influenced by disruptions from Hurricane Isaac in August.
The housing market has been making a modest but steady recovery, helped by the Federal Reserve's efforts to stimulate the economy through lower interest rates. The Fed this month announced a third round of bond buying in an effort to strengthen the economy and improve employment.
Sales of previously occupied homes jumped in August to the highest level since May 2010. On Tuesday, the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller home price index showed home prices increased 1.2 percent in July compared with July 2011.

HEADLINE: Japan's Automakers Scale Back Production in China as Sales Drop

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Japanese automakers, including Toyota and Nissan, are cutting back production in China after anti-Japan protests that closed dealerships and darkened the sales outlook in the Chinese car market, one of the world's largest.
Production slowdowns are a normal feature of the auto industry in mature markets like the United States and Japan, where inventories are kept from ballooning, keeping pressure off automakers that would push them into offering discounts, at a cost in profitability. 
But steps by the Japanese automakers to cut output in China are an anomaly in a market that has driven the industry's global growth over the past decade and where most automakers had been adding capacity until China's economic slowdown in recent months. The slowdown caused production to outpace sales, resulting in larger-than-normal inventories for many car dealers.
''For the time being I think you're going to see Japanese automakers' sales in China down by 20 to 30 percent,'' said Koji Endo, auto analyst at Advanced Research Japan, a firm dealing in investment information. ''The last time we had protests like this, in 2010, the effects only lasted about a month, but I think this time is going to be different. This is going to have a serious impact.''
Nissan, one of the top Japanese automakers in China, said that it would halt production at a joint venture in China starting Thursday, three days earlier than planned, and would extend the halt through the national holiday period next week.
Toyota plants in Tianjin and Guangzhou will also suspend production, from Wednesday through the holiday, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman, Shino Yamada, said. That closing will be a few days earlier than planned.
Production at factories in China may be curtailed further, depending on market conditions, she said.
A senior Toyota executive in Beijing said that as a result, the company probably would not be able to meet its goal of selling one million cars in China this year.
Toyota and its local Chinese partners sold about 900,000 cars in the country last year.
''It's very difficult to sell cars right now, but that's true with every Japanese brand. Not just us,'' said the executive, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media.
In addition to Toyota and Nissan, Mazda has decided to halt production in China on Friday and Saturday, giving workers two extra days off in an extension of the production shutdown for the national holiday. Suzuki Motor said that it also had stopped one of two shifts that it runs in China.
Anti-Japan sentiment in China intensified earlier this month after Japan said that it would buy a group of disputed islands in the East China Sea, called Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan, from a private owner.
Tension between the Asian neighbors have smoldered since the end of World War II.
In protests across China, angry demonstrators vandalized the properties of Japanese companies, including a Toyota outlet in the eastern city of Qingdao that was burned.
The latest production adjustments follow cutbacks that Japanese automakers had been making before the protests to cope with slower-than-anticipated sales in China this year.
In the second quarter, the Chinese economy grew at the slowest pace in more than three years.
In the Chinese auto sector, Japanese automakers had a share of about 19 percent of the passenger car market in August before the protests. That was down from 20 percent in July, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.
An analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Bin Wang, said that Japanese auto dealers in Guangdong province had seen sales fall about 60 percent since the protests, adding that the slowdown had bolstered sales for German, American and Korean brands.
Mr. Endo of Advanced Research Japan said that he expected Japanese automakers to continue to adjust production if sales remained weak and would take measures like cutting shifts or slowing production speed to keep inventory from building.
As a result, he said, parts suppliers in both China and Japan would have to cut output as well.

HEADLINE: Markets Tumble on Unrest in Greece and Spain

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE and DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
LONDON -- Clear signs of the political and social cost of the euro zone crisis sent financial markets tumbling Wednesday as Greece faced a crippling 24-hour strike and Spain cleaned up after violent protests near the country's Parliament.
Spanish bond yields approached 6 percent for the first time in months, while European shares and the euro fell sharply, as developments in Greece and Spain sent a new wave of anxiety through the ranks of international investors. 
The Euro Stoxx 50, a measure of euro zone blue chips, closed 2.7 percent lower on Wednesday. National benchmarks were also down, led by the Ibex in Spain, which fell 3.9 percent, and the MIB in Milan, down 3.3 percent.
The euro was at $1.2863, down from $1.2950 late Tuesday in New York.
Spanish bond yields had fallen back from levels thought unsustainable after the European Central Bank announced a plan Sept. 6 to buy the sovereign bonds of debt-strapped euro countries, like Spain and Italy, in amounts sufficient to bring the cost of servicing their debt down to a manageable level.
The renewed spike in borrowing costs indicates that the E.C.B.'s pledge is losing its power to calm markets, at least in the case of Spain. Higher borrowing costs also put pressure on the Spanish government, which is hoping to avoid a full-scale bailout.
The gap between the rates Spain and Italy must pay is growing, with Spain's borrowing costs rising amid new challenges from disgruntled regional authorities and continuing uncertainty over the central government's intentions concerning a possible bailout.
Spain's benchmark 10-year government bond yield rose 30.1 basis points to 5.988 percent late Wednesday, while Italian 10-year bonds rose 10.4 basis points to 5.181 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percent.
Italy's short-term borrowing costs fell Wednesday at an auction of debt. The Italian Treasury sold &#x20ac;9 billion, or $11.6 billion, of six-month debt priced to yield 1.503 percent. That was down from the 1.585 percent it paid to sell debt at the last such auction, and was the lowest the Treasury has paid for debt of that maturity since March.
Leaders in Greece and Spain are confronting difficult decisions on spending cuts intended to satisfy either international lenders or the bond markets, and events in the two countries highlighted the growing European backlash against the politics of austerity.
In Greece, where political leaders are seeking to negotiate a new round of cuts to placate the troika of international creditors -- the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund -- protesters clashed with the riot police in the first big anti-austerity strike since a new coalition government took power in June.
The troika's mission to Greece is to release a report next month on whether the government is Athens is on track to meet the commitments it made in exchange for a bailout. At stake is whether the country receives further installments of aid.
In Spain, several thousand people converged on the Parliament on Tuesday, where confrontations followed with more than 1,000 police officers. Wielding batons, the officers charged protesters, and some demonstrators broke down barricades and threw rocks and bottles.
The results of an independent assessment on the crisis in the country's financial system are due to be released this week, along with next year's budget and plans for new structural overhauls.
The Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, has said he is considering whether to seek a new rescue package for his troubled country to lower borrowing costs, but only if they stay too high for too long. He has already secured a promise of up to &#x20ac;100 billion from Spain's euro zone partners to salvage the nation's sickly banks.
Philippe Gijsels, head of research at BNP Paribas Fortis Global Markets in Brussels, said the turmoil in Greece and Spain had added to bearish market sentiment that carried over from comments Tuesday by Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Mr. Plosser said the Fed's latest effort to bolster the economy by buying bonds would probably be ineffective and said the central bank could risk its credibility.
''We have budget discussions in Spain, the troika decision in Greece and demonstrations in both places,'' Mr. Gijsels said. ''That's not helping things.''
''I would compare the current situation to August 2010, though,'' he added, when the world economy was slowing and there were worries about recession and deflation. ''This time all the major central banks are pumping money into the system, but back then it was only the Fed.''
That liquidity, Mr. Gijsels said, has to go somewhere, and if the real economy is moribund, it is likely go into the financial markets, bidding up prices for financial assets.
As a result, he said, he did not expect the current wave of selling to be sustained.
David Jolly reported from Paris.

HEADLINE: Huffington Post Continues Expansion With Site in Italy

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

 BODY:
PARIS -- Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime minister of Italy who left office last year in the depths of the economic crisis, resurfaced this week in a new place: the Italian-language Web site of The Huffington Post.
An interview with Mr. Berlusconi, in which he insisted that speculation about his private life was ''disinformation and defamation,'' gave The Huffington Post a typically juicy scoop as it accelerated its international expansion. The Italian site, L'Huffington Post, which made its debut Tuesday, is the fifth version of the Internet news outlet outside the United States, following its rollout in Canada, Britain, France and Spain. 
Arianna Huffington, the site's founder, said she did not plan to stop there. Germany is next, with an introduction planned for January, and discussions are under way with potential business partners in Japan, South Korea, India and Brazil, executives said.
''There are obviously huge advantages editorially to being in all these countries, when the world is so closely linked by all these economic problems,'' Ms. Huffington said by telephone from Milan.
In addition to the interview with Mr. Berlusconi, L'Huffington Post featured contributions from a range of bloggers on its opening day, including Giulio Tremonti, a former Italian finance minister, and Oscar Farinetti, founder of the food and wine emporium Eataly, which has branches in Italy, Japan and New York.
To try to demonstrate its political impartiality -- an unusual feature in Italy, where newspapers tend to have a left- or right-wing bias -- the site featured voices from both sides of the spectrum. While Mr. Berlusconi and other figures from his government were featured, so was Maurizio Landini, a labor leader.
Some critics said, however, that they would have preferred to see fresher journalistic faces rather than the people in charge when Italy got into its financial mess.
''It's an interesting project, but it might be better if they invested more in young journalists rather than old politicians,'' said Francesco Siliato, a professor of communications at Milan Polytechnic University. ''The power of The Huffington Post in the United States was young people, not politicians.''
The Italian site features the now familiar Huffington Post mix: bold news headlines, interviews with public figures and a mix of political, economic and lifestyle news, as well as links to articles in other publications and copious comments from readers.
It is a joint venture with the Espresso Group, which publishes the newspaper La Repubblica and the magazine L'Espresso, among other titles. The Espresso Group handles advertising sales and other business functions, while The Huffington Post, which is owned by AOL, is in charge of the editorial content.
L'Huffington Post employs the bare-bones staff model that The Huffington Post has used in other markets, with only about a dozen paid, full-time editorial employees. L'Huffington Post has some paid freelance contributors, but also relies on bloggers who provide unpaid material in return for the exposure.
The Italian edition is being overseen by Lucia Annunziata, a former foreign correspondent for La Repubblica and Corriere della Sera, and the current host of a news program on RAI, the Italian public television company.
Ms. Huffington said she was happy with the growth of the international editions, though she declined to say how much revenue they were generating. The British site, which was begun in 2011, attracts 4.6 million unique visitors a month, while the French site, which was started this year, draws 2.2 million, according to comScore, an Internet data provider.
The United States site is still far bigger, drawing nearly 44 million unique visitors each month, according to comScore. But Jimmy Maymann, head of international operations for the AOL Huffington Post Media Group, said the company's goal was for the international sites to equal the United States edition in readership within three years -- by which time, he said, there might be as many as 10 international editions.
Ms. Huffington said she had already selected a business partner in Germany, though she declined to identify it.
It might not seem like an opportune time to introduce the site in Italy, which is still mired in an economic crisis. Ad spending in Italy is in a deep slump, with analysts predicting double-digit declines this year. Online advertising is expected to do better, however, with gains of about 10 percent.
Online advertising remains underdeveloped in Italy compared with some other European countries. Italian online ad spending, which last year totaled 1.2 billion euros, or about $1.5 billion, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau, was less than a quarter of the level in Britain, a similar-size country.
Analysts said that generating a following could pose a challenge as well. In news coverage, the site was widely referred to as a blog rather than The Huffington Post's preferred description of itself as an ''Internet newspaper.'' While bloggers like the comedian and politician Beppe Grillo have fared well on the Internet, online newspapers have experienced less success in Italy.
Still, L'Huffington Post lined up four prominent introductory advertisers: the leather goods company Tod's, the carmaker Citroën, the energy company Eni and the telecommunications provider Wind. Each of the partners has invested 1 million euros, or about $1.3 million.
The Italian site alone expects to generate 5 million euros, about $6.4 million, in annual advertising revenue by the third year, said Massimo Ghedini, chief executive of the Espresso Group's advertising sales arm, A.Manzoni.
''Italian advertisers are always looking for two things: results, in terms of a return on their investment, and positioning,'' Mr. Ghedini said. ''The Huffington Post gives them both. It brings readers into the conversation, and the Italian edition will spread knowledge of Italian style around the world.''

HEADLINE: As Refugees Flood Turkey, Asylum System Nears Breakdown

BYLINE: By SUSANNE GÜSTEN

 BODY:
ISTANBUL -- A month after arriving in Istanbul after a six-week journey across Africa and the Middle East, Moussa and Diaby are still trying to figure out what to do next.
The two young men from the Ivory Coast have had one lucky break: A man from Senegal is letting them sleep nights on the floor of a basement he shares with 10 other Africans in the Kumkapi district under the crumbling Byzantine-era city wall, where migrants from all corners of the world wash up at the edge of Europe.
But with the basement locked in the daytime, their waking hours are spent wandering the back streets of Kumkapi in a daze of bewilderment and hunger.
''We don't know anyone and we don't speak any Turkish,'' Moussa, 28, a car mechanic from Abidjan, said last week. ''We can't just walk up to a stranger and ask for help.'' 
Although they are refugees from the latest spate of political violence in the Ivory Coast, it has not occurred to the men to apply for asylum here.
''We wouldn't know where or how, or whom to ask,'' said Diaby, 25, who worked as a vendor in Abidjan and, like his friend, declined to give his last name for fear of being deported.
Nor would applying for asylum be of much use, as earlier arrivals from Africa well know.
''The screening takes years, and then you still have to wait for a third country to take you,'' said Fofana, 36, a former law student from Abidjan on the run from political violence at home. Fofana has been in Istanbul for a year, choosing to keep his head down in Kumkapi on an expired tourist visa and to take odd jobs as a day laborer, rather than register as a refugee and be sent to a remote Turkish province to wait while the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees screens his application and tries to resettle him overseas. ''It's a hard life, but it's better than going back and being killed,'' he said.
Asylum is not on offer for Africans and other non-Europeans in Turkey, which retains a ''geographical limitation'' to the Geneva Refugee Convention, effectively limiting asylum to refugees from Europe.
But Ivorians are only the most recent arrivals in Kumkapi. They join thousands of Iraqis, Iranians and Afghans, as well as Somalis and Congolese, who have run as far as they can and now find themselves unable to proceed further and stuck in a country that precludes asylum for refugees fleeing events occurring outside of Europe.
For many years, the U.N. agency has picked up the slack in Turkey, screening asylum applications and resettling refugees in countries like the United States, Canada and Australia. But with the number of refugees swelling drastically and resettlement quotas shrinking, the system is headed for a breakdown.
Nearly 29,000 incoming refugees registered with the United Nations in Turkey by Aug. 31 this year, according to figures provided by the agency. That figure does not include an estimated 125,000 Syrian refugees sheltering in camps and private accommodation in the southern border area. It also excludes thousands of unregistered refugees, like those in Kumkapi.
Even so, only France, Germany, Italy, Belgium and Sweden, among E.U. countries, received more asylum applications in all of last year, according to Eurostat figures.
The figure in Turkey is sharply higher than an average of 10,000 to 15,000 annually in recent years, according to Multeci-Der, a private group supporting refugee rights. ''It is a record number for Turkey,'' the association's chairman, Taner Kilic, said last week.
At the same time, resettlement quotas are down from about 6,500 places last year to fewer than 6,000 this year, according to the U.N. agency, with the United States accepting about 4,000 refugees in 2012 and Canada offering 900 places. Australia is taking 630 refugees, with Norway and Finland offering 150 places each and Germany taking 100 refugees.
''A refugee entering Turkey today will wait for a year and a half just to register with the U.N.H.C.R. and another year for his first interview with them,'' Mr. Kilic said. ''That's a two-and-a-half-year wait, just for your first chance to plead your case.'' With follow-up interviews and appeals, the average wait for a decision is four to five years, he added, with some refugees waiting seven to eight years before they even become eligible for resettlement.
Third countries then choose among the eligible refugees according to criteria like education, language skills and nation of origin. ''Afghans, for example, currently have virtually zero chance of being resettled,'' Mr. Kilic said, citing cases of recognized refugees who have been waiting 10 years in what are often miserable conditions.
It is the uncertainty of that wait more than anything else that leads refugees to resort to the desperate action of boarding a smugglers' boat like one that sank off Turkey's western coast last month, drowning more than 60 refugees on their way to Europe, Mr. Kilic said.
While Turkey does grant temporary protection to registered refugees while their applications are being considered by the U.N. agency, it requires them to sit out the wait in one of 53 provincial towns to which they are assigned by the Interior Ministry. ''But no one tells them how to get there or what to do when they arrive, no one asks where they will sleep, what they will eat and how they will survive,'' Mr. Kilic said.
Asylum seekers are neither entitled to material assistance nor granted work permits, leaving them at the mercies of provincial authorities and driven to work illegally. They are frequently subject to detention and deportation by the Turkish authorities without recourse to legal appeal.
It is criticism of such conditions that led lawmakers to draft Turkey's first asylum law, submitted to Parliament just before the summer recess and due to be voted on soon after it reconvenes next week. The draft law has been greeted with praise by activists and academics, who were consulted in its preparation by the Interior Ministry to an extent that is highly unusual in Turkey.
''They invited us to the ministry and sat down with us, and we went over the law for two days, article by article, and then they did the same with the academics,'' Mr. Kilic said. Officials drafting the law also traveled to Strasbourg and Brussels to consult the European Court of Human Rights and the European Commission. The result is an asylum law that not only meets E.U. standards, but exceeds them, experts agree.
''The law has been deeply influenced by the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights,'' specifically addressing the issues raised by the court, Kemal Kirisci, a professor of political science at the Bosporus University and one of the country's leading experts on asylum issues, said in an interview last week. The draft law, which was supported in committee by all parties represented in Parliament, ''puts the accent on human rights rather than on security,'' he said.
There is just one problem, activists like Mr. Kilic say: The new asylum law will not extend asylum to refugees from outside Europe, because it does not lift the geographical limitation.
''Over all it is a good law, but in my view as long as the geographical limitation is maintained, it remains problematic,'' Mr. Kilic said. ''We will continue to depend on the U.N. to resettle refugees in third countries, and if those countries will not take them -- perhaps pointing out that our economy is now stronger than theirs and that the refugees have fled to our country, not theirs -- then we have a deadlocked system.''
But Mr. Kirisci is among those who argued for keeping the geographical limitation in place. ''If Turkey were to lift the geographical limitation without being a member of the European Union, I think it would fall into a situation worse than that Greece, an E.U. member, has found itself in over the last couple of years,'' he said, pointing to the overwhelming numbers of refugees there and the international criticism of Greece's handling of the situation.
Turkey would have to lift the geographical limitation to accede to the European Union, Mr. Kirisci conceded. But for now, Turkey is within its rights under international law in maintaining the restriction, he said.
''Why should Turkey give away such a right without European Union membership itself?'' Mr. Kirisci said. ''I see this as a hard bargaining chip with the European Union.''

HEADLINE: As Power Flows to Regional Bosses, Questions Rise on India's Economy

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- It seems like eons ago, but Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his coalition government once inspired very high expectations. They were going to stoke India's economy, improve education, help the poor, build modern transportation and energy systems and, perhaps most improbably, prove that India, the most populous and messiest of democracies, could be successfully governed.
That was in 2009, when the governing coalition, led by the Indian National Congress Party, won an unexpectedly broad re-election victory. India's economy was motoring out of the global recession, and the country seemed to be moving from an era of fragmented politics to a new stage in which power resided with a stronger central government in New Delhi. To those who saw India as a rising global power, this was good news.
If only. 
Today, India's political calculus is again in flux. The economy is in a tailspin, Mr. Singh and his government are desperately trying to regain credibility, and power is now radiating to regional political chieftains, who are teasingly considering a new national political alignment, a so-called third front to compete with the two national powers, the Congress Party and the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party.
Regional bosses, once in decline, are becoming kingmakers again: the squat, sleepy-eyed Mulayam Singh Yadav, who oversees the powerful Samajwadi Party, is even publicly musing about himself as a future prime minister.
''The incentive for every single party from the opposition to the allies is to send a signal that the Congress can't govern,'' said Pratap Bhanu Mehta, president of the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi. ''That's the election plank.''
Had Mr. Singh's government met initial expectations, or even come close, the political landscape would undoubtedly be different. ''They just blew it,'' Mr. Mehta said. The rise of Mr. Yadav and several other regional bosses has many implications for Indian politics, but the trend also raises a broader question about the changing arc of the Indian economic story: If the old assumption was that India needed a strong central government to compete globally, and to avoid a competitive disadvantage with China, what will happen now that the opposite seems to be happening?
History does not provide much reassurance. In past decades, third-front governments have twice taken power and have twice collapsed because of internal bickering, a prospect of instability certain to be unappealing to those in New Delhi and Washington who are eager for India to become a stable and influential player in Asia. Most analysts are skeptical that a true third front will take power in the near future, but they agree that the clout of regional leaders is growing.
''Indian politics will have to live with bargains and negotiations with regional parties,'' Ashutosh Varshney, a political expert, said in an e-mail interview. ''A third front may or may not emerge, but both national parties will have to negotiate and bargain. That also means that India will find it harder to make firm assertions of power on the international stage, à la China. Its power will grow, but more gradually.''
Last week, Mr. Singh's coalition government nearly collapsed after he pushed through unpopular economic measures, including an increase in diesel fuel prices and a policy shift enabling global giants like Walmart to open retail stores here. Mamata Banerjee, the populist chief minister of the state of West Bengal, declared the moves ''anti-poor'' and withdrew her regional party from the governing coalition, potentially bringing down Mr. Singh's government. Until, that is, Mr. Yadav and another nonaligned regional leader, Mayawati, who uses only one name, stepped in to rescue the government, at least for now, by pledging ''outside'' support.
The machinations were hardly altruistic. For months, Mr. Yadav and other regional leaders have speculated -- at times gleefully -- about the possibility that the governing coalition might collapse, forcing early elections for Parliament, before the scheduled date in 2014. By allowing the government to survive, analysts say, the regional bosses made a cold calculation: keeping afloat a wounded central government was more advantageous, for now, than trying to pick up extra seats by forcing early elections.
The strategy is to pummel Mr. Singh's government like a piñata, if not yet knocking it completely to the ground, in hopes of inflicting even greater long-term damage to the Congress Party. Mr. Yadav, for example, is lending parliamentary support to the government, even as he plans to rally against Walmart and some economic measures.
India's economy has suffered in the lingering global downturn, but most analysts say India's current problems are disproportionately self-inflicted. The two-headed leadership structure of Mr. Singh and Sonia Gandhi, the Congress Party president, which worked earlier, is now seen as increasingly ineffective.
For his part, Mr. Singh is trying to reverse course and reposition the Congress Party as an agent of reform. He is expected to reshuffle his cabinet this week and announce more economic measures, like speeding up public spending on new airports and subway systems.
Mr. Singh, who turned 80 on Wednesday, now seems more determined to act decisively, perhaps with his legacy in mind. He gave a nationally televised address on Friday in which he sought to explain why the fuel price increase and other measures were necessary to stabilize the country's economy. Maligned for months, Mr. Singh has since won praise in India's news media, though many commentators have warned him not to fall back into what often seemed like an aloof governing style.
''The essence of progressive politics is communication, a skill this government must learn fast,'' The Indian Express, a leading English-language newspaper, said in an editorial.
In the meantime, India's regional leaders will continue to press for advantage. Ms. Banerjee is planning a huge demonstration in New Delhi on Monday against the government's new economic measures. Even as Ms. Banerjee is often criticized for being intemperate and unpredictable, her influence is undeniable: this week the American ambassador, Nancy Powell, met with her privately, just as Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton made a point of visiting her during a trip to India in May.
Other regional leaders are also increasingly powerful national figures. Nitish Kumar, the chief minister of the state of Bihar, has hinted that his regional party could join any coalition that granted his state special status. Naveen Patnaik, the chief minister of Orissa, has expressed support for a third-front coalition. Jayalalithaa, the chief minister of Tamil Nadu, has also spoken suggestively about a new political alliance.
Most of them have won political support by delivering economic growth and, to varying degrees, improved government. This is one reason that even as India's politics is again fragmenting, some analysts believe that the country's economic modernization can continue. In recent years, as policy logjams paralyzed the central government, many international and domestic business leaders shifted their focus to negotiating with individual state leaders.
Most analysts predict that both the Congress Party and the Bharatiya Janata Party will lose seats in the next election, but that one of the dominant parties will ally with some combination of the regional bosses to form a government, possibly even agreeing to elevate one of them to serve as prime minister.
No doubt several of them are interested in the job.

HEADLINE: Former Prime Minister in Japan Elected to Lead Opposition Party

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI; Makiko Inoue and Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Shinzo Abe, a nationalist former prime minister, was elected to lead Japan's main opposition party on Wednesday, giving him a chance of regaining the nation's top job -- a prospect that could worsen the country's tense relations with China and its other Asian neighbors.
Mr. Abe's Liberal Democratic Party is poised to make gains in nationwide elections expected soon, in part because of the unpopularity of Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda. Poll ratings for Mr. Noda and his Democratic Party have been pulled down by the party's handling of last year's disasters and gridlock in Parliament that has crippled policy making. 
''We are going to win back Japan and build a strong country, a prosperous country,'' Mr. Abe said after defeating four other candidates in the party ballot.
It is a striking return to the spotlight for Mr. Abe -- who called for a stronger and unapologetic Japan when he took office in 2006, but stepped down just a year later, citing a health problem -- after his party suffered a defeat in an interim election. At the time, Mr. Abe's nationalist agenda seemed off the mark for a public that was more interested in jobs and economic recovery.
During his brief term, he angered China and South Korea with moves to change Japan's pacifist Constitution, denials that Asian women were forced into sexual slavery for the Japanese military during World War II, and efforts to alter school textbooks to present what critics called a whitewashed version of Japan's wartime history. But in some ways, he kept tensions with China from boiling over, picking Beijing for his first official trip overseas and refraining from visiting a contentious Tokyo war shrine.
But with emotions running high between Japan and China in recent weeks over a set of disputed islands, a return to office by Mr. Abe could help fuel more tension. Mr. Abe has veered further to the right since his time as prime minister, suggesting recently that he intends to visit the Yasukuni war shrine if he becomes prime minister again and may even seek to nullify some of Japan's war apologies.
Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Mr. Abe promised to take a strong stand in the dispute with Beijing over the islands, even as he referred to Japan's strong economic ties with China. He said he would also seek to strengthen Japan's defense cooperation with the United States by taking a more active military role.
Political analysts had all but written off Mr. Abe after his abrupt resignation, which drew much ridicule and greatly weakened the long-ruling Liberal Democrats. His party eventually lost to the Democrats in 2009, ending a half-century of almost uninterrupted rule.
But now the Democratic Party has lost much of its support, having fallen short on many of its promises to wrest power away from the country's bureaucrats. The public is disillusioned with reconstruction efforts after the tsunami and nuclear crisis last year, and the moribund economy remains a drag. Mr. Noda is under mounting pressure to call elections soon, though he need not hold them until next summer. Analysts agree that the Democrats would probably lose their majority in Parliament's lower house in an early vote, but the Liberal Democrats are seen as unlikely to win a majority either, inviting further political gridlock.
Mr. Abe had not been the front-runner in the party balloting on Wednesday; he ran second in the initial round to Shigeru Ishiba, a conservative but less ideological former defense minister. But party elders did not back Mr. Ishiba in the runoff, analysts said, because of an independent streak that led Mr. Ishiba to leave the party for a time in the 1990s. Mr. Abe ultimately won the party vote, 108-89.
Now, the Liberal Democrats and Democrats appear set to limp into an election to decide which party is the least unpopular.
''I don't think the Liberal Democrats can hope for much more support under Mr. Abe, who comes with a sense of tired déjà vu,'' said Atsuo Ito, an independent political analyst who has worked in the secretariats of both parties. ''But there will be no change to the public's deep-rooted disillusionment with the Democrats,'' he said.
If the two largest parties perform as tepidly as recent polls suggest, the future political landscape may depend on whether they can work together, given that their platforms are similar on most issues.
''It would be good if the parties can somehow cooperate across party lines,'' Harumi Arima, a well-known political commentator and newscaster. ''But if they can't, I'm afraid we're heading into more confusion.''

HEADLINE: Does a City Need More Highways?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- More and more Americans, educated 20-somethings and empty nesters among them, want to live downtown. Plenty of downtowns are coming back; many are thriving. Even so, we remain a nation in thrall to suburbs, highways, cars. On a recent visit here I was struck by this paradox.
A half-century or so ago Louisville, like so many American cities, bet the farm on cars and suburbia. It sacrificed a swath of its downtown to three interstate highways. There was the usual reasoning: highways would bring business, without which downtown, already struggling, would shrivel and expire.
Blocks of historic commercial warehouses and banks were leveled as a consequence; the center of the city was severed from Louisville's spectacular waterfront; mass transit was largely abandoned and many corners of town transformed into parking lots. Around the same time the construction of a plaza and a hotel, along with a Mies van der Rohe building that commanded a singular view of the falls on the Ohio River, aspired partly to reconnect the city to the water. But the completion of the big John F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge leading into downtown capped off the massive entanglement of highways that produced what locals came to call Spaghetti Junction. 
And the traffic?
It got worse.
Since then cities everywhere have been tearing down postwar highways that ripped through downtowns. They've replaced them with parks and streets and neighborhoods. It has happened from Seoul and San Francisco to Milwaukee and Madrid. In San Francisco removal of the Central Freeway has turned a destitute neighborhood into one of the most fashionable quarters of the city. Cincinnati (which is linked to Louisville by one of the interstates rumbling through downtown) and Pittsburgh have made headlines, too, successfully recovering historic riverfronts.
So what is Louisville doing now?
Pursuing a plan that would, in part, enlarge the downtown highways and construct a second bridge next to the Kennedy. It would even eat up some of a park designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, of Prospect Park and Central Park fame. Louisville is a car city with auto plants and a big investment in the auto industry. But still, I was stunned to hear this. The proposal, so clearly out of step, has been met with grass-roots opposition and is now in the courts, tied up over issues about financing, tolls and the environment.
Does it make any sense? Ted Smith, director of the Louisville department of economic growth and innovation, told me that growing numbers of people in their 20s have been moving to the area. Downtown and its surrounding neighborhoods are increasingly eclectic. Young people are coming for some of the urban amenities of Boston, Chicago or Portland without the expense. At the same time, Louisville is banking a chunk of its economic future on care for the aging, trying to attract empty nesters and affluent retirees looking for the same things.
''Urbanism is the preferred lifestyle now,'' Mr. Smith said, a remark that dovetailed with what Greg Fischer, the mayor of Louisville, boasted when we spoke about the expanding arts menu and local food scenes. We met the other day during a break at the Idea Festival, an annual conclave of public talks whose success illustrated what the mayor was saying about the city's contemporary charms.
Along these lines, the large new Louisville Waterfront Park designed by Hargreaves Associates of San Francisco, built partly under the interstates, has become a recent source of civic pride. Getting there requires crossing several busy roadways, and the park is practically inaccessible without a car. But it's popular. A former railroad bridge over the Ohio River will soon be opened to pedestrians and bikers. The Louisville firm De Leon & Primmer, which has generated buzz in architectural circles for a new office-residence combo downtown, among other projects, is designing a spiral ramp to link the park and the bridge.
Various architects have also repurposed some historic downtown sites, including a stretch of West Main Street where Deborah Berke, the New York architect, has combined several buildings to design a hotel, restaurant and contemporary art museum complex called 21C.
Some blocks away, along East Market Street, on the far side of one of those interstates bisecting downtown, a renovated 19th-century former dry goods store, the Green Building, opened to much fanfare in 2008 and inspired a cluster of art galleries and upscale restaurants in an area long known for its homeless shelters and projects for the poor. The neighborhood now advertises itself as NuLu.
I was struck by the quality of some postwar buildings: a modern addition to the city's Beaux-Arts main public library is a 1960s gem of Brutalist design by Louis & Henry, a Louisville firm. And several parking garages by Jasper D. Ward, another local and underappreciated architect, reimagine the most banal of building types as concrete sculptures, unusually alert to their urban context.
So Louisville has good bones, good architects and some good ideas. But for three decades the city has wrestled with the interstate and bridge problem. Delays and traffic accidents have mounted. The current idea would join up the ring road to the east with a bridge linking Kentucky and Indiana. The State of Indiana has been willing to take up much of the cost. This sounds like a good idea, encouraging traffic to shift from downtown.
But this ring road plan is tethered to the scheme to expand the downtown interstates and build another new bridge, next to the Kennedy. That idea is backed by politicians aligned with business leaders, who argue that many drivers here won't want to use the ring road and that without the second new bridge to downtown, the joined-up ring road would encourage jobs to leave for Indiana.
It's true: ring roads have historically encouraged American sprawl and diverted jobs from struggling downtowns, but demographic patterns and traffic engineering are evolving. Adding more lanes doesn't turn out to reduce traffic. It increases traffic. The phenomenon is called ''induced demand.'' The reverse is also true: fewer roads ultimately tend to produce less traffic.
As for the notion that expanding the interstate tangle and adding the sister bridge next to the Kennedy might bring more people and jobs into the city, I can only say that 40 years after the interstates supposedly started pumping life into Louisville's downtown, the streets here looked pretty empty, especially at night.
Maybe that's an outsider's misperception. But removing the highways, or downscaling them, might turn downtown and its adjacent neighborhoods, including the riverfront, into more attractive places. And where highways have come down in other cities, property values have gone up. What brings life to a city are attractions, services, homes and walkable streets.
At the very least, Louisville needs to devote far more resources to public transit. It's great that the riverfront park opened and that groups of citizens are nurturing neighborhoods. But why repeat costly mistakes? We see traffic problems today and ask how to ease them. But it's better to start by thinking about what kind of streets and neighborhoods a city wants, what kind of waterfront it should have and how mass transit could change things.
First things first.

HEADLINE: Shares Fall on Worries Over European Debt Crisis

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks fell on Wednesday as protests in Spain and Greece over euro zone austerity measures raised fresh concerns about Europe's ability to control its debt crisis.
Investors sold sectors susceptible to risk, like energy and technology, while they poured money into more defensive areas like utilities and consumer staples. The Standard & Poor's technology sector declined 0.8 percent and the energy sector fell 0.9 percent, while the utility sector rose 0.2 percent. 
Violent protests in Madrid over expected austerity measures and increasing talk of secession in the wealthy Catalonia region raised pressure on the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, as he moved closer to asking euro zone policy makers for rescue money.
Greece had its biggest austerity protest in more than a year as international lenders admitted to difficulty in determining how to solve its debt crisis.
''When it gets down to it, there is real disagreement between the people in the streets and the policy makers'' in Europe, said Timothy M. Ghriskey, chief investment officer of the Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, N.Y.
''I think it's certainly causing some concerns'' for investors, he said, adding, ''The market's probably looking for an excuse to have a correction.''
Concern that the European debt crisis will curtail global economic growth also weighed on oil and metals prices.
The 19-commodity Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index closed down 1 percent.
The front-month contract for crude oil in the United States fell 1.5 percent to $89.98 a barrel, its lowest close, and the first below $90 since Aug. 2. The price dropped despite a report from the Energy Information Administration of a 2.45 million barrel decline in crude inventories last week.
A Commerzbank oil analyst in Frankfurt, Carsten Fritsch, said investors were losing faith in the ability of the European Central Bank to hold the euro zone together. ''No solution is in sight for the euro zone crisis,'' he said. ''It is impossible to make financial reforms in the face of such strong opposition from the people.''
The S.& P. 500-stock index is up 5.2 percent for the third quarter and 1.9 percent for September, historically a weak month for equities. Gains were largely tied to actions by the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank to prop up their economies.
For the day, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 44.04 points, or 0.33 percent, at 13,413.51. The S.& P. 500-stock index was down 8.27 points, or 0.57 percent, at 1,433.32. The Nasdaq composite index was down 24.03 points, or 0.77 percent, at 3,093.70.
Also weighing on technology shares Wednesday, Jabil Circuit tumbled 9.9 percent to $18.90 after reporting fourth-quarter earnings that missed expectations and forecasting weak first-quarter results.
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 18/32, to 100 5/32, and the yield fell to 1.61 percent from 1.67 percent late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: In Further Opening, U.S. to Ease Ban on Imports From Myanmar

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS and RICK GLADSTONE

 BODY:
The United States announced Wednesday that it would begin to ease a longstanding ban on imports from Myanmar, one of the last major economic sanctions on the country, because of the advances made by its military-led government in moving toward a more democratic system.
The announcement was made by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton during a meeting in New York with U Thein Sein, a former general who is now president of Myanmar. He has been directing the gradual transition away from the two decades of dictatorship and isolation that had driven the country to near economic collapse and dysfunction. 
''We have watched as you and your government have continued the steady process of reform,'' Mrs. Clinton, who has been ensconced in meetings with world leaders gathered for the United Nations General Assembly, told Mr. Thein Sein at the Mark Hotel in Manhattan. ''And we have been pleased to respond to specific steps that recognize the government's efforts and encourage other reforms.''
Mr. Thein Sein, who was making his first visit to the United States to attend the General Assembly, responded: ''The people of Myanmar are very pleased with the easing of economic sanctions by the United States. We are very grateful for the actions of the United States.'' He presented Mrs. Clinton with a large envelope containing a letter to President Obama.
It was Mrs. Clinton's third meeting with Mr. Thein Sein. The first was on her trip to Myanmar last December, and they met again at a meeting of the Association of South East Asian Nations in Cambodia in July.
The United States had already lifted its ban on American investment in Myanmar, and just last week it removed Mr. Thein Sein from a blacklist of individuals who faced sanctions. The pressure for further easing of sanctions also came from Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Myanmar opposition leader and former political prisoner, who said during a visit to Washington last week that she favored moves toward normalization of commercial relations.
Political experts said the easing of the restriction on imports from Myanmar was significant for that country, which is mineral-rich but desperately impoverished. Formerly known as Burma, it was once prosperous and self-sufficient.
''The timing of this announcement is a big win for Thein Sein,'' said Suzanne DiMaggio, the Asia Society's vice president for global policy programs. ''He will return from his first visit to the U.S. as Myanmar's president with a major boost to his reform agenda. It's a 'concrete deliverable' that will go a long way toward muffling critics and hard-liners at home.''
A senior Obama administration official said the lifting of the import ban -- which has been in place for more than a decade -- would require a waiver that the administration would now shape, working in consultation with Congress. That could take some months, and some prohibitions could remain in place on specific areas of concern, including businesses tied to military industries. Even so it will remove the bulk of sanctions, though the provisions will remain on the books.
''What this is intended to do is help a Burmese economy that is more than resource-based in terms of exports,'' the official said, expressing hope that lifting American and European sanctions would create jobs and promote industries beyond natural gas, oil and timber.
A second administration official, asked about Myanmar's military ties to North Korea -- one of the main concerns for American officials -- said that the administration was satisfied with efforts by Myanmar's leaders to reconsider that relationship. ''They understand this is a legacy of a different Burma,'' this official said.
The easing of the import ban was announced against a backdrop of gradually warming American relations with Myanmar, punctuated not only by Mr. Thein Sein's first visit but by a 17-day tour of the United States by Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel laureate who became a worldwide political heroine during nearly two decades of house arrest. She has met with President Obama, received the Congressional Gold Medal and enjoyed rapturous welcomes from expatriate communities.
In a meeting with the editorial board of The New York Times earlier Wednesday, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, 67, said she bore no malice toward the generals who oppressed her, and as a recently elected legislator from her party, the National League for Democracy, said she hoped to qualify as a presidential candidate one day.
''The leader of every political party must aspire to be head of state; otherwise he or she would be letting the party down,'' Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi said.
The daughter of the country's independence hero, Gen. Aung San, who was assassinated when she was just 2 years old, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi rose to become Myanmar's most popular political figure and a beacon of resistance to the military dictators who have run the country for much of her adult life. She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.
The ruling generals first placed her under house arrest in 1989 and kept her there for most of the next 21 years, isolated from her English-born husband and two sons, finally releasing her in 2010. Her children grew up without her, and her husband died of cancer in 1999. Nonetheless, she said, she did not feel a sense of bitterness or need for retribution.
''They didn't treat me badly,'' she said. ''If I had been put in prison and tortured, perhaps I would have feelings of vengeance and hatred.''
House arrest was not unpleasant, she said, adding, ''I was just simply kept in the house.''
Asked why she had not been imprisoned, like many of her colleagues, she said, ''I think because I'm my father's daughter.''

HEADLINE: Nets Helped Clear Path for Builder in Brooklyn

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI and JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
Bruce C. Ratner did not pretend to be much of a basketball fan when he paid $300 million in 2004 for the New Jersey Nets. Before long, the team had the worst record in the National Basketball Association, and he had a reputation as one of the worst owners in professional sports.
But he also had the leverage he needed to pull off a real estate megadeal.
The purchase was the most glaring demonstration of Mr. Ratner's single-minded dedication to a goal: building a 22-acre, $4.9 billion project in the heart of Brooklyn, the largest development project in the borough's history. Though the Atlantic Yards plan also called for residential towers, a significant portion of which will be subsidized, he sold it to the public as a way to finally bring professional sports back to the borough. 
''So, how did we get here?'' Mr. Ratner asked last week, almost giddy, at the ribbon cutting of the nation's most expensive basketball arena, the Barclays Center. ''We first needed to buy a basketball team, and against all odds we did it.''
That acknowledgment highlights a characteristic that emerged again and again over the past nine years: Mr. Ratner, one of the most prominent and polarizing figures in real-estate-mad New York, may portray himself as a reluctant developer, but he will do what is necessary to get a deal done.
''By nature he's a very generous guy,'' said Stuart Pertz, an architect who worked for Mr. Ratner in the 1980s but opposed his arena project. ''Once he's in business, he deals with the business at hand.''
Since the inception of the Atlantic Yards project in 2003, Mr. Ratner, 67, has revised his plans and timelines so often that critics say the whole thing amounts to an enormous bait and switch. He has spent millions lobbying politicians and donating to civic groups to smooth the way. He persisted through lawsuits, protests, financial problems and the chilling doubts of his relatives. His supporters laud his vision, saying it promises local jobs and affordable housing and creates a new center of gravity in Brooklyn. His critics, citing many of the same facts, deride him for overrunning the neighborhood with a Manhattan-size behemoth.
On Friday, Mr. Ratner will find some measure of vindication as the glass-and-rusted-steel home of the rechristened Brooklyn Nets -- situated at the intersection of Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues -- opens with a week of concerts by Jay-Z, whom he recruited to buy a tiny stake in the team.
But the project is far from over. Plans call for 15 residential towers over the next 25 years and, possibly, an office building or hotel. Though groundbreaking on the first of those buildings is scheduled for November, already 18 months behind schedule, neighborhood residents grumble that the area is destined to remain a construction zone in perpetuity.
At the same time, there are signs that Mr. Ratner, who is considered the city's most significant developer outside Manhattan, may be winding down his career. He sold his 30 percent share of Forest City Ratner Company for $46.3 million and substantial stock in 2006. And for the first time in decades, he has no other major developments in the pipeline. His focus, he said, is completing what will most likely be his most prominent, if not most profitable, project.
In a recent interview, Mr. Ratner acknowledged that Atlantic Yards had been ''the most difficult, bruising development project I've done, or could even imagine doing.'' He bristled at the criticism and lamented the damage that critics had inflicted to his reputation, insisting that he had always sought to ''make something wonderful and terrific.''
''We've kept every single promise we've ever made,'' he said. ''We've built the arena. They said we'd never build it. And I'm going to build the affordable housing.''
His neighborhood critics, who say the opening of the arena does not signify the end of their battle against the development, remain as skeptical as ever.
''Mr. Ratner portrays himself as a liberal do-gooder type, but this is as phony as the arena's rust,'' said Candace Carpentor, a spokeswoman for Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn, one of the groups representing residents of the surrounding neighborhoods.
''He garnered political support and taxpayer favors with the promise of huge benefits, including 2,250 affordable-housing units and 10,000 permanent jobs. But the only benefit we have received is a traffic-choking, noise-generating, taxpayer-money-losing white elephant and acres of vacant lots where a thriving, multiethnic community once stood.''
Hair and shirttail running amok, Mr. Ratner has the bookish and unassuming style of an absent-minded professor, a striking contrast to the sharp elbows and blustery personality of developers like Donald J. Trump.
Mr. Ratner, a Vietnam War protester in his youth who has held onto his liberal politics, said he was initially ''embarrassed'' to describe himself as a developer even though it was the family business. His father, Harry (Ratowczer until the name was Americanized), one of eight siblings who came to the United States from Poland, ran a successful supplier of cement and gravel for construction in the Cleveland area. His uncles were builders, one of whom started Forest City Ratner, now a national real estate developer based in Cleveland.
After graduating from Harvard and Columbia Law School, Mr. Ratner went to work for the City of New York in 1978. Mayor Edward I. Koch made him consumer affairs commissioner, a post he used to put his liberal politics into practice, going after short-weighting merchants, fraudulent TV repairs and burglar alarm companies that preyed on the poor. He left government work to become a developer.
In 1985, he heard about a request by the city for proposals to develop a ragged 16-acre patch of Downtown Brooklyn. So low were the prospects in the Brooklyn of that era that Forest City Ratner was one of only two applicants. The project, the MetroTech Center, a $1 billion complex of nine office buildings, gradually became a thriving locus for the back-office operations of major banks and city agencies.
For him, it was the first of many so-called public-private partnerships, where the city and the state provided land, tax breaks and sometimes cash to lure developers into building projects designed to transform once industrial or troubled neighborhoods.
He was also one of the first developers to recognize that the city's four boroughs outside of Manhattan, particularly poorer areas, were vastly underserved by retailing. He built a series of highly successful shopping centers. ''We invented the concept of big box retail in the boroughs,'' Mr. Ratner said.
Among them was Atlantic Center, the busy, fortresslike collection of shopping malls, near the Barclays Center, that he built in the 1990s. ''People thought they'd be a failure,'' he said.
Mr. Ratner also played a role in the transformation of Times Square in the early 1990s, when most developers were unwilling to take a chance on the still seedy area. He agreed in 1995 to renovate three theaters on 42nd Street and build a retail complex. But in what would become a pattern for him, he quickly renegotiated the deal, persuading state officials to allow him to override existing zoning restrictions and also build a 444-room high-rise hotel. (Later, he was a partner in the development of The New York Times building, in Midtown.)
Though developers frequently come under attack in New York, the criticism is rarely as fierce as it has been with Mr. Ratner over the Atlantic Yards project.
Initially, his plan to move the Nets from New Jersey to a Brooklyn railyard and surround it with thousands of apartments garnered effusive support from Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki, who helped clear the way for the use of eminent domain and provided $305 million in grants. Mr. Ratner formed an alliance with housing and community groups, some of which he financed. He was also among the biggest spenders in the state on lobbying politicians.
His willingness to change plans -- abandoning an expensive Frank Gehry design and building a smaller railyard -- solidified his reputation for promising anything to get a deal, only to renegotiate relentlessly for more favorable terms. In separate encounters in meetings over the Atlantic Yards project, Mr. Ratner loudly berated Rafael E. Cestero, then the housing commissioner, and Seth W. Pinsky, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, after not getting his way.
More recently, while criticism continued to mount, Mr. Ratner's projects surfaced at the edge of political scandals.
A lobbyist hired by his company for the Atlantic Yards project, Richard J. Lipsky, pleaded guilty earlier this year to a bribery scheme in which he split hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees with State Senator Carl Kruger in exchange for his political support. Mr. Kruger, a leading advocate of Atlantic Yards in the Legislature, pleaded guilty to related charges and left office. Neither Mr. Ratner nor anyone at his company was charged with wrongdoing, and there was no evidence that he knew of the scheme.
(A few months later, a former Yonkers councilwoman and a political operative were convicted of bribery and extortion in a case involving another Ratner project, the Ridge Hill mall.)
The Atlantic Yards project appeared to be close to collapse in 2009. The legal battle was costing a fortune. The company stock price plummeted during the recession. The Nets were losing money and playing poorly. The estimated cost of the arena was soaring. And without new financing, they would lose the ability to issue tax-free bonds. Mr. Ratner was called to Cleveland by his family members and grilled about the state of the project.
The rescue ship for the project came in the form of a Russian billionaire, Mikhail D. Prokhorov, who bought an 80 percent stake in the Nets and 45 percent of the arena for $223 million. But the damage to Mr. Ratner's reputation was done.
''We all feel a great deal of concern over how Bruce has been treated on this and how we as a company have been vilified,'' said his cousin, Charles A. Ratner, chairman of Forest City Enterprises, a publicly traded company based in Cleveland. Forest City in New York represents one-third of the company's assets
''But at the end of the day, if you believe in what you're doing, you deal with it.''
As the arena opens, preparations are under way to start construction of the project's long delayed residential towers by the end of the year.
Mr. Ratner has been celebratory in his public appearances and news media interviews. In the first three minutes of his ribbon-cutting speech, he used the phrase ''We did it'' 14 times.

HEADLINE: Resort's Snow Won't Be Pure This Year; It'll Be Sewage

BYLINE: By LESLIE MACMILLAN

 BODY:
FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. -- Klee Benally, a member of the Navajo tribe, has gone to the mountains just north of here to pray, and he has gone to get arrested. He has chained himself to excavators; he has faced down bulldozers. For 10 years, the soft-spoken activist has fought a ski resort's expansion plans in the San Francisco Peaks that include clear-cutting 74 acres of forest and piping treated sewage effluent onto a mountain to make snow.
But he appears to be losing the battle. 
In February, a federal appeals court ruled in favor of the ski resort's upgrade plans, ending a legal saga fought by a coalition of environmental groups and 13 American Indian tribes, which consider the mountain sacred and view the wastewater snow as a desecration.
This coming ski season, the resort, Arizona Snowbowl, will become the first ski resort in the world to use 100 percent sewage effluent to make artificial snow.
''It's a disaster, culturally and environmentally,'' said Taylor McKinnon of the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the plaintiffs. He worries about the impact on the delicate alpine tundra and to human health should skiers fall into the treated sewer-water snow and ingest it.
The United States Forest Service, which owns the land where the resort is, says the treated water meets the highest standards -- just below drinking water -- and is already used to irrigate golf courses, soccer fields and parks, according to Corbin Newman, a regional forester.
''Snow-making has become necessary because of climate change,'' he said. It allows for a more consistent ski season, bringing money into neighboring Flagstaff, which contracted to sell Snowbowl the water from its sewage treatment plant.
The dispute runs deeper than water. It has erupted into protests, hunger strikes and multiple arrests and has become a political jostling point for Senator John McCain of Arizona and the Obama administration. At one point Snowbowl's owner, Eric Borowsky, declared that if the resort lost its legal bid to make snow, ''radical groups would achieve their ultimate goal of control of our nation's resources.''
Indeed, the battle has put this picturesque city, about an hour southeast of the Grand Canyon, on the frontier of what many say is the new war for the West's public lands. It does not involve ranchers, miners or loggers, but centers on the burgeoning outdoor recreation industry, which some say is expanding at the expense of the environment.
Half of all alpine ski areas in the United States, including the big names of Vail, Aspen and Lake Tahoe, are on public land, and many of them are faced with the choice of expanding or going out of business. ''A ski resort, to remain competitive, has to hit certain dates. They have to guarantee they'll be open by Thanksgiving, Christmas at the latest,'' said Jim Bedwell, director of the Forest Service's Recreation and Heritage Resources.
''Everyone does well when the ski area does well,'' said J. R. Murray, general manager of Snowbowl.
But Indians, who pray and hold ceremonies on the mountain, feel their concerns are too easily swept aside. ''Our culture can still be reduced to something that is less important than the profit margin on a ski resort,'' Mr. Benally said. ''That's a very, very hard place to be in.''
The wastewater snow, Indians say, will ruin a mountain they consider sacred ground as well as the ecosystem, a concern shared by environmental groups. When it melts, it ''could degrade water quality of the aquifers,'' said Rob Smith, regional staff director at the Sierra Club.
City officials, like Brad Hill, Flagstaff's utilities director, say they have been ''very proactive'' in ensuring that the water is safe. That is why, in addition to the federal study, the city conducted its own water tests.
It hired Catherine R. Propper, a scientist and professor at Northern Arizona University, who found that Flagstaff's water contains endocrine-disrupting chemicals, or EDCs, including hormones, antibiotics, antidepressants, pharmaceuticals and steroids.
''We don't know what effect freezing and thawing is going to have on the chemical compounds,'' she said. ''We don't know what UV is going to do to them. Some of the compounds will bind to the soil; some will get into the aquifers. It is a very complicated system that we know very little about.''
The substances were not considered in the Forest Service's impact assessment because federal guidelines do not require doing so, and their nonstatus is part of why Flagstaff can consider its water safe despite Dr. Propper's findings. Even she is quick to say that ''a mouthful of snow is not going to make the difference.''
The Environmental Protection Agency says it is studying the chemicals, and Flagstaff and Snowbowl both say that if they become regulated, the city ''will scale treatment to come into compliance,'' according to Kevin Burke, city manager.
''It's an Old West mentality: let's go forward and assess the damage later,'' said Mr. Benally, referring to the unregulated mining that went on for decades and left a legacy of environmental degradation. That reality is particularly acute on the sprawling Navajo Indian reservation bordering Flagstaff, where Mr. Benally grew up. Forty percent of the population there does not have indoor plumbing; one out of three does not have access to clean drinking water.
For now, Flagstaff business owners are gearing up for the ski season, hoping the fake snow will ''generate as much as $35 million for the local economy during the winter,'' said Julie Pastrick of the Flagstaff Chamber of Commerce.
Asked whether he thinks the protests will continue, Mr. Murray, the Snowbowl manager, expressed a certain weariness with the controversy, saying, ''I have no idea.''
Mr. Benally is undeterred. ''It's not over,'' he said. ''Until the Obama administration addresses the issue, we will continue to lay bodies in front of Snowbowl's machinery.''

HEADLINE: Mr. Romney Addresses Foreign Aid

 BODY:
Six weeks before the election, Mitt Romney has finally made a substantive contribution to the national security debate, offering ideas about how he would handle foreign aid. For a campaign troubled by fumbles and incoherent proposals, this counts as progress. But, even here, there are details he needs to flesh out. 
In a speech to the Clinton Global Initiative on Tuesday, Mr. Romney acknowledged the value of foreign aid and its purpose: providing humanitarian assistance, improving security and encouraging economic growth. He did not call for slashing aid, as many in the Republican Party have.
But we don't know whether he would really protect the current budget -- $54.9 billion in 2012 -- from further cuts if he is elected. He had earlier endorsed ending foreign aid to countries that ''oppose America's interests,'' a fuzzy term that could affect many recipients. The budget drafted by his running mate, Representative Paul Ryan, would cut foreign affairs spending by 10 percent in 2013 and even more in 2016.
Mr. Romney focused most of his attention on overhauling aid programs. The George W. Bush and Obama administrations and the development community have worked on this for years, so Mr. Romney will find little argument when he says aid has too often been ineffective.
Mr. Romney's call for more public-private partnerships on aid projects makes sense. The Obama administration has made this a priority. The United States Agency for International Development this week announced a joint initiative with several banks and technology companies to promote the use of cellphones to get aid payments to people in poor and rural communities. Another American initiative links donors and private companies in providing clean cook stoves for impoverished women so they don't risk their lives gathering firewood in conflict zones or being asphyxiated by smoke from fires in closed spaces. It's unclear what more Mr. Romney would do.
His talk about the potentially transformative nature of American assistance and the need to invest more in small and medium-size businesses that will create jobs and lift ailing economies is also sensible and in line with administration policies. His plan to condition aid on a country's promise to make reforms, including reducing barriers to American trade and investment, seems to add a twist to initiatives put in place by the Bush and Obama administrations. Mr. Romney needs to explain more fully how this might affect countries that receive the bulk of aid: Egypt, Israel, Afghanistan and Pakistan.
There were also gaps in Mr. Romney's speech; there was no mention of foreign aid's critical role in health, agriculture, education and poverty programs. On the whole, though, Mr. Romney's remarks were encouraging. Foreign aid is badly misunderstood. Many Americans believe it consumes a large part of the federal budget when it really is less than 2 percent. It is a crucial security asset that should be increased, not reduced.

HEADLINE: Visas for Scientists, With a Catch

 BODY:
It isn't hard to find Republicans in Congress willing to support immigration generally, but rarer to hear them talk about actually allowing more foreigners to come here. When they do, you have to listen for the catch. Take Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, leader of the Republican immigration restrictionists, who recently offered a bill to provide 55,000 permanent-residency visas, or green cards, each year to immigrants with advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. 
These so-called STEM graduates are the immigrants everybody likes. Even Mitt Romney, a defender of Arizona-style deportation crackdowns, says he'd happily staple a green card to every advanced STEM diploma.
But the Smith bill was a cynical exercise. It supported one visa program by killing off another. It eliminated the diversity visa, which distributes 55,000 green cards by lottery to countries with low immigration rates. And it ruled that any unused STEM green cards could not be redistributed to ease backlogs in other visa categories -- a common practice under current law.
In effect, Mr. Smith was willing to consider approving a few thousand STEM visas only as long as the net effect on immigration was zero, or less than zero. The bill was brought to a vote last week by a fast-track method and needed a two-thirds majority to pass; thankfully it didn't.
The noxious thinking behind the bill, however, survives. It considers immigration a zero-sum game, and that America should allow in only a subset of educated elites.
Senator Charles Schumer and Representative Zoe Lofgren each have bills to increase STEM immigration while preserving the green-card lottery. That's a fair approach, but better still would be a far broader deal that gives immigrants multiple legal paths into the country, is generous in reuniting families and legalizes millions of valuable workers who are already here. Building the kind of immigration system the American economy needs takes a lot more than cherry-picking workers for technology industries.

HEADLINE: Republicans Intensify Drive To Win Over Jewish Voters

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
BOCA RATON, Fla. -- Using billboards, television advertisements and finely honed voter lists, Republicans here and in other battleground states have intensified an effort to lure a small but potentially significant group of new or wavering voters from President Obama.
Focused on South Florida, Ohio and Nevada, the Republican Jewish Coalition, backed mostly by the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, a Zionist, has begun spending $6.5 million on an air-and-ground strategy to reach Jewish voters who may view Mr. Obama as unreliable on the question of Israel's security. Jewish voters, who generally vote for Democrats in big numbers, overwhelmingly supported Mr. Obama in 2008, giving him 78 percent of their vote, according to exit polls conducted by Edison/Mitofsky.
In Florida, where the largest share of the $6.5 million is being spent, one of the group's most visible messages is along Interstate 95 and the Florida Turnpike, including in Boca Raton and in Broward County, areas with large Jewish populations. A series of red-and-blue billboards lament: ''Obama ... Oy Vey!!'' Then ask, ''Had enough?'' 
Last week, the coalition began the first in a series of ''buyer's remorse'' television ads featuring a Jewish voter concerned about Israel and the economy who declared that he would not vote for Mr. Obama this time around.
The hope among Republican groups is to continue to erode Mr. Obama's deep-seated popularity in the Jewish community, which polls show has dropped slightly since 2008, by emphasizing first Israel and then the economy.
A study of Jewish voters in Florida conducted early this month by the American Jewish Committee showed that about 7 in 10 said they would vote for Mr. Obama. According to the Gallup daily tracking poll conducted from July 1 to Sept. 10, 70 percent of registered Jewish voters planned to vote for Mr. Obama, compared with 25 percent for Mitt Romney. In the spring, Gallup's poll showed Mr. Obama up 64 percent to 29 percent against Mr. Romney.
Some Republicans see those numbers as an opportunity. ''Sixty-nine percent still shows that President Obama has real trouble in the Jewish community, and it hints at the challenges he is facing among a reliable Democratic constituency,'' said Matthew Brooks, the executive director of the Republican Jewish Coalition.
''It is a significant drop,'' Mr. Brooks added. ''And keep in mind, it is taken at the height of all the negative press and all the challenges Romney has been facing.''
At the same time, the latest Quinnipiac University/New York Times/CBS News poll of likely Florida voters showed Mr. Obama with a widening lead, 53 percent to 44 percent.
Democrats said the effort to steer a meaningful number of Jewish votes to Mr. Romney was wishful thinking. Surveys show that most voters are content with Mr. Obama's handling of Israel. And while Israel is important to most Jewish voters, domestic issues hold sway. On issues like immigration, gay rights, abortion and health care, most Jewish voters align with Democrats, analysts say. As the Republican Party tilts further to the right, the task of winning over Jewish voters gets increasingly complicated, analysts add.
The coalition routinely makes a run at Jewish voters -- although never with as much cash as this year -- and walks away with little to show for it, Democrats said. Nineteen percent of Jewish voters are Republicans, according to a March survey by the American Jewish Committee, a nonpartisan advocacy group.
''People understand the president's commitment to the state of Israel,'' said Representative Ted Deutch, a Florida Democrat who is outspoken on the question of Israel. ''Beyond that, the community really does care about women's rights and seniors and about what the Supreme Court would be like with multiple appointments by Mitt Romney.''
But Mr. Brooks said the coalition was not interested in winning over liberal voters, only a more conservative slice of the community. ''We're not trying to appeal to the hard-core Democratic voters,'' he said.
Jewish voters are coveted on both sides because they register to vote and cast ballots in disproportionally large numbers. As a result, a shift of even 5 percent, or 25,000 voters, in a swing state like Florida, known for its cliffhanger elections, can make a difference, Mr. Brooks said.
In Florida, 3.4 percent of registered voters are Jewish, but they make up as much as 8 percent of the electorate, said Ira M. Sheskin, the director of the Jewish Demography Project at the University of Miami.
For this reason, the Republican Jewish Coalition is investing on the ground -- not just the air -- in Florida, Ohio and Nevada, the state that is now receiving the money originally intended for Pennsylvania, Republicans said.
Working with research that microtargets Jewish voters who might choose Mr. Romney, the coalition dispatched hundreds of volunteers this month to South Florida and elsewhere to knock on thousands of doors; stuff mailboxes with brochures that exhort, ''We need a president that stands with Israel''; and make 55,000 phone calls. It is also using high-profile Jewish Republicans, like Ari Fleischer, President George W. Bush's press secretary, to talk to Jewish voters.
''As I like to say, Palm Beach County is ground zero for the Republican Jewish movement,'' said Sid Dinerstein, the garrulous chairman of the Republican Party there, who described a rising chorus of disaffected if discreet Jewish voters in his area. ''The taking for granted of Jewish votes by the Democrats reached a tipping point because of how openly hostile the president is to Israel and the relationship with Israel.''
Israel is the most obvious wedge issue. Republicans portray Mr. Obama's stance on Israel as limp, misguided or worse. Among other things, Mr. Obama's critics say the president has weakened military aid to Israel, is soft on Iran and has snubbed Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister.
Last week, another group, Secure America Now, which is backed by two Republican strategists, ran an ad in Florida featuring Mr. Netanyahu making public remarks on Sept. 11. In the ad, Mr. Netanyahu says that while the world waits, Iran gets closer to building a nuclear bomb. ''And I say wait for what?'' he asks. ''Wait until when?''
This is precisely why Marcia Kaleky Stern, 67, who works as an administrator at an online university in South Florida and who says she voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 and usually backs Democrats, has switched to Mr. Romney.
''He promised to be good to Israel, and I am very, very passionate about Israel,'' Mrs. Stern said. ''The president has proved not to be. Most of the Jewish Democrats, and I hate to say I was one of them until last December, they have their eyes closed.''
But Jewish Democrats say the Republican groups are twisting Mr. Obama's record on the Middle East. In fact, they say, Mr. Obama has showered Israel with large amounts of military aid, put in place sanctions against Iran and met with Mr. Netanyahu nine times since taking office.
''They are distorting the president's stellar record on Israel in their hopes to shave off a couple of votes,'' said Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Democrat of Florida, who is chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. ''It's cynical and harmful to Israel to put partisan politics and love of party ahead of a love of Israel.''
Despite their natural kinship with Jewish voters, Democrats say they are not taking them for granted.
In Florida and elsewhere, they have run phone banks and hosted house parties for Jewish voters to discuss Mr. Obama's contributions. They formed Rabbis for Obama, a group of more than 600 rabbis who have endorsed the president. And they have sent high-profile Democrats around the country to speak out, including former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright.
''The amount of money being put in by Adelson and others is unprecedented, and we don't know what the impact is going to be,'' acknowledged Mik Moore, co-founder of the Jewish Council for Education and Research, a ''super PAC'' that supports Mr. Obama and created the ''Great Schlep'' campaign aimed at increasing Jewish support for Mr. Obama in 2008. ''We are taking very seriously what millions of dollars' worth of print and radio ads can do in an election.''

HEADLINE: The Cost of Electronic Medical Records

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Medicare Bills Rise as Records Turn Electronic'' (front page, Sept. 22) discussed cost problems with the implementation of electronic medical records.
We shouldn't dream of scrapping electronic records; they are a leap toward reducing fragmentation of care. We might ask (1) did the transition to electronic records improve efficiency and patient safety, and (2) was this improvement worth the cost?
Without research, it's difficult to conclusively decide whether doctors underbilled before implementation of electronic records, or fraudulently billed after. But maybe it doesn't matter; we need doctors to want to be economical, especially in a primarily fee-for-service system. We need changes in the payment system and regulations. 
A third question makes the first two mostly irrelevant: Can the Affordable Care Act or other potential changes to Medicare recoup these costs by modifying doctors' financial incentives? And if so, shouldn't the media refocus attention not on individual doctors and electronic record implementations, but rather on fixing the system itself?
DAN MELTZER Berkeley, Calif., Sept. 23, 2012
The writer is studying public health at the University of California, Berkeley.
To the Editor:
Medicare has mostly itself to blame for its predicament. It created a system to bill for ''levels of service'' that bear little relevance to the care that patients need or that doctors provide, and then is ''shocked'' to find that the incentives it creates actually encourage bad actors to take advantage of electronic records to maximize revenue.
The next scene in this morality play, which we have seen time and again, is that Medicare will go after the fraud -- but instead of concentrating on these bad actors, it will end up crippling many law-abiding health care providers. Unfortunately, until the fee-for-service system is put to bed, we will see this same movie again and again.
BRUCE LEFF Baltimore, Sept. 22, 2012
The writer is a professor in the division of geriatric medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.
To the Editor:
Never mind ''upcoding'' (seeking a higher reimbursement); wait till you see the ''downcoding'' of the humanity in the patient-doctor encounter. Nowhere does the new record system honestly record the interaction of these two most important players in the process of healing.
Previously, doctors were taught to record on a paper chart the ''chief complaint'' -- words chosen by a patient to describe his or her reason for seeking medical help. This enabled doctor and patient to know each other more closely.
Now, with electronic records, the doctor clicks on a couple of symptoms, and the patient's complaint becomes a prewritten paragraph, no different from the same complaint for 1,000 other patients in that practice with the same symptoms.
Electronic records are both necessary and here to stay. But, as a novice user, I am already looking forward to a more accurate way to record what really happens in that exam room.
TOBI RICHMAN-STEINHARDT Boca Raton, Fla., Sept. 22, 2012
The writer is a dermatologist.
To the Editor:
The huge flaw in current medical billing systems is that patients are left out of the equation. They are seldom asked to verify that they received the services indicated on their bills and are generally unable to do so anyway because medical services are listed in codes.
The most obvious solution is to print medical bills in plain English. Yes, it will take a little more paper, but we should be moving to a system in which most patients verify their bills online.
JOHN V. KJELLMAN Henniker, N.H., Sept. 22, 2012
To the Editor:
It may be true, as you report, that hospitals using electronic medical records account for a larger increase in Medicare payments when compared with other hospitals. However, your article seems to blame the technology instead of those who use it.
Yes, electronic medical records may make it easier to upcode or to bill for services not rendered, but they also help prevent medical errors and facilitate coordinated care. The real problem is fraudulent billing by some hospitals.
Like any technology, electronic medical records can be misused, but that is no more an argument against their widespread adoption than increases in plagiarism are an argument against word processing and the Web.

HEADLINE: Incumbent Pounces In Missouri Senate Race

BYLINE: By STEVEN YACCINO

 BODY:
When Republicans started calling for Todd Akin to bow out of the United States Senate race in Missouri last month, Senator Claire McCaskill, his Democratic opponent, tried to avoid talking about his "legitimate rape" controversy on the campaign trail. But now that the final deadline for Mr. Akin to withdraw has passed, with Mr. Akin locked in as the Republican nominee, she is swinging as expected. 
A new television advertisement released by Ms. McCaskill's campaign on Tuesday threw the first punch in what is not likely to be the candidate's last mention of a comment Mr. Akin made in an August television interview that the female body naturally prevents pregnancy in instances of "legitimate rape."
The advertisement flips through a list of Mr. Akin's "own words" on myriad issues - Social Security, Medicare, minimum wage, student loans - ending with a jab that many Democrats have been waiting for since the firestorm began.
"And on Aug. 19, Todd Akin said only some rapes are legitimate," the 30-second spot said. "What will he say next?"
The race in Missouri has been one of the most closely watched battles this election cycle, as Ms. McCaskill has shown vulnerabilities in her state and many see it as a crucial seat in the Republicans' effort to take control the Senate.
Mr. Akin's defiance to stay in the race, even after losing the backing and financing of the Republican establishment, now has some Republicans reconsidering their support as high-profile endorsements from within the party emerge.
On Wednesday morning, a former Republican presidential candidate, Rick Santorum, sent an e-mail to supporters informing them that he and Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina would announce their endorsement of Mr. Akin's candidacy.
"If Republicans are to win back the Senate and stop President Obama's liberal agenda, we must defeat Senator Claire McCaskill in Missouri," the statement said. "Her support of President Obama's job-killing, big-spending policies are sending our country into an economic abyss."
Calling Mr. Akin a "principled conservative" it continued: "We support Todd Akin and hope freedom-loving Americans in Missouri and around the country will join us so we can save our country from fiscal collapse."
Showing his commitment to stay in the race on Tuesday, Mr. Akin began a bus tour across the state this week.

HEADLINE: China Politics Stall Overhaul For Economy

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS; Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Beijing and Hong Kong. Patrick Zuo contributed research from Beijing.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- When it comes to confronting economic slowdowns, the Chinese government has not been shy about making bold moves. Faced with the contagion of global recession four years ago, policy makers created a $585 billion stimulus package that helped inoculate the nation against the economic malaise still sapping the United States and Europe.
But today, even as China's vaunted export manufacturing juggernaut loses force and the Shanghai stock market remains in a slump, the Communist Party appears so distracted by its politically tangled once-a-decade leadership transition that it is unwilling or unable to pursue the more ambitious agenda that many economists say is necessary to head off a far more serious crisis in the future.
Although the departing government has tried in recent months to address decelerating growth by easing bank loan restrictions, increasing pensions and offering tax breaks to small businesses, a lack of consensus among the top stewards of the economy has stymied a more muscular response, insiders say. 
Similarly, many analysts question whether the incoming leadership has the political will to overcome the resistance of the so-called princelings and other well-connected families that have prospered under the current system.
China's standard economic formula, they say, is losing its potency: overzealous government investment and lagging consumer spending are creating serious imbalances that are expected to lead to a much more painful reckoning, perhaps not long after the new raft of younger leaders assumes power in early 2013.
''There are tough choices to make, but the central government appears to be so paralyzed they are just sitting on their hands,'' said Ho-Fung Hung, a political economist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. ''The situation is looking increasingly dire.''
The economic data is indeed glum. Direct foreign investment has fallen for 9 months out of the past 10, and industrial output is rising at the slowest rate in three years. Last week, Frederick W. Smith, the chief executive of FedEx, the global airfreight titan, warned of more trouble to come, saying that China's faltering exports pointed to a weakening global economy in the coming year.
Since the death of Deng Xiaoping, the wily leader who steamrollered his conservative opponents to introduce market reforms in the 1980s and '90s, China's political system has increasingly operated through consensus. The horse-trading, involving a dozen or so men who negotiate in secrecy, has dimmed the prospect of significant political or economic change.
''The slogans are loud and the plans are grand, but when it comes to implementation, the constraints are many,'' said Zhao Xijun, an economics professor at Renmin University in Beijing.
Prime Minister Wen Jiabao is a vocal advocate of what many experts see as the kind of change China needs: breaking up state-owned monopolies, encouraging more consumer spending and reducing reliance on investment in real estate and heavy industry. But he has already been rendered something of a lame duck because of his planned retirement in March. He lacks the political capital to undertake a more ambitious overhaul of the economy, particularly anything that would undercut the favored position of state monopolies, analysts say.
''Wen is a spent force,'' said a person with close contacts in the upper levels of the Chinese government.
To be sure, China's developing economy enjoys many advantages over those of most other major industrial nations, with growth still robust enough to prevent unemployment from rising significantly. But unrest is increasing, as riots at a big Foxconn electronics factory on Sunday demonstrated, and there is so much uncertainty surrounding economic policy and the leadership hand-over that few are willing to hazard a prediction about the future.
''The system is so opaque and the new guys are such unknown entities that no one really knows what to expect,'' said Alistair Thornton, senior China economist at IHS Global Insight.
Supporters of Xi Jinping, the man expected to be China's next president, and Li Keqiang, who is all but certain to replace Mr. Wen as prime minister, have been quietly putting out the word that the new team plans to introduce a more far-reaching agenda once the incoming leaders are secure in their new posts. Some even argue that the worse things get, the better the chance the new leaders will have to deal with China's biggest challenges after the successors are announced at the 18th Party Congress, expected to take place next month.
''When the bubble bursts, there will be an initial period of pain,'' Li Zuojun, a prominent government economist, said in a recent speech, ''but it would be good news for the new leadership because it would be clear who is to blame -- their predecessors. The new leadership can start over on solid ground.''
But so far, Mr. Xi has offered almost no clues as to where he stands on overhauling the economy, while Mr. Li's track record during his time as a provincial governor and party secretary suggests he is more of a risk-averse technocrat than a reformer.
For the moment, the world's second-largest economy is drifting, as exports to Europe and the United States wane. Some economists even suspect that the official figure of an annual rate of growth of 7.6 percent in the second quarter is overstated; indicators like electricity generation are rising much more slowly. Moreover, part of the growth led only to producing stocks of unsold appliances, toys and coal that are piling up at warehouses and ports.
Still, Beijing has largely held back from the kind of prodigious investment in housing and public works that propped up the flagging Chinese economy during the global downturn. In an editorial published this month, People's Daily, the party's influential mouthpiece, conveyed the official view, saying the central government should resist the temptation to spend its way out of the slowdown.
In a speech this month at a World Economic Forum session in Tianjin, Mr. Wen agreed that the government was holding its fire, but said that it would step in forcefully if necessary. Beijing has a budget surplus of $158 billion, with $16 billion more in a reserve fund, he noted.
''We will use that money at a right moment for pre-emptive policy and fine-tuning to propel stable economic growth,'' Mr. Wen said.
Local governments, alarmed by a slowdown they fear could lead to mass unemployment and the kind of sluggish growth that can dent political careers, have decided to take matters into their own hands. In recent months, a number of cities have proposed extravagant infrastructure projects they hope will be financed in part by newly liberalized bank loan policies.
Tianjin claims $236 billion will be spent in the petrochemical, aerospace and other industries. Xi'an, home of the famed terra cotta warriors, plans to invest tens of billions of dollars on nine new subway lines. In Guizhou, one of China's poorest provinces, officials said they hoped to funnel $472 billion into tourism-related development.
In Changsha, the provincial capital of Hunan, officials brag of 12.9 percent growth as they spend billions of dollars on a new subway system, a ring road, an intercity rail line and a pair of bridges to knit together its transportation system.
''We haven't felt any impact from the crisis in Europe,'' said Liu Maosong, chairman of the Hunan Economics Association and an adviser to the Changsha government. ''Our guiding philosophy is 'investment, investment, investment.' ''
Even if many such projects turn out to be wishful thinking, economists have expressed alarm that municipalities are still chasing debt-financed growth. ''It almost scares me to death,'' said Mao Yushi, a prominent economist. ''Local governments are using the people's money for investment, but when they can't repay the banks, the financial system will snap.''
And Liao Jinzhong, an economist at Hunan University, worries that much of the spending is misplaced. ''What we really could use is a functioning sewage system,'' he said, speaking from his sixth-floor apartment in a crumbling faculty building that has no elevator.
Mr. Liao said he gave frequent lectures at the local party school about the dangerous fixation on propping up growth figures at all costs. He said officials often congratulated him on his frank views.
''But then they admit they can't change the way they do things,'' he said. ''Given that the whole system is oriented toward bolstering the careers of officialdom, I just don't see things changing any time soon.''
Changing of the Guard: Articles in this series are examining the implications for China and the rest of the world of the coming changes in the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

HEADLINE: Guinea Pigs, for Their Health

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Like a dream patient conjured up in the boardroom of a pharmaceutical company, the Russian grandmother accepted the risks of the drug she was taking without complaint and cheerily endured even extraordinary side effects.
As a test subject in a Russian clinical trial for an experimental weight loss drug, Galina I. Malinina had to inject herself in the stomach daily. ''No problem,'' she said. ''The needle is thin and the dose is small.''
The first time she did this at a hospital where long-faced, white-robed doctors stood by and observed her intently, Ms. Malinina soon vomited. After that, she threw up every day for two weeks, yet stuck to the regimen, something valued by companies, as dropouts are expensive.
''It's wonderful,'' she said of the test substance, a weight loss serum under development by the Danish biotechnology giant Novo Nordisk. In addition to losing 22 pounds in a year, she said, ''I became more lively; I walk easier and I have energy.'' 
Ms. Malinina's willingness, like that of thousands of other Russians, to take part in drug trials illustrates a remarkably advantageous development for the international pharmaceutical industry, which is running up against high costs and recruitment difficulties in the United States and Europe.
Russian regulators, Russian doctors and even many patients are increasingly embracing any chance they can get to take part in medical experiments.
Patients, as was the case with Ms. Malinina, are eager to join trials because often it is the only way to receive modern medical care.
That creates a pool of willing test subjects. The government of President Vladimir V. Putin, eager to diversify Russia's economy away from oil dependence, welcomes the jobs and high-tech investment associated with clinical trials, and has eased access for drug companies to the Russian patients as an incentive to lure in these benefits.
In fact, under a law passed in 2010, ostensibly on health grounds, foreign drug companies must test medicine on Russians for it to be marketed in Russia.
The law has the effect of compelling investment in clinical testing on Russians, trade groups say. And it is working. The number of drugs tested on Russians has shot up over the last year. Russian regulators approved 448 clinical trials in the first six months of 2012, compared to 201 in the same period a year earlier -- an increase of 123 percent.
Russia is not alone in opening the doors of hospitals in the national health system to drug companies looking for test subjects, in a quid pro quo with the international industry that conducts tests globally for a better demographic representation.
Testing in Russia is a net benefit to public health, pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into diagnostic work and doctor care that would not have been here otherwise. Much of the business swirls around lower-risk testing of generic replacements for brand-name drugs.
Singapore, South Korea and China are among countries offering incentives or compelling companies to conduct clinical trials locally, John Lewis, the vice president for the Association of Clinical Research Organizations, a trade group, said in a telephone interview from Washington.
Ethically, if a clinical trial will most likely improve a patient's health -- for whatever reason, including because the patient lacks access to standard, already accepted care -- a doctor should admit the patient to the trial.
''We see a lot of governments encouraging testing for economic benefits, for health care benefits and for innovation benefits,'' he said.
Drug companies benefit, too, though the association does not endorse that motive. ''Clinical trials should be viewed as experiments, as investigations, not as treatment,'' Mr. Lewis said.
A host of pharmaceutical companies operate in Russia, including Bayer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, Novartis, Novo Nordisk and Pfizer. The companies use the results of trials in Russia, as elsewhere, to help win approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration.
Companies have turned to Russia in particular to test experimental psychiatric medicines, sometimes in the same mental health wards once used to confine Soviet dissidents. There is no indication political detainees are used today in drug testing.
But there have been strange results. In 2007, an F.D.A. official wrote that the agency approved Eli Lilly's top-selling antipsychotic drug Zyprexa for use by adolescents based on the results of a Russian test, even though trials in the United States showed the drug had no effect. Why tests differed in Russia and the United States was never explained. Doctors now routinely prescribe the drug for American adolescents.
Companies are exploring creative ways to take advantage of Russia's embrace of clinical testing as a means to attract biotech investment.
In March, Domain Associates, an American venture capital firm, agreed to jointly invest with the Russian government about $760 million in 20 biotechnology start-up companies in the United States. The investment was intended to help Russia transfer drug development expertise to its own, nascent biotech industry.
As an incentive for the American drug companies it will invest in, the joint venture offered to help these start-ups conduct ''advanced stage clinical trials in Russia of new pharmaceuticals,'' according to a statement.
In another example, VitaPortal, a Russian Web site analogous to WebMD, plans to profit by helping pharmaceutical companies find test subjects among visitors to the Web site who have searched for information about particular ailments.
For Russian doctors, the benefits of the globalization of clinical trials are clear from cases like that of Albert V. Chupikov, a 75-year-old cardiac patient enrolled in a trial in Moscow who was referred for an interview by one of his doctors. He said he joined because he could not find treatment elsewhere.
''It was really, really hard to find a doctor,'' he said. ''We couldn't find one.'' So he joined a trial to take an experimental medicine, a choice that worked well for him.
He credits the trial for keeping him alive. ''I understand I won't get any healthier. So it's important not to get worse. And it hasn't gotten worse. So I'm thankful.''
Supporters of the expanding business in Russia note it has room to grow. For every one million people in the United States, drug companies are conducting 46.8 clinical trials, according to the National Institutes of Health, which keeps a running tally. In the European Union the average is 11.5, and in Russia a mere 3.3. About 5 percent of global clinical trials are conducted in Russia, compared with about 50 percent in the United States.
''America is saturated with clinical trials,'' Svetlana Zavidova, the director of a trade group promoting the business in Russia, said in an interview.
The National Center for Preventive Medicine, a research hospital on a leafy back street in Moscow, is testing dozens of new drugs for American and European companies this fall, with a range of promising uses and side effects.
The weight loss medicine gets the pounds off, but patients often vomit or lose control of their bowels. A prostate medicine being tested here on young male volunteers can cause dizziness and spontaneous erections. Elderly patients are raving about the energy-elevating effects of one experimental drug, Dr. Svetlana N. Toppygina, a lead doctor on the studies, said.
That energy-enhancing substance, from a class of drugs banned as doping in sports, was once tested on soldiers to raise stamina and mood. So far the trial is going well with geriatric cardiac patients, who all seem spry after taking their pills.
Folya M. Gonopolsky, an 83-year-old retired engineer who is taking these pills with his wife, Margarita, said, ''They told me I would feel better and I do.''
At a recent appointment, the two received free electrocardiograms and consultations, then shuffled into a room to take the experimental medicine, laid out on a table in tiny plastic bags beside glasses of water. ''Take the pills,'' a doctor said. They did.
Inevitably, tests sometimes do go awry.
Vera G. Belolipetskaya is the supervisor of the ward where patients are observed in early-stage trials. Here, a substance is tested on humans for the first time after animal trials. These studies are also done more cheaply and swiftly in Russia than the West, as volunteers, perhaps tapping Russians' deep sense of fatalism, are surprisingly forthcoming.
Once, an experimental antibiotic set off allergic reactions. Doctors stared in amazement at the students and migrant workers who volunteered to take it.
''It was like something from the cartoon 'Tom and Jerry,' when a character gets sick,'' Dr. Belolipetskaya said. ''Red dots started appearing all over, right in front of my eyes. They appeared in just a few minutes. It was really shocking.''
On a recent morning, Yevgeny Maksimov, a 32-year-old computer salesman, slouched in a chair and waited for his turn in these trials. On offer: $180 to take the experimental prostate drug.
He would be enclosed in a ward under observation for 24 hours, then let go and asked to return two weeks later for a follow-up.
''Why not? I take risks every day,'' Mr. Maksimov said, noting that he recently flew on a Russian-made airplane.

HEADLINE: As Jobless Figures Go Up, Officials Dispute the Data

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
In some statehouses in the Northeast, it is open season on the federal number-crunchers who calculate the unemployment rate every month.
First, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut, a Democrat, questioned their work. Now Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, and members of the staff of New York's Democratic governor, Andrew M. Cuomo, are piling on. Their criticism echoes complaints that had already been lodged by New York City's mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, and some of his lieutenants.
All these elected officials say they are certain that things are going much better in the state or city they govern than the official unemployment statistics imply. Something is wrong with the federal government's jobless numbers, they say. And come to think of it, they add, the longstanding procedure is fundamentally flawed. 
Mayor Bloomberg, an independent, was among the first to take issue with the monthly reports, arguing that a federal survey of employers had been registering healthy gains in employment throughout 2012, so the city's steadily rising unemployment rate could not be accurate.
By June, the federal count crept all the way to 10 percent, a return to the highest rate recorded at the depths of the last recession and well above the national rate. That trend contradicted the mayor's mantra that the city had bounced back much faster and stronger than the rest of the country. City officials, therefore, started dismissing the unemployment rate.
By August, Mr. Malloy was expressing skepticism about his state's reported unemployment rate of 8.5 percent for July. He remained skeptical when it jumped to 9 percent in August.
In Trenton, skepticism turned to disdain when New Jersey's unemployment rate for August came in at 9.9 percent, its highest level in three decades. State officials could find no way to fit that number into the economic comeback story Mr. Christie had been telling.
''These numbers simply do not make sense,'' the governor said in a statement last week.
The chief economist for New Jersey's treasury department, Charles Steindel, went further, telling reporters, ''That's nuts.'' He said the rising rate conflicted with other economic data, including the payroll survey that showed that the state had added about 50,000 jobs in 2012.
In Albany, the consternation about the high unemployment rate has caused delays in reporting the data. Last Thursday, the report that revealed that New York's unemployment rate held at 9.1 percent in August included a dismissive description of the household survey that the Census Bureau conducts monthly for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That survey, state officials declared, is ''not comprehensive,'' because it samples the working status of too few residents.
The focus of the criticism is the divergent results of two federal surveys conducted each month. The unemployment rates are derived from a survey of households, while the tally of jobs added and eliminated comes from a separate survey of employers.
The rash of criticism has left the staff of the federal Labor Department bewildered.
On Monday, Labor Secretary Hilda L. Solis said that she did not understand the complaints because the system for determining the rates ''has been used for a long time.'' Ms. Solis was in Manhattan to announce a $3 million federal grant to the Borough of Manhattan Community College to train students for jobs in health information technology.
Brian Hannon, an economist with the Bureau of Labor Statistics in Washington, said almost all of the complaints about the methodology came from the Northeast, particularly New York. Mr. Hannon said the bureau's Office of Survey Methods Research was analyzing the data to determine if changes were needed. But so far, he said, ''we think that what we have now is working.''
Mark Zandi, the chief executive of Moody's Analytics, said he agreed that the surveys used to produce the state and national unemployment rates were too small to be reliable. But he said he had not heard state or city officials calling for the federal government to spend enough to improve them.
''As an economist, I think it's kind of silly that we don't spend more resources trying to get better data,'' Mr. Zandi said. ''The economic benefits would be enormous if we had good information.''
Still, he said, ''no matter how you slice the data, it's hard to change the reality that things are better, but they're still not good.''

HEADLINE: Cerberus to Sell $2.5 Billion Stake in Japanese Bank

BYLINE: HIROKO TABUCHI


HIGHLIGHT: The private equity firm will start selling its $2.5 billion stake in Japan's struggling Aozora Bank this year in a much-anticipated exit for Cerberus after a more than a decade since its initial investment. 

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Cerberus Capital Management will start selling its $2.5 billion stake in Japan's struggling Aozora Bank this year, the Asian lender said on Thursday, in a much-anticipated exit for the American private equity firm after a more than a decade since its initial investment.
Ceberus will sell a portion of its 55 percent stake in Aozora in a planned share buyback scheme by the bank, Aozora said in a news release. The New York-based private equity firm will sell its remaining Aozora shares in the capital markets or through private transactions, the statement said.
Shares in Aozora plunged on the news, ending the day down 9 percent at 232 yen, or about $2.99, in Tokyo. At that price, a sale of Cerberus's entire stake would fetch about $2.5 billion.
Cerberus has not yet decided on the sale's pace and pricing, Aozora said. The Tokyo-based bank also said it was replacing its chief executive, Brian Prince, with Shinsuke Baba, the bank's chairman.
Representatives of Cerberus in Tokyo could not immediately be reached.
Aozora's predecessor, the Nippon Credit Bank, was temporarily nationalized in 1998 during Japan's banking crisis. The government then sold off large stakes in the bank to investors, including Cerberus, which had hoped to profit from Japan's distressed assets.
Despite an attempted turnaround, Aozora, a mid-sized lender in the Asian country, has struggled to carve out a lucrative business, squeezed between Japan's megabanks and smaller regional lenders who dominate local lending.
Last month, Aozora said it would take more than a decade to pay back about 180 billion yen in public funds that it still owes the government.
Cerberus has already more than doubled its initial 100 billion yen investment in Aozora when it sold part of its holdings during the bank's 2006 relisting. But Aozora's share price has slumped amid the financial crisis and has struggled to recover, limiting any further upside for the American firm and spurring its executives to explore a possible exit.

HEADLINE: Q. and A.: Farming for an Uncertain Future

BYLINE: KATHRYN SHATTUCK


HIGHLIGHT: Wes Jackson, a co-founder of the Land Institute, reflects on population growth, resource depletion and the accumulation of carbon -- and what it means for contemporary agriculture. 

 BODY:
Nearly 40 years ago, while teaching environmental studies at California State University in Sacramento, Wes Jackson began reflecting that something about the country's agricultural practices wasn't quite right. Soon that instinct grew into a powerful itch.
 "The source of that itch was things like, my golly, do we want to be putting those chemicals out here? And my golly, look at that soil erosion. Don't we have a conservation service, or aren't they paying attention? And my golly, look at the size of that equipment and think of the fossil fuel going into food production,' " he said.
 So Mr. Jackson scratched it.
 Returning to his native Kansas, he helped to found the Land Institute, a nonprofit organization devoted to sustainable alternatives in agriculture, in 1976. The institute, based in Salina, promotes "natural systems agriculture," or practices that mimic the ecological stability of the prairie yet result in a grain yield comparable to that of mainstream farming, 
For his work, Mr. Jackson was named a Pew Conservation Scholar in 1990 and a MacArthur Fellow in 1992. In 2000 he received a Right Livelihood Award, which goes to honorees "working on practical and exemplary solutions to the most urgent challenges facing the world today."
 Among those challenges is feeding a global population that is expected to reach nine billion people by midcentury. The Land, as devotees call the institute, is developing perennial crops like Kernza, a wheatgrass with a substantial root structure that would alleviate the need for yearly planting and thus help to replenish the soil and reduce erosion while guaranteeing an annual food crop.
On Friday, the Land Institute kicks off its 34th annual Prairie Festival, a weekend of scientific lectures that will also include a barn dance, bonfire and a celebration of the 35th anniversary of the publication of Wendell Berry's seminal book, "The Unsettling of America: Culture and Agriculture."
 In a phone interview, Mr. Jackson spoke about the festival, his research and the 10,000-year-old "problem of agriculture," as he puts it. Following are excerpts, edited for brevity and clarity. 
 Q. 
 What's the focus of this year's festival? 
 A. 
One of the topics I'm thinking about is "getting over the hump." Imagine the lines of population growth, resource depletion and accumulation of carbon in the atmosphere going up, up and up. And as they are going up, up and up, our whole scientific effort is dependent on fossil fuels for our pickup trucks, for our tractors, for our greenhouses, for the tremendous power we have with these computers. It's all dependent upon the scaffolding within civilization of lots of highly dense carbon.

So the question is, will these new species and varieties be dependent on the extractive economy? And I am saying, no. That as we get over that hump and somewhere on the down slope in the use of resources, there will come a time in which the creatureliness of these plants, these perennial grain crops, are available for the same kind of selection that farmers have had for millennia, and agronomists for hundreds of years. 
The new species and varieties are only half of the equation. The other half is to bring two or more species together with a diverse ecosystem as the conceptual tool. Essentially, all of nature's ecosystems are perennial mixtures, so that's our standard. 
 Q. 
 I assume you're talking about Kernza, the wheatgrass that the institute is developing. How long before it will be released to the public?
 A. 
That will be eight or nine years away, and it will be available for farmers working with ecologists and agronomists. When we say "a release," we have to be careful qualifying that, because there's an awful lot that's going to have to be dealt with because the agronomics have not been worked out. 
You know, the agronomics of many of the crops that we have were probably worked out over hundreds of years in order to achieve what by our standards today would be some acceptable level. By a standard at the time of the early Neolithic, they're totally acceptable. So at this moment we may have about early-to-middle-Neolithic species. But by using modern genetic methods, we're able to accelerate quickly, along with the computational power of our time. We've gone from wild nature to Neolithic in 10 years.
 Q. 
 And in nine years, farmers would volunteer to try it out? 
 A. 
We have a lot of farmers who would like to have this stuff. People come to us all the time, and say, "Just give me some seed and let me play with it." Well, now, just imagine. Say they get the seed, and they don't get the right depth. And remember, the seeds are still small. But some farmer says, "Yeah, I planted those, and no thank you." Farmers are conservative for a good reason. You know, they've had to deal with the pitfalls as well as the promises. 
But let's say we get enough of the agronomics worked out with these special farmers that we work with, and then others see it, and it becomes a compelling alternative. Will the Chicago Board of Trade have the mechanisms to embrace it, or are they so ossified, whether it involves export policy or what, that they can't adjust? I'm more concerned about that than whether farmers will want to do it.
 Q. 
 Will the current system of food production have to collapse before people will be open to this shift? 
 A. 
I think we need to keep the pressure on about the problem of our time. I have friends that will protest Monsanto. Now, I don't like what Monsanto is doing, with their G.M.O's [genetically modified organisms] and all that. But I'm not going to protest them. Because Monsanto is a derivative of corporate charters, and those corporate charters allow for growth and a fiduciary responsibility to stockholders. And what we need to do is to acknowledge that Monsanto is a derivative of assumptions. 
I come back to my friend the late Dan Luten [a lecturer in geography at the University of California, Berkeley]. And he said our problem is: "Wes, we came as a poor people into a seemingly empty land that was rich in resources. And then we've become rich people in an increasingly poor land that's filling up, and those institutions don't hold." 
So if you put poor people in an empty land that's rich, it's inevitable that your institutions - whether they're political institutions or economic institutions or educational institutions or even your religious institutions - will reflect that underlying assumption. We have these institutional structures that are predicated upon the idea of limitlessness. 
The forests of America are limitless. The ocean is limitless. And you contrast that with what Robert Louis Stevenson saw in the South Pacific when he visited the islands - that they're aware of how much land they have, they're aware of how far out they can row to catch fish, so therefore they practice infanticide. Now, I'm not advocating infanticide. But I'm saying that, acknowledging the reality of limits, they act on it. And we could acknowledge the value of limits and begin to get more assiduous about birth control and consumption. Equally important.
 Q. 
 I understand that you hold that the rise of the land-grant university is responsible for the state of agriculture today. 
 A. 
I would say, yeah, and that's what got sent into the third world during the Green Revolution - a lot of those assumptions. That's why bushels and acres became paramount. You know, people are hungry. They need calories. Oh, we need more bushels per acres. Totally understandable. Totally acceptable. And that's considered hardheaded realism. Wendell Berry once used a line: "A hard-headed realist is somebody who uses a lot less information than what's available."
 Q. 
 You've spoken about agriculture being "a 10,000-year-old problem." What do you mean? 
 A. 
Let's go back to 1600. We can see the kind of adjustments that came at the time of the Renaissance, which followed the Reformation of our Christian heritage. Just a change in the concept of the position of the earth relative to the sun had a way of kind of blowing the circuits. And it took a long time, a century and a half. 
Now think about what we're talking about - that 10,000 years ago, if we were going to get the seeds of incipient agriculture to germinate, nature had to be subdued or ignored. You've got to tear it up, you disk it, you harrow it, you plant the seeds. So nature has to be destroyed. Now what we're saying is that nature becomes the standard or the measure, and we want to bring those processes of the wild to the farm? That's 180 degrees away from the way we've thought for 10 millennia. 
 Q. 
 What's your plan for changing that way of thinking? 
 A. 
The only thing I know is to get the good examples out there. The imagination develops that we don't need the seed houses to the extent we do now - the crop just keeps coming up every year. And there'll be some we have to plant. Doesn't mean they go away completely. We don't need the fertilizer people so much because of biological nitrogen fixation. 
We don't need the pesticide people so much because with species diversity, you have chemical diversity. It takes a tremendous enzyme system on the part of an insect or a pathogen to give you the epidemic. And the farm machinery companies aren't as important because there are fewer passes through the field. 
So here is a kind of an inversion of industrial agriculture. 
I don't think they're going to go away and play tiddlywinks. I think there will be some resistance. They'll find a lot of things wrong with it, and who can predict what it'll be like. It's just that if the compelling alternative is there, there will be enough of a push for it because people are concerned about soil erosion, people are concerned about fossil fuel dependency, people are concerned about putting chemicals out there we haven't evolved with. So this is going to require, I think, people coming to their senses about limits.
 Q. 
 Has the current drought crisis helped drive home this need for limits? 
 A. 
Oh, it might have. But then you get a lot of rain next year, and they'll forget it. That's one of the problems with the Paleolithic mind. Someday I'm going to make what I call the American Doll: you wind it up and it loses interest.

HEADLINE: Taming the High-Speed Traders

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: High-frequency trading, which dominates the market in the United States, is getting more oversight abroad. | Expectations are low as Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, gets ready to report its quarterly results. | The biggest Democratic Super PAC donor is James H. Simons, the billionaire hedge fund quant and onetime math professor. | The negotiations between Glencore and Xstrata are centering on the question of who will run the new company. 

 BODY:
Taming the High-Speed Traders | High-frequency trading, which dominates the market in the United States, and has been associated with some high-profile problems in this country, is getting more oversight abroad, in places like Germany, Australia and Canada. As Nathaniel Popper of The New York Times puts it, "countries around the globe are now using America as a model for what they don't want to look like." Our own Securities and Exchange Commission, though, is taking a look at how high-speed trading glitches are handled, according to The Wall Street Journal. (On Tuesday, the S.E.C. is hosting a meeting in Washington to talk about ways to limit problems.)
A committee of lawmakers in the European Parliament voted on Wednesday to have orders by speedy traders be delayed by at least a half-second - an eternity when time is measured in millionths of a second. Those proposed rules, which would need support from individual countries, came right after the German government moved forward with an effort to bring these traders under stricter government control.
All this doesn't sit well with some of the industry's players (although some insiders do support reform). An executive at Deutsche Boerse, the operator of the stock exchange in Frankfurt, told Reuters that the plan by the European Parliament could hurt liquidity and have "corresponding additional costs for investors and the real economy." The debate over the issue can tend to veer into technicalities, but Business Insider has put together a handy guide in plain English.
RIM Earnings Preview | Expectations are low as Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, gets ready to report its quarterly results after the market closes on Thursday. Analysts are predicting the company will report a loss, compared with a profit in the period a year earlier. For a blunt assessment of RIM's outlook, just turn to the chief executive, Thorsten Heins, who said this week, "We have a clear shot at being the No. 3 platform in the market." 
The company, looking ahead to the upcoming BlackBerry 10, has been using some creative methods of wooing software developers, and it recently pointed to its bigger cash pile as a sign of optimism. Shares rose on Wednesday after the company reported a better-than-expected number of subscribers. But shareholders probably aren't feeling comforted, writes Spencer Jakab in The Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street column: 
"Focusing on cash and cash flow isn't exciting to investors who have, for good reason, discounted the likelihood of a takeover offer. The company may be worth more than the sum of its parts but probably is more trouble than it is worth."
On the Agenda | Discover Financial Services reports earnings before the market opens, and Nike reports its results after the bell. John Thain, the former Merill Lynch chief executive who now runs the CIT Group (which, according to Fox Business Network, he is looking to sell), is on CNBC at 3:00 p.m.
The third quarter will be over on Friday, at least as far as stock trading is concerned, and investors are likely to have smiles on their faces after they get their quarterly investment statements. So far the Dow is up more than 6 percent, the S&P 500 is up nearly 8 percent and the Nasdaq is up more than 8 percent for the quarter. Certainly, the last two days could erase some of those gains. Durable goods orders for August are expected to be weak.
The Biggest Democratic Super PAC Donor is James H. Simons, the billionaire hedge fund quant and onetime math professor, reports Nicholas Confessore in The New York Times. Mr. Simons, who is known for keeping a low profile, has given at least $2 million to Priorities USA Action, the super PAC supporting President Obama, and $2 million more to two allied groups that support Democrats in Congress, Mr. Confessore says.
"The fact is that I am not seeking any publicity in this matter," Mr. Simons said in an e-mail to The Times. "The donations can speak for themselves." 
Clock Ticking for Glencore and Xstrata | Monday is the new deadline for Xstrata to decide whether to accept Glencore's sweetened takeover offer. The negotiations are centering on the question of who will run the new company, which will combine Xstrata's mining business with Glencore's trading operations. Under the new terms, Glencore's chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, would take over from Xstrata's chief, Mick Davis, six months after the merger is complete. William MacNamara writes in DealBook:
"An adviser close to Xstrata said he had the 'strongest possible guidance' that Xstrata executives would leave when Mr. Glasenberg took over. As a result, retention packages have become the leading issue in Xstrata's talks with shareholders before its decision to recommend or reject Glencore's offer, according to an adviser close to the proceedings. More than 60 Xstrata executives would receive bonuses worth more than $200 million if they stayed at the new company for a specified period. Xstrata says it believes these are crucial safeguards for the performance of Glencore-Xstrata's mining-led business. But it may be tough to extract any richer bonuses than those."

HEADLINE: Emancipation in Indiana

BYLINE: STEPHEN E. TOWNE


HIGHLIGHT: Most people in the Hoosier State didn't take kindly to Lincoln's new stand on slavery. 

 BODY:
Indiana was a free Union state, but one with strong pro-slavery sentiments. The editorial reactions of Indiana Democratic newspapers to President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation were predictably hostile. The Huntington Democrat, a northern Indiana weekly paper, lashed out in indignation at the president's capitulation to abolitionist pressure. The proclamation would prompt the South's "servile population" of "savage negros" to rise up in "insurrection, rapine, murder, arson, and what not," the paper predicted. 
The racism of the majority whites in Indiana of that era was profound. Both Republicans and Democrats shared a hatred and morbid fear of African-Americans. Many in the state had migrated from the South seeking a landscape and economy free from the reach of the slave-centric economy. But only a small number of them supported the abolition of Southern slavery, and even fewer believed that black was equal to white. Many were willing to let Southern whites maintain slavery in the South and keep African-American slave laborers away from their Indiana farms, workshops and homes. Democratic reactions to Lincoln's proclamation fit the pattern of what the historian Emma Lou Thornbrough called Hoosier "negrophobia." 
Indiana was, to be sure, under strong Republican control. Since the formation of the party, Republicans had grown in strength and seized majorities of the Indiana General Assembly and Congressional seats. In 1860, they won the governor's office. The coming of war to preserve the national Union had created a powerful coalition of Indiana Republicans and War Democrats intent on crushing rebellion. But dissenion roiled. The Indianapolis Daily State Sentinel, the chief antiwar voice and official organ of the state Democratic Party, crowed that the abolitionist intentions of the administration were now clear; Joseph J. Bingham, the editor and chairman of the party's central committee, challenged apostate War Democrats who had coalesced with Republicans in the Union effort: were they now willing to "sit down to the abolition feast?" Many were not. Reacting in anger and disgust, War Democratic newspapers like The New Albany Daily Ledger denounced the proclamation as a betrayal of their trust.
Back in Washington, Lincoln's secretary of the interior, the Indiana politician Caleb Blood Smith, understood his state's people and telegraphed their interests in the cabinet. In July, when the president shared with the cabinet his plan to emancipate slaves in the rebel states, Smith had warned (though whether he addressed his warning to Lincoln is not clear) that "if the President carried out that policy, he might count on losing Indiana, sure!" Smith knew that a year and a half of bloody, expensive and, to date, inconclusive war had strained that Union coalition and threatened Republican control.
Indeed, since the beginning of the conflict, Indiana Democrats had slowly regained strength. The federal defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run, in July 1861, made clear to all that the rebels would not be defeated easily. In the following months, as the war dragged on, many voters recovered from "war fever" and gravitated to the Democratic position that opposed coercing the rebel states back into the Union. 
The war took a severe toll on everyone. Families mourned the large toll of dead, maimed and grievously ill soldiers. The agricultural economy suffered as warfare blocked the shipment of Indiana's farm products to Southern markets and drained the fields of able workers. Citizens complained of a new protective tariff and higher taxes. As the federal government expanded to meet its military challenges, Democrats who adhered to a Jeffersonian state sovereignty ideology of limited national powers were aghast at what they saw as Lincoln's overreach. Democratic editors wrote that the president aimed to establish a military dictatorship. Violations of civil liberties mounted. The president suspended the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, and Union Army forces arrested Democratic politicians and speakers; troops and civilian crowds sacked Indiana Democratic newspapers and assaulted editors for voicing opposition to the coercive war. 
Indiana's people also felt the shock of a resurgent Confederacy when the rebels invaded neighboring Kentucky in August and September 1862. Armies under generals Edmund Kirby-Smith and Braxton Bragg marched north and overran Indiana troops hurriedly sent south. Rebel forces were poised both to strike at Louisville and cross the Ohio River to attack Cincinnati. Could southern Indiana be the next scene of war? The rebels retreated after the battle of Perryville, fought on Oct. 8, but not before sending a cold shiver up the spines and casting gloom on the faces of the people residing north of the river. Federal victory was even less imminent than once believed. 
Demands for more federal troops to conquer a resilient Confederacy required a draft. Lincoln called on the states to resume recruiting efforts on a large scale. Congress added conscription to the mix. Indiana's draft was set for early October, just days after the news of the president's Emancipation Proclamation. Indiana Democrats viewed the draft as another example of the Republican assault on the liberties of free (white) men. 
Moreover, emancipation changed the war from one to restore the Union to one to free Southern slaves. Men who would not volunteer to fight in such a cause certainly did not want to be drafted into it. A draft-day riot in the northern Indiana town of Hartford City, in strongly Democratic Blackford County, revealed profound opposition to the war and prompted authorities to send 500 troops from Indianapolis to quell disorder. Troops remained in the area for several days until after Election Day. Commanders posted soldiers at polling places to arrest rioters who attempted to vote, adding to Democratic fears of tyranny. 
Lincoln's proclamation did no favors for Indiana's Republican candidates in the upcoming elections. The tepid endorsements offered by Republican newspaper editors exemplified rank-and-file reactions to the abolitionist turn. Editors of the state Republican flagship organ, The Indianapolis Daily Journal, resigned themselves to making the most of the bad hand dealt them. While faulting the proclamation for freeing the slaves of loyal Southerners along with those of the rebels, the editorial writer fell back on the argument that a blow to the slave economy must weaken the rebellion. In a speech in Washington, Governor Oliver P. Morton characterized it as merely a "stratagem of war." While opposed to slavery, he and other Indiana Republicans believed abolition was bad politics at this time and capable of harming the Union coalition they hoped to preserve.
On Oct. 14, Election Day, Indiana voters went to the polls in presidential-election-year numbers. Republican fortunes suffered from the fact that Indiana law prohibited soldiers in the field from voting. Many War Democrats broke from their union with Republicans and returned to the old standard. The adverse reaction to the proclamation aided the energized Democrats to win all the state offices on the ballot, as well as large majorities in both chambers of the Indiana General Assembly. They also won 7 of 11 congressional races, reversing Republican victories two years earlier. Ohio saw similar Democratic election victories, and Illinois voters followed suit in November. Democratic election victories in the Old Northwest presaged a tumultuous year to come.
Only Indiana's small minority of abolitionists rejoiced at Lincoln's bold move. Centreville's Indiana True Republican, owned by the radical- Republican Congressman George W. Julian and edited by his brother Isaac, stood at the forefront of abolitionist opinion in the state. The proclamation, wrote Isaac, "will change the entire policy of the war, and gives new hope for our country." Offering rare praise for Lincoln, he added: "At last, the President is arousing himself to a solemn duty."

HEADLINE: Volkswagen Introduces the Golf Triumverate

BYLINE: JERRY GARRETT


HIGHLIGHT: The seventh generation of the compact hatchback was formally unveiled on Thursday along with BlueMotion and GTI variants that were introduced as concepts. 

 BODY:
PARIS -- Pop quiz: What is the highest-selling Volkswagen model of all time? If you guessed the Beetle, you would be wrong by about 8 million cars.
Volkswagen's top seller is the Golf, of which more than 29 million have been sold worldwide since its introduction in 1974, according to the automaker.
The Golf enters its seventh generation with the global introduction of the redesigned 2013 model on Thursday. The new Golf will go on sale here in November, but not in the United States until this time next year, prolonging an unfortunate tendency of leaving the company's American division out of step with the rest of the world.
"The Golf is the bedrock upon which our company is built," Jonathan Browning, head of Volkswagen of America, said in a brief interview here, after the vehicle's introduction. "It has fathered a whole family of vehicles."
Unlike the sixth-generation Golf, which was little more than a facelifted fifth-generation car, or MkV, as it was known in series, the latest version truly is all new. Mr. Browning said every aspect of the car was redesigned and upgraded.
Key improvements include a larger interior with extra rear legroom and more luggage space; upgraded safety systems, including a feature called multicollision braking; completely redesigned information and entertainment systems; a lower-weight, modular platform; and engines that sip an average of 18 percent less fuel.
"Our engineers have come up with a much improved vehicle, with a lot more standard features, without raising the price," Mr. Browning said.
Along with the basic four-door hatchback, Volkswagen also unveiled a high-efficiency BlueMotion diesel prototype and a GTI concept, both "almost ready to go into full production," VW noted.
The diesel-powered BlueMotion model, expected to enter production as early as next summer, was shown here with a new direct-injected, 1.6-liter turbodiesel 4-cylinder engine mated to a 5-speed manual transmission. VW said it was 15 percent more efficient than the model it would replace, improving highway fuel economy.
Fuel savings were also on the minds of the engineering team for the GTI concept. "The average fuel consumption has been reduced, in comparison to its predecessor, by about 18 percent," the company noted. Powertrain and equipment details for the nominal concept were few, but the company noted the hot hatchback's engine, also unspecified, would generate 217 horsepower, a 17-horsepower bump over the 2-liter unit found in the MkVI GTI sold in the United States.

HEADLINE: Mixed-Race America

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: The population of mixed-race Americans grew by 32 percent from 2000 to 2010. 

 BODY:
That map is from a new Census Bureau report about the population of mixed-race Americans, which grew 32 percent from 2000 to 2010. The population of single-race Americans, by contrast, grew 9.2 percent.
As a share of the total population, mixed-race Americans are still a tiny minority, just 2.9 percent, or about nine million people.
As you can see in the map, the states with the highest share of residents who report being of more than one race are Hawaii (23.6 percent), Alaska (7.3 percent), Oklahoma (5.9 percent) and California (4.9 percent).
Four distinct mixed-race combinations represented about 92 percent of all mixed-race people: people who reported being both white and black totaled 1.8 million; white and "some other race," 1.7 million; white and Asian, 1.6 million; and white and American Indian and Alaska native, 1.4 million.

HEADLINE: New York Lags Behind Other Cities in College Graduation Rate

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: New York City is sixth among the 10 biggest cities in America in the percentage of residents with college degrees, according to a report by the comptroller's office. 

 BODY:
 College graduation rates in New York City are so low that more of the city's residents who have college degrees were born abroad than in New York, a report released on Thursday shows.
 The report, published by the city comptroller's office, found that despite the city's reputation as a magnet for college graduates, only 42 percent of its residents have degrees from two-year or four-year colleges. That share placed New York sixth among the 10 biggest cities in America, the report found.
 Comptroller John C. Liu, who is expected to run for mayor next year, had his staff conduct the studyas part of "Beyond High School NYC," which he said would be an initiative to find ways to increase the share of city residents with college degrees to 60 percent by 2025. Doing so would put the city on par with the level of education in Washington and Seattle, the report shows.
 First, Mr. Liu said, the city would need to raise the graduation rate for its secondary students. Only 21 percent of New York City students obtain a college degree within 12 years of entering high school, according to the report.
 Of the 1.9 million city residents with college degrees, almost 40 percent were born in other countries. And, contrary to the popular notion that the city is flooded with new college graduates every spring, only about 1 of every 60 college graduates in the city came from a neighboring state and only an additional 5 of those 60 came from elsewhere in the country. 
 By comparison, the five big cities with higher concentrations of college graduates - Washington, Boston, San Francisco, Minneapolis and Seattle - drew about one-fourth of their college graduates from beyond their neighboring states.
 "If New York City were to approximate the educational attainment of the five most-educated cities, [#x2028]it would need to have more than 630,000 additional college degree-holders among its resident population," says the report, which was written by Frank Braconi, the comptroller's chief economist.
 Improving high-school graduation rates would be an important step toward that goal, the report states, though it does not lay out any suggestions for how that would be accomplished or how much it would cost.

HEADLINE: Longer Unemployment, Fewer Interviews

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: A study finds that a job applicant's chances of obtaining an interview fall sharply between the first month of unemployment and the eighth, and then they level out. 

 BODY:
I've writtenbeforeabout about how the longer you're unemployed, the less likely you are to find a job. That's probably because of some combination of several factors: skill deterioration; better workers are more likely to get hired faster, leaving a pool of less qualified workers as the ones who disproportionately make it to long-term unemployment in the first place; and the stigma of unemployment, or at least the assumption by employers that the longer-term unemployed will be lower quality because of the previous two factors.
A new study tries to measure how big a factor that stigma is.
In the fall of 2009, the authors sent out 12,054 fake résumés for 3,040 jobs posted online, with most showing that the (fictional) applicant had been unemployed somewhere from one to 36 months. The résumés were all variations on a few standard templates that the researchers came up with. The duration of unemployment was randomly assigned to candidates of otherwise equal qualifications.
Over all, 4.7 percent of résumés resulted in the candidate's being invited for an interview. But a candidate's chances of being called back depended on how long he or she had been looking for work.
Candidates unemployed for just a month had a 7 percent chance of being invited for an interview. Those chances dropped off sharply with just a few more months of unemployment. After eight months of unemployment, the callback rate was just 4 percent. In other words, the chances of getting an interview fell about 45 percent from Month 1 to Month 8.
At that point, though, the callback rate pretty much flattened out.
Candidates unemployed for 8 months, 12 months and even 36 months all had about a 4 percent chance of getting an interview.
"A lot of this sorting mechanism happens really early on," said Fabian Lange, an economics professor at McGill University and one of the paper's authors, along with Kory Kroft at the University of Toronto and Matthew J. Notowidigdo at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.
He attributed these patterns to the fact that in a normal economy, most people who are unemployed find jobs within the first several month. After someone has been unemployed for more than a few months, the chances that the candidate is a desirable one start to fall rapidly. But after some point -- in this case, about eight months -- employers believe the difference in duration of unemployment is less informative about a candidate's likely quality.
The résumés were submitted for three categories of jobs: customer service, clerical and administrative, and sales. The drop-off in callback rates was largest for sales.
"That makes some sense," Mr. Lange said. "If you're in sales, you're supposed to sell something. If you've been unemployed for six or seven months, you're not that good at selling yourself, so why should an employer take a chance on you?"
Interestingly, the study also found that a candidate who is currently employed is actually less likely to be called back for an interview than one who is newly unemployed.
This may be surprising, given that people with jobs have already demonstrated that they are employable; there are even some job postings that specifically require candidates to be currently employed to be considered.
The authors of the study offered a few theories for why the currently employed had a lower callback rate than the recently employed.
First, they learned from personnel professionals that employers were concerned that people who were already employed were not serious candidates. Second, some jobs require workers to start immediately, and someone who already has a job will probably have to give notice before leaving. Third, a person who already has a job has more bargaining power and can ask for a higher wage in a new position. There's also the question of loyalty.
"If you're an employer, you might see that this person has a job and is not being very loyal to that current job," Professor Lange said. "You might think, 'Maybe if I give him or her a job, and they go through a phase of training, maybe he or she will leave me within a few months on the basis of what they did to the last employer.'"
The study also found that in areas with higher unemployment rates, callback rates for even the recently unemployed were very low, and there was not as much of an advantage to being recently unemployed compared with long-term unemployment.
In other words, employers are more forgiving of longer durations of unemployment when they know that the job market is really bad: they recognize that length of unemployment is not as good a proxy for quality of a worker when no one is being hired, not even the really good candidates.
The problem, of course, is that duration of unemployment is always going to be an imperfect signal for quality. You still have a lot of good candidates being passed over for interviews because they got unlucky, and that unluckiness develops an inertia.
"It's the classic lemon problem," Professor Lange said. "You have a lot of lemons, but still some good cars among then. The problem is to distinguish the good from the bad when you have a high proportion of bad."
One possible policy response, he speculates, is having the government provide some sort of additional screening mechanism to help employers distinguish the unlucky-but-good long-term unemployed from the long-term unemployed who cannot find jobs because they are unmotivated or unskilled.
For example, there could be "training" programs whose purpose is just to demonstrate that students have the discipline and motivation to attend and complete them, regardless of what skills are actually taught.
"It could be something that involves 40 hours a week, the regular workday length, and starts early in the morning," he said. "If you find people who are willing to subject themselves to a 40-hour-a-week program and complete that successfully, that might be the signal the labor market needs to determine they're good job candidates."
Mr. Lange and his colleagues are also looking into ways to redesign the unemployment benefits system to account for the patterns they found.
He says one idea might be to start benefits at lower levels, to encourage people to take jobs sooner before their chances for getting interviews fall off sharply. And then to make benefits more generous once applicants pass the eight-month mark, when it becomes much more difficult to get interviews and applicants are in need of assistance.

HEADLINE: France and Britain Weigh the Price of Nuclear Deterrence

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Britain and France are second-ranking powers that "punch above their weight," in part because they have nuclear weapons. But some would like to cut the cost of this ticket to the top table without jeopardizing their world power status at the United Nations. 

 BODY:
LONDON - There were reports on Thursday of stirrings within the British military about the need to scale back the country's nuclear deterrent in order to spend the money on confronting more conventional threats.
It is part of a continuing debate in Britain and France - Europe's two nuclear weapons powers - about the cost to their overburdened budgets of maintaining nuclear independence.
In the post-Cold War world, does it make sense to have nuclear capacities that were designed to deter the Soviet Union?
From a diplomatic viewpoint, nuclear weapons are seen as money well spent, allowing both countries to punch above their weight in the international arena. However, economic factors mean the two countries would now like to keep the weapons but cut costs in a process that has been described as "deterrent lite."
Although Britain and France have fallen to the status of second-tier powers, they are still among the big five that hold a veto in the United Nations Security Council alongside the United States, Russia and China. That authority stems in part from the fact that both maintain independent nuclear deterrents.
As world leaders gathered at the United Nations this week for the annual opening of the U.N. General Assembly, the supremacy of the big five, a legacy of World War II, was once more under attack as a global anachronism.
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran, playing to the non-aligned gallery, told the Assembly: "The existence of the right of veto and the monopoly of power by the Security Council has led to the restriction of the exercise of rights by, and the protection of the rights of nations."
That is an argument that might be dismissed if it were confined to the leader of a country that is under pressure from the big five to come clean about its own nuclear ambitions. However, it is one widely shared within the 193-member U.N., where reform of the Security Council has been on the agenda for almost 20 years.
In the margins of the General Assembly this week, the foreign ministers of India, Brazil, Germany and Japan called for a bigger effort to reorganize the UN with a view to giving major developing countries permanent seats on the 15-member Security Council "in order to better reflect today's geopolitical realities."
President Jacob Zuma of South Africa used his U.N. speech to call for a more democratic Security Council and more seats and greater representation for Africa.
"Given its mandate, the Council has to be legitimate, democratic and transparent. Its current composition has a propensity for deadlock and paralysis even in the face of crisis," President Zuma said.
Any fundamental shake-up of the Security Council would make the permanent seats held by France and Britain vulnerable, providing both with a strong motive to maintain their nuclear forces.
An unidentified senior British general quoted by The Independent made the connection. "There are all kinds of considerations beyond purely military ones," he said, "such as whether not having a nuclear deterrent [would] have any impact on our seat in the Security Council." 
There is broad cross-party support in both countries for keeping nuclear weapons despite the need to curb defense costs.
Michel Rocard, a former French Socialist prime minister, was widely criticized this year for suggesting France should abandon its independent deterrent, saying the money spent on maintaining it "serves absolutely no purpose."
The latest debate in Britain was spurred by remarks from Sir Nick Harvey, a Liberal Democratic former defense minister in the Conservative-led coalition government. He was dropped this month from a post that included reviewing Britain's nuclear capability.
He said senior military commanders had expressed reservations about the costs and benefits of maintaining the country's current level of nuclear deterrence after the country's aging fleet of nuclear-armed Trident submarines is scrapped. 
Sir Nick told members of his party that there were opportunities to scale back the level of the deterrent without actually scrapping it. 
He said Britain had the technology to "simply put it away in a cupboard and keep it as a contingency in case there ever were to be deterioration in the global security picture that might need the U.K. government to take it out of the cupboard."

HEADLINE: Is This the Nastiest Election Ever?

BYLINE: PETER MANSEAU


HIGHLIGHT: Nope. Not by a long shot. The real question is why negativity is always with us. 

 BODY:
A month after pundits declared the current presidential contest the "meanest," "nastiest," "most poisonous," and "dirtiest campaign in history," those summer laments already seem like poignant reminders of a kinder, gentler time. Thanks to recent efforts to score political points on violence in Egypt and Libya, and charges of class warfare rising on both sides, this mean and nasty season has only gotten worse.
Yet as bad as this election may seem, it is hardly original in its biliousness. Its protagonists often appear to be reading from a borrowed script, delivering lackluster renditions of the truly inspired negative campaign tactics that have made American politics a blood sport from the start.
Concerned that the supposedly hands-off topic of a candidate's faith has become too much a factor in 2012? Compared to the elections of 1796 and 1800, this contest has all the inter-religious animosity of a Lutheran versus Methodist slow pitch softball game. In the earliest of the nation's two-party elections, the match-up of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson gave voters a choice, according to Adams supporters, between "God and a religious president, or Jefferson and no God!" The pious allegedly buried Bibles in their gardens, in fear that President Jefferson would gather holy books for the pyre upon inauguration.
Jefferson versus Adams may also have the dubious distinction of the being the first time the so-called race card was played. Even then, Jefferson's rivals circulated rumors of his relationship with an enslaved woman - perhaps beginning during his years as the United States minister to France, when Sally Hemings was just 14 years old. It was thanks to the racist undercurrents of this campaign that Jefferson, the target of more conspiracy theories than even Donald Trump could shill, was later said to be 
a mean-spirited, low-lived fellow, the son of a half-breed Indian squaw, sired by a Virginia mulatto father, as was well known in the neighborhood where he was raised, wholly on hoe-cake (made of course-ground Southern corn), bacon, and hominy, with an occasional change of fricasseed bullfrog, for which abominable reptiles he had acquired a taste during his residence among the French.
"Race has always been an inflammatory subject in campaigns," Richard Brookhiser, the author of several presidential biographies, told me. "In 1844, the Whigs ran slave owner Henry Clay. But he and his running mate, Theodore Frelinghuysen, supported settling freed slaves in Liberia. This was not racist enough for Democrats, who attacked them in verse: 'De nigger vote am quite surprising, We's all for Clay and Frelinghuysing.' "
Entwined suspicions of ethnic difference and foreign connections run like an ugly thread through the fabric of our civic history. The original birthers of American politics, members of the 19th-century Know Nothing Party, were driven by nativist fears exploding in response to the influx of Irish, Chinese and other immigrant groups. In 1856, a popular Know Nothing candidate for president, George Law, was hoist on his own xenophobic petard when supposed evidence of his foreign birth emerged. Mr. Law swore he had been born on a farm in New York, a year after his alleged immigration, but that did not stop his opponents from pursuing this attack with obvious delight.
Nor is this election unique in its willingness to play politics with the loss of American lives. The Obama camp went there first with a "super PAC"-financed ad that blamed Mitt Romney for the death of a woman who lost her health insurance when Bain Capital closed a Kansas City steel plant. More recently, Romney adviser Richard Williamson suggested that the deaths of American diplomats in Benghazi might have been avoided if his man had been on watch. 
Distasteful as either of these claims may be, they have nothing on the attempt to tar Andrew Jackson as an actual murderer of American militiamen during the War of 1812. While commanding American forces fighting the British in New Orleans, Jackson had approved an execution order for six men convicted of desertion though they had believed their tour of duty had ended. A dozen years later, a broadside describing "The Bloody Deeds of General Jackson" offered the iconic visual of six black coffins arranged below the presidential candidate's name. An accompanying hymn made these attack ads a multimedia experience:
 The regulars then he did command 
 These citizens to kill 
 And far from home, their wives and land 
 Their blood he there did spill 
 And God forbid, our President 
 This Jackson e'er should be; 
 Lest we should to his camp be sent, 
 And shot for mutiny. 
Of course, Jackson's campaign could give as well as it got, and its efforts likewise have a contemporary analogue. While some have drawn a parallel between the hidden camera tactics behind Romney's 47 percent video and James O'Keefe's stealth attack portraying Acorn as an enabler of prostitution, Jackson supporters charged that Old Hickory's rival for the White House, the incumbent John Quincy Adams, was an actual pimp.
"Sex was used with special gusto in prudish times," Mr. Brookhiser said. "Adams was charged with supplying an American woman to the czar when he was minister to Russia years earlier. Adams's supporters in turn accused Jackson of bigamy."
The moral character - and intimate entanglements - of the candidates has been a common front in the battle of for the presidency. In 1884 Grover Cleveland famously dealt with taunts of "Ma, Ma, where's my pa?" when news spread that he had fathered a child with a woman to whom he was not married. 
Less well known is a counter-rumor that circulated about Cleveland's opponent, James G. Blaine. Hitting the supposedly morally superior Blaine where he lived, Cleveland supporters claimed that Blaine's first-born son, who had died as a toddler 30 years before, had been conceived before Blaine and his wife were married. In an apparent attempt to make it seem as if Blaine was hiding something, vandals chiseled the date of the child's birth from his grave.
Before we count our blessings that we are now far removed from a time when the dead children of politicians were considered fair game, or when an election would be framed unabashedly as a choice between God and no God, it's worth remembering that similar moments have been a part of 2012 all along - from January, when Rick Santorum endured questions about his family's method of grieving for his son Gabriel, to September, when Democrats faced a literal "God or no God" question in their party platform.
If there is anything uniquely negative about this year, it could only be the sheer tonnage of baldly hostile messages bombarding the electorate in the dozen or so states still considered to be in play.
"What may set apart the 2012 campaign from previous elections is the volume of negative ads," said Melissa Deckman, a professor of political science at Washington College. While the use of deceptive ads by campaign organizations goes back at least as far as Jefferson and Adams, Ms. Deckman noted, recent research shows that while negative ads accounted for 9 percent of all political advertising in 2008, in this election attack ads account for 70 percent of the total. "Given that Election Day is still weeks away," Ms. Deckman said, "from an advertising perspective, this election could well be the most negative in history."
Is it possible that anything good could come of this? Negative campaign tactics - even the meanest and nastiest - have their place in the theater of American politics, but they do not always have their desired effect. Four years ago, Mr. Obama most likely would not have given his pivotal speech on race were it not for the attempts to link him to the divisive rhetoric of his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright. Twenty years earlier, George Bush similarly turned negative associations to his advantage when he countered concerns over his toughness with tales of his time as a decorated fighter pilot and undeniable war hero. After enduring questioning of his manhood at the hands of media ranging from Newsweek to "Doonesbury," the vice president showed that his ability to throw a punch had not diminished by going on the offensive during a live interview with Dan Rather - who is, it must be noted, among those currently lamenting this election as "the worst."
Smear campaigns, whether they contain a kernel of truth or are based on outright lies, allow candidates to demonstrate how they respond under the strain of conditions most other Americans would find intolerable. As the historian Gil Troy has written, brutal campaigns endure not only because they let off the collective steam of 300 million opinionated Americans, but because - unlikely as it seems - they work.
If there is to be no end to the negativity, perhaps the question we should be asking is not "Is this campaign the dirtiest ever?" but rather "Why have our elections been so negative in the same ways for so long?" The enduring themes of the supposedly worst campaigns - race, religion, sex and death - remind us of their centrality not just to politics, but to every aspect of American life. No matter how much the economy matters to the outcome, this election is as dirty as many others because voters know they are choosing something other than a manager.
Given the stakes, the most surprising part of our perpetually dirty political system is that all the slings and arrows that once cut so deeply may later seem merely funny, or only instructive. Today's fighting words will be reduced to tomorrow's interesting anecdotes, but the true questions at the heart of every presidential election will remain.

HEADLINE: Is This the Nastiest Election Ever?

BYLINE: PETER MANSEAU


HIGHLIGHT: Nope. Not by a long shot. The real question is why negativity is always with us. 

 BODY:
A month after pundits declared the current presidential contest the "meanest," "nastiest," "most poisonous," and "dirtiest campaign in history," those summer laments already seem like poignant reminders of a kinder, gentler time. Thanks to recent efforts to score political points on violence in Egypt and Libya, and charges of class warfare rising on both sides, this mean and nasty season has only gotten worse.
Yet as bad as this election may seem, it is hardly original in its biliousness. Its protagonists often appear to be reading from a borrowed script, delivering lackluster renditions of the truly inspired negative campaign tactics that have made American politics a blood sport from the start.
Concerned that the supposedly hands-off topic of a candidate's faith has become too much a factor in 2012? Compared to the elections of 1796 and 1800, this contest has all the inter-religious animosity of a Lutheran versus Methodist slow pitch softball game. In the earliest of the nation's two-party elections, the match-up of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson gave voters a choice, according to Adams supporters, between "God and a religious president, or Jefferson and no God!" The pious allegedly buried Bibles in their gardens, in fear that President Jefferson would gather holy books for the pyre upon inauguration.
Jefferson versus Adams may also have the dubious distinction of the being the first time the so-called race card was played. Even then, Jefferson's rivals circulated rumors of his relationship with an enslaved woman - perhaps beginning during his years as the United States minister to France, when Sally Hemings was just 14 years old. It was thanks to the racist undercurrents of this campaign that Jefferson, the target of more conspiracy theories than even Donald Trump could shill, was later said to be 
a mean-spirited, low-lived fellow, the son of a half-breed Indian squaw, sired by a Virginia mulatto father, as was well known in the neighborhood where he was raised, wholly on hoe-cake (made of course-ground Southern corn), bacon, and hominy, with an occasional change of fricasseed bullfrog, for which abominable reptiles he had acquired a taste during his residence among the French.
"Race has always been an inflammatory subject in campaigns," Richard Brookhiser, the author of several presidential biographies, told me. "In 1844, the Whigs ran slave owner Henry Clay. But he and his running mate, Theodore Frelinghuysen, supported settling freed slaves in Liberia. This was not racist enough for Democrats, who attacked them in verse: 'De nigger vote am quite surprising, We's all for Clay and Frelinghuysing.' "
Entwined suspicions of ethnic difference and foreign connections run like an ugly thread through the fabric of our civic history. The original birthers of American politics, members of the 19th-century Know Nothing Party, were driven by nativist fears exploding in response to the influx of Irish, Chinese and other immigrant groups. In 1856, a popular Know Nothing candidate for president, George Law, was hoist on his own xenophobic petard when supposed evidence of his foreign birth emerged. Mr. Law swore he had been born on a farm in New York, a year after his alleged immigration, but that did not stop his opponents from pursuing this attack with obvious delight.
Nor is this election unique in its willingness to play politics with the loss of American lives. The Obama camp went there first with a "super PAC"-financed ad that blamed Mitt Romney for the death of a woman who lost her health insurance when Bain Capital closed a Kansas City steel plant. More recently, Romney adviser Richard Williamson suggested that the deaths of American diplomats in Benghazi might have been avoided if his man had been on watch. 
Distasteful as either of these claims may be, they have nothing on the attempt to tar Andrew Jackson as an actual murderer of American militiamen during the War of 1812. While commanding American forces fighting the British in New Orleans, Jackson had approved an execution order for six men convicted of desertion though they had believed their tour of duty had ended. A dozen years later, a broadside describing "The Bloody Deeds of General Jackson" offered the iconic visual of six black coffins arranged below the presidential candidate's name. An accompanying hymn made these attack ads a multimedia experience:
 The regulars then he did command 
 These citizens to kill 
 And far from home, their wives and land 
 Their blood he there did spill 
 And God forbid, our President 
 This Jackson e'er should be; 
 Lest we should to his camp be sent, 
 And shot for mutiny. 
Of course, Jackson's campaign could give as well as it got, and its efforts likewise have a contemporary analogue. While some have drawn a parallel between the hidden camera tactics behind Romney's 47 percent video and James O'Keefe's stealth attack portraying Acorn as an enabler of prostitution, Jackson supporters charged that Old Hickory's rival for the White House, the incumbent John Quincy Adams, was an actual pimp.

While commanding American forces fighting the British in New Orleans, Jackson had approved an execution order for six men convicted of desertion though they had believed their tour of duty had ended. A dozen years later, a broadside describing "The Bloody Deeds of General Jackson" offered the iconic visual of six black coffins arranged below the presidential candidate's name. An accompanying hymn made these attack ads a multimedia experience:
 The regulars then he did command 
 These citizens to kill 
 And far from home, their wives and land 
 Their blood he there did spill 
 And God forbid, our President 
 This Jackson e'er should be; 
 Lest we should to his camp be sent, 
 And shot for mutiny. 
Of course, Jackson's campaign could give as well as it got, and its efforts likewise have a contemporary analogue. While some have drawn a parallel between the hidden camera tactics behind Romney's 47 percent video and James O'Keefe's stealth attack portraying Acorn as an enabler of prostitution, Jackson supporters charged that Old Hickory's rival for the White House, the incumbent John Quincy Adams, was an actual pimp.
"Sex was used with special gusto in prudish times," Mr. Brookhiser said. "Adams was charged with supplying an American woman to the czar when he was minister to Russia years earlier. Adams's supporters in turn accused Jackson of bigamy."
The moral character - and intimate entanglements - of the candidates has been a common front in the battle of for the presidency. In 1884 Grover Cleveland famously dealt with taunts of "Ma, Ma, where's my pa?" when news spread that he had fathered a child with a woman to whom he was not married. 
Less well known is a counter-rumor that circulated about Cleveland's opponent, James G. Blaine. Hitting the supposedly morally superior Blaine where he lived, Cleveland supporters claimed that Blaine's first-born son, who had died as a toddler 30 years before, had been conceived before Blaine and his wife were married. In an apparent attempt to make it seem as if Blaine was hiding something, vandals chiseled the date of the child's birth from his grave.
Before we count our blessings that we are now far removed from a time when the dead children of politicians were considered fair game, or when an election would be framed unabashedly as a choice between God and no God, it's worth remembering that similar moments have been a part of 2012 all along - from January, when Rick Santorum endured questions about his family's method of grieving for his son Gabriel, to September, when Democrats faced a literal "God or no God" question in their party platform.
If there is anything uniquely negative about this year, it could only be the sheer tonnage of baldly hostile messages bombarding the electorate in the dozen or so states still considered to be in play.
"What may set apart the 2012 campaign from previous elections is the volume of negative ads," said Melissa Deckman, a professor of political science at Washington College. While the use of deceptive ads by campaign organizations goes back at least as far as Jefferson and Adams, Ms. Deckman noted, recent research shows that while negative ads accounted for 9 percent of all political advertising in 2008, in this election attack ads account for 70 percent of the total. "Given that Election Day is still weeks away," Ms. Deckman said, "from an advertising perspective, this election could well be the most negative in history."
Is it possible that anything good could come of this? Negative campaign tactics - even the meanest and nastiest - have their place in the theater of American politics, but they do not always have their desired effect. Four years ago, Mr. Obama most likely would not have given his pivotal speech on race were it not for the attempts to link him to the divisive rhetoric of his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright. Twenty years earlier, George Bush similarly turned negative associations to his advantage when he countered concerns over his toughness with tales of his time as a decorated fighter pilot and undeniable war hero. After enduring questioning of his manhood at the hands of media ranging from Newsweek to "Doonesbury," the vice president showed that his ability to throw a punch had not diminished by going on the offensive during a live interview with Dan Rather - who is, it must be noted, among those currently lamenting this election as "the worst."
Smear campaigns, whether they contain a kernel of truth or are based on outright lies, allow candidates to demonstrate how they respond under the strain of conditions most other Americans would find intolerable. As the historian Gil Troy has written, brutal campaigns endure not only because they let off the collective steam of 300 million opinionated Americans, but because - unlikely as it seems - they work.
If there is to be no end to the negativity, perhaps the question we should be asking is not "Is this campaign the dirtiest ever?" but rather "Why have our elections been so negative in the same ways for so long?" The enduring themes of the supposedly worst campaigns - race, religion, sex and death - remind us of their centrality not just to politics, but to every aspect of American life. No matter how much the economy matters to the outcome, this election is as dirty as many others because voters know they are choosing something other than a manager.
Given the stakes, the most surprising part of our perpetually dirty political system is that all the slings and arrows that once cut so deeply may later seem merely funny, or only instructive. Today's fighting words will be reduced to tomorrow's interesting anecdotes, but the true questions at the heart of every presidential election will remain.

HEADLINE: Is This the Nastiest Election Ever?

BYLINE: PETER MANSEAU


HIGHLIGHT: Nope. Not by a long shot. The real question is why negativity is always with us. 

 BODY:
A month after pundits declared the current presidential contest the "meanest," "nastiest," "most poisonous," and "dirtiest campaign in history," those summer laments already seem like poignant reminders of a kinder, gentler time. Thanks to recent efforts to score political points on violence in Egypt and Libya, and charges of class warfare rising on both sides, this mean and nasty season has only gotten worse.
Yet as bad as this election may seem, it is hardly original in its biliousness. Its protagonists often appear to be reading from a borrowed script, delivering lackluster renditions of the truly inspired negative campaign tactics that have made American politics a blood sport from the start.
Concerned that the supposedly hands-off topic of a candidate's faith has become too much a factor in 2012? Compared to the elections of 1796 and 1800, this contest has all the inter-religious animosity of a Lutheran versus Methodist slow pitch softball game. In the earliest of the nation's two-party elections, the match-up of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson gave voters a choice, according to Adams supporters, between "God and a religious president, or Jefferson and no God!" The pious allegedly buried Bibles in their gardens, in fear that President Jefferson would gather holy books for the pyre upon inauguration.
Jefferson versus Adams may also have the dubious distinction of the being the first time the so-called race card was played. Even then, Jefferson's rivals circulated rumors of his relationship with an enslaved woman - perhaps beginning during his years as the United States minister to France, when Sally Hemings was just 14 years old. It was thanks to the racist undercurrents of this campaign that Jefferson, the target of more conspiracy theories than even Donald Trump could shill, was later said to be 
a mean-spirited, low-lived fellow, the son of a half-breed Indian squaw, sired by a Virginia mulatto father, as was well known in the neighborhood where he was raised, wholly on hoe-cake (made of course-ground Southern corn), bacon, and hominy, with an occasional change of fricasseed bullfrog, for which abominable reptiles he had acquired a taste during his residence among the French.
"Race has always been an inflammatory subject in campaigns," Richard Brookhiser, the author of several presidential biographies, told me. "In 1844, the Whigs ran slave owner Henry Clay. But he and his running mate, Theodore Frelinghuysen, supported settling freed slaves in Liberia. This was not racist enough for Democrats, who attacked them in verse: 'De nigger vote am quite surprising, We's all for Clay and Frelinghuysing.' "
Entwined suspicions of ethnic difference and foreign connections run like an ugly thread through the fabric of our civic history. The original birthers of American politics, members of the 19th-century Know Nothing Party, were driven by nativist fears exploding in response to the influx of Irish, Chinese and other immigrant groups. In 1856, a popular Know Nothing candidate for president, George Law, was hoist on his own xenophobic petard when supposed evidence of his foreign birth emerged. Mr. Law swore he had been born on a farm in New York, a year after his alleged immigration, but that did not stop his opponents from pursuing this attack with obvious delight.
Nor is this election unique in its willingness to play politics with the loss of American lives. The Obama camp went there first with a "super PAC"-financed ad that blamed Mitt Romney for the death of a woman who lost her health insurance when Bain Capital closed a Kansas City steel plant. More recently, Romney adviser Richard Williamson suggested that the deaths of American diplomats in Benghazi might have been avoided if his man had been on watch. 
Distasteful as either of these claims may be, they have nothing on the 1848 image of the Whig candidate Zachary Taylor sitting on a pile of human skulls (a sharp critique of the kind of experience he had gained during the Mexican-American War) or on the attempt to tar Andrew Jackson as an actual murderer of American militiamen during the War of 1812. While commanding American forces fighting the British in New Orleans, Jackson had approved an execution order for six men convicted of desertion though they had believed their tour of duty had ended. A dozen years later, a broadside describing "The Bloody Deeds of General Jackson" offered the iconic visual of six black coffins arranged below the presidential candidate's name. An accompanying hymn made these attack ads a multimedia experience:

 These citizens to kill 
 And far from home, their wives and land 
 Their blood he there did spill 
 And God forbid, our President 
 This Jackson e'er should be; 
 Lest we should to his camp be sent, 
 And shot for mutiny. 
Of course, Jackson's campaign could give as well as it got, and its efforts likewise have a contemporary analogue. While some have drawn a parallel between the hidden camera tactics behind Romney's 47 percent video and James O'Keefe's stealth attack portraying Acorn as an enabler of prostitution, Jackson supporters charged that Old Hickory's rival for the White House, the incumbent John Quincy Adams, was an actual pimp.

HEADLINE: Fiscal Confrontation Undermines the U.S.

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: The continuing failure to address government debt, and the looming fiscal cliff, threaten the status of the dollar, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Simon Johnson is the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and co-author of "White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters to You." 
It is axiomatic among most of our Washington elite that the United States cannot lose its pre-eminent global role, at least not in the foreseeable future. This assumption is implicit in all our economic policy discussions, including how politicians on both sides regard the leading international role of the United States dollar. In this view, the United States is likely to remain the world's financial safe haven for international investors, irrespective of what we say and do.
Expressing concerns about the trajectory of our federal government debt has of course become fashionable during this election cycle; this is a signature item for both the Tea Party movement in general and the vice-presidential candidate Paul D. Ryan in particular. 
But the tactics of fiscal confrontation - primarily from the right of the political spectrum - make sense only if the relevant politicians, advisers and donors firmly believe that the American financial position in the world is unassailable. 
Threatening to shut down the government or refusing to budge on taxes is seen by many Republicans as a legitimate maneuver in their campaign to shrink the state, rather than as something that could undermine the United States' economic recovery and destabilize the world. This approach is more than unfortunate, because the perception of our indefinite pre-eminence - irrespective of how we act - is at completely odds with the historical record.

In his widely acclaimed book, "Eclipse: Living in the Shadow of China's Economic Dominance," Arvind Subramanian places the rise of the dollar in its historical context and documents how economic policy mistakes, World War II and the collapse of empire undermined the British pound and created space for the United States dollar to take over as the world's leading currency. (Dr. Subramanian and I are senior fellows at the Peterson Institute for International Economics; we have worked together, but not on this book.)
Very few people in Washington are aware - and even fewer care - that persuading people around the world to hold both their official government reserves and their private wealth in dollars was the result of a hundred-year process and a great deal of hard work. Responsible economic policy and being careful about fiscal accounts were absolutely part of why the United States persuaded others that holding its dollars was appealing.
But Dr. Subramanian also asserts that two other factors were important: the sheer size of the American economy, which overtook Britain's, probably at some point in the late 19th century, and the United States current account surplus. In particular, American exports were far larger than imports during World War I and in the years that followed, and by the end of World War II the United States had amassed almost half the gold in the world (gold at that time was used to settle payments between countries). 
In effect, the United States dollar pushed aside the British pound in part because the United States became the world's largest creditor.
Dr. Subramanian's point is not just that the United States will lose its predominance but rather that it has already lost key advantages. The United States has run current account deficits consistently since the 1980s; we are now the world's largest debtor, not a creditor. About half of all federal debt is held by foreign individuals and governments. Emerging markets have amassed very large foreign-currency reserves (much of which is this Treasury debt in dollars). 
The Chinese are embarked on a long-term strategy to make their currency, the renminbi, into an appealing reserve currency. Their economy is currently about one-quarter the size of the American economy, but it is catching up fast. China has overtaken the United States as the world's leading exporter. You may not agree with Dr. Subramanian on the extent of Chinese dominance today, but there is no question that this is a real possibility within 20 years.
The "fiscal cliff" coming at the end of this year could be resolved in a reasonable manner (if you need a primer on what is coming, I recommend these graphics from NPR's "Planet Money"). For example, let the Bush-era tax cuts expire and replace them with other temporary tax cuts (e.g., to payroll taxes), to provide short-term support to the economy. And American politicians could find other ways to restore federal government revenue to where it was in the late 1990s while also bringing health care spending under control. 
The point is not to make precipitate adjustments but rather to increase revenue and limit spending in a reasonable manner over the next two decades.
But this is not going to happen. Congressional Republicans will refuse to consider anything they regard as a tax increase, and the fiscal cliff is likely to become a repeat of the debt-ceiling fight last summer, which ended up making everyone in Washington look bad. What would be the consequences?
First, this will definitely be destabilizing to world financial markets - making people more concerned about risk both in the United States and around the world. Anyone who pays a "risk premium" when they borrow - including American home buyers and euro-zone governments - is likely to be affected negatively. Uncertainty and fear will increase, slowing the economy in the United States and perhaps contributing to yet another round of crisis in Europe. The stock market will presumably fall.
Second, yields (market-determined interest rates) on United States Treasury debt are likely to decline. In most other countries, when politicians act irresponsibly, bond yields go up. But we are still the world's No. 1 safe haven - so capital will come into the United States. Some politicians will see this as justification for their tactics - and continue with more of the same. 
Third, Dr. Subramanian will be proved right, faster than would otherwise be the case. The world will more eagerly seek an alternative to the fickle American dollar. It will become increasingly hard for the United States to borrow at reasonable interest rates. Indeed, one striking point in "Eclipse" is the speed with which the British pound lost its predominance once the British position weakened as a result of World War I.
The dollar became strong because American politicians were responsible, careful and willing to compromise. Fiscal extremism, confrontation and a refusal to consider tax increases over any time horizon will undermine the international role of the dollar, destabilize the world and make it much harder for all of us to achieve any kind of widely shared prosperity.

HEADLINE: Labor Group Revives George Allen Gaffe in New Ad

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: A labor group backing George Allen's opponent in Virginia is trying to revive the controversy over the word "macaca" by printing the word next to Mr. Allen's picture in a new series of ads. 

 BODY:
As George Allen battles to regain his seat in the United States Senate from Virginia, one important name has not been mentioned -- until now.
"Macaca."
That word -- a term that can refer to monkeys -- torpedoed Mr. Allen's re-election campaign in 2006 after he was caught on video using it to describe a young man of Indian descent at a campaign rally. The video instantly went viral online, one of the first such examples on YouTube.
The incident sparked weeks of national news about Mr. Allen's past, including allegations that the Republican senator had embraced symbols of racial hatred during his political career and in his personal life.
Mr. Allen's opponent this year, Tim Kaine, the former governor of Virginia, has steered away from all of that, preferring to argue that Mr. Allen's economic and policy record make him unfit for a return to the Senate.
But now, a labor group backing Mr. Kaine's election is trying to raise it all again with a series of small, online advertisements that note each of the most unsavory allegations against Mr. Allen. The ads were created by workersvoice.org, a political arm of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
One notes that Mr. Allen "kept a noose in his office" and shows a picture of Mr. Allen giving a thumbs up next to a hangman's noose. Mr. Allen has always claimed the noose was a lasso intended to represent cowboys.
Another banner ad says that Mr. Allen hung a Confederate flag in his living room; he said it was a symbol of youthful rebellion. A third ad notes, correctly, that as a member of the Virginia state legislature, he voted against a holiday honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (The state celebrated Lee-Jackson-King Day for 16 years.)
A fourth ad revives the controversy over "macaca" by simply printing that word next to Mr. Allen's picture.
"George Allen kept a noose and a Confederate flag in his office and anyone who would insult the African-American and Latino people of Virginia this way is not fit to hold office," said Eddie Vale, the communications director for the group. "This is similar to, but even more offensive, than Mitt Romney secretly attacking 47 percent of all Americans." 
Emily Davis, a spokeswoman for Mr. Allen, said in a statement: "It is disappointing to see that Tim Kaine and his union allies would stoop to this level rather than talk about the very serious issues facing Virginia families and small businesses. George Allen has apologized and forthrightly addresses these old accusations, but when he is on the campaign trail he is hearing from Virginia families and small businesses concerned about skyrocketing fuel costs, burdensome regulations and increased taxes that are bringing uncertainty."
The revival of questions about Mr. Allen's racial attitudes is clearly an effort to help Mr. Kaine break away from Mr. Allen in what has been one of the closest Senate elections in the country. Mr. Kaine, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has been targeted by national conservative groups with millions of dollars of negative television ads.
Will it work? 
It could. The intensity of the "macaca" coverage in 2006 made Mr. Allen toxic among donors, dashed his hopes of becoming a serious contender for the 2008 Republican presidential primary, and ultimately cost him his re-election against the Democrat, Jim Webb.
But the stories have faded now. There are plenty of new voters in Virginia who may have little memory of all that coverage. If the labor group can remind them effectively, it could cause Mr. Allen problems again.
But it also could backfire. Despite all of the negative coverage -- including, for weeks, reporting about whether Mr. Allen had used a particularly offensive racial epithet often aimed at African-Americans -- Mr. Allen came within just a few thousand votes of winning re-election. (He denied using the epithet.)
The avalanche of negativity was seen by political observers as evidence that many Virginia voters were turned off by the series of attacks. Mr. Allen could tap into that sentiment if Mr. Kaine's allies try a reprise of the 2006 campaign.
Odds are that Mr. Kaine's advisers are smart enough to avoid getting drawn into the attacks. Better for them if their allies can make the attacks work without any strings attached.
But in the end, it's also possible that the whole thing could just fizzle this time around.
The economy in 2012 is very different than it was in 2006. People are out of work. Housing values have plummeted. The appetite for personal attacks that date back decades may have faded in the face of those more serious issues.
If so, look for "macaca" to once again become part of YouTube's early viral history.

HEADLINE: Beware ... the Curse of the I.P.L.?

BYLINE: PRASHANT AGRAWAL


HIGHLIGHT: Does owning one an Indian Premier League team bring bad luck? 

 BODY:
After the failed auction of the Deccan Chargers, I can't help but notice an interesting trend: the stock prices of the owners of nearly all the Indian Premier League cricket teams have lost substantial value since the league was started four years ago.
It's not just Kingfisher Airlines and Deccan Chronicle, the corporate owners most often in the headlines now, that have suffered. The same holds true for GMR, Reliance and others.

Of the nine Indian Premier League teams, seven are owned by companies that have lost a combined $25 billion in market value since the league began in April 2008. While the Sensex index has also suffered during that time, returning just 15 percent before the rally connected to the government's recent economic policy changes, all seven stocks associated with the I.P.L., including India Cements, News Corporation and Bombay Dyeing and Manufacturing, have underperformed the Sensex.
The remaining two I.P.L. team owners, Shah Rukh Khan and Subrata Roy, do not have large listed companies, but Mr. Roy's Sahara Group is deeply troubled, having been recently ordered to pay $3 billion to investors. (At least Mr. Khan is still a king at the box office.)
Could the I.P.L. be cursed?
That may be overstatement. What's true in India appears to be true throughout the world. Let's call it the curse of the sports team, instead.
Guess which company owns the naming rights to the newest major sports stadium in the United States, the nearly $1 billion home of the Brooklyn Nets? Barclays -- yes, the Barclays that agreed in June to pay $450 million to settle accusations that it tried to manipulate the benchmark London interbank offered rate, or Libor. Barclays bought the naming rights in 2007, years before there was a hint of the Libor scandal.
Citigroup bought the naming rights to the New York Mets' new stadium in 2006. Two years later, as the global financial crisis erupted, Citigroup's stock plummeted.
But the steepest downfall in recent years of a company with a sports connection may have been that of Enron, which bought the naming rights to the Houston Astros' park in 1999. In December 2001, it was embroiled in one of the most spectacular bankruptcies in modern corporate history.
"Pro sports teams are a lot like works of art," the author Malcolm Gladwell wrote last year on the sports-oriented Web site Grantland. He argues that buying a team, like buying a painting, is less about profit than about "psychic benefits," that is, "the pleasure that someone gets from owning something - over and above economic returns." Mr. Gladwell notes that sports teams do go up in value in the United States because they are inherently so few of them. One day, the I.P.L. owners may see similar gains, but at least in the auction of the Deccan Chargers that wasn't the case.
It's not clear whether I.P.L. team owners make money from their franchises, because these numbers are not public, but they have certainly lost equity value on their main businesses. And the loss in equity value in the main businesses would dwarf any operating losses in running any I.P.L. team.
If any of India's banks buys a sports team, or the naming rights to a new stadium, perhaps the Reserve Bank of India should take notice.
There are some exceptions to the rule, at least in the United States. The technology entrepreneur Mark Cuban, for example, has done wonders with a once-moribund Dallas Mavericks, who won the N.B.A. championship in 2011, but he spends in an inordinate amount of time on the team. Similarly, the Pittsburgh Steelers and New York Giants have been profitably run by families who focus on the teams, rather than treating them as part-time occupations. Corporations that stray into sports often end up on the losing side.
In India, however, sports teams appear to be a distraction from the main business. And, for most I.P.L. owners, it has been a very expensive distraction indeed, given the amount of share market equity lost on their main businesses.

HEADLINE: Sept. 26: Could 2012 Be Like 2008?

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: If the election were held today, the FiveThirtyEight statistical model shows President Obama favored in all but two of the states he won in 2008. 

 BODY:
There's no point in putting it gently: Mitt Romney had one of his worst polling days of the year on Wednesday.
It began with a series of polls from The New York Times, CBS News and Quinnipiac University, released early Wednesday morning, which gave President Obama leads of between 9 and 11 points in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Later in the day, Mr. Romney got polls showing unfavorable numbers for him in Colorado and Iowa.
Unlike many recent days, when Mr. Obama's national polls were slightly less euphoric than his swing state surveys, Wednesday's national polls seemed to support the notion that Mr. Obama has a clear lead in the race. The Gallup national tracking poll gave Mr. Obama a six-point lead among registered voters, close to his high mark on the year in that survey. The online tracking poll conducted by Ipsos gave him a six-point lead among likely voters. Another online tracking poll, from the RAND Corporation, put Mr. Obama's lead at roughly seven and a half percentage points, his largest of the year in that poll. And a national poll for Bloomberg produced by the pollster J. Ann Selzer, who has a strong track record, put Mr. Obama six points ahead.
The exception was the Rasmussen Reports tracking poll, which gave Mitt Romney a two-point lead among likely voters. (This was in the version of the poll that included voters who leaned toward a candidate, which is the one that FiveThirtyEight uses for all surveys.)
What to think of the Rasmussen poll? Their surveys usually have a Republican lean, but it seems to have gotten stronger in the last few weeks. It has also been stronger in some years than others. Rasmussen got reasonably good results in years like 2006 and 2008 when their polls were close to the consensus. However, their polls were the least accurate of the major polling firms in 2010, when they had an especially strong Republicanhouse-effect. The same was true in 2000, when they had a three- or four-point statistical bias toward Republican candidates.
This feature is not unique to Rasmussen Reports: a poll that substantially differs from the consensus, whether in a Democratic or Republican direction, is usually not one that you'll want to bet on. And there is even less reason to do so when a poll is taking a number of methodological shortcuts, while others are being more thorough. But there have been years when the whole polling average has been off in one direction or another, and the "outlier" polls turn out to look good. It's also the case that a broken clock is right twice a day.
Accounting for all of the data, including the Rasmussen Reports poll, the FiveThirtyEight forecast showed Mr. Obama making gains. His probability of winning the Electoral College is now listed at 81.9 percent, his highest figure of the year and up from 79.7 percent on Tuesday.
We're at a point in the race, however, when it's important to contrast what we think might happen on Nov. 6 with what we're seeing in the polls at the moment. Right now, there is a gap between these two things.
Although Mr. Obama is now the clear favorite in the Nov. 6 forecast, his advantage is larger in the FiveThirtyEight "now-cast," which projects what would happen in an election held today.
The "now-cast" estimates that Mr. Obama would have a 97.8 percent chance of winning an election held today. Further, it pegs his advantage at five and a half percentage points in the national popular vote.
By contrast, the Nov. 6 forecast expects Mr. Obama to win by a smaller margin, 3.6 percentage points, on Election Day itself. Two things account for this disparity.
First, there are still some effects from the convention bounce penalty that the Nov. 6 forecast applies to Mr. Obama's polls, but which the "now-cast" does not. The convention bounce adjustment is phasing out of the model, but it hasn't done so completely.
Second, the Nov. 6 forecast is still using economic data along with the polls. By design, the economic component of the forecast receives less and less weight over the course of the year, since it becomes less and less likely that there will be predictable effects from economic news that are not already priced into the polls. (By Election Day itself, the economic component of the model will phase out completely, meaning that the forecast will become equivalent to the "now-cast.") For the time being, however, the economic index still accounts for about 30 percent of the forecast.
The way that the economic index evaluates the data, Mr. Obama is the favorite in the race. However, he is only a slight one, and the economic index has been declining recently, following a poor report on manufacturing activity and a decline in the stock market over the last week on renewed investor concerns about Europe. 
Mr. Obama is considered a modest favorite by the economic model because he is the incumbent president, and incumbents are favored given average economic conditions. The economy is decidedly below-average, but it is not recessionary, and there have been just enough bright spots in the data that Mr. Obama remains in the buffer zone where his incumbency advantage could outweigh it. 
However, the economic index would point toward a two- or three-point win for Mr. Obama in the popular vote, rather than the five- or six-point advantage that he has enjoyed in the most recent polls. Thus, the economic index is exerting some downward pressure on Mr. Obama's Nov. 6 forecast.
If the election were held today, however, it could look pretty ugly for Mr. Romney. The "now-cast" has Mr. Obama favored in all the states he won in 2008 except for Indiana, where he is several points behind, and North Carolina, which it shows as an almost exact tie. It would project Mr. Obama to win 337 electoral votes, slightly fewer than the 365 that he won in 2008.
Beneath the surface, however, there are some bigger differences in the individual states. In the table below, I've compared how Mr. Obama performed in each of the 50 states in 2008 against what the "now-cast" estimates would happen in an election held today.
In 14 of the 50 states, the "now-cast" would bet on Mr. Obama winning by a larger margin than he did in 2008. They are an eclectic mix and include the following:
 Two states, Arizona and Alaska, that were home to the Republican presidential and vice-presidential candidates in 2008.
 Three states in New England: Vermont, Maine and Rhode Island. There is an interesting split this year among the six New England states, with Mr. Obama running very well in these three, which are poorer, but not as well in Connecticut, New Hampshire and Massachusetts, where voters are better off.
 Several states in theupland South, like Kentucky and Tennessee, where polls have sometimes shown Mr. Obama running ahead of his 2008 numbers. This is a region of the country where a higher-than-average number of voters said in exit polls that the race of the candidates played a role in their voting decision. It is possible that some of these racial effects have abated as Mr. Obama has become more of a familiar presence. It is also possible that this is a region of the country where polls still exaggerate the standing of African-American candidates. (This phenomenon, termed the Bradley Effect, no longer seems to hold in most parts of the country.)
 New York, where Mr. Obama's numbers have been quite strong in the polls, and which has gone from a state where Republicans could sometimes compete into one that seems completely lost for them.
 Finally, two swing states: Florida and Ohio.
The utter weirdness of this mix - how often do you see Ohio, New York, Kentucky and Vermont on the same list? - is one reason to be skeptical that either candidate has all that much of an advantage in the Electoral College relative to his position in the popular vote. 
With Mr. Obama's strong run of polling in the swing states recently, the model has reverted to figuring that he would have just the slightest Electoral College edge in an election in which the popular vote were exactly tied. But it is a slight advantage indeed: the model estimates that Mr. Obama would have a 53 percent chance of winning the Electoral College under those conditions.
If Mr. Obama were to choose any two states in which to overperform, Ohio and Florida are pretty good picks, and both represent huge problems for Mr. Romney. It is too late in the race, and there are too many polls there, to write off Mr. Obama's polling in these states as a fluke - although the set of Quinnipiac polls certainly present a rather optimistic case.
Mr. Obama is also polling fairly close to his 2008 levels in Minnesota and Pennsylvania, two states that Mr. Romney has not contested as vigorously as John McCain did four years ago. Some recent polls also show Mr. Obama near his 2008 numbers in Virginia and North Carolina, where demographic and cultural shifts seem to be working in favor of Democrats.
But there are a number of other swing states in which Mr. Obama is still polling well off his 2008 pace. Mr. Obama's numbers have perked up in Iowa and Colorado, for instance - but polls are suggestive of a lead for him in the mid-single-digits there, when he won both states by nine percentage points in 2008.
Mr. Obama is a heavy favorite in Michigan, but is highly unlikely to replicate his 2008 performance, when Mr. McCain pulled out of the state early and he won it by more than 16 points. He is also unlikely to duplicate his 12-point margin of victory in Nevada, where economic conditions are so poor as to be almost depressionary (Nevada's median household income fell to $47,043 in 2011 from $54,744 in 2008) -- or in Wisconsin, in which Paul D. Ryan should help Mr. Romney at least a little bit.
Because he won some of these states by such a wide margin in 2008, Mr. Obama has a lot of cushion in them. Michigan, in particular, looks all but lost for Mr. Romney, and Wisconsin may be getting that way.
But in order to say that Mr. Obama had an especial advantage in the Electoral College relative to his standing in the popular vote, we'd need to see at least one or two more of these states start polling in the high single digits for him, as Ohio now is. If Mr. Obama were polling three points better in Colorado than our current estimate has him, for instance, he'd win the Electoral College in about an additional 2 percent of the time, making him almost an 85 percent favorite, with most of those additional wins coming in cases where he lost the national popular vote. 
If Mr. Obama did this in two or more of these states - say, Colorado and Nevada, or Iowa and Virginia - we might say that Mr. Obama had really developed a "blue wall." Right now, we're not quite able to do that. His highly favorable numbers in Ohio and Florida lately offset other swing states where he's likely to underachieve his 2008 numbers by several percentage points.
Still, this Electoral College discussion is going to be academic unless Mr. Romney can reverse his poor run of polling. We'll conclude with a scary thought for Republicans.
Right now, the Nov. 6 forecast projects that Mr. Obama will win the popular vote by 3.6 percentage points. As I mentioned, that does account for about a two-point decline from where Mr. Obama seems to be in the polls right now. Otherwise, however, the model assumes that the uncertainty in the forecast is symmetric: Mr. Obama is as likely to overperform it as underperform it.
If Mr. Obama misses to the downside by 3.7 percentage points, then Mr. Romney would win, at least in the popular vote. However, if Mr. Obama missed to the upside by 3.7 percentage point instead, he'd win the popular vote by 7.3 percentage points, exactly replicating his margin from 2008.
In other words, there looks to be about a 20 percent chance that Mr. Romney will win, but also about a 20 percent chance that Mr. Obama will actually beat his 2008 margin in the popular vote. The smart money is on an outcome somewhere in the middle - as it has been all year. But if you can conceive of a Romney comeback - and you should account for that possibility - you should also allow for the chance that things could get really out of hand, and that Mr. Obama could win in a borderline landslide.

HEADLINE: Accustomed to Shooting the Moon, Volkswagen Group Holds Fire in Paris

BYLINE: STEPHEN WILLIAMS


HIGHLIGHT: The group's leadership sounded a cautionary note about the European economy on Wednesday, a sentiment reflected in the less-than-audacious cars brought on stage. 

 BODY:
PARIS -- Swapping the incendiary feel of last year's motor show in Frankfurt for a more delicate theme here -- in a phrase, ballerinas and bubbles -- the Volkswagen Group unofficially opened the press days on Wednesday night with a half-dozen premiers before a mass of media.
In his remarks, Martin Winterkorn, chief executive of VW, allowed for some skepticism amid the corporate ebullience. "These are turbulent times in Europe," Mr. Winterkorn said, referencing the sovereign debt turmoil in the euro zone. "How long will the crisis last? Where do things go from here? No simple answers." Ferdinand Piëch, meanwhile, was seen smiling, uncharacteristic of the VW Group chairman, who may still be on a high from purchasing the long-coveted Ducati earlier this year.
Mr. Winterkorn noted that plug-in hybrids rather than pure electrics would figure prominently in VW's product plans, sketching out vehicles that would offer about 30 miles on a charge, then switch to fossil-fuel power, in the manner of the Chevrolet Volt. "There is no alternative to the internal combustion engine over the long term," he said.
Here are some notable debuts from Wednesday, to be attended on Thursday by formal introductions at the show:
 The Audi A3 Sportback: A four-door hatchback to join its two-door equivalent. Neither is destined for sales in the United States; the American market is scheduled to receive an A3 sedan next spring. The S3, a variant of the two-door hatchback with 296 horsepower, is another piece of forbidden fruit for American buyers to be displayed at the show.
Bentley Continental GT3: The company says the GT3 marks a "return to racing" for the brand. The GT3, looking like a blown Audi TT, is nominally a concept, but it is scheduled to undergo testing in 2013 on the GT3 class circuit.
 Volkswagen Cross Caddy: No relation to the premium General Motors marque. An M.P.V. in the vein of the Fiat Panda and redesigned Ford Transit Connect, the Caddy mates what appears to be the front end of the Tiguan compact crossover with a big box in the back. Perhaps a descendent will contest the Taxi of Tomorrow wars in New York in some distant year, but the generation shown here will not be sold in the United States.
 Volkswagen MkVII Golf: Built on the group's new modular MQB platform, which arrives in Europe in November and is expected to reach the United States early next year. A GTI version, also being shown in Paris, closely follows the Golf's release. A diesel concept, the Golf BlueMotion, was shown here on Wednesday.
 The Unobtanium: A mildly refreshed Lamborghini Gallardo and special edition called the Edizione Tecnica were joined by a 1,200-horsepower Bugatti Veyron Gran Sport Vitesse. Fast company.
 Ducati: A pair of sexy sportbikes showcased for the Ducatisti the works of the Italian brand recently acquired by Audi.
Befitting the largest automaker on the continent, VW has a number of other introductions planned for Thursday from holdings like Seat, Skoda and Porsche.

HEADLINE: Obama Unveils New Ad as Early Voting Begins

BYLINE: JEREMY W. PETERS


HIGHLIGHT: Early voting begins Thursday in Iowa, the first of many battleground states that allow people to cast their ballots well before Election Day on Nov. 6. The Obama campaign said the new ad would also run Florida, Nevada and Colorado. 

 BODY:
At two minutes long, President Obama's new ad, "Table," is his longest direct pitch to voters in a television commercial this year. And the stakes could not be higher.
Early voting begins Thursday in Iowa, the first of many battleground states that allow people to cast their ballots well before Election Day on Nov. 6. The Obama campaign said the new ad would run not just in Iowa but in Florida, Colorado and Nevada as well - all of which allow early voting.
"During the last weeks of this campaign, there will be debates, speeches and more ads," the president says, as the ad begins, adding "But if I could sit down with you in your living room or around the kitchen table, here's what I would say."
In his script, the president sticks carefully to the story arc that he and his campaign have tried to lay out in their ads since the spring. He starts by reminding voters of the economic crisis he inherited and explains that progress - albeit too slow and incomplete, in his view - has been made.
"As a nation we are moving forward again. But we have much more to do to get folks back to work, and make the middle class secure again," he says before laying out a four-point plan that includes investing in manufacturing, cutting oil imports, training new math and science teachers and reducing the deficit.
Mitt Romney's plan, he says, would "double down on the same trickle down policies that led to the crisis in the first place."
The ad will have considerable money behind it. On Thursday the Obama campaign reserved more than $6 million in air time in the seven states where it will appear.

HEADLINE: Goldman to Pay $12 Million to Settle S.E.C. 'Pay to Play' Case

BYLINE: SUSANNE CRAIG and BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Goldman Sachs settled allegations on Thursday that one of its investment bankers curried favor with a public official to win lucrative government contracts in Massachusetts. 

 BODY:
 8:34 p.m. | Updated 
Goldman Sachs on Thursday settled federal allegations that one of its investment bankers curried favor with a public official to win lucrative government contracts in Massachusetts.
The Wall Street bank struck a $12 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to resolve the "pay to play" accusations without admitting or denying guilt.
The banker, Neil M. M. Morrison, who was a vice president at the firm, did not settle with the agency. His lawyer did not return a call seeking comment.
The S.E.C.'s order suggested that Mr. Morrison helped win government business for Goldman after promoting his ties to Timothy P. Cahill, then Massachusetts state treasurer, who was indicted on public corruption charges in April. Mr. Morrison, the agency said, in essence ran a campaign office for Mr. Cahill out of Goldman, acting as a fund-raiser and speechwriter during work hours and using the company's e-mail system and phones.
The campaigning, which spanned from 2008 to 2010, also led Mr. Morrison to indirectly contribute money to Mr. Cahill. Mr. Morrison, regulators say, gave $400 a friend who then wrote a check to the treasurer's campaign. During the same period, the S.E.C. says, Mr. Morrison began soliciting public contracts for Goldman, a conflict of interest that violates securities laws. Goldman ultimately snared 30 "prohibited" deals to help arrange Massachusetts bond offerings.
"The pay-to-play rules are clear: Municipal finance professionals that use their firm's resources to campaign on behalf of political candidates compromise themselves and the firms that employ them," said Robert Khuzami, director of enforcement at the commission.
In recent years the S.E.C. has stepped up its interest in pay-to-play cases, adding a specialized unit that examines corruption in government bond offerings and bringing actions against banks and public officials.
The S.E.C. faulted Goldman for failing to keep an eye on Mr. Morrison, a former senior staff member to Mr. Cahill while he was treasurer. Had Mr. Morrison's campaigning been disclosed, Goldman would have been prohibited from getting state business for two years.
In a statement, Goldman said it detected Mr. Morrison's activities, flagged regulators and then terminated him. "We accept responsibility for the consequences of his unauthorized actions under the terms of the settlements announced today and are pleased to resolve these investigations," the company said.
Goldman's penalty includes disgorgement of $7.5 million that it earned in fees from underwriting Massachusetts bonds. The company also settled with the state attorney general, which in a related action received more than $4 million from Goldman.
"We are pleased that this settlement brings back more than $4 million to the Commonwealth and serves to protect the integrity of the Commonwealth's bidding process," the Massachusetts attorney general, Martha Coakley, said in a statement. She cited "violations of state law that involved millions of taxpayer dollars."
For Mr. Morrison, the S.E.C. said, winning the contracts appeared to be personal. "We have discussed the Build American Bond transaction and how important it is to me," he wrote in an e-mail to one of Mr. Cahill's employees in reference to a deal that Goldman wanted to underwrite. "Having Goldman as the lead and getting 50% of the economics would be such a home run for me."
Mr. Morrison, the regulator said, also highlighted his political ties when courting Mr. Cahill's office. In one e-mail to a deputy treasurer, he wrote, "From my standpoint as an advisor/consultant/friend I am saying, PLEASE don't give these slots away willy-nilly," referring to the underwriting business. "This has to be a political decision."
At one point, according to the S.E.C. complaint, Mr. Morrison acknowledged the problem his lobbying posed, telling a campaign official in an e-mail that "I am staying in banking and don't want a story that says that I am helping Cahill, who is giving me banking business. If that came out, I'm sure I wouldn't get any more business."

HEADLINE: Not The Election They Were Expecting

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Guess who's enthusiastic. 

 BODY:
A brief, mostly subjective note: This really isn't looking like the election anyone expected. Obviously it's not the election Romney and the Republicans expected and wanted; but it's also looking very different from what Democrats expected.
What Romney & Co. expected was a simple rejection of Obama because of the weak economy. As Greg Sargent often reminds us, this isn't how it has played at all. On one side, voters tend to react to recent trends, not the absolute level -- and the economy has gotten better in some ways over the past year, though obviously not by a lot. On the other, people do remember the crisis of 2008, which they still blame on Bush, and remain willing to cut Obama substantial slack.
But as the polls move strongly in Obama's direction (yes, I know, it's all a liberal conspiracy that somehow even includes Fox News), it's clear at least to me that there's more going on.
The conventional wisdom -- which I too bought into -- was that Democrats were going to support Obama, but grudgingly and without much enthusiasm. There had been too many disappointments; the golden aura of 2008 was long gone. Meanwhile, Republicans would show their usual unity and discipline, and at best it would be Obama by a nose.
Instead, the Republicans appear to be in a shambles -- while the Democrats seem incredibly united, and increasingly, dare I say it, enthusiastic. (Mark Blumenthal sees this in the polls, but it's also just the impression you get.)
How did that happen? Partly it's because this has become such an ideological election -- much more so than 2008. The GOP has made it clear that it has a very different vision of what America should be than that of Democrats, and Democrats have rallied around their cause. Among other things, while we weren't looking, social issues became a source of Democratic strength, not weakness -- partly because the country has changed, partly because the Democrats have finally worked up the nerve to stand squarely for things like reproductive rights.
And let me add a speculation: I suspect that in the end Obamacare is turning out to be a big plus, even though it has always had ambivalent polling. The fact is that Obama can point to a big achievement that will survive if he is reelected, perish if he isn't; health insurance for 50 million or so Americans (30 million from the ACA, another 20 who would lose coverage if Romney/Ryan Medicaid cuts happen) is enough to cure people of the notion that it doesn't matter who wins.
All of this in turn has an implication that Republicans won't like -- assuming that Rasmussen doesn't have a special insight into the truth denied to all other pollsters, and that Obama does in fact win with a solid margin. The right is already set up to blame poor Mitt, claiming that he lost because he wasn't conservative enough. But that's not what we're seeing; it looks as if voters are rejecting the right's whole package, not just the messenger.
As I said, not the election anyone was expecting -- but a happy surprise for some, and a nasty shock for others.

HEADLINE: Standard Chartered's Next Worry: A $1 Billion Indonesian Loan

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS and MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The British bank, which agreed last month to pay the New York State's top banking regulator $340 million to settle money-laundering allegations, may be at risk of losing money on a $1 billion loan to an Indonesian mining company to make an investment that has since soured. 

 BODY:
Standard Chartered is facing another potential headache.
The British bank, which has just settled accusations of money-laundering with New York State's top banking regulator for $340 million, may be at risk of losing money on a $1 billion loan to an Indonesian mining company to make an investment that has since soured.
The exposure highlights Standard Chartered's reliance on often unstable emerging markets for the majority of its income. The bank, based in London, earned around 90 percent of its $2.86 billion net profit from developing countries like China and India in the first half of the year.
The bank's strategy is not risk free.
In January, Standard Chartered lent $1 billion to PT Borneo Lumbung Energi and Metal, a coal mining company based in Jakarta and owned by the Indonesian billionaire Samin Tan.
PT Borneo used the money to buy a 23.8 percent stake in Bumi, a company that owns Indonesian coal mining assets and is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Mr. Tan's interest in Bumi is part of a wider boardroom standoff between the British financier Nathaniel Rothschild, who partly owns the company, and the Bakrie family, which controls another stake in Bumi.
After calling for a shareholder meeting earlier this year to reshuffle Bumi's executives, Mr. Tan took over as chairman, while Mr. Rothschild became a nonindependent director.
After the management changes, Bumi announced on Monday that it was opening an investigation into financial irregularities at one of its divisions.
The accusations relate to financial accounting records at its subsidiary PT Bumi Resources. The irregularities are in connection to investments that were marked down to zero, according to a statement from Bumi.
The news caused the shares to drop 25 percent by the end of trading on Monday. Stock in the company has fallen 82 percent over the last year.
"We see this investigation as a positive development, although we feel it does have the potential to bring to light some gross and potentially criminal mismanagement of funds," Richard Knights, an analyst at Liberum Capital, wrote in a note to investors.
For Standard Chartered, the danger is that PT Borneo may have lost money on its Bumi stake as the shares have continued to plunge.
In a default situation, Standard Chartered may have the right to collect the Bumi shares, but the stock may end up being worth a lot less than it was when Mr. Tan bought the shares in January.
Still, Standard Chartered would be able to absorb any potential losses on the loan through its $33 billion of core capital. Standard Chartered may need those reserves, given that more of its corporate borrowers are having trouble staying current on their loans. In Standard Chartered's wholesale banking division, "gross nonperforming" loans totaled $4.06 billion at the end of June, up from $3.09 billion at the end of last year.
A spokesman for Standard Chartered declined to comment on the Indonesian loan.
Scott Merrillees, a director at PT Borneo and chief financial officer of Bumi, did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment on PT Borneo's borrowings.
The investigation into financial irregularities at a subsidiary, coupled with a global financial crisis that has depressed coal prices, has hurt Bumi's prospects. The company reported a $106 million loss in the first half of the year.
The tough economic conditions also have weighed on PT Borneo, which reported a net profit of $191 million in 2011, the latest figures available. The company had $105 million of cash flow from operations over the same period.
It is difficult to ascertain the size of Standard Chartered's exposure to PT Borneo, as the bank may have sold parts of the loan to other banks since January.
In April, Bloomberg News reported that First Gulf Bank of the United Arab Emirates had made a commitment to take $200 million of the $1 billion loan, citing a person familiar with the matter. A representative for First Gulf Bank declined to comment on Thursday.
PT Borneo's chief executive, Alexander Ramlie, has also raised the possibility of a bond issuance to raise money to lower its debt to Standard Chartered, but the company's Web site does not mention any such deals being completed.
In its most recent investor presentation in June, PT Borneo mentioned the $1 billion loan. But it merely said that the Bumi stake was 100 percent financed by a $1 billion "amortizing senior debt facility provided by Standard Chartered Bank."
If the London-based bank takes a hit on its PT Borneo loan, it would be another black mark against the firm, which until recently had a reputation as a careful lender.
Last week, Standard Chartered's group executive director for wholesale lending, Mike Rees, gave an investor presentation outlining strategic goals for corporate lending. That included "balancing the pursuit of growth with firm control of costs and risks."

HEADLINE: After Lehman, Callan Bids New York Farewell

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Erin Callan, the former chief financial officer of Lehman Brothers, is looking to sell her house in East Hampton, Long Island, for $3.95 million. 

 BODY:
Erin Callan, the former chief financial officer of Lehman Brothers, is headed for warmer climes.
She is looking to sell her East Hampton house for $3.95 million, according to a listing with the real estate broker Saunders. The gambrel-roof house, where Ms. Callan has lived with her husband, Anthony Montella, has been a de facto hideaway since the former executive all but disappeared from view after the financial crisis.
She now plans to live in Florida, where she recently bought a modest house.
"This is a big house to have when it's not a full-time house," Ms. Callan said in a phone interview with DealBook on Thursday. "We really wanted to think about down-sizing."
Ms. Callan, who had a stint at Credit Suisse after Lehman spiraled downward, has kept a low profile. Her wedding to Mr. Montella last November was an intimate affair. In the interview on Thursday, she declined to comment further on any future plans.
Ms. Callan has put the house on the market previously, in 2008 and again in 2009, but ultimately decided against selling, as Mr. Montella's children were in school in the area. Now, with Mr. Montella's daughter having left for college, his son plans to complete his last year of high school down in Florida, Ms. Callan said.
The current asking price is just above the $3.93 million paid by Ms. Callan and her then-husband in 2005.
The seven-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bathroom house, designed by Joseph Greenleaf Thorpe in 1912, has been "lovingly renovated to impeccable standards," according to the listing, and it includes "bay windows overlooking the rose garden and multiple French doors that open to covered open air dining porches and patios." In addition, the listing says that a "pre-existing barn/garage and landscape and moon lighting provide both depth and charm." (The listing was noticed earlier by the blog Curbed.)
An open house for real estate brokers is scheduled for Thursday afternoon, and a showing for prospective buyers is planned for Columbus Day weekend.

HEADLINE: Fewer Wealthy Americans Say They're Conservative Investors

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: A survey finds a shift in attitude toward conservative investments among rich Americans over the last two years. 

 BODY:
Fewer affluent Americans describe themselves as "conservative" investors, suggesting that their tolerance for risk may be rebounding after some tumultuous years.
Thirty percent describe themselves as leaning toward lower-risk investment and savings options (like "mutual funds, bonds, savings and money market accounts"), down from 36 percent a year ago and 50 percent two years ago, according to findings of the Merrill Lynch Affluent Insightssurvey.
The telephone survey, of 1,000 adults with assets of more than $250,000 to invest, was conducted in August by Braun Research on behalf of Merrill Lynch Wealth Management. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.
The shift in attitude toward risk is most clear among affluent investors younger than 50. For instance, about a quarter of investors age 18 to 34 describe themselves as conservative, compared with 52 percent two years ago. These are investors who had become quite wary of the stock market, because of its volatility in the economic downturn. And a quarter of those age 35 to 50 also describe themselves as conservative, compared with 45 percent two years ago.
What is your risk appetite these days? Are you willing to consider individual stocks or alternative investments, or are you sticking with index funds and savings accounts?

HEADLINE: Romney Charges That Obama Has Shrunk Military Commitment

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Speaking to local veterans at an American Legion Hall in Virginia, Mitt Romney attacked President Obama over cuts to defense spending. 

 BODY:
SPRINGFIELD, Va. - Speaking to local veterans at an American Legion Hall here, Mitt Romney offered a military-heavy version of his usual stump speech Thursday, attacking President Obama over cuts to defense spending and arguing for doing more to help the servicemen and women returning from war in need of psychological treatment.
"We have huge numbers of our men and women returning from conflict that are seeking counseling, psychological counseling, and can't find that counseling within our system," Mr. Romney said. "And, of course, record numbers of suicides. This is a crisis."
He said that as president, he would devote more financial resources to the military, including to help treat psychological issues like post-traumatic stress disorder. (Mr. Obama's wife, Michelle, has also made helping military families one of her main initiatives as first lady.)
"How in the world, as commander in chief, you could stand by as we shrink our military commitment financially is something that I don't understand, and I will reverse it," Mr. Romney said.
Mr. Romney also attacked Mr. Obama over proposed cuts to the military, calling the proposed sequestration legislation a "kind of a gun to your head opportunity, which is that Congress couldn't get the job done properly and the president couldn't lead them."
"The world is not a safe place," he said. "It is still a troubled and dangerous world. And the idea of cutting our military commitment by a trillion dollars over this decade is unthinkable and devastating. And when I become president of the United States, we will stop it. I will not cut our commitment to the military."
 The Obama campaign was quick to point out that Mr. Romney, while publicly offering a muscular pro-military stance, had offered slightly different words behind closed doors; in secretly videotaped remarks at a May fund-raiser, Mr. Romney referred to "47 percent" of voters who don't pay income taxes and are dependent on the government - a group that would most likely include veterans.
"Mitt Romney would like Virginians to forget how he disdainfully wrote off half of all Americans, including veterans and active-duty members, at a fund-raiser with high-dollar donors," Lis Smith, an Obama spokeswoman, said in an e-mail statement.
The Obama campaign pointed to remarks Mr. Romney made in South Carolina, when he seemed to float the idea of privatizing veterans' health care, though he never returned to the suggestion.
"His plan could result in deep cuts to the VA, and he has suggested privatizing veterans' health care," Ms. Smith said in her statement. "And because of his refusal to lead his party and demand that Congressional Republicans, including his running mate, drop their opposition to asking for a penny more from millionaires and billionaires, he's stood in the way of preventing devastating automatic defense cuts. These policies would be disastrous for America's military, military families, and veterans and we can't afford them."
Tying a strong economy to a strong military, Mr. Romney held up Russia - which he once called the country's "No. 1 geopolitical foe" - as an example of a country whose military had faltered under a shaky economy.
"The old Soviet Union tried for a while to maintain a Grade A, if you will, military, but they had a Grade B economy and they couldn't keep up," Mr. Romney said. "They finally had to - well, they collapsed. We have to have a strong economy."
He pointed out that while Russia's gross domestic product is growing at about 4 percent annually, the United States' gross domestic product last quarter was down to 1.3 percent per year - "about a quarter or a fifth the rate of Russia's," he noted.
But Mr. Romney also used his visit here to share some personal stories, albeit with a military twist. He talked about his experience Tuesday night in Toledo, when his private charter plane was getting ready to take off as an honor flight - full of veterans who had spent the day in Washington visiting the war memorials - was returning home. Mr. Romney delayed his flight in order to greet all of the veterans as they walked down the gangway of their plane, and one elderly, wheelchair-bound World War II veteran, he said, stood out in his mind.
"I said hello to him and shook his hand, and then he turned to go through this long alleyway that had been set up with flags and people who were there to recognize each of the veterans," Mr. Romney recalled. "But he stopped the person who was pushing him, pushing him in the wheelchair, and then he reached inside his coat and took out a flag. And waved it."
Mr. Romney also talked about how, as governor of Massachusetts, he was attending a ceremony to send his state's servicemen and women off to Iraq and Afghanistan when one of the soldiers raised his hand with an interesting proposal.
"He said, 'I have a young lady that I'm in love with, and we haven't been married and I'm going to go off to conflict - could you marry us?' " Mr. Romney said. "And I said, 'I don't see why not.' "
He added, jokingly, "I figured I was the governor, I could do whatever the heck I want to."
Mr. Romney said that he called the soldier and his girlfriend up to the front of the entire audience and married them right there.
"When I got back to the office, they said, 'You know there's this thing called a marriage license,' " he said, before adding, "We were able to take care of all those things and make sure it was legitimate."
Attendees said they appreciated hearing some of Mr. Romney's more personal anecdotes.
"He's much more compassionate than the press gives him credit for," said William McCarron, 76, a veteran of the Korean War. "When he talks about that honor flight and that marriage, that shows a compassionate side to him that's not getting emphasized."

HEADLINE: It Must Be the Polls

BYLINE: JULIET LAPIDOS


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama's leading in the polls. But the Romney campaign says the polls are all wrong. 

 BODY:
Nearly every national poll shows President Obama leading Mitt Romney. Gallup, Ipsos and Bloomberg all have the president up by six points. The RAND Corporation puts Mr. Obama up by seven and a half. Only Rasmussen has Mr. Romney up nationally among likely voters, by two points. Swing state surveys also give Mr. Obama the advantage, with new polls from The New York Times, CBS and Quinnipiac showing Mr. Obama up between 9 and 11 points in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
There's still more than a month until the election. Mr. Obama could lose. Mr. Romney could win. Hanging chads could leave the result up to the Supreme Court. But at the moment it's rational to conclude that Mr. Obama has a better chance of winning. Unless you're on the Romney campaign, or you're a right-wing pundit, in which case it's only natural-in a stages of grief sort of way-to conclude that the polls are all wrong.

On Tuesday Rich Beeson, the Romney campaign's political director, told reporters: "The public polls are what the public polls are. I kind of hope the Obama campaign is basing their campaign decisions on the public polls I have great faith in our data." A new Washington Post poll has Mr. Romney down by 8 points in Ohio, but Mr. Beeson said "We are, by any stretch, inside the margin of error in Ohio." Then on Wednesday Ed Gillespie, a senior advisor to the Romney campaign, said on Fox & Friends that the public polls "are not consistent with our polling." In which case, why not make the internal data public?
One common kvetch is that polling organizations (with the exception of Rasmussen) are over-sampling Democrats, and therefore don't accurately reflect the electorate. Hugh Hewitt, the radio host, yesterday tweeted "NYT/Quinnipiac is junk, with +9 Ds in Ohio and FLA samples and +11Ds in PA in sample." A Tuesday Fox News segment on how to read "the fine print on political polls" referred to a "continuing discussion" on whether recent surveys include "too many Democrats."
Pollsters counter that it would be unscientific to take an otherwise random sample, and then adjust it to achieve a target partisan split (50-50 Democrat-Republican, for instance). Swing voters, moreover, often identify with whichever party they favor at the moment (they'll call themselves Democrats if they're planning to vote for a Democrat). And as Chris Cillizza wrote recently in The Washington Post, "the simple truth is that Democrats have long enjoyed an edge on the party ID question...[E]ven in very good Republican years nationally (2004 and 2010 being obvious examples) more people still identify themselves as Democrats than Republicans."
The party ID issue gets technical, but the growing class of emotionally unstable pundits thinks there's a full-blown conspiracy afoot. On his radio show Tuesday, Rush Limbaugh said:
The purpose of the people right now, most of them doing these polls, they're trying to make news, not reflect it, they're advancing an agenda. They're all Democrats. They're all liberals. They just have different jobs. The polls are the replacement refs. They see certain things. They don't see other things. They don't call certain things, and other things go by. In this case, what they're trying to do is exactly what they've done in your case: frustrate you, make you pull your hair out, say, what the hell's happening to the country?
Sean Hannity also thinks the media-industrial complex is trying to dampen enthusiasm among Republicans: "The narrative the media would like to advance is, this is over, don't even bother paying attention, let's move on. That's not true by any stretch. These polls are so skewed, so phony, that we need to start paying attention to what's going on so that you won't be deflated."
The National Review recently published an unusually paranoid version of the poll-plot, with John McLaughlin, the Republican pollster, suggesting that the corruption goes to the very top. The president and his allies "want to convince" right-wing voters "falsely that Romney will lose to discourage them from voting. So they lobby the pollsters to weight their surveys to emulate the 2008 Democrat-heavy models. They are lobbying them now to affect early voting. The intended effect is to suppress Republican turnout through media polling bias."
Here's another conspiracy theory: If Mr. Obama goes on to win the election, Mr. Limbaugh et al. will recycle this narrative to sow doubt about the results.

HEADLINE: Buoyant Obama Courts Military Votes in Virginia

BYLINE: HELENE COOPER


HIGHLIGHT: Appearing just a few miles from the shipyard where Mitt Romney announced last month that Representative Paul D. Ryan would be his running mate, President Obama was fighting hard to make a dent in the Republican Party's traditional stranglehold on military votes. 

 BODY:
VIRGINIA BEACH - Appearing just a few miles from the shipyard where Mitt Romney announced last month that Representative Paul D. Ryan would be his running mate, President Obama on Thursday was fighting hard to make a dent in the Republican Party's traditional stranglehold on military votes. 
Virginia Beach and Norfolk are crucial to both campaigns' hopes of winning Virginia, where the race is widely viewed as one of the closest in the remaining swing states, and one that both camps desperately want to win.
"I still believe in you!" Mr. Obama yelled out to the sea of white, brown and black faces before him. "If you stand with me and work with me, we'll win the Tidewater again. We'll win Virginia again."
Just six days before the first debate, both candidates were in Virginia. Mr. Romney campaigned at a veterans' event in the Washington suburb of Springfield, where he, too, played to the military, promising to stop "devastating job losses" to veterans if he is elected. Mr. Romney also vowed to build a military that is "so strong that no one wants to test it."
The state has 13 electoral votes, but pathways to victory for either man get far steeper if Virginia is taken out of the column. This is especially the case for Mr. Romney, now that polls show him trailing Mr. Obama in Ohio and Florida.
And yet, with each day that moves the president closer to Election Day - and perhaps because of the recent polling in Ohio and Florida - he has appeared more relaxed, almost as if he is starting to enjoy himself. Surrounded by 7,000 screaming supporters - a crowd as diverse as the Tidewater region, with its naval base and countless veterans - Mr. Obama seemed determined to hang on to his small but steady lead in the state polls.
"How's it going, Virginia Beach?" the president shouted. He quickly attached himself to Senator Jim Webb, the Virginia Democrat and former Marine who had introduced him in a lengthy windup that trumpeted the president's support for military families. "I could not be prouder," Mr. Obama said, "of a man who has served his country his entire life, as a Marine, as a secretary of the Navy."
The crowd was eating it up, primed beforehand by the cast of colorful characters that make up Virginia Democratic politics. Representative Robert C. Scott, with his thick Southern accent, seemed a particular favorite. He got roars when he recounted how in 2008 CNN called Virginia for Mr. Obama for the first Democratic presidential victory here in 40 years, and then "two minutes later" called the election for Mr. Obama, a story meant to demonstrate how central winning the state has become to presidential aspirations. 
Of course, winning the people at this rally looked pretty easy. Attendees were so pumped up that there was almost a stampede when organizers handed out the Obama campaign's "Forward" signs.
As is becoming the norm before the president enters a rally, the crowd took over as Al Green's "Let's Stay Together" came on, belting out the lyrics like the president did at the Apollo Theater. By the time Mr. Webb came out to introduce the president, the din at Farm Bureau Live - an outdoor concert amphitheater - sounded like a Bruce Springsteen concert.
The Obama campaign also released a two-minute television ad on Thursday, in which Mr. Obama pitches an economic plan that he says will create one million manufacturing jobs, cut oil imports and increase education jobs.
Mr. Obama characterized the plan as a "new economic patriotism." Speaking in Virginia Beach, he said: "During campaign season, we always hear a lot about patriotism. Well, you know what? It's time for a little economic patriotism."
The ad will be shown in seven swing states: Virginia, Ohio, Florida, Nevada, Colorado, Iowa and New Hampshire. And with each poll that shows Mr. Obama ahead in Florida and Ohio and clinging to his narrow lead in Virginia, the president and his aides have seemed a little more buoyant - to the point that the campaign spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, cautioned that "if we need to pass out horse blinders to all of our staff, we will do that."

HEADLINE: Geithner Urges an Overhaul of Rules on Money Market Funds

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner on Thursday urged the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a special committee of senior regulators that he leads, to push ahead with rules aimed at strengthening America's money market funds. 

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner on Thursday urged the regulatory team that he leads to push ahead with new rules aimed at money market funds, which manage $2.6 trillion.
In a letter to the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a committee of senior regulators formed after the 2008 financial crisis, Mr. Geithner said the changes were "essential for financial stability."
The Securities and Exchange Commission, which is the primary regulator for money market funds, had proposed the main changes favored by Mr. Geithner in his letter.
But the commission dropped its attempt at a money market fund overhaul last month after it became clear that a majority of its commissioners would not vote for the measures. Large mutual fund companies fiercely opposed the changes, saying they were unnecessary and could harm a type of investment fund that was popular.
"You can be sure that the firms on the receiving end won't take this passively," said Jay G. Baris, a lawyer at Morrison & Foerster, which represents money market funds.
During the 2008 crisis, investors fled money market funds, which worsened the credit freeze that gripped the banking system. The funds received a big bailout from the Treasury and the Federal Reserve.
Before the Dodd-Frank Act was passed, efforts to change the money market fund industry probably would have died after the commission dropped them. But the Financial Stability Oversight Council, set up by Dodd-Frank, can choose to take over from the commission.
In his letter, Mr. Geithner laid out a number of ways the council, which meets Friday, can act.
He urged it to gather public comments on a range of changes and then make a final overhaul recommendation to the S.E.C. The commission would be required to adopt those changes, or explain why it did not. Mr. Geithner said the council's staff was already working on recommendations and said he hoped they would be considered at the council's November meeting.
The recommendations would include two changes supported by the commission. One would require money market funds to hold loss buffers. The other would end the money market funds' practice of valuing investors' shares at $1 even when the funds' assets should reflect a value slightly less than $1.
Mr. Geithner said in his letter that, while the S.E.C. is best positioned to regulate money market funds, the Financial Stability Oversight Council could proceed without waiting for the commission. The council, he wrote, could designate certain money market fund entities as systemically important and subject them to regulation by the Federal Reserve, which could then impose an overhaul.
Mr. Baris, the lawyer, said that designating a money market fund as systemically important could make it hard for it to stay in business. "Who would want to invest in a fund that has been designated by the federal government in this manner?" Mr. Baris said.
"It will drive investors away." Mr. Baris said he believed that Mr. Geithner might face resistance on the council if any new rules were aimed at specific money market funds.
In addition, the council could designate money market fund activities as critical to the working of the financial system's plumbing. That would allow regulators to impose heightened risk management standards on the funds.
Mr. Geithner wrote that without the changes, "our financial system will remain vulnerable to runs and instability."
If the council acts, the mutual fund industry will almost certainly fight back. The industry's lawyers will probably contest the council's interpretation of Dodd-Frank and perhaps even the council's authority to act.

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Reach

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
 In Today's Times: 
Democrats' old deep-pocketed friends are beginning to pour money into Democratic "super PACs" like the groups Republican operatives have used to build their outsized influence in this election. Nicholas Confessore reports that the wealthy liberals who supported Democrats' efforts in 2004 remain on the sidelines, while Democrats draw from old friends like trial lawyers, unions and Hollywood. The financing comes at a crucial time for President Obama, as conservative groups prepare a barrage of attack ads.

In an aggressive effort to clean up the fallout from his "47 percent" comments, Mitt Romney isreaching out to middle-class and working-class voters with an ad aimed at reassuring them that he cares about their plight. Ashley Parker observes that the ad, which comes nine days after the remarks surfaced, reflected Mr. Romney's gamble that the election will be decided in the closing weeks and that Democrats' attacks will not hurt him much.
The president and Mr. Romneyboth stopped in Ohio on Wednesday before the state starts early voting next Tuesday. Helene Cooper writes that Mr. Obama is trying to "gallop ahead" to keep early voters out of Mr. Romney's reach, but Mr. Romney is campaigning hard in Ohio, too. Mr. Obama will visit Virginia on Thursday and Nevada on Sunday, before he begins two days of debate preparations in Denver.
Republicans in battleground states are stepping up their efforts to turn Jewish voters who are wavering on Obama into Romney supporters. Lizette Alvarez writes that Republicans hope "to erode Mr. Obama's deep-seated popularity in the Jewish community," but Democrats call that "wishful thinking."
 Around the Web: 
The New Yorker explores how Mormonism and private equity shaped Mr. Romney's candidacy.
 Happening in Washington: 
Economic reports expected Thursday include second-quarter gross domestic product, durable goods for August, and weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. Weekly mortgage rates and pending home sales index for August will be out at 10.
At 9, Prime Minister Mario Monti of Italy will discuss "challenges for the euro and the future of European integration" on a conference call with the Council on Foreign Relations.

HEADLINE: Hackers May Have Had Help With Attacks on U.S. Banks, Researchers Say

BYLINE: NICOLE PERLROTH


HIGHLIGHT: The hackers claiming responsibility for cyberattacks on American banks over the past week must have had substantial help to disrupt and take down major banking sites, security researchers say. 

 BODY:
 The hackers claiming responsibility for cyberattacks on American banks over the past week must have had substantial help to disrupt and take down major banking sites, security researchers say.
Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, U.S. Bancorp, Wells Fargo and PNC all experienced disruptions and delays on their banking sites over the past week because of denial of service or DDoS attacks, in which hackers clog a Web site with data requests until it slows or collapses under the load.
A hacker group, which calls itself the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters, took credit for the attacks in online posts. They enlisted volunteers for the attacks with messages on various sites. On one blog, they called on volunteers to visit two Web addresses that would cause their computers to instantly start flooding targets - including the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and Bank of America - with hundreds of data requests each second. This week, hackers asked volunteers to attack banks according to a defined timetable: Wells Fargo on Tuesday, U.S. Bancorp on Wednesday and PNC on Thursday.
Representatives for Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank and PNC all confirmed Wednesday that their Web sites had experienced disruptions because of unexpected volumes of traffic. Both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq saw a slowdown, but no serious disruption, on their Web sites.
Security researchers say the attack methods being peddled by hackers - the custom-built Web sites - were too basic to have generated the disruptions.
"The number of users you need to break those targets is very high," said Jaime Blasco, a security researcher at AlienVault who has been investigating the attacks. "They must have had help from other sources."
Those additional sources, Mr. Blasco said, would have to be a well-resourced group, like a nation state, or botnets - networks of infected zombie computers that do the bidding of cybercriminals. Botnets can be rented via black market schemes that are common in the Internet underground, or loaned out by cybercriminals or governments.
Last week, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said in an interview that he believed the attacks on the banks were being sponsored by Iran's government.
Mr. Blasco said security researchers had noticed an increase in the use of botnets out of Iran recently. But he said he had not been able to track the origin of the attack to Iran. Attacks can be routed through various I.P. addresses to mask their true origin, making attribution "nearly impossible," Mr. Blasco said.
In the hackers' post, they said their attacks were not sponsored by Iran, and said they "strongly reject the American officials' insidious attempts to deceive public opinion."
They said they conducted the attacks in retaliation for a video, made by amateur filmmakers in the United States, that mocks the Prophet Muhammad.
"Insult to the prophet is not acceptable, especially when it is the last prophet Muhammad," the hackers said in their post.
They pledged to continue to attack American banking sites and targets in other countries, including France, Israel and the United Kingdom, until the video was pulled offline.

HEADLINE: Romney Adds Note of Inevitability to Stump Speech

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: To hear Mitt Romney tell it, a Romney administration is not a question of if, but when. 

 BODY:
To hear Mitt Romney tell it, a Romney administration is not a question of if, but when.
Speaking to a group of veterans in Springfield, Va., Thursday morning, Mr. Romney made a point of stressing that come Nov. 6, he expects to be the president-elect.
"And if I become president - no, when I become president of the United States - we're going to do what we have to do," he told the group, pausing for effect.
In the face of public polls that show President Obama leading Mr. Romney in a number of crucial battle ground states, Mr. Romney has recently added a deliberate line to his stump speech - a when-not-if quip - that seems designed not only to pump up the crowd, but perhaps also to reassure weary Republicans and staff members that he has what it takes to wrest the Oval Office from Mr. Obama on Election Day.
Addressing a group of wealthy donors at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Los Angeles last weekend, Mr. Romney tried to sound a confident note.
"I'm asked from time to time, 'What are going to do if you get to become president?' " he said, gearing up for his big applause line. "And the answer is, 'Well first of all, I'm going be president.' That's No. 1."
Making his way through Ohio Wednesday on a modified day-and-a-half long bus tour, Mr. Romney made sure to incorporate the line at every stop.
At a morning rally in Westerville, Ohio: "I can commit to you this: With every ounce of my energy, when I'm president of the United States," Mr. Romney began, before repeating the phrase again, for added emphasis, "When I am president of the United States, I will strengthen America."
Before a business round-table discussion in Bedford Heights, Ohio, encouraging the small business owners to give him suggestions: "So if there's some impediments to that growth, some challenges you think we face, if you'll let me know what those things are, because I'm going to be the next president of the United States and I want to know."
And at an evening rally in Toledo, Ohio: "If instead I - no, instead when I become president - we're going to get this economy growing again, we're going to do the things that ignite this economy."
The cheerily confident assertion that Mr. Romney believes he will be the next president has become a fail-safe applause line for him - akin to repealing the president's health care plan, or making the nation energy independent - and a way for Mr. Romney to project optimism at the daunting path he faces to 270 electoral votes.
The line is a big hit with voters.
Don Byers, 80, a Korean and Vietnam veteran, recalled that when Mr. Romney reassured the audience Thursday morning that he was going to be president, "the crowd roared."
So what did his wife, Joyce Byers, 80, think?
"Hope," she said emphatically. "We hope that he does, hope that he makes it."

HEADLINE: Growth of Suburban D.C. Is Felt Politically in Maryland

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: An army of government workers and government contractors live in suburban Maryland and favor Democrats by significant margins. 

 BODY:
 We continue our Presidential Geography series, a one-by-one examination of the peculiarities that drive the politics in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Here is a look at Maryland, the Old Line State. FiveThirtyEight spoke with Donald F. Kettl, the dean of the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland; and Theodore F. Sheckels, a professor of communications and English at Randolph-Macon College in Ashland, Va. 
Political contests at the state and national level tend to be settled in the suburbs. Republicans carry the countryside, Democrats win by large margins in big cities, and both parties battle to win the votes of those living in between.
That is an oversimplification, of course, but it's a useful rule of thumb. In every presidential election since 1980, the candidate who won the suburban vote also won the national popular vote, according to exit polls.
Suburbia's informal role as the last arbiter of elections also explains why Maryland is among the most Democratic-leaning states. According to the current FiveThirtyEight projection, President Obama will carry Maryland by 23 percentage points; Mitt Romney is projected to win just 39 percent. 
Maryland's urban and rural areas follow the normal partisan pattern: Baltimore is overwhelmingly Democratic, while the more rural parts of the state -- the Eastern Shore and western Maryland -- tend to vote Republican.
But the pattern falls apart in Maryland's suburbs, particularly those in Montgomery County and Prince George's County. For several reasons, a large chunk of suburban Maryland behaves more like a city politically, favoring Democrats by significant margins.
Not all suburbs are equally competitive. Generally, suburbs in the Northeast have been less friendly to the Republican Party than those in the Deep South or Great Plains ever since cultural conservatism gained sway in the party. That dynamic accounts for much of suburban Maryland's partisan lean (although, Maryland's northern border doubles as the Mason-Dixon line).
Baltimore and Baltimore County -- which report election returns separately -- vote like a typical city and suburban county in the Northeast; in 2008, Mr. Obama won 87 percent of the vote in Baltimore and 57 percent in Baltimore County.
But the same is not true for Maryland's share of suburban Washington. Mr. Obama won 89 percent in Prince George's County and 72 percent in Montgomery County, both of which have been made more Democratic-leaning, at least partly, because the federal government is right next door. Both counties have a large population of government workers and government contractors, and both counties are more diverse than typical suburbia. 
Maryland has the highest share of black residents of any state outside the South, and the fourth-highest proportion overall, 29 percent. That alone would make the state Democratic. But Maryland's African-American community is more affluent and more suburban than in most other states (perhaps only the Atlanta region is comparable). The federal government, as Mr. Kettl explained: "has long put a very high priority on ensuring broad and diverse hiring. For a very long time, the government was a place where minority workers could get fair treatment in employment. That, in turn, helped create strong and stable middle-class black communities."
As a result, Prince George's County, where the majority of the population is black, is highly educated and affluent; it is the 69th wealthiest county in the country, ranked by household median income. That wealth, as well as the wealth of the surrounding suburbs in Montgomery and Howard Counties, has been partly fueled by federal dollars.
And that economic relationship is a hurdle for Republicans.
The Washington suburbs have expanded as the federal bureaucracy has grown. An army of government workers, as well as contractors directly and indirectly employed by the government, live in suburban Maryland. The Republican Party's message is ill-suited to win their votes. The "evils of big government" narrative is not an effective pitch to a voter who works for big government.
This dynamic is clearly evident in Montgomery County, which is home to a raft of federal agencies, that have helped spawn booming support industries, like defense, biotechnology, technology and health care. The bustling economy has, in turn, attracted immigration. Montgomery is now a majority minority county with large black, Asian and Hispanic populations.
 The Bellwether: Howard County 
The spread of suburban Washington has passed through Montgomery County and reached Howard County, beginning a transformation from rural and Republican to suburban and Democratic.
At this point in its transition, it is a slightly Republican-leaning bellwether. It has been a couple percentage points to the right of the state in the last two presidential elections. But because the suburbs have continued to expand since 2008, Howard County may be an even more accurate bellwether in this year's race.
 The Bottom Line 
If the Washington metropolitan area continues to expand, Maryland will only get more Democratic. The suburban sprawl has already reached previously rural counties like Howard, Charles and Frederick, Mr. Sheckels said, and Democratic constituencies have been encroaching on Maryland's Republican territory: western Maryland, Southern Maryland and the Eastern Shore. 
For example, historically Republican-leaning Anne Arundel County went just barely to Senator John McCain in 2008, despite the large military presence around Annapolis. 
Living next to the federal government has had a profound effect on the state. Eleven of Maryland's 24 counties are in the top 100 most affluent counties by median income. And the state overall has the highest household median income in the country, according to the Census Bureau.
But talk of austerity has increased in Washington, and if it arrives, the region will likely feel the impact economically. In turn, suburban expansion could slow.
The political preferences of Maryland's ethnically diverse suburbs may also be a harbinger of things to come in other states. Suburban communities across the country became significantly more diverse throughout the 2000s, and it has started to show. Mr. Obama's share of the suburban vote was the highest of any Democrat since 1980.
Mr. Obama is a 100 percent favorite to carry Maryland, according to the current FiveThirtyEight forecast, and the presidential race is unlikely to receive much attention there.
Instead, same-sex marriage is likely to be a major focus of the fall campaign. Opponents of Maryland's Civil Marriage Protection Act, which allows same-sex couples to obtain a civil marriage license, gathered enough signatures to put Question 6 on the ballot. The referendum asks Maryland residents to vote for or against the law. If it passes, and polling shows that it may, the Maryland electorate would be the first to endorse same-sex marriage at the ballot box.

HEADLINE: Popcorn in Hand, Mayor Rides Ferry to Staten Island

BYLINE: MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: The voyage offered a chance for Michael R. Bloomberg to rub his Paul Stuart-clad shoulders with the public, although, surrounded as he was by bodyguards and reporters, only one citizen had the courage to approach. 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg famously travels by helicopter and private jet, with an occasional foray into the subway. Most of the time, he is chauffeured around town behind the tinted windows of his city-issued S.U.V.
So it came as a bit of a surprise on Thursday when the mayor, heading to a news conference on Staten Island, hopped aboard the borough's famous ferry for the half-hour ride across New York's harbor. The rumpled City Hall press corps, startled by the impromptu appearance, was invited to come along. 
Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire, appeared comfortable on the big orange boat, whose shabby booths and fried-food concessions are patronized by thousands of commuters and tourists each day. He purchased a $2 jumbo bag of popcorn from the onboard kiosk shortly after boarding, paying in cash.
Asked if he'd like a soda to go with the snack, Mr. Bloomberg, who has introduced regulations on sugary drinks, said it would have to be "a diet one, so I don't have to worry about size."
The mayor, a leather-bound iPad under his arm, settled in for the ride by the windows near the boat's prow. He rarely entertains casual questions from the news media, and he kept his answers brief. 
How was his Yom Kippur fast? "I survived." 
What accounts for the rise in city tourism? "A great mayor."
Only one semi-gaffe occurred, when the conversation turned to the subway system, which Mr. Bloomberg occasionally rides.
"The only time it's really crowded is when you go to a Yankees game," the mayor said, of the subway. "The trick is, you got to leave early."
Several reporters pointed out that, during rush hour on weekdays, the trains can get a bit packed.
"Amazing, it's crowded when everybody wants to use it," Mr. Bloomberg replied, with a hint of sarcasm. 
As the ferry glided across the harbor, a Police Department escort boat in its wake, the mayor reminisced a bit about his bachelor days, when the ferry was one of his preferred spots for a date.
"You'd get a six-pack of beer, a pizza, and you'd sit outside; it was really romantic," Mr. Bloomberg recalled, noting that he used to pay a nickel for the ride, which is now free. "If you stayed on the ferry, you could go back on the same fare."
The ride also offered a chance for the mayor to rub his Paul Stuart-clad shoulders with the public, although, surrounded as he was by bodyguards and reporters, only one private citizen had the courage to approach. 
"Excuse me, Mr. Bloomberg, could you do something about freezing the subway fare?" asked Gerveline Dorléant, 51, of Staten Island, a few minutes after the mayor settled in.
Mr. Bloomberg shook his head. "It's a state agency," he explained, referring to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the subway. He pointed at the reporters who were hastily transcribing his words: "But these people would be happy to help you."
Later, Ms. Dorléant, who said she is unemployed at the moment, said she was not quite satisfied with the mayor's reply, although, she added, Mr. Bloomberg "was nice" about the whole thing. A longtime Staten Island resident, she said she was surprised to see the mayor among the ferry-going hoi polloi.
"I didn't recognize him at first, because he looked so dapper and fresh!" she said.

HEADLINE: The 47 Percent Here? Far Fewer Escape City's Income Tax

BYLINE: SAM ROBERTS and PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: A city analysis found that for 2010, about one-third of the New York households that filed tax returns paid nothing in city income tax. 

 BODY:
 In New York City, the "47 percent" is only 35 percent.
 That's the share of city tax filers who, according to an analysis by the city's Independent Budget Office released Thursday, paid no city income tax in 2010 - as opposed to the 47 percent of Americans that Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, said depend on government handouts, pay no federal income taxes and will vote for President Obama.
 Most of the 1.3 million New York households that filed returns but paid no tax - 67 percent of them - reported income below the threshold for owing city income tax. Another 28 percent of them would have owed taxes if they had not received tax credits. The remaining 5 percent reported negative income as a result of investment or business losses (their income, before losses, averaged $43,100). 
Over all, the 35 percent of filers who did not pay city income tax reported an average income of $9,108.
 Filers who owed taxes reported average income of about $100,000 (and paid an average of $2,925 in city tax).
 Among those who did not pay, fully half said they had earned wages from full or part-time jobs, but not enough to make them liable for income tax.
 "A significant share of these people are in the labor force and working, but they are not paying taxes because even though they are working, they didn't have a lot of income," said George Sweeting, deputy director of the Independent Budget Office.

HEADLINE: The Arab Spring Still Blooms

BYLINE: By MONCEF MARZOUKI. 
Moncef Marzouki is Tunisia's president.

 BODY:
THE violent demonstrations that have spread across the Muslim world in recent weeks have convinced many in the United States and Europe that the Arab revolutions that began in late 2010 are now over and that the democratic project has failed. Bitterness and a sense of impending catastrophe are replacing the enthusiasm that followed the toppling of dictators in Tunisia and Egypt last year.
Now there is ominous talk of an ''Islamist Fall'' and ''Salafi Winter'' after a supposedly failed Arab Spring. To these skeptics, religion is the driving force in Arab politics, and hateful anti-Western slogans and the killing of America's ambassador to Libya, J. Christopher Stevens, are evidence of a ''clash of civilizations'' between Islam and the West. 
While these fears are understandable, such alarmism is misplaced. The Arab revolutions have not turned anti-Western. Nor are they pro-Western. They are simply not about the West. They remain fundamentally about social justice and democracy -- not about religion or establishing Shariah law.
The democratization of Tunisia, Egypt and other countries has allowed a number of extremist free riders into the political system. But it has also definitively refuted the myth that democracy and Islam are incompatible. Islamists are political actors like any others: they are no more pure, more united or more immune from criticism than anyone else.
Islamist parties are now free to take part in political debates and to win seats in legislatures and governments. However, these political changes have also rendered the divisions among Islamists more apparent than ever before.
Islamists span a wide ideological and political spectrum. Yet many observers still seem to believe that extremist Salafi groups represent a majority. They are wrong. Radical Salafis who advocate violence and Shariah constitute a very small minority in Tunisia -- and even in Egypt they are vastly outnumbered by more moderate Islamists. They are a minority within a minority, and extremely unpopular among both religious and secular Tunisians. They do not speak for all Tunisians, Arabs or Muslims.
The goal of these violent extremists is not political participation; it is to create chaos. We should not forget that before attacking American symbols, these extremists had degraded Tunisian symbols, like the flag and national anthem.
Despite their small numbers, the danger they pose cannot be dismissed. Tunisia's economy depends on the millions of foreign tourists who visit each year. If Salafi extremists were to attack just two or three foreigners in Tunisia, it would destroy our tourism industry and ruin our country's peaceful reputation. As a democratic government, we support the Salafis' freedom of expression, but advocating violence is a red line. Those who cross it will be arrested.
The strength and importance of extremist groups have been unduly amplified by the news media. Images of angry Muslim mobs, like the one featured on a recent cover of Newsweek magazine, once again revived the old Orientalist trope of a backward and hysterical Muslim world, unable to engage in civilized and rational debate or undertake peaceful negotiations -- in other words, incapable of conducting political affairs.
However, that image is a distorted fantasy; it does not represent any sociological or political reality. Arguing that the groups who have recently staged violent demonstrations represent the entire Arab population is as absurd as claiming that white supremacist groups represent the American people or that the Norwegian right-wing mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik is representative of Europeans.
The demonstrations that took place against the anti-Islamic video ''Innocence of Muslims'' involved small numbers of extremists; there were only about 3,000 in Tunisia. Counterprotests denouncing the violence also took place in Benghazi, Libya, after the killing of Ambassador Stevens; numerous Muslim leaders have implored believers not to respond to provocations; and no demonstration occurred last Friday, after a French newspaper published demeaning caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad.
The attempts by journalists and anti-Islamic filmmakers to stage a sequel to the Danish cartoon controversy of 2006 are in vain. Most Tunisians firmly condemn the violence that took place against the United States embassies, even if they were personally offended by anti-Islamic provocations emanating from the United States and Europe.
They are frustrated by how this unnecessary uproar has made the struggle for what matters most to them more arduous: building new democratic institutions, creating jobs and halting the exodus of Tunisian boat people seeking a better life in Europe.
These are difficult tasks for any country, and the challenge is even greater for new democracies in the post-revolutionary Arab world. We are in a race against poverty. At this crucial moment, the West must not abandon us. It must continue to aid Tunisia in strengthening democracy and the rule of law, securing our borders to stop arms from reaching extremists, and creating economic opportunities that give our citizens hope.

HEADLINE: New Arena Rivals the Garden's Glow

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
WHEN Jay-Z takes the stage on Friday night at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, it will be more than the triumphant homecoming of a native son, performing eight sold-out nights in a sparkling new arena near the housing project where he grew up. It is also the official opening of an 18,000-seat performance space that will fundamentally transform the music scene in New York City.
The arena's opening is being closely watched in the music business, and perhaps nowhere more so than in Manhattan, at Madison Square Garden, which for generations has been the only game in town for arena acts and has earned a reputation as a career-defining concert hall.
Though Garden officials and Barclays executives are both careful to say that the arenas are not in direct competition for big-name bands, concert promoters and booking agents say such competition is inevitable, and Barclays has already positioned itself as an alternative, booking several marquee performers who have played the Garden in the past. 
''Barclay's is going to say, 'Hey, if you want to play New York City, you have two choices,' '' said Jim Glancy, a partner in the Bowery Presents, a New York concert promoter.
With three professional sports teams and St. John's basketball, the Garden's calendar has long been extremely crowded, making it a headache for tour planners seeking an open night in the city; its calendar has been even tighter over the last two years as it has undergone renovations.
And while the Garden is considered a prestigious place to play -- a high-profile arena in the media capital of North America -- it is not always a lucrative one. The costs of doing a show there are high and profit margins low, promoters say. What's more, it is hard to get two nights in a row there, even if the band or performer is capable of selling out two dates.
''I consider it a godsend Barclays arena is there,'' said Randy Phillips, the chief executive of AEG Live, one of the largest promoters in the country. ''Prior to this we were really kind of held hostage on a tour to the availability of Madison Square Garden.''
The new $1 billion arena rises at the intersection of Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues like a modern sculpture, evoking a crashed alien spacecraft with its rusted-steel-and-glass facade and swooping lines. Inside, it is a sleek study in gray and black broken only by bright digital banners, with steeply raked rows of black seats that descend from the street level into the arena's bowl. With clear sightlines and acoustic panels over hard surfaces to minimize reverb and noise, the space seems intimate yet open. For some, it is a symbol of Brooklyn's cultural and economic renaissance, a sign the borough has come back from the long slide that started when the Dodgers left in 1957. But it is also a symbol of the borough's growing stature as center for the arts.
Several big acts have added a night in Brooklyn in addition to planned dates at the Garden, among them Neil Young and Crazy Horse, the Who, Lady Gaga, Justin Bieber and Leonard Cohen. Others who have played the Garden in the past are foregoing it altogether and playing Barclays instead, among them Bob Dylan, Green Day, John Legend, Rihanna and Rush.
Brett Yormark, the chief executive of the Brooklyn Nets, who will call the arena home, and of Barclays Center, said he did not see it in competition with the Garden. He said there was a demand in New York City for far more arena concerts than the Garden could accommodate.
''We knew there was a void, and a new venue in Brooklyn could be supported by a lot of events that weren't coming here,'' he said. ''I don't look at this as cannibalization in any way. I look at it as truly additive to the market.''
Melissa Ormond, the president of Madison Square Garden Entertainment, acknowledged that the Garden's tight calendar has meant it has few dates to offer artists, and that Barclays has benefited, as have the suburban arenas. But she said in an e-mail statement: ''We always respect any competition, but the Garden will always be the Garden. We've been privileged to be at the center of New York City for more than 130 years, with 400 annual events, the most of any arena in the country. It's the pinnacle of an artist's career to play Madison Square Garden.''
Historically the market for concerts has expanded every time a new arena has been built in the region, a testament to the enormous population within commuting distance of Manhattan. The arrival of the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y; the arena now called the Izod Center in East Rutherford, N.J.; and the Prudential Center in Newark did not damage Madison Square Garden's profits.
But the new arena is the first challenge to the Garden's dominance, and it underlines a growing rivalry between Brooklyn and Manhattan as cultural centers, not to mention the competition between the Knicks and the Nets. ''The big question is: Will Barclays expand the marketplace?'' said John Scher, a veteran New York City promoter.
Mr. Scher said the Garden would remain a steppingstone for young artists who need the prestige of a show there to further their careers, even if it means earning less. One such client of his is Jason Mraz, who is playing his first show there on Dec. 11.
''Not unlike the Yankees, you can't trade that tradition and that sense of accomplishment for something that's newer,'' Mr. Scher said. ''No one can compete on that level with the Garden. But you can compete on cost and efficiency.''
Not surprisingly, Barclays has undercut the Garden's prices for performers, which are among the highest in the industry. Several promoters said a band stands to earn between $150,000 and $250,000 more for a sold-out show at Barclays than for one at the Garden. For concertgoers that means ticket prices for some shows will be lower at Barclays as well: Neil Young fans can buy a seat for $58 at Barclays, versus $63 at the Garden, according to Ticketmaster. Yet tickets to other big shows -- the Who and Justin Bieber for instance -- are roughly the same price at both places.
If a price war ever develops with the Garden, owned by the publicly traded Madison Square Garden Company, the new arena has deep pockets. Though Jay-Z has a tiny stake in the Nets and the arena, the principal partners behind the new building are the developer Bruce C. Ratner and the Russian billionaire Mikhail D. Prokhorov.
Mr. Phillips, the chief executive of AEG Live, said the lack of competition in the city's market had turned the Garden into an exorbitantly expensive space many performers are grudgingly compelled to play. ''You're lucky to break even,'' he said. ''Now we have a building where we can play and actually make money and the press will come. That's big for us. That's going to make the Garden more honest.''
Still, Marsha Vlasic, the booking agent for Neil Young and several other top-tier performers, said the Garden retains an advantage. She said Mr. Young and his band only decided to play a second concert at Barclays because two dates could not be found at Madison Square Garden.
Some bands, however, are betting that playing both arenas is a winning strategy, promoters and agents said. The thinking is that Barclays can tap Brooklyn's 2.6 million residents and, because the arena sits at the junction of several subway lines and a Long Island Rail Road station, it can draw fans from Long Island and Staten Island, while Madison Square Garden tends to pull people from Manhattan, New Jersey and the northern suburbs, promoters said.
Barclays is likely to develop its own personality as well, as promoters and arena officials discover what sort of acts resonate there. Jay-Z's run of eight shows and involvement may cement it as a popular hip-hop stage. It also could become a forum for emerging acts that cannot yet command high ticket prices, older artists who want a larger profit margin or performers with ties to Brooklyn's vibrant indie-rock scene.
Mr. Glancy said it will take time for the positions of the arenas to become defined. Barclays will enjoy a honeymoon period, as bands and their promoters give it a try, and the Garden's renovations will not be completed until late next year. ''The true test is years away,'' Mr. Glancy said.

HEADLINE: In Virginia, Nominees Reach Out To Military

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and ASHLEY PARKER; Helene Cooper reported from Virginia Beach, and Ashley Parker from Springfield, Va.

 BODY:
VIRGINIA BEACH -- In case anyone is wondering, Virginia is up for grabs this election. So, with 39 days to go, President Obama and Mitt Romney dueled in the commonwealth on Thursday, both trying to lock up support from voters with ties to the military.
''I still believe in you!'' President Obama yelled out at the sea of white, brown and black faces gathered before him at Farm Bureau Live, an outdoor amphitheater in this naval town. ''If you stand with me and work with me, we'll win the Tidewater again. We'll win Virginia again.'' 
Appearing just a few miles from the shipyard where his Republican rival, Mitt Romney, last month named Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin as his running mate, Mr. Obama was fighting hard to loosen the Republican Party's traditional grip on military votes. Virginia Beach and Norfolk are crucial to both campaigns' hopes of winning this state in what is now widely viewed as one of the closest races in the remaining swing states.
To that end, just six days before the first debate, both candidates made another of their frequent visits to Virginia. Mr. Romney campaigned at a veterans event in the Washington suburb of Springfield, where he promised to stop ''devastating job losses'' among veterans if he is elected. He also proposed more help for service members returning from war in need of psychological treatment.
''We have huge numbers of our men and women returning from conflict that are seeking counseling, psychological counseling, and can't find that counseling within our system,'' Mr. Romney said. He also vowed to build an American military ''so strong that no one wants to test it.''
Virginia has 13 electoral votes, but pathways to victory for either man, particularly Mr. Romney, get steeper if the state is taken out of their column.
With each day that moves him closer to Nov. 6, and perhaps because of recent polling that shows him ahead in Ohio and Florida, the president has appeared more relaxed, almost as if he is starting to enjoy himself. Surrounded by 7,000 screaming supporters -- a crowd as diverse as the Tidewater region, with its naval base and countless veterans, has become -- Mr. Obama seemed determined to hang on to his small but steady lead in Virginia polls.
''How's it going, Virginia Beach?'' Mr. Obama shouted into the microphone. He quickly attached himself to Senator Jim Webb, the retired Marine who had introduced him in a lengthy windup that trumpeted the president's support for military families. ''I could not be prouder of a man who has served his country his entire life, as a Marine, as a secretary of the Navy,'' the president said of Mr. Webb, who is not seeking re-election.
The crowd ate it up, especially as they were primed beforehand by the cast of colorful characters that make up Virginia Democratic politics. Representative Robert C. Scott, sporting an accent straight out of ''Dukes of Hazzard,'' seemed a particular favorite. He drew roars when he recounted how in 2008, CNN called Virginia for Obama for the first Democratic presidential win here in 40 years, and then, ''two minutes later,'' called the election for Mr. Obama. It was a story meant to demonstrate how central winning the state has become to American presidential aspirations.
As is now becoming the norm before the president comes on stage, when Al Green's ''Let's Stay Together'' -- part of the campaign playlist -- came on, the crowd took over, belting it out the way the president did at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. By the time Mr. Webb came out to introduce the president, the din sounded like a Bruce Springsteen concert.
The Obama campaign also unleashed a new two-minute television ad in which Mr. Obama pitches an economic plan he says will create one million manufacturing jobs, cut oil imports and increase education jobs. He characterized it as a ''new economic patriotism.''
Mr. Romney was tying himself to the military as well. He talked about his experience on Wednesday night in Toledo, when his private charter plane was getting ready to take off as an honor flight -- full of veterans who had spent the day in Washington visiting the war memorials -- was returning home. Mr. Romney delayed his own flight in order to greet all of the veterans as they walked down the gangway of their plane, and one elderly, wheelchair-bound World War II veteran, he said, stood out in his mind.
''I said hello to him and shook his hand, and then he turned to go through this long alleyway that had been set up with flags and people who were there to recognize each of the veterans,'' Mr. Romney recalled. ''But he stopped the person who was pushing him, pushing him in the wheelchair, and then he reached inside his coat and took out a flag. And waved it.''
Mr. Romney also talked about how, as governor of Massachusetts, he was attending a ceremony to send his state's servicemen and -women off to Iraq and Afghanistan, when one of the soldiers raised his hand with an interesting proposal.
''He said, 'I have a young lady that I'm in love with, and we haven't been married and I'm going to go off to conflict -- could you marry us?' '' Mr. Romney said. ''And I said, 'I don't see why not.' ''
He said he called the two up to the front of the audience and married them right there.

Full reviews of recent dance performances: nytimes.com/dance.
Ephrat Asherie (Friday and Saturday) Though probably best known in break-dancing circles, the fiercely talented Ms. Asherie (also known as Bounce) moves deftly between the dance world's underground and mainstream realms, from performing with the all-female house dance crew MAWU to touring with Pilobolus. And she choreographs too. Dixon Place presents the premiere of ''Single Ride,'' in which she weaves breaking, house and voguing into an exploration of that most relatable New York experience: riding the subway. At 7:30 p.m., Dixon Place, 161A Chrystie Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-0736, dixonplace.org; $15 in advance, $18 at the door; $12 for students and 65+. (Siobhan Burke) 
&#x2605; Soledad Barrio & Noche Flamenca (Friday through Sunday) After their sold-out, weeklong run at the Joyce last year, the dazzling Ms. Barrio and her ensemble of dancers, singers and musicians are back for two weeks of bracing, soulful flamenco. They bring a collection of solos, duets and ensemble works under the title ''Flores Para los Muertos,'' including two world premieres and a United States premiere. Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $10 to $69. (Burke)
Composer / Choreographer Series (Friday through Sunday) The opening of the Barclays Center may eclipse all other signs of cultural life in Downtown Brooklyn this weekend. But as Jay-Z inaugurates the stadium, Roulette will be presenting this series of composer-choreographer collaborations right down the street. First up, on Friday, is a satire on aging by Susan Hefner and Michael Evans, followed on Saturday by the dance maker Melanie Maar, the vocalist Shelley Hirsch and the musician Kenta Nagai. On Sunday, Biba Bell and Ben Hall offer three works, including ''Mouth w/ Objects,'' which Ms. Bell performed in the space last winter to chilling effect. At 8 p.m., Roulette, 509 Atlantic Avenue, near Third Avenue, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, (917) 267-0363, roulette.org; $15, or $10 for students and 65+. (Burke)
&#x2605; DD Dorvillier (Friday through Sunday) Dancers mirroring music isn't exactly a new concept, but an excerpt from Ms. Dorvillier's ''Danza Permanente'' at Judson Church last year suggested a smart, inquisitive take on the idea. In the finished work, which is having its United States premiere as part of the Crossing the Line Festival, we can expect to see music without hearing it, as each of four performers embodies one instrument in a Beethoven string quartet, dancing in near silence. The composer Zeena Parkins, who helped to transpose the score into choreography, contributes a spare sonic landscape. At 8 p.m., the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, Ext. 11, thekitchen.org; $15, or $12 for students and 65+. (Burke)
Garth Fagan and Wynton Marsalis (Friday through Sunday) When ''Griot New York,'' a collaboration between Mr. Fagan and Mr. Marsalis, opened at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1991, Anna Kisselgoff praised it in The New York Times as ''one of the happiest and most poetic dance premieres of the season.'' Perhaps we'll be saying the same of ''Lighthouse/Lightning Rod,'' which once again pairs Mr. Fagan's luscious, Afro-Caribbean-inflected movement with an original jazz score by Mr. Marsalis, played live on the academy's stage. The work has its premiere alongside excerpts from ''Griot.'' Friday and Saturday at 7:30 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Howard Gilman Opera House, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $20 to $70. (Burke)
Fall for Dance (Friday through Sunday and Tuesday through Thursday; through Oct. 13) City Center's famously affordable, something-for-everyone festival brings together 20 companies from 11 countries over 12 days, raising the perennial question: What to see? For my $15, Program 4, on Thursday, has the most to offer: the enchanting soloist Shantala Shivalingappa, who fluently interweaves contemporary and classical Indian dance; Jodi Melnick's finely wrought quartet ''Solo, (Re)Deluxe Version''; Pacific Northwest Ballet in an excerpt from Christopher Wheeldon's ''Carousel (A Dance)''; and the all-male hula troupe known as Ka Leo O Laka I Ka Hikina O Ka Lâ. Program 2 -- with works by Martha Graham, Pam Tanowitz, Twyla Tharp and Peter Quanz -- on Saturday and Sunday also looks promising. Friday, Saturday and Tuesday through Thursday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 7 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org; $15; sold out Friday through Sunday. (Burke)
Fall Further (Monday) The dance agency Pentacle has gathered some of the East Coast artists it represents -- an eclectic group known as the Gallery -- for this one-night showcase of contemporary dance. The extensive lineup (13 companies) includes Bill Young/Collen Thomas & Company, Claire Porter/PORTABLES, Amanda Selwyn Dance Theater and danceTactics performance group. At 7:30 p.m., Ailey Citigroup Theater, 405 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 405-9000, alvinailey.org; $10 in advance, $14 at the door. (Burke)
Trajal Harrell (Monday) On the first evening of his Danspace Project residency (which culminates in a longer run later in October), Mr. Harrell offers a one-time-only showing of ''Antigone Jr.'' That work is part of his continuing project ''Twenty Looks or Paris Is Burning at the Judson Church,'' which reimagines the relationship between two dance subcultures of 1960s New York: Greenwich Village's Judson Dance Theater and the voguing scene in Harlem. At 6:30 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, danspaceproject.org; free. (Burke)
&#x2605; Keith Hennessy / Circo Zero (Thursday through Oct. 6) A brilliant improviser and instigator of theatrical mischief, Mr. Hennessy comes to New York Live Arts with ''Turbulence (a dance about the economy),'' a response to our current economic and ecological crises. Integrating new cast members into each performance, the collaborative work continuously morphs and reinvents itself, never quite knowing where it's headed. If it's anything like Mr. Hennessy's ''Almost,'' performed at the Abrons Arts Center last year, that uncertainty will be thrilling. At 7:30 p.m., New York Live Arts, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, newyorklivearts.org; $20, or $16 for students and 65+. (Burke)
&#x2605; Sarah Michelson (Thursday) Though Ms. Michelson's image often presides over her captivating works -- in the form of looming oil portraits or, in her award-winning piece at the Whitney Biennial last spring, a rendering of her silhouette in neon -- we rarely see the choreographer herself onstage. Ever the enigma, she may or may not make an appearance during ''Not a Lecture/Performance,'' in which, according to the Crossing the Line festival's Web site, she ''neither lectures nor performs about the myriad layers that comprise her work.'' At 8 p.m., French Institute Alliance Française, Tinker Auditorium, 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (800) 982-2787, fiaf.org; $20 in advance, $25 day of performance, $15 for members. (Burke)
&#x2605; New York City Ballet (Friday through Sunday and Tuesday through Thursday; through Oct. 14) The company's tribute to Balanchine, Stravinsky and the long, fruitful partnership between them continues through Sunday. Next week brings various selections from Jerome Robbins, Peter Martins, Christopher Wheeldon and (more) Balanchine. On Thursday all tickets are just $29, and you can't do much better for the chance to see, in the same evening, Robbins's bracing ode to silence, ''Moves,'' and Mr. Wheeldon's breathtaking ''After the Rain,'' with Wendy Whelan in one of her most celebrated roles. Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., and Tuesday through Thursday at 7:30 p.m., David H. Koch Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 496-0600, nycballet.com; $29 to $155. (Burke)
Philadanco (Tuesday through Thursday; through Oct. 7) This mainstay of Philadelphia's modern dance scene, now in its 42nd year, returns to the Joyce with four works, including a world premiere by Matthew Rushing (an esteemed member of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater) and the New York premiere of Rennie Harris's ''Wake Up,'' which explores the inception and evolution of hip-hop. Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $10 to $49. (Burke)
&#x2605; Yvonne Rainer (Tuesday) A founding member of Judson Dance Theater, the collective of artists that pioneered postmodern dance in the 1960s, Ms. Rainer left choreography for filmmaking in the early 1970s. (She would return to making dances three decades later.) In honor of Judson's 50th anniversary, Movement Research and the Anthology Film Archives are presenting a series of films created by and featuring Judson artists, beginning with Ms. Rainer's ''Lives of Performers'' (featuring a performance of a rehearsal) and ''Connecticut Rehearsal (of Continuous Project -- Altered Daily).'' At 7 p.m., Anthology Film Archives, 32-34 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org; $10, or $8 for students and 65+. (Burke)
Jason Akira Somma (Friday, Saturday and Tuesday through Thursday; through Nov. 17) A host of renowned figures in contemporary performance -- Robert Wilson, Laurie Anderson, Mikhail Baryshnikov and others -- are there without really being there in Mr. Somma's ''Phosphene Variations.'' In this innovative exhibition, these artists appear in the form of free-floating holograms, whose movements are a reaction to the viewer's touch. (In other words, you can pretend you're dancing with Baryshnikov.) Most Wednesday nights feature live performances incorporating video feedback that Mr. Somma generates in real time. From noon to 6 p.m., Wednesday performances at 7 p.m., Location One, 26 Greene Street, SoHo, (212) 334-3347, location1.org; exhibition is free, performances are $10. (Burke)
Stacy Spence (Friday and Saturday) As its title suggests, the 10-week series ''Judson Now'' focuses not only on the veteran postmodernists who founded Judson Dance Theater in 1962 but also on their disciples who are making work today. One of those younger artists is Mr. Spence, who danced for the Judsonite Trisha Brown from 1997 to 2006. Working with the sound artist Tei Blow and the dancer Brandi Norton, he offers the premiere of ''Eden as We Recall,'' looking at how individuals and their environment inform each other. At 8 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, danspaceproject.org; $18. (Burke)
&#x2605; RoseAnne Spradlin (Friday and Saturday) An arresting feat of endurance for four performers -- Rebecca Serrell Cyr, Natalie Green, Rebecca Warner and Rebecca Wender -- Ms. Spradlin's ''beginning of something,'' which had its premiere at the Chocolate Factory Theater last year, gets a welcome reprise at New York Live Arts. At once steely and vulnerable, controlled and unhinged, the performers stalk the confines of a raised platform, intermittently dressing and undressing, with the audience bearing witness in proximity. Friday at 7:30 and 10 p.m., Saturday at 7:30 p.m., New York Live Arts, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, newyorklivearts.org; $30, or $24 for students and 65+. (Burke)
Works & Process at the Guggenheim (Sunday and Monday) For the next installment of this performance and conversation series (which, once again, is sold out), dancers from American Ballet Theater perform a survey of work by the company's resident artist -- and one of ballet's most in-demand choreographers -- Alexei Ratmansky. We don't often get to hear from the thoughtful, surprisingly soft-spoken dance maker (in ways other than his eloquent choreography), so it's worth tuning in to the live stream of Sunday's show (at ustream.tv/worksandprocess), as he talks about his career path and artistic process. At 7:30 p.m., Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3587, worksandprocess.org; sold out. (Burke)

HEADLINE: Good News And Bad In New Data On Economy

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- New economic data painted a mixed picture on Thursday of the nation's economy.
Demand for long-lasting manufactured goods fell, and slightly fewer people signed contracts to buy homes. The job market looked only a little better. 
Taken together, the reports suggested the economy was growing only modestly and not quickly enough to spur hiring.
''The economy over all has only weak forward momentum,'' Nigel Gault, the chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight, said in a note to clients. ''The news from housing may be improving, but manufacturing is struggling now.''
Most of the data seemed discouraging on the surface, but a closer inspection of the details offered some promise.
Companies cut orders for long-lasting goods by 13.2 percent in August, the Commerce Department said. That was the biggest drop in more than three years, but it was largely influenced by a large decline in aircraft orders. Excluding transportation equipment, orders fell only 1.6 percent. And in a positive sign, orders that reflect business investment plans rose 1.1 percent, the first increase since May.
The overall economy grew at a 1.3 percent annual rate in the April-June quarter, much lower than the 1.7 percent the government had estimated. About half of the downward revision stemmed from the severe drought in the Midwest, which cut overall farm output. But growth also fell because exports and consumer spending expanded at a slower pace.
The number of Americans who signed contracts to buy previously occupied homes fell in August from a two-year high in July. The National Association of Realtors said its index of sales agreements declined 2.6 percent, to 99.2. That was just below the reading of 100 that is considered healthy. Still, the index was 10.7 percent higher than a year ago.
Economists expected growth to hover near or below 2 percent for the rest of the year. Typically, that is too weak to create enough jobs to lower the jobless rate.
One report appeared to offer some hope that the job market will improve. Weekly applications for unemployment benefits fell 26,000 to a seasonally adjusted 359,000, the lowest level in two months, the Labor Department said. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, fell to 374,000.
Applications are a measure of the rate of layoffs. When they consistently fall below 375,000, it typically indicates that hiring is strong enough to lower the unemployment rate.
The last few reports on applications for unemployment benefits ''suggest no significant acceleration or deceleration in employment growth,'' said Jim O'Sullivan, an economist at High Frequency Economics.

ANOTHER ROUND On Thursday, Sergey Aleynikov, a former programmer at Goldman Sachs, pleaded not guilty to state charges that he had stolen secret computer code from the bank. There was a ''Groundhog Day'' quality to the proceedings. More than three years ago, Mr. Aleynikov, left, appeared in Federal District Court in Manhattan -- just around the corner from New York State court -- to plead not guilty to similar charges brought by the United States attorney in Manhattan. His conviction in the federal case was reversed this year. 
A lawyer for Mr. Aleynikov sharply criticized the bank and the government in court Thursday. ''He left Russia for freedom, justice and the American way and he got Franz Kafka and Goldman Sachs,'' said Kevin Marino, the lawyer.

TOSSED OUT A federal judge has dismissed a fraud lawsuit filed this year against the chief executive of the investment bank Allen & Company. Judge Colleen McMahon of Federal District Court in Manhattan threw out a claim that Herbert A. Allen Jr., the bank's chief executive, and his cousin Terry Allen Kramer, a well-known Broadway producer, had forged the signature of a dying cousin to protect a family ranch in Arizona from a creditor. The judge was highly dismissive of the lawsuit, calling aspects of it ''implausible'' and specifically describing the forgery claim as based on ''sheer speculation.'' PETER LATTMAN
MATTRESS MERGER The mattress maker Tempur-Pedic announced on Thursday that it was buying a rival, Sealy, for $2.20 a share, or $228.6 million. With the deal, Sealy will finally cut ties with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, which owns about 46 percent of the publicly traded company. K.K.R. has often tested investors' patience. This year, several investors blamed K.K.R. for Sealy's poor financial performance and lobbied for a shake-up of the company's board. According to Tempur-Pedic's statement, Sealy will continue to operate as an independent unit. EVELYN M. RUSLI
PARING BACK The private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management will start selling its $2.5 billion stake in Japan's struggling Aozora Bank this year. It's a much-anticipated move for Cerberus, which made its initial investment more than a decade ago. Aozora's share price has slumped amid the financial crisis, limiting any further upside for the American firm.

HEADLINE: Last Quarter's Growth Is Revised Down Sharply

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department said Thursday that the United States economy grew at an annual pace of just 1.3 percent in the second quarter of the year, showing that the recovery came close to stalling in the spring.
The revision was down from the 1.7 percent rate the government reported in August. The economy grew at a 2 percent pace in the first quarter of the year and 3 percent at the end of 2011. 
With just 40 days to go until the election, the weak growth figure was sure to take on a strong political resonance. Mitt Romney has battered President Obama for failing to foster a robust recovery and has pinned the economy's weak jobs growth on his policies. Mr. Obama has conceded that the recovery has been anemic, but has argued that his administration put the economy on the right track after the worst recession since the Great Depression.
Thursday's report underscored that the recovery has proved insufficient to pull down the unemployment rate, which has been stuck between 8.1 percent and 8.3 percent all year.
The renewed weakness this month spurred the Federal Reserve to act to support the economy, putting in place a third major round of bond purchases designed to aid the nascent housing recovery and to encourage employers to add jobs.
Much of the downward revision to the second-quarter figures was because of the effects of the nation's worst drought in 50 years. Farm inventories dropped in the second quarter, after falling in the first as well.
More broadly, cuts to state and local government spending have held down growth, and private firms have hesitated to invest during the poor business climate, despite the attraction of low interest rates on loans.
A separate report Thursday showed the manufacturing sector, one of the brightest spots in the recovery, contracting as well. The Commerce Department said that durable goods orders, a key measure of manufacturing strength, plunged 13.2 percent in August, far more than economists had anticipated and the steepest drop since the worst of the recession in the winter of 2009.
Much of the drop was from orders for aircraft.
Still, the economic news was not all bad. The Bureau of Labor Statistics issued revised numbers for employment that raised the estimate of jobs in the economy last March by 386,000, or 0.3 percent -- enough to make President Obama a net job creator over his tenure.
The report, adjusting data that will be refined once more, follows a trend of the bureau underestimating job growth when the economy is expanding and underestimating job losses when the economy is contracting.
That proved the case in the early-2000s recession following the collapse of the tech bubble, the massive recession that started in 2008 and the period of economic expansion in between.
Indeed, the Great Recession proved much worse than government policy makers understood as it was happening, with the economy shedding hundreds of thousands more jobs than initially estimated.
In August, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said that it had overestimated job growth in June and July, revising down the number of jobs added in those months by more than 40,000. Thus, the bureau estimates the economy added fewer than 100,000 jobs a month through the summer months -- not enough to pull down the unemployment rate, given normal expansion in the labor force.
But housing has recently proven a surprising bright spot, with sales and prices starting to climb in many regions of the country. On Thursday, the National Association of Realtors said that pending home sales retreated slightly in August after reaching a two-year peak in July. The level of pending home sales -- a measure of properties under contract but not yet closed on -- has risen more than 10 percent in the past year.
Many housing experts expect a sustained, slow recovery in the market. On Thursday, the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage fell to a record low of 3.4 percent. Low mortgage rates, driven in part by the new Federal Reserve program, are expected to drive more Americans to refinance their homes and to encourage purchases as well.

HEADLINE: Economy Still Weak, But More Feel Secure

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
Both economists and the Romney campaign are puzzling over the same paradox: The recovery has flagged and yet the country's mood appears to be improving.
Despite months of disappointing-to-dismal economic reports -- capped by a Commerce Department release Thursday showing the economy had expanded at an annual pace of just 1.3 percent in the second quarter, barely above stall speed -- a closely watched measure of consumer confidence surged to its highest level since February.
Economic experts pointed to several trends to explain how Americans were feeling better about the economy even though growth in jobs and the overall economy had weakened. First, the election is having a strong effect on economic perceptions. Second, though the recovery is weak, it has persisted, with employment and wages rising and some households feeling more secure. 
Though the unemployment rate has been stuck between 8.1 and 8.3 percent all year, employers have continued to add workers to their payrolls. Wages and consumer spending have strengthened.
The housing sector's nascent recovery foretells rising employment in the construction, real estate and mortgage finance sectors, as well as rising household wealth.
''There is a recovery. There are jobs. There is more income. There is some improvement,'' said Lawrence Mishel, a labor market expert at and president of the liberal Economic Policy Institute. ''But the improvement is obviously disappointing,'' he added, a sentiment that many economists echoed.
Moreover, Labor Department data released on Thursday suggested that job growth in the 12 months through March 2012 might have been significantly stronger than government economists first expected.
In a standard revision of its jobs numbers, the department said that the economy added nearly 400,000 more jobs during that period than originally thought.
''The pattern of revisions suggest that the recession that began at the end of 2007 was deeper than initially reported, and the jobs recovery over the last 2.5 years has been a bit stronger than initially reported, although much work remains to be done to return to full employment,'' Alan B. Krueger, the head of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers said in a statement.
In the first quarter of the year, the economy added, on average, 134,000 jobs a month. Over the last three months, the rate of job growth has fallen to 79,000 a month. Similarly, economic growth was 2 percent in the first quarter before dropping to 1.3 percent in the second, largely because of the effects of the nation's worst drought in 50 years.
According to Macroeconomic Advisers, a widely respected forecasting firm, growth is tracking at 1.7 percent for the third quarter. Moreover, rising gas and food prices have cut into workers' wallets.
The economic data has grown so dismal that Federal Reserve this month announced a major new bond-buying effort to resuscitate the recovery once more. ''The Federal Reserve is basically saying that we don't have a recovery,'' said Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, Mitt Romney's running mate. ''Obamanomics didn't work.''
Earlier this year, the conventional wisdom held that numbers like these should have meant trouble for the Obama campaign. Yet, even as job growth has fallen far below 100,000 a month, the American people appear to be growing more confident in both the economy and the president.
On Tuesday, the Conference Board's measure of consumer confidence surged to a seven-month high, trouncing economists' expectations. Respondents in particular had a more favorable view of the job market going forward -- with more consumers expecting employers to add positions in the coming months.
The recovery seems to have jelled with voters, too. A recent New York Times/CBS News poll found that 40 percent of respondents think the country is on the right track, up from 23 percent a year ago. Moreover, 31 percent of respondents described the economy as very or fairly good, up from 14 percent a year ago.
Just as opinions about the economy have driven opinions about the campaign, it seems that opinions about the campaign are driving opinions about the economy.
Democrats have become much more optimistic, pulling the national numbers up with them. A new Pew poll, for instance, shows that just 15 percent of Democrats say that recent economic news is mostly bad, while 60 percent of Republicans say the same. A year ago, they held similar opinions.
''Right now, politics is playing an inordinately large role in the behavioral economic data,'' wrote Lydia Saad and Dennis Jacobe, of Gallup, in an analysis of the surge in consumer confidence. ''This suggests that the period between now and the election is a particularly hazardous time to apply traditional behavioral economic and political interpretations to key economic measures.''
Economists and political experts described the recovery as a ''Rorschach test,'' with both sides' arguments compelling to voters.
''It's a challenging messaging environment,'' said Lynn Vavreck, a political scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles. ''President Obama is in this strange situation of wanting to go out there and own this growth when people are saying, 'That's nothing to be proud of!' ''
''If it were just the economy, the president would be in a lot of trouble based on how voters have reacted to numbers like the ones we're seeing now,'' said Nigel Gault, the chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight, an economic forecasting firm.
Mr. Gault said he believed that Mr. Obama's significantly higher likability and favorability numbers -- and the Romney campaign's recent decision to talk about other things besides the economy -- helped to explain Mr. Obama's lead in the polls.
Professor Vavreck, though, said that the fact that the economy was growing gave Mr. Obama a powerful leg up, even given voters' queasiness about the economy.
''Incumbents in growing economies, even slow ones, are hard to beat,'' she said.
Others noted that the time for Mr. Romney to make his case and have it sink in had grown short.
''The economy's not going to change much between now and the election,'' said Mr. Gault of IHS Global Insight. ''The economy is what it is. And if the economy hasn't tilted the race in favor of Romney by now, you wonder whether it ever will.''

HEADLINE: Mixed Returns for Endowments

BYLINE: By RICHARD PÉREZ-PEÑA

 BODY:
An uneven economic year yielded uneven results for the largest university endowments, with reports released through Thursday revealing a range of results, from a fractional loss on investments for Harvard to a healthy gain for M.I.T. 
Harvard said on Thursday that its endowment posted an investment loss of 0.05 percent in the fiscal year ended June 30, due to steep losses on its large foreign assets. Taking into account new donations collected and money spent, Harvard's endowment fell $1 billion, to $30.7 billion -- still the largest by far, but well below the $36.9 billion it reached in mid-2008, just before the financial crisis struck.
Yale's endowment earned a 4.7 percent investment return, the university said on Thursday. But it ended the fiscal year down slightly, at $19.3 billion, as spending outpaced investment earnings and new gifts.
Earlier this month, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology reported an 8 percent gain on investments, with its endowment reaching $10.3 billion, up from $9.7 billion.
The past year brought a strong stock market, a still-stagnant real estate market, plummeting overseas markets and mixed results from private equity and hedge funds, so the universities' performance depended on where they put their money. Over all, they appear to have underperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index, which returned 5.5 percent.
The wealthiest institutions, which invest heavily in private equity, may turn out to have below-average results for the past year, said Ken Redd, director of research and policy analysis at the National Association of College and University Business Officers. ''The smaller institutions tend to invest more conservatively, which might have been a better strategy this past year,'' he said.
Endowments dropped sharply during and after the 2008 financial crisis, prompting many universities to defer expensive projects, then rebounded strongly. In the 2010-11 fiscal year, the average gain on investment was 19 percent. But by midyear, most endowments remained far below where they stood four years earlier -- $6.2 billion below in Harvard's case, and $3.6 billion in Yale's.
A major exception is Stanford, which has raised more in recent years than any other American university. On Thursday, Stanford reported a $17 billion endowment as of Aug. 31, the end of its fiscal year, up from $16.5 billion a year earlier, nearly matching its 2008 high of $17.2 billion.

HEADLINE: Talking at Cross Purposes

 BODY:
The alternate universes of the Israeli and Palestinian leaders were on display Thursday at the United Nations General Assembly.
In dueling speeches, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel focused on drawing a red line for an attack on Iran's nuclear facilities while the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, cataloged his community's many grievances against Israel and tried to revive the fading dream of a two-state solution. Mr. Netanyahu even had on hand a visual aid -- a primitive cartoon drawing of a bomb, which quickly went viral on the Internet.
Both issues -- Iran's dangerous nuclear ambitions and the Palestinian right to a secure state -- need to be dealt with seriously, but neither man acknowledged the other side's priority nor articulated a common path forward. Mostly, the speeches showed how far peace efforts have gone off track. 
Mr. Netanyahu told the United Nations that he believes Iran's ability to make a nuclear weapon will be irreversible by next spring or summer, and he argued that a ''clear red line'' must be drawn to warn Iran to halt its nuclear fuel enrichment or face military action. While that was a far more specific time frame than he had previously noted, his reference to next year seems to back away from earlier statements that seemed to suggest an Israeli strike much sooner.
Still, Mr. Netanyahu's speech continued to push a campaign, which promotes military action when there is time for sanctions and diplomatic negotiations to produce a peaceful outcome. An Israeli Foreign Ministry report, disclosed by Haaretz, an Israeli newspaper, on Thursday, acknowledged as much, saying that sanctions imposed by the United States and Europe are having a huge impact on Iran's economy and may be affecting the government's stability. The report urged that the sanctions be tightened further.
A recent report by The Iran Project signed by nearly three dozen American experts concluded that ''conservatively, it would take Iran a year or more to build a military-grade weapon, with at least two years or more required to create a nuclear warhead that would be reliably deliverable by a missile.''
Mr. Netanyahu is justifiably suspicious that Iran may be using negotiations to buy time as it advances its weapons program. And President Obama made clear the other day that the time for a diplomatic solution is ''not unlimited.''
Mr. Abbas's complaints are no less important for both Israel, the Palestinians and the region. Using exceptionally sharp rhetoric, he accused Israeli settlers of undertaking 535 attacks against Palestinians in recent months, and he charged Israel with using settlement expansion and efforts to weaken the Palestinian Authority to destroy the prospect of a two-state solution. Mr. Netanyahu made a brief reference to wanting peace with the Palestinians, but there is no hope of meaningful negotiations anytime soon.
After failing to get a process for talks going early in his term, Mr. Obama seems to have given up. Mitt Romney has suggested that he would do even less if he's elected. On the notorious video taped when he was speaking at a private fund-raising event in May, he disparaged Palestinians as ''not wanting to see peace anyway'' and said his approach was to ''recognize this is going to remain an unsolved problem.'' He seems poised to encourage Mr. Netanyahu's intemperate posture toward Iran, no matter the consequences.

HEADLINE: Andra Ursuta: 'Magical Terrorism'

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
Ramiken Crucible
389 Grand Street, at Suffolk Street, Lower East Side
Through Oct. 21
Andra Ursuta's rambunctious, haunted shows sure don't look like anyone else's. Her second solo at Ramiken Crucible is partly an all-out assault on the gallery format, of which Ramiken is a small, rough, downscale approximation to begin with. She has opened the gallery's interior to the outdoors simply by knocking out its immense plate-glass windows, a bit of institutional critique worthy of Michael Asher, if somewhat more violent. (Shards of shattered glass remain.) 
Meanwhile, in a dioramalike display, the gallery's back wall has been rammed and partly collapsed by a vehicle opulently encrusted with silver foam. This gleaming, quasi-comical thing-in-itself evokes both an ancient cart (a pair of boots embedded in it suggest that it once carried a ceremonial figure) and NASA's moon rover.
In between these two acts of possible terrorism are three life-size Social Realist marble sculptures. The news release provides salient facts and political motivation: the sculptures are based on a news photograph of an unknown Romanian Gypsy woman awaiting deportation from France that Ms. Ursuta, who is Romanian, contracted to have made in China.
Also here are several exceptionally striking female torsos cast (from a sculpture made by Ms. Ursata) in aluminum, iron or a combination of concrete and manure; their geometric, somewhat African mien is undercut by suggestions that the original was partly stitched together and possibly stuffed.
Both the marble figures and most of the cast torsos wear elaborate coin chokers or collars, using equal values of euros and American and Romanian currency, that conjure magic, decoration and armor. The exception is a torso laid on a stack of pallets like a dead warrior on a pier.
This exhibition contrasts systems of belief, economics and display, as well as different states of otherness. The disturbing impression is of time running backward, of civilization devolving.

HEADLINE: Goldman To Settle Pay-to-Play Charges

BYLINE: By SUSANNE CRAIG and BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
8:34 p.m. | Updated Goldman Sachs on Thursday settled federal allegations that one of its investment bankers curried favor with a public official to win lucrative government contracts in Massachusetts.
The Wall Street bank struck a $12 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to resolve the "pay to play" accusations without admitting or denying guilt.
The banker, Neil M. M. Morrison, who was a vice president at the firm, did not settle with the agency. His lawyer did not return a call seeking comment. 
The S.E.C.'s order suggested that Mr. Morrison helped win government business for Goldman after promoting his ties to Timothy P. Cahill, then Massachusetts state treasurer, who was indicted on public corruption charges in April. Mr. Morrison, the agency said, in essence ran a campaign office for Mr. Cahill out of Goldman, acting as a fund-raiser and speechwriter during work hours and using the company's e-mail system and phones.
The campaigning, which spanned from 2008 to 2010, also led Mr. Morrison to indirectly contribute money to Mr. Cahill. Mr. Morrison, regulators say, gave $400 to a friend who then wrote a check to the treasurer's campaign. During the same period, the S.E.C. says, Mr. Morrison began soliciting public contracts for Goldman, a conflict of interest that violates securities laws. Goldman ultimately snared 30 "prohibited" deals to help arrange Massachusetts bond offerings.
"The pay-to-play rules are clear: Municipal finance professionals that use their firm's resources to campaign on behalf of political candidates compromise themselves and the firms that employ them," said Robert Khuzami, director of enforcement at the commission.
In recent years the S.E.C. has stepped up its interest in pay-to-play cases, adding a specialized unit that examines corruption in government bond offerings and bringing actions against banks and public officials.
The S.E.C. faulted Goldman for failing to keep an eye on Mr. Morrison, a former senior staff member to Mr. Cahill while he was treasurer. Had Mr. Morrison's campaigning been disclosed, Goldman would have been prohibited from getting state business for two years.
In a statement, Goldman said it detected Mr. Morrison's activities, flagged regulators and then terminated him. "We accept responsibility for the consequences of his unauthorized actions under the terms of the settlements announced today and are pleased to resolve these investigations," the company said.
Goldman's penalty includes disgorgement of $7.5 million that it earned in fees from underwriting Massachusetts bonds. The company also settled with the state attorney general, which in a related action received more than $4 million from Goldman.
"We are pleased that this settlement brings back more than $4 million to the Commonwealth and serves to protect the integrity of the Commonwealth's bidding process," the Massachusetts attorney general, Martha Coakley, said in a statement. She cited "violations of state law that involved millions of taxpayer dollars."
For Mr. Morrison, the S.E.C. said, winning the contracts appeared to be personal. "We have discussed the Build American Bond transaction and how important it is to me," he wrote in an e-mail to one of Mr. Cahill's employees in reference to a deal that Goldman wanted to underwrite. "Having Goldman as the lead and getting 50% of the economics would be such a home run for me."
Mr. Morrison, the regulator said, also highlighted his political ties when courting Mr. Cahill's office. In one e-mail to a deputy treasurer, he wrote, "From my standpoint as an advisor/consultant/friend I am saying, PLEASE don't give these slots away willy-nilly," referring to the underwriting business. "This has to be a political decision."
At one point, according to the S.E.C. complaint, Mr. Morrison acknowledged the problem his lobbying posed, telling a campaign official in an e-mail that "I am staying in banking and don't want a story that says that I am helping Cahill, who is giving me banking business. If that came out, I'm sure I wouldn't get any more business."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Enrollment Drops Again In Graduate Programs

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
Enrollment in college is still climbing, but students are increasingly saying no to graduate school in the United States.
New enrollment in graduate schools fell last year for the second consecutive year, according to a report from the Council of Graduate Schools.
The declines followed surges in enrollment in 2008 and 2009 as many unemployed workers sought a haven during the recession. Financial considerations probably played a role in the shift. Students may be dissuaded from continuing their education in part because of the increasing debt burden from their undergraduate years. 
Additionally, state budget cuts are forcing public institutions to reduce aid for graduate students, who in some disciplines have traditionally been paid to attend postgraduate programs.
The number of students enrolled in master's and doctoral programs (excluding law and certain other first professional degrees like M.D.'s) declined by 1.7 percent from the fall of 2010 to fall 2011.
Among American citizens and permanent residents, matriculation fell by 2.3 percent. In contrast, temporary residents increased their enrollment by 7.8 percent.
Temporary residents made up 16.9 percent of all students in American graduate schools, and that figure has been growing as foreign governments pay for more of their citizens to obtain education in the United States, particularly in technical areas. Temporary residents represented 45.5 percent of all students enrolled in engineering graduate programs in the United States, and 42.4 percent of those in American mathematics and computer science graduate programs.
The changes in 2011 varied by discipline, with education having the biggest drop-off in new graduate enrollment at 8.8 percent.
''The states are in financial stress,'' said Debra Stewart, president of the Council of Graduate Schools. ''The school systems especially are in financial stress. Teachers are no longer being provided time off to get graduate degrees, and schools are no longer funding principals to go back and get principal certificates.''
The next sharpest decline was in programs for arts and humanities, where new graduate enrollment fell by 5.4 percent, perhaps reflecting that career prospects for such graduates are becoming more limited as colleges lay off even tenured faculty members in these areas.
Health sciences, on the other hand, experienced a big increase in enrollment. The health care industry has been hiring consistently and robustly during the recession and the weak recovery.
The number of new graduate students studying health care rose by 6.4 percent, which was slightly slower growth than the average in the last decade. The average annual change in new graduate enrollment in health sciences from 2001 to 2011 was 9.8 percent.
Enrollment showed more tepid growth in business, which was up by 2.6 percent, and in mathematics and computer sciences, up by 1.6 percent.
While overall enrollment for graduate school declined, the number of applications rose by 4.3 percent. It was the sixth consecutive increase in application volume.
The Council of Graduate Schools did not have data on how many schools the typical applicant applies to, so it was unclear if there were more people applying in 2011 than in the previous year. But there was an increase in the number of people taking the Graduate Record Examinations (G.R.E.), a test that many graduate schools require as part of student applications.
As the number of grad school applications has risen, the share of those applications leading to offers of admission has been falling. In 2007, the acceptance rate across all master's and doctoral programs was 44.6 percent, whereas in 2011 it was 40.8 percent.
Women continued to outnumber men in the nation's postgraduate programs, 58 percent to 42 percent, in the 2011 report.
The Council of Graduate Schools, a membership organization for institutions of higher education in the United States and Canada, based its findings on an annual survey of American graduate schools. The latest report reflected the responses from 655 institutions, which collectively award 81 percent of the master's degrees and 92 percent of the doctorates each year.

HEADLINE: European Automakers Face a Stunted Future

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
PARIS -- The optimistic view at the Paris Motor Show on Thursday was that auto sales were so bad that they could not possibly get any worse.
But even if there is a slight recovery in 2013, as some predict, it is dawning on industry executives that it could be years before sales return to the levels of 2007, when they peaked just before the financial crisis.
New passenger car registrations in the European Union have declined every year since then and are down 7 percent this year so far this year. The inescapable conclusion, some executives say, is that the industry is not going through a downturn but is changing permanently, and car companies must adapt more quickly. 
''In the near future, it will be impossible to come back to the numbers of the early 2000s,'' Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, the chairman of Ferrari and a member of the board of the Italian carmaker Fiat, said in an interview Thursday. ''Every single carmaker will have to take care of this.''
The new-model introductions in Paris reflected the state of the market. They seemed to be aimed either at rich people who still have money or at the masses trying to make do on less and less at the middle of the market. At the high end, Jaguar is offering its first two-seat sports car since the 1970s, the all-aluminum F Series, which will go on sale in the United States and the rest of the world next summer, starting at about $70,000.
Toward the low end was Renault's new Clio and the Adam from the Opel unit of General Motors, both attempts to offer a measure of style on a budget.
But even if those new models turn out to be hits, auto companies must still radically cut costs -- a process that has only begun. Sergio Marchionne, the chief executive of both Fiat and Chrysler, said that factories in Italy were operating at 50 percent capacity, well below the level analysts say is needed to be profitable.
Mr. Marchionne, trying to counter the image of auto executives as heartless job cutters, said he laid awake at night worrying about Fiat employees whose jobs are in danger.
''We all understand that a lot of livelihoods depend on the decisions we make,'' he said at a news conference.
Mr. Marchionne repeated calls for European Union leaders to negotiate cuts in manufacturing to spread the pain throughout the region, as they did for the steel industry in the 1990s. Mr. Marchionne said political leaders were in favor of closing plants only outside their own countries.
''This is something that has festered for a number of years,'' Mr. Marchionne said. ''If this issue had been handled in a coordinated way long before, it would be a lot less of a problem than it is now.''
Among auto executives there is increasingly open frustration at political leaders who they think have dithered in finding a solution to the euro zone debt crisis, while at the same time obstructing attempts by manufacturers to cut costs.
''We have to deal with overcapacity; politicians need to understand this,'' said Wolfgang G. Schneider, vice president for governmental, environmental and legal affairs at Ford of Europe.
At the same time, leaders must do more to restore confidence in stricken countries, Mr. Schneider said. Ford is selling fewer cars in Spain than it is in Turkey because Spanish consumers are fearful of the future and unwilling to make large purchases.
''Things are going in the right direction, but not fast enough,'' he said of measures to stabilize the euro zone.
Among the mass market carmakers, Volkswagen remains an exception. ''Despite all the headwinds, we are sticking to our ambitious goals for 2012,'' Martin Winterkorn, the chief executive, said at a company event Wednesday evening.
Volkswagen, the largest automaker in Europe by far, has benefited from its strength in Germany, which has escaped the worst of the crisis, as well as its strong presence in fast-growing emerging markets like China and Brazil.
Still, the company seemed at pains not to show any satisfaction at the woes of its competitors. There was some of the usual over-the-top spectacle at the event Wednesday evening, like dancers twirling in vinyl ballet dresses, their faces covered by plastic visors. VW showed a design for a new version of the Panamera, made by its Porsche unit, that is a kind of high-performance luxury station wagon.
In addition, Volkswagen introduced the latest version of its best-selling Golf, an exception to the trend of cars aimed at the high or low ends.
But Volkswagen also devoted significant time to its efforts to promote youth employment in troubled European countries, bringing two young trainees from Spain and Portugal on stage to speak about how happy they were to have jobs at Volkswagen.
''We're doing everything we can to ensure that Europe has a future as a place to manufacture,'' Mr. Winterkorn said.
Despite the dismal outlook for Europe, auto executives said they remained optimistic about the car industry globally. Sales continue to rise in countries like Brazil and Russia, offsetting Europe to some extent. The companies suffering the most are Opel and PSA Peugeot Citröen, because they remain heavily dependent on Europe.
''When you look at the sector on a worldwide basis, it's not decreasing,'' said Jérôme Stoll, executive vice president for sales and marketing at Renault. Still, foreign markets are not yet doing enough to compensate for slowness in Europe, which will not recover before the end of the decade, he said.
Renault does not plan to close any plants in France, Mr. Stoll said, but he pleaded for legislation that would make it easier to adjust capacity -- for example, by transferring workers to other plants. ''We need to be as flexible as possible,'' he said.
Even Ferrari has felt the crisis, though its overall sales have continued to rise. Sales in Italy have plunged, in part because buyers may fear that driving an expensive sports car makes them a target for tax inspectors.
Ferrari has continued to do well globally because of investments it began making years ago to expand its lineup and sell to newly wealthy buyers in Asia, Mr. Montezemolo said. China has become Ferrari's third-largest market, behind Germany and the United States.
''Thanks to innovation, new products and worldwide presence,'' he said, ''thank God we are not suffering.''

HEADLINE: The Best Defense Is Dialogue

BYLINE: By WALTER C. LADWIG III

 BODY:
The recent visit to Beijing by the U.S. secretary of defense, Leon Panetta -- which coincided with State Department statements that the U.S.-Japan security treaty would apply to the disputed Senkaku Islands -- highlights the growing tension with China over America's military presence in Asia, Chinese efforts to counteract it, and the dangerous misperceptions that can arise if defense strategy gets in the way of diplomacy.
The U.S. military strategy underpinning the Obama administration's ''pivot'' to Asia is known in Pentagon circles as ''Air-Sea Battle.'' It depends upon the long-range capabilities of the U.S. Navy and Air Force to overcome the mines, submarines, anti-ship missiles and other advanced technology designed to keep the U.S. military out of ''exclusion zones'' established by potentially hostile powers. 
Although applicable to Iran, Air-Sea-Battle has attracted the most attention in the Asia-Pacific region, where America's allies see it as a way to respond to an increasingly confrontational China. Beijing, in turn, has interpreted it as a clear sign of Washington's aggressive policy toward the People's Republic.
While the Senkaku island crisis raged last week, I was in Beijing, meeting with a variety of members of China's strategic community. These consultations strongly suggest that Beijing views both Air Sea Battle and the broader ''pivot'' to Asia as provocation. At the same time my discussions suggested that there was very little awareness among the people I met about how the People's Liberation Army's own strategies or Beijing's forceful regional diplomacy -- which in recent years has sometimes bordered on belligerence -- might alarm its neighbors.
On the contrary, many officials expressed the belief that only by forcefully pressing China's position abroad would the country win the respect and cooperation of other great powers.
For their part, American officials take pains to emphasize that Air-Sea -Battle is not directed at any one country, but is designed to maintain the military capabilities necessary to uphold security guarantees in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific. In private, though, these officials admit the obvious, that the planning for Air-Sea-Battle is designed for a possible conflict involving Taiwan or a dispute over the South China Sea.
Each side views its own military preparations as defensive and the other's as hostile. Under the circumstances, it is no surprise that their public proclamations of a desire to work for harmonious relations ring hollow, at least to each other.
The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimates that China spent $129 billion on its armed forces in 2011, a significant portion of which is dedicated to acquiring ''anti-access'' capabilities. Despite headline-grabbing spending, China's military technology and armed forces are largely untested. Its last large-scale military clash was a failed invasion of Vietnam in 1979.
More importantly, Beijing's primary security concerns are internal, which means that a significant portion of the Army's personnel and resources is devoted to guarding the country's borders and supporting public-security forces. Moreover, efforts to ensure that the Chinese Army is sufficiently divided to prevent it from becoming an independent power base that could threaten Communist Party control have had a deleterious impact on military effectiveness.
Americans tend to view the U.S. military as the guarantor of an international order that benefits nations across the globe, whether by maintaining stability in the Gulf and thereby safeguarding oil flows to Europe and Asia, or by providing a security overlay that has allowed nations in Europe and Asia to set aside rivalries and concentrate on mutually beneficial economic relations.
Yet it is not hard to see how the United States would appear threatening to China, particularly when it spends six times as much on defense and has formal alliances or strategic partnerships with the third, fourth and fifth strongest military powers in Asia.
Policymakers in Beijing must recognize that U.S. military forces have global commitments and that only a portion of these are dedicated to the Asia-Pacific. Despite the rhetoric of President Obama's ''pivot,'' U.S. Army and Marine Corps forces in the region will merely be restored to pre-Iraq-war levels -- no new permanent deployments are being contemplated -- while the overall U.S. defense budget is set to decline by $487 billion over the next 10 years.
I do not suggest that the United States back away from Air-Sea-Battle or from its broader efforts to confront the anti-access threat. America's ability to project military power abroad is necessary for protecting democratic rule, retaining access to important trading partners and reassuring allies of American commitments to them.
However, this concept must be imbedded in a broader political strategy that recognizes the deep-seated insecurity of China's strategic community. A key aspect of that strategy must be a broad-based engagement with China's top leadership, academics and strategists, as well as its next generation of military leaders.
Frequent and frank dialogue about the reasons for U.S. military modernization, and about China's own military capabilities and behavior, need to be part of that conversation, as do the benefits of sustained collaboration between the world's two largest economies.
In contrast, a narrow focus on military strategies fosters the kind of mutual suspicion that can escalate into costly rivalry. Both countries need to remember that military plans are worst case scenarios designed to hedge against risk, not statements of preferred outcomes.

HEADLINE: Italian Prime Minister Speaks of Possible Second Term

BYLINE: By ELISABETTA POVOLEDO

 BODY:
ROME -- Prime Minister Mario Monti said Thursday that he would consider staying on in his post if elections next spring did not produce a strong majority in the Italian Parliament. 
Mr. Monti, speaking at a seminar at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, said he hoped that this would not be the case and that elections would point to a ''clear result,'' with a ''government led by a political leader.'' But should political stalemate follow the elections, a likely outcome, according to recent polls, Mr. Monti said he would think about heading another government, if lawmakers asked him to do so.
''I will consider,'' he said. ''I cannot preclude anything.''
It was the first time that he had publicly acknowledged the possibility of accepting a second mandate. The Italian president chooses the prime minister after consulting with political parties. Mr. Monti, an economist and former member of the European Commission, was appointed by President Giorgio Napolitano to form a government of technocrats last November after the conservative government of Silvio Berlusconi fell because of market pressures.
But Mr. Monti made clear on Thursday that his future involvement would be institutional and not political in nature. His government is supported by a broad coalition of political parties, and Mr. Monti said he had purposefully not aligned himself with any party so as not to ''destabilize the smooth functioning of the government.'' Mr. Monti does not need the appointment to remain active in politics: He is a senator for life.
To restore market confidence, Mr. Monti's government, by virtue of its nonpartisan nature, has been able to pass a number of measures to rein in Italy's high public debt and shift the country from the stagnant economic track it listlessly followed for years.
A series of recent scandals, mostly at the regional level, wore away voter confidence in Italy's political class. A poll published on Sunday by Corriere della Sera showed that nearly 50 percent of voters were undecided or planned to abstain from the elections, expected in April.

HEADLINE: Turkey's Opening Comes With Catch

BYLINE: By JON GORVETT

 BODY:
ISTANBUL -- Recent changes to Turkey's real estate laws that allow more foreigners to buy property have given a boost to sales.
Yet, even as lawyers and real estate agents confidently say the changes will increase Turkey's attractiveness to foreigners, new visa regulations and uncertainty about residence permits may prove difficult for buyers intending to visit their new homes.
The revisions, which were passed in May but only came into effect Aug. 18, add citizens of 130 countries to the previous list of 53 whose citizens may buy residences or limited amounts of land in Turkey. (The final list is awaiting approval by the Turkish cabinet. Until then the newly added citizens must wait, though it appears some sales have moved forward regardless.) 
The changes also make it easier for subsidiaries of foreign companies to buy real estate in this Eastern Mediterranean country.
Over all, agents say, the changes could give a welcome fillip to the high-end real estate sector, where activity has been steady this year even though demand from traditional buyers in Europe has been held back by economic concerns.
''This is very important for us in the sector and for the economy as a whole,'' said Arman Ozver, general manager of Sotheby's International Real Estate in Istanbul. ''In 2009, foreigners spent around $1.5 billion on Turkish real estate. We are now expecting at least four or five times that figure in 2013.''
The latest figures from the Turkish Economy Ministry show that, from January to July this year, real estate sales were up 7.6 percent from the period last year.
The increase is widely credited to local residents and foreigners already allowed to buy who are making purchases now with the expectation that prices will increase as demand rises.
Until now, only citizens of countries allowing reciprocal real estate purchasing rights for Turkish citizens, like Britain, Germany and the Netherlands, were allowed to buy in Turkey.
Onur Gulsaran, a partner at the Istanbul law firm Cerrahoglu, said, ''individuals from many more countries -- mainly Arab and Central Asian ones -- will now be able to buy in Turkey without reference to reciprocity.''
In the past those foreigners could buy only after setting up a Turkish-registered company, which would purchase the property. It was not a popular procedure.
The latest figures from the General Directorate of Title and Title Registries show that, as of end of August 2012, Bahrainis owned just eight properties in Turkey and Saudi Arabians, 53.
In contrast, the figures show some 38,691 properties directly owned by Germans, the largest group of foreign property owners, and 1,182 by U.S. citizens.
Yet now, ''the Arab states alone have the potential to add a further $2 billion to the Turkish real estate market,'' said Hakan Yener, Turkish district council coordinator for the Urban Land Institute, a nonprofit education and research organization. ''Demand from them is likely to be more in high-end projects and Bosporus-side mansions.''
Isik Gokkaya, chairman of the Turkish Association of Real Estate Investment Companies, added, ''It's expected that there will be an increase in projects specifically targeting Arabs in the longer term.''
Opening to Arab buyers could allow Turkish sellers to take advantage of the turmoil in the region. ''The numbers of people coming from the Middle East could rise a lot,'' said Orhan Yavuz Mavioglu, a managing partner and real estate expert with the Istanbul law firm ADMD Law. ''The region is boiling and everyone is trying to leave.''
''We closed three deals last week alone, all from Middle Eastern countries,'' Mr. Ozver of Sotheby's said. ''Because Turkey is close to that region, both geographically and culturally, it is easy for them to come here.''
Russians also are free to buy now, a change that is expected to see house sales increase in areas already popular with that country's tourists, like Antalya and the southern Turkish coast.
When it comes to land, a foreigner from one of the approved countries now can buy as much as 300,000 square meters, or almost 75 acres, of land. That is an increase from the 25,000 square meters previously allowed, provided the buyer shows evidence that he intends to build on the purchase within two years.
Previously, a foreigner also needed permission from the military, granted on a case-by-case basis, to buy land.
The latest list of countries whose citizens are allowed to purchase land or properties -- the list that is awaiting cabinet approval -- maintains at least some of the previous restrictions when it comes to citizens of Greece, a neighbor that has a long history of strained relations with Turkey.
Residents of Armenia, which is not recognized by Turkey, continue to be denied any right to buy.
The second major change in the law allows Turkish subsidiaries of foreign companies where the foreign share is less than 50 percent to have unrestricted purchases. Previously, the foreign share of a company had to be just 10 percent or less.
Yet despite optimism among some brokers and industry observers, others point to a major drawback: troubling new visa rules.
''Previously, a visitor from Europe or the U.S. could come here on a 90-day tourist visa, leave for a day and then come back for a further 90 days,'' said Mr. Gulsaran of the law firm Cerrahoglu, which also specializes in immigration issues. ''If you wanted to buy here, but not be resident, this was fine.
''Yet earlier this year they also changed the visa rules so you could only stay here for 90 days in every 180 days,'' he added. ''And if you are from a non-Western country, that period is even smaller.''
In addition, ''the local police still decide in Turkey if you will get a residence permit, and owning a property here is still no guarantee you will get one,'' said Mr. Mavioglu of ADMD Law.
''This is the missing link,'' said Mr. Ozver of Sotheby's. ''It should be made very easy to get a residency permit if you buy a house, and the Turkish government must come up with some solution to this.''
A temporary stay of the change, introduced after many foreigners had to leave the country in February, expired in August with no new regulation in place. ''The government will have to do something,'' Mr. Mavioglu said. ''I mean, why would anyone buy a house here, if they couldn't stay in it?''

HEADLINE: Europe to Seek Trade Penalties From U.S.

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK

 BODY:
PARIS -- The European Union inched closer to a trans-Atlantic trade war on Thursday, saying that it would seek to impose up to $12 billion a year in sanctions against the United States in retaliation for U.S. government subsidies to Boeing.
The European Commission, the E.U. executive, said it was seeking the sanctions to compensate for the impact of illegal subsidies to Boeing that it said gave Boeing an unfair advantage over its European archrival, Airbus. The move, which follows a similar trade threat against Europe made by Washington this year, is the latest salvo in a seven-year battle over aircraft subsidies. 
A World Trade Organization appellate body affirmed in March that Boeing had received at least $5 billion in improper subsidies from the U.S. government to develop the 787 Dreamliner and other aircraft. But in a separate case, the organization found that Airbus had benefited from four decades of improper subsidies from European governments. The W.T.O. ordered both sides to end the subsidies.
In a statement, the European Commission said it had decided to ask the W.T.O. for permission to impose trade sanctions after reviewing a list of remedies submitted this week by the U.S. Trade Representative -- remedies the commission said were insufficient.
The commission said it had acted because ''the United States had not lived up to its obligation to remove its illegal subsidies in the aircraft sector, as required by the W.T.O. rulings that clearly condemned U.S. subsidies to Boeing.''
In a statement, the W.T.O. said that the European request was expected to be formally submitted at a meeting of the organization's dispute settlement body on Oct. 23.
The W.T.O. has also concluded that Airbus, a unit of European Aeronautic Defense & Space, received $15 billion in loans from European governments at below-market interest rates, as well as several billion dollars in grants to build the A380 superjumbo and five other best-selling models.
The trade panel did not quantify the savings from the lower interest rates, but said that without the loans, Airbus could not have introduced many of its models when it did.
In April, Washington rejected the European Union's list of remedies to eliminate the subsidies to Airbus that the W.T.O. had deemed illegal. The U.S. government said it would seek the trade body's approval to impose $7 billion to $10 billion in retaliatory measures. A W.T.O panel was expected to rule on that request around the end of this year.
On Sunday, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said Washington had eliminated certain payments that Boeing had been receiving from the Defense Department and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. A number of tax breaks and beneficial funding programs to Boeing had also been removed, the trade representative said. The European Commission said Tuesday, however, that these steps did not fully offset the adverse trade effects to Airbus.
Charlie Miller, a Boeing spokesman, said he was not surprised by the Union's move but declined to offer further comment.
Nkenge Harmon, a spokeswoman for the U.S. trade office, said Washington remained ''confident'' that the remedies announced Sunday had brought the United States into '' full compliance'' with its W.T.O. obligations.
In a document filed with the W.T.O., the European Commission did not specify what form its sanctions would take. It said a list would be drafted ''in due course'' and did not say what type of goods and services might be targeted.
In a statement, Airbus said it was grateful to the European Commission for ''taking consequential action'' on its behalf but stressed that it was still prepared to seek a negotiated settlement of the dispute.
''We regret that Boeing continues a legal battle that should have long been resolved by a mutual agreement,'' said Maggie Bergsma, an Airbus spokeswoman. ''We made offers time and again, but are ready to fight it through if the other side wishes to do so.''
Trade experts said they hoped the two sides would eventually return to the negotiating table.
''Given the size of damage claims on both sides, my guess is that the case will become the lead item for U.S.-E.U. trade negotiations in 2013,'' Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said by e-mail.
Some observers noted that the Union's move came just two weeks after Airbus's parent company, EADS, announced that it was in talks about a possible $49 billion merger with BAE Systems of Britain. The combined company would eclipse Boeing as the world's largest defense and aerospace group.
But while the timing was perhaps politically awkward, few analysts expected the latest trade flare-up to influence U.S. regulators charged with reviewing the combination of EADS and BAE.
''I'd rather hope that all of these decisions are in the hands of independent authorities,'' said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace consultant at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. ''Right now, I don't think it matters. Both sides are going to continue doing exactly what they want to support their industries in economic times like these.''

HEADLINE: Israeli Foreign Ministry Calls for More Sanctions on Iran

BYLINE: By ISABEL KERSHNER

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- An internal report prepared by Israel's Foreign Ministry calls for an additional round of international sanctions against Iran, an Israeli official confirmed on Thursday, in what appeared to be a rare Israeli acknowledgment that there might still be time to try to stop the Iranian nuclear program by means other than military action.
Details of the report were leaked to Haaretz and were published on Thursday morning as the prime minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, was on his way to New York to address the United Nations General Assembly. An Israeli official who is familiar with the report, but was not authorized to speak about it to it publicly, confirmed the points that appeared in Haaretz. 
The Foreign Ministry report states that the international sanctions already imposed on Iran are having a deep effect on the country's economy, according to the official, and may, according to some assessments, also be affecting the stability of the Iranian government. But the sanctions have not yet persuaded the government in Tehran to suspend its nuclear drive. Therefore, the report concludes that ''another round of sanctions is needed,'' the official said.
The question of how to deal with Iran's nuclear drive has become an acute source of tension between Mr. Netanyahu and the Obama administration. Israel views a nuclear Iran as an existential threat. Mr. Netanyahu has argued that sanctions have not worked and that time is running out to stop Iran from achieving a nuclear military capability.
President Obama opposes military action at this point, saying that there is still ''time and space'' to resolve the issue through diplomacy and pledging that the United States will do what it must to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Iran insists that its nuclear program is for purely civilian purposes.
Mr. Obama has also rejected Mr. Netanyahu's demands to set clear ''red lines'' for Iran.
But there appears to be an effort by Israeli officials to smooth relations with Washington and lower the tone of the public argument.
''I think that this whole matter of red lines should be made, but not publicly,'' Israel's deputy foreign minister, Danny Ayalon, told Israel Radio on Thursday. ''And I think that at the moment, the talks between us and the Americans, which are excellent, are precisely about this.''
Mr. Ayalon added: ''We are constantly coming closer in our positions, and this is because, among other reasons, Iranian activity continues without a break. And the more the Iranians defy the entire world, this coming closer will ultimately reach a point that we are united in our positions.''
The timing of the leak to Haaretz raised questions among Israelis. It was unclear whether the Foreign Ministry, led by Avigdor Lieberman, was sending a pointed message of its own to counter the usually belligerent tone of Mr. Netanyahu, or whether the leak was coordinated with the prime minister and intended to send a more conciliatory message from Israel to Washington.
Mr. Netanyahu called for economic sanctions against Iran to be intensified at a meeting with the Italian foreign minister earlier this month.
Citing an Israeli Foreign Ministry official, Haaretz said Iran had suffered a 50 percent decline in its oil exports as a result of sanctions by the European Union and other countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan and South Korea. As a result, the country's oil revenues have declined by $40 billion since the beginning the year, it said.
Sanctions on the Iranian central bank have hampered the government's access to its foreign currency reserves and prices of basic necessities have risen sharply, it added. Haaretz said the internal Israeli report was based partly on assessments provided by countries that maintain embassies in Tehran.
But at the same time on Thursday, Israel's defense minister, Ehud Barak, underlined Israel's readiness to act militarily if faced with no alternative, and reiterated the Israeli doctrine of self-reliance when it comes to national security.
Speaking at a memorial ceremony for the soldiers who fell in the 1973 Yom Kippur war, Mr. Barak said the clear message to be learned on this anniversary was ''not to be captivated by false hopes, aspirations or wishes.''
''In the ultimate test, we can rely only on ourselves,'' he said.
Mr. Barak added that it was the government's responsibility to do everything possible to ''break the circle of hostility'' without resorting to war, but that if left with no choice, Israel was ready to fight any battle demanded of it ''even at a painful price.''

HEADLINE: Italian Prime Minister Says He'd Consider Another Term

BYLINE: By ELISABETTA POVOLEDO

ROME -- Mario Monti, the economist chosen as a stopgap prime minister of Italy after the collapse of Silvio Berlusconi's government last November, said Thursday that he would consider staying on for another term in office if elections scheduled for next spring do not produce a strong majority for any party coalition. 
Mr. Monti said he hoped that the voting would yield a ''clear result'' and a ''government led by a political leader.'' But opinion polls now indicate that the elections may yield another deadlock, and if that happens, Mr. Monti said, he would think about leading another government if asked. ''I will consider, I cannot preclude anything,'' he said at a seminar at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.
It is the first time that Mr. Monti, a former European Union commissioner, has publicly mentioned the possibility of remaining prime minister after the election.
When he was appointed after the conservative Berlusconi government fell under intense financial and market pressures, his mandate was to form a nonpartisan cabinet of experts, pass austerity measures, hold elections, hand off to the winner and step back.
Mr. Monti made clear on Thursday that any future involvement he had in government would also be nonpolitical in nature.
His current government is supported by a broad coalition of political parties that would ordinarily oppose one another, and Mr. Monti said that he had purposefully not aligned himself with any party so as not to destabilize ''the smooth functioning of the government.'' He said he would consider a new mandate only if the political parties asked it of him; as a senator for life, he has no need to run for election.
To restore market confidence, over the past 10 months in office Mr. Monti's government has tackled a number of measures meant to rein in Italy's high public debt and extract the country from the economic stagnation it has suffered for years. Its nonpartisan nature allowed it to pass measures that would have remained stalled in wrangling under ordinary partisan politics.
Public confidence in Italy's leaders has been eroded in recent months by a series of scandals, mostly at the regional level of government, involving political parties of every stripe.
A poll published by the Milan daily newspaper Corriere della Sera on Sunday indicated that nearly 50 percent of Italian voters were undecided or planned not to vote in the next elections, which will most likely be held in April 2013. About 14 percent of respondents said they were inclined to support fringe parties and protest movements that disparage the mainstream political class. None of the major parties drew enough support in the poll to form a government.

Full reviews of recent jazz performances: nytimes.com/jazz.
Howard Alden-Anat Cohen Duo (Thursday) Howard Alden, a guitarist, and Anat Cohen, a clarinetist and tenor saxophonist, are conversant in swing and earlier jazz. The duo is a semi-regular format for them, and it should work nicely in such an intimate room. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Bar Next Door, 129 Macdougal Street, near West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 529-5945, lalanternacaffe.com; $12 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Nate Chinen)
'Bouncin' With Bud' (Friday and Saturday) In what's becoming a welcome tradition, Birdland presents its birthday tribute to Bud Powell, the quintessential bebop pianist. Holding down the piano chair this year is Dan Tepfer, a meticulous young rhapsodist; the band's front line consists of the alto saxophonist Greg Osby and the trumpeter Tim Hagans, two assertive improvisers, each with his own means of grabbing attention. In the rhythm section are the bassist Lonnie Plaxico and the drummer Matt Wilson: stabilizer and catalyst. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; $30 and $40 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) 
Willem Breuker Kollektief (Thursday) Willem Breuker, who died in 2010, was a Dutch composer and multireedist whose jump-cut style and theatrical panache made him a contrarian hero of European jazz. His long-running signature band, the Kollektief, is now carrying on his legacy with an American tour bearing the handle ''Willem Breuker: 45 Years Composing His World.'' At 8 p.m., Shapeshifter Lab, 18 Whitwell Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, shapeshifterlab.com; $15. (Chinen)
The Brubeck Brothers Quartet (Sunday) Over the years Chris Brubeck, a bassist and trombonist, and Dan Brubeck, a drummer, have found many ways to honor their father, Dave Brubeck, the influential pianist and composer. Their latest is ''LifeTimes'' (Blue Forest), an energetic tribute album that's sure to provide some of the repertory here. At 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, iridiumjazzclub.com; $30 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

&#x2605; Ravi Coltrane Quartet (Tuesday through Oct. 7) The implicit hope for ''Spirit Fiction,'' Ravi Coltrane's Blue Note debut, was that it would represent a clear step forward. And by that token Mr. Coltrane, an unflappable tenor and soprano saxophonist, succeeded handsomely, spotlighting both his longtime quartet and a reunited cohort from his past. This engagement presents neither of those, instead featuring a new band with the excellent young Cuban pianist David Virelles, the stalwart bassist Robert Hurst and the nimble drummer Greg Hutchinson.

Noah Preminger Group (Saturday) The resourceful young tenor saxophonist Noah Preminger has a dry but pliable tone, and a great reserve of ideas -- as well as this strong working band, with Ben Monder on guitar, Matt Pavolka on bass and Colin Stranahan on drums. The group appears at this Sound It Out series event in advance of recording Mr. Preminger's next album for the Palmetto label. At 7:30 p.m., Greenwich House Music School, 46 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 242-4770, noahpreminger.com; $12. (Chinen)
&#x2605; Kurt Rosenwinkel Standards Trio (Friday through Sunday) A few years ago the brilliant guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel released ''Reflections'' (Wommusic), an album of common-language jazz compositions as interpreted, with luminescent ease, in a trio format. He's after the same idea here, working with the bassist Ugonna Okegwo and the drummer Colin Stranahan. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; $25 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)
&#x2605; John Scofield Trio (Tuesday through Oct. 7) Low-key and temperate enough to be an easy-listening record, ''A Moment's Peace'' (Emarcy) -- the most recent album by the guitarist John Scofield, encompassing standards of jazz and pop -- nevertheless simmers with intent. The energy onstage should suggest more of a rolling boil next week, as Mr. Scofield reconnects with one of his best working bands, an alert and soulful trio featuring the bassist Steve Swallow and the drummer Bill Stewart. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; $35 cover at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)
&#x2605; Skirl Records Festival (Monday) Skirl, a Brooklyn label run by the saxophonist and clarinetist Chris Speed, gives itself a party next week, with five separate sets of music. Three of those -- by the Ben Holmes Quartet, the Clarinets and Anthony Burr -- are timed to usher in or preview new releases. Then there's H-Alpha -- an enthusiastically spiky project of the saxophonist Briggan Krauss, with Ikue Mori on electronics and Jim Black on drums -- and a duo consisting of Mr. Speed and the drummer Dave King. At 8 p.m., Shapeshifter Lab, 18 Whitwell Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, shapeshifterlab.com; $20. (Chinen)
Jesse Stacken / 40twenty (Thursday) Mr. Stacken, a pianist and composer, applies an obsessive conceptual rigor to his new album, ''Bagatelles for Trio'' (Fresh Sound New Talent), which negotiates a balance between classical form and jazz improvisation. He works here with the saxophonist Tony Malaby, the bassist Eivind Opsvik and the drummer Tom Rainey, in a 10 p.m. set full of his own music. Playing an earlier set, at 8:30 p.m., is 40twenty, a pliable collective -- the pianist Jacob Sacks, the trombonist Jacob Garchik, the bassist Dave Ambrosio and the drummer Vinnie Sperrazza -- that gets its name from an old-fashioned jazz-club work schedule. At I-Beam Music, 168 Seventh Street, Gowanus, Brooklyn, jessestacken.com, ibeambrooklyn.com; $10 suggested donation. (Chinen)
&#x2605; Toots Thielemans: Celebrating 90 Years (Friday and Saturday) Mr. Thielemans, a harmonica virtuoso of easeful melodic inclination, turned 90 this spring, and just released a live compilation album, ''90 yrs.'' (Challenge), to celebrate the milestone.

At 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; $30 to $120. (Chinen)
&#x2605; Henry Threadgill's Zooid (Saturday) Mr. Threadgill, a penetrating saxophonist, flutist and composer, has long been a maestro of unconventional timbres, bristling counterpoint and tough but slippery rhythms. Zooid, his flagship for more than a decade, features the guitarist Liberty Ellman, the tuba and trombone player Jose Davila, the acoustic bass guitarist Stomu Takeishi and the drummer Elliot Humberto Kavee. A cellist, Christopher Hoffman, was recently added to the roster, with welcome results: consult the fine new album, ''Tomorrow Sunny/The Revelry, Spp'' (Pi), from which this one-nighter seems likely to pull. At 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium Jazz Club, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, theiridium.com; $30 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)
Ben Wendel-Ralph Alessi Quintet (Friday) Ben Wendel, a multireedist in his mid-30s, and Ralph Alessi, a trumpeter closing in on 50, share a fastidious approach to improvisation, but one still committed to discovery. They also share the reins in this ensemble, working with the dynamic rhythm section of Fabian Almazan (piano), Noah Garabedian (bass) and Kendrick Scott (drums). At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; $20 cover, $10 for members. (Chinen)

HEADLINE: Fearing Fiscal Cliff, Investors Cash In and Seek Safety

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
After riding a quarter-long rally fueled by central bankers in Europe and the United States, investors are taking a more defensive posture on fears that politicians could derail the momentum.
When the third quarter comes to an end on Friday, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is set to close up over 5 percent for the quarter and 15 percent for the year, largely because of excitement about the unexpectedly aggressive bond-buying pledges by the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank over the last few months. Speculation on Thursday of impending stimulus from the Chinese government helped push stocks up despite generally downbeat economic data.
With central banks having made their plans clear, investors are training their attention on the outcome of the elections in the United States. They are also awaiting negotiations in Washington over the so-called fiscal cliff, when a series of tax cuts expire at the end of the year. European leaders, meanwhile, have been hesitating on moving forward with bailout programs that were announced over the summer. In both instances, analysts are anticipating that politicians may not act until forced -- setting the markets up for weeks of angst.
''Right now, we're much more defensive than we were a few weeks ago,'' said Martin Leclerc, the founder of Barrack Yard Advisors. 
Mr. Leclerc has shifted 20 percent of his company's assets to the safety of cash in recent weeks. More broadly, investors have spent the final days of the third quarter cashing in their gains on riskier stocks and moving into bonds and safer stocks, like consumer discretionary companies that are not as susceptible to a downturn in the economy.
The benchmark S.& P. 500 index dropped seven of the last nine days, though it rose Thursday 1 percent, or 13.83 points, to 1,447.15. The Dow Jones industrial average finished the day up 0.5 percent, or 72.46 points, to 13,485.97. The Nasdaq composite index ended up 1.4 percent, or 42.90 points, at 3,136.60.
It is not unusual for asset managers to sell stocks near the end of the quarter to make portfolios look more attractive in quarterly reporting documents. But the proportion of investors viewing stock prices as undervalued -- and ripe for purchase -- fell from 48 percent at the beginning of the third quarter to 31 percent in September, according to a survey released Thursday by Russell Investments.
The recent demand for United States Treasury bonds has pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-year note from 1.87 percent in mid-September to 1.61 this week. On Thursday, the 10-year note fell 14/32, to 99 23/32, and the yield rose to 1.66 percent, from 1.61 percent late Wednesday.
For American stocks, the fourth quarters of presidential election years have tended to provide good returns, particularly when the incumbent wins, as is currently expected in investor polls. But strategists at Citigroup have estimated that leading indexes could fall 15 to 20 percent if no fiscal policy compromise is reached in Washington before year-end, which would lead to automatic spending cuts and tax increases.
''A lot of the good news has been cooked into the market -- for a moment we are moving into yet another risky period,'' said Jack Malvey, the chief global markets strategist at BNY Mellon Asset Management.
Since the market began to recover from the financial crisis in March 2009, stocks have faced broad weakness in the global economy and several crises that have led to lengthy declines. But none of this has proved fatal to the upward march of share prices, which has pushed the benchmark index up 113 percent since the lows of 2009, bringing it near the highs of 2007.
James W. Paulsen, the chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, said that even if political disagreement knocked stocks off their stride temporarily, he expected markets to continue their broad rally.
''In the last three and a half years we've been given nothing but crisis after crisis to worry about -- the proper thing to do has been to ignore it,'' said Mr. Paulsen.
No matter what the outcome of the political contests, the economy is not expected to show any great signs of strength in the fourth quarter. The Federal Reserve predicted in September that the United States economy would only grow 2 percent this year, the same as 2011. The Commerce Department said on Thursday that growth had been slower than initially thought in the second quarter.
When it comes to corporate profits, analysts are predicting that American companies in the coming weeks will announce that third-quarter earnings fell from the previous year for the first time since 2009.
Overseas, the situation is more dire. Much of Europe is falling into a recession and continued austerity measures are expected to hamper growth.
But at the beginning of the third quarter there was widespread fear that it would be much worse. Spain and Italy were watching their borrowing costs spike to unsustainable levels and it was not clear that the political will existed to keep the countries in the euro currency. The president of Europe's central bank, Mario Draghi, managed to assuage many of these concerns when he introduced a major program in late August that would buy the bonds of troubled euro zone members to allow them to continue paying creditors.
The yield on the 10-year Spanish bond, which falls as the bonds become more attractive, dropped almost two percentage points from a high of 7.5 percent in late July. In the last week, though, fresh worries have emerged that Spain may not be willing to take the steps necessary to take advantage of the central bank's bond-buying program. On Thursday, investors were heartened by a new Spanish budget that included big cuts, pushing yields down for the day, from 6.06 percent to 5.94 percent.
But Jurgen Odenius, the chief economist at Prudential Fixed Income, said that he expected Spanish politicians to keep investors in limbo and avoid making any big final decisions until after regional elections take place on Oct. 21. ''It creates major uncertainty,'' Mr. Odenius said.
For American investors who have trimmed their exposure to Europe, the more pressing threats comes from the American political scene. A poll of 455 investors by the Bespoke Investment Group found that 52 percent would vote for Mitt Romney but 71 percent expected Barack Obama to win.
Since World War II, the stock market has risen in the fourth quarter every time an incumbent president won except once, in 1948, according to Jeffrey A. Hirsch, editor in chief of the Stock Traders Almanac.
This year, even if President Obama wins it will not be entirely up to him to resolve the tax cuts that are set to expire at the end of the year. If the White House and Congress become deadlocked again, as they did in the summer of 2011, it could lead in 2013 to a drop in spending of $140 billion and an increase in taxes of $531 billion, according to Credit Suisse economists.
Barry Knapp, United States equity strategist at Barclays, said that most investors were operating on the assumption that the politicians would reach an agreement this fall, but he was not confident of that outcome.
''If we don't get compromise, you look at the magnitude of the tax hike we are faced with and it is plenty big enough to send us into recession,'' said Mr. Knapp.

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases: nytimes.com/movies.
'About Cherry' (R, 1:42) The fatal flaw of this well-acted insider's view of the pornographic film industry is its refusal to examine the career of the blasé 18-year-old title character from outside the bubble. In places it feels like an industry recruitment film. (Stephen Holden)
&#x2605; 'Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry' (R, 1:31, in English and Mandarin) In December 2008 a 24-year-old American, Alison Klayman, as a favor to a friend, started videotaping the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei. Her timing was dazzling as was her perseverance, as becomes clear in this galvanizing portrait of the artist, his work and his times. (Manohla Dargis)
'Arbitrage' (R, 1:40) Richard Gere plays a New York hedge-fund magnate whose glittering world may be coming undone in Nicholas Jarecki's sleek entertainment about how very good greed can be. A fairy tale masquerading as a tragedy, the film features Susan Sarandon as the wife and Brit Marling as the doting daughter. (Dargis) 
'Barfi!' (No rating, 2:05, in Hindi) This engagingly odd Hindi romantic comedy stars Ranbir Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra: He's deaf and mute; she's autistic; they fall in love. Featuring long sequences with minimal or no dialogue, the movie, written and directed by Anurag Basu, sometimes seems mawkish and the comedy tends toward pathos. But ''Barfi!'' is also a particularly pure expression of one Bollywood's most cherished themes: love conquers all. (Rachel Saltz)
&#x2605; 'Beasts of the Southern Wild' (PG-13, 1:33) A blast of joyful, chaotic emotion from the bayou, Benh Zeitlin's dazzling film is a homegrown magic-realist fable of defiance in the face of hardship. A community in a stretch of coastal Louisiana called the Bathtub is menaced by storms and government benevolence. Their ordeal is narrated by a young girl named Hushpuppy (Quvenzhané Wallis), who lives with her father, Wink (Dwight Henry), and who belongs in the tradition of Huck Finn, Scout Finch, Eloise and other indomitable American child heroes. (A. O. Scott)
'The Bourne Legacy' (PG-13, 2:05) Less a thrilling franchise reboot than a solid salvage mission, the fourth installment of the ''Bourne'' spy series replaces Matt Damon with a sympathetic Jeremy Renner, who handles the action persuasively even if the fight sequences lack a sense of regret or even sorrow. As viewers are whisked from location to location, it feels as if the director, Tony Gilroy, is trying too hard to match the accelerated tempo of the previous films. (Dargis)
'The Campaign' (R, 1:25) Two nincompoops run against each other for a seat in Congress. It's not a documentary, but a silly, not very outrageous comedy starring Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'Compliance' (R, 1:30) Raising troubling questions about the influence of class and education on our response to authority, Craig Zobel's squirmy psychological horror movie, based on a series of hoaxes at fast-food restaurants nationwide, is a slow-motion punch to the groin. (Jeannette Catsoulis)
'Cosmopolis' (R, 1:48) David Cronenberg directs this cold, funny adaptation of the 2003 Don DeLillo novel starring Robert Pattinson as a zomboid billionaire, one of the limo-riding masters of the universe who, over the course of a long day and night, loses a great deal and, by doing so, becomes human. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'The Dark Knight Rises' (PG-13, 2:44) After seven years and two films that have pushed Batman (Christian Bale) ever deeper into the dark, the director Christopher Nolan has completed his postmodern, post-Sept. 11 epic of ambivalent good versus multidimensional evil with a burst of light. (Dargis)
'Detropia' (No rating, 1:33) A visual caress of postindustrial blight, Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady's dreamy documentary about a slowly crumbling Detroit places information and analysis distant seconds to mood and impression. (Catsoulis)
'Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel' (PG-13, 1:26) A dizzily enjoyable documentary from Lisa Immordino Vreeland about Diana Vreeland, the famous fashion editor and paradigmatic self-made woman who had a genius for the inspirational, the gnomic and the quotable. (Dargis)
'Dredd 3D' (R, 1:35) Alex Garland wrote and Pete Travis directed this grim, gory adaptation of the British comic series. The setting is a neo-wild West in which the gizmos look futuristic, but everything else is B-movie familiar. Karl Urban stars. (Dargis)
'End of Watch' (R, 1:49) David Ayer's ode to beat cops and the expansive literature on them is a muscular, maddening exploitation movie embellished with art-house style and anchored by solid performances from Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña. (Dargis)
'The Expendables 2' (R, 1:43) Sylvester Stallone returns with his band of aging action stars and a ridiculous amount of ammunition and explosives, bent on avenging a comrade's death and keeping some plutonium out of evil hands. A brief appearance by Chuck Norris provides the best moment of self-parody in a movie that could have used a few more of them. (Neil Genzlinger)
'Hope Springs' (PG-13, 1:32) While this film about a longtime marriage that's gone dry has modest charms to go with its well-matched and practiced pair of wily scene stealers -- Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones working on screen together for the first time -- the industry will have to do better if it wants to convince boomers that there's something for them at the local multiplex other than cartoons and clichés. (Dargis)
'House at the End of the Street' (PG-13, 1:41) This blatant unscary rip-off of ''Psycho'' is an incoherent hybrid of the Hitchcock classic and standard teenage horror films. (Holden)
&#x2605; 'How to Survive a Plague' (No rating, 1:50) The currents of rage, fear, fiery determination and, finally, triumph that crackle through David France's inspiring documentary lend this history of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or Act Up, a scorching electrical charge. (Holden)
'The Intouchables' (R, 1:52, in French) In this buddy movie from France, a rich white guy (François Cluzet), paralyzed from the neck down, is cared for by an African immigrant (Omar Sy) who teaches his boss to loosen up and appreciate life. The film's unabashed embrace of racial stereotypes may startle American audiences -- the movie was a huge hit in France -- but there is appealing warmth to the performances and an overall mood of friendly tolerance. It's embarrassing, but not as bad as it might have been. (Scott)
'Lawless' (R, 1:55) A blizzard of gunfire and a riot of Southern accents animate this meandering tale of violent bootleggers in Depression-era Virginia. Tom Hardy croaks like a bullfrog, Shia LaBeouf chatters like a chipmunk and Jessica Chastain pours coffee. (Scott)
'Liberal Arts' (No rating, 1:37) This slick, feel-good film about a college admissions counselor who returns to his alma mater has enough dark notes to make the smug, obsequious performance of its star, screenwriter and director, Josh Radnor, tolerable and at times even likable. (Holden)
&#x2605; 'The Master' (R, 2:17) Confounding and amazing, Paul Thomas Anderson's latest film explores the relationship between a cult leader (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and a shellshocked veteran of World War II (Joaquin Phoenix). Must be seen to be believed, and wrestled with for a long time after. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'Moonrise Kingdom' (PG-13, 1:34) In Wes Anderson's latest, a wondrous storybook tale, a girl and a boy, both 12, run off to a remote inlet on an island where most of the adults seem disappointed and more than a little sad. The two are very serious -- about love, their plans, books, life itself -- and often act older than their age. You wonder what their hurry is, given that here adulthood, with its quarrels, regrets and anguished pillow talk, can feel as dangerous as the storm that's hurtling toward the island, ready to blow it all down. With Bill Murray, Bruce Willis and Frances McDormand. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'ParaNorman' (PG, 1:33) This beautiful, charmingly heartfelt 3-D stop-motion animation -- from the studio that produced ''Coraline'' -- centers on an 11-year-old boy who can see ghosts and, with frights and laughter, battles a spirit. Directed by Sam Fell and the movie's screenwriter, Chris Butler. (Dargis)
'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' (PG-13, 1:43) Stephen Chbosky directs this adaptation of his 1999 young adult novel about the ups, downs and playlists of an introverted high school freshman, Charlie (Logan Lerman), who's rescued by the friendships he makes. (Dargis)
'The Possession' (PG-13, 1:32) Perched somewhere between ''The Exorcist'' and ''The Unborn,'' this eerily enjoyable tale from the Danish director Ole Bornedal gives a malevolent box to a troubled young girl, throws in the Hasidic rap artist Matisyahu, and stands back. (Catsoulis)
&#x2605; 'The Queen of Versailles' (PG, 1:40) Lauren Greenfield's documentary follows the shifting fortunes of David and Jackie Siegel, a wealthy Florida couple who dreamed of building the biggest house in America. The movie, which starts out like smirky reality television, turns into something darker and more complex as economic troubles take a toll on the Siegels and the audience becomes better acquainted with them. It's like a Theodore Dreiser novel for our new gilded age. (Scott)
'Radio Unnameable' (No rating, 1:27) This documentary is an affectionate and informative portrait of Bob Fass, voice of the insomniac counterculture on New York's WBAI in the 1960s and '70s. (Scott)
'Resident Evil: Retribution' (R, 1:35) Taking place almost entirely inside airless, computer-simulated locations, this fifth entry in the series finds its caffeinated heroine (Milla Jovovich) still battling zombies, still wearing bondage gear, only now with a daughter -- shamelessly cribbing from ''Aliens'' -- and an alternate suburban reality to protect. (Catsoulis)
'Robot & Frank' (PG-13, 1:30) Jake Schreier directed, from a script by Christopher D. Ford, this eager-to-please story set in the near future about an elderly gent (Frank Langella), his robot (voiced by Peter Sarsgaard) and some awkwardly managed truths about old age. Susan Sarandon also stars. (Dargis)
'Samsara' (PG-13, 1:39) Ron Fricke's new film, like its predecessor, ''Baraka,'' is a free-associative tour of the world, a series of striking, sometimes surreal images of nature, work, life and death in the global economy. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'Searching for Sugar Man' (PG-13, 1:26) There are several entrancing mysteries circulating in Malik Bendjelloul's hugely appealing documentary about fans, faith and an enigmatic Age of Aquarius musician known as Rodriguez, who burned bright and hopeful before disappearing. Don't wait for the DVD. (Dargis)
'Sleepwalk With Me' (No rating, 1:30) The surreal dream sequences in this screen adaptation of Mike Birbiglia's 2008 one-man show -- about a commitment-phobic stand-up comedian with a sleep disorder -- help make this likable movie more than a glorified stand-up act. (Holden)
'Ted' (R, 1:46) Seth MacFarlane, creator of ''The Family Guy,'' takes his provocative humor and his New England-accented voice-over skills to the big screen in this profane, sometimes funny comedy about a talking stuffed animal, the overgrown boy who loves him (Mark Wahlberg) and, somewhat tangentially, the boy's girlfriend (Mila Kunis) who wishes he would just grow up. (Scott)
'To Rome With Love' (R, 1:52) Woody Allen's latest is a mild, silly collection of tales set in the Italian capital, where love is complicated and characters -- both Italian and American -- are baffled, neurotic and always articulate. Mr. Allen plays a semi-retired opera promoter, while Jesse Eisenberg plays the younger Woody Allen type, torn between loyalty to his sensible girlfriend (Greta Gerwig) and her wayward, needy friend (Ellen Page). Alec Baldwin, Penélope Cruz and Roberto Benigni also contribute to this frothy, airy romp through some of Mr. Allen's favorite themes. (Scott)
'Total Recall' (PG-13, 1:58) Colin Farrell, Kate Beckinsale and Jessica Biel star in this chaotic and thoroughly unmemorable science-fiction action movie, loosely remade from a 1990 Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle and even more loosely based on a story by Philip K. Dick. (Scott)
'Trouble With the Curve' (PG-13, 1:51) The latest of Clint Eastwood's grumpy old men is Gus Lobel, a Major League Baseball scout struggling with failing eyesight and a front office full of number-crunching ''Moneyball'' types. On a trip to North Carolina to check out a promising young slugger, Gus and his semi-estranged daughter, Mickey (Amy Adams), do some squabbling and some healing. Mickey, a big-city lawyer, also dabbles in romance with a rival (and former protégé) of her dad's, played by Justin Timberlake. The movie, directed by Mr. Eastwood's protégé Robert Lorenz, is hokey and predictable -- the very title is a spoiler -- but it is also full of warmth, humor and wonderful performances. (Scott)
'The Words' (PG-13, 1:37) Despite a compelling performance from Jeremy Irons, this story within a story about literary plagiarism doesn't bear close scrutiny and has little moral weight. (Holden)
Film Series
'Dial M for Murder' (Friday through Thursday) A new digital restoration of one of the most significant films of the 1950s 3-D craze, which was coming to an end just as Alfred Hitchcock's adaptation of this stage success by Frederick Knott (''Wait Until Dark'') was released. Hitchcock's use of the format was typically thoughtful and carefully calibrated, with no exaggerated depth effects until one climactic moment, when a victim seems to be reaching to the audience for help. Scanned from the original, dual-system camera negative, this new version from Warner Bros. should afford the most accurate viewing of the 3-D version in decades. With Ray Milland, Grace Kelly and John Williams. Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110, filmforum.org; $12.50. (Dave Kehr)
John le Carré (Friday through Wednesday) The romantic and ethical entanglements of John le Carré's spy novels have provided the source material for several distinguished films, most recently Tomas Alfredson's 2011 adaptation of ''Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,'' which screens Friday in this BAMcinématek retrospective. Forthcoming titles include Frank Pierson's 1969 ''The Looking Glass War'' (Saturday); Sidney Lumet's 1966 ''The Deadly Affair'' (Sunday); John Boorman's 2001 ''The Tailor of Panama'' (Monday); Martin Ritt's 1965 ''The Spy Who Came In From the Cold'' (Tuesday); and George Roy Hill's 1984 ''The Little Drummer Girl'' (Wednesday). BAMcinématek, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $12. (Kehr)
Ride, Boldly Ride (Friday through Thursday) A selection of classic westerns presented in conjunction with the publication of ''Ride, Boldy Ride,'' a new survey of the genre by Mary Lea Bandy, the former chief curator of the Museum of Modern Art's Department of Film, and Kevin Stoehr, a professor at Boston University. The series begins, appropriately, with John Ford's first feature, the 1917 ''Straight Shooting'' (Friday at 1:30 p.m.) and continues with Leo McCarey's western comedy ''Ruggles of Red Gap'' (Wednesday and Thursday at 1:30 p.m.). The weeks ahead bring King Vidor's 1940 ''Northwest Passage'' (Oct. 10-12), Ford's 1956 masterpiece ''The Searchers'' (Oct. 17-19) and Clint Eastwood's rueful 1992 ''Unforgiven'' (Oct. 24-26). Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $12. (Kehr)

HEADLINE: At U.N., Myanmar Leader Highlights Steps to Reform

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE; Kim Fararo contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The president of Myanmar, a former general who has led the move away from a prolonged era of dictatorship, poverty and isolation, asserted on Thursday in his first United Nations speech that ''amazing changes'' were transforming his country and could never be reversed.
The president, U Thein Sein, also paid homage to the country's opposition leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and former political prisoner whose liberation from nearly two decades of house arrest in 2010 signaled the beginning of Myanmar's gradual emergence from pariah status. 
''As a Myanmar citizen, I would like to congratulate her for the honors she has received in this country in recognition of her efforts for democracy,''said Mr. Thein Sein in his address to the United Nations General Assembly.
It was the first time that Mr. Thein Sein had praised Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi in such a public way, and appeared to reflect growing confidence that his navigation of Myanmar's political system away from decades of authoritarian rule would not be challenged at home, where many of his colleagues in the military are known to be ambivalent about the changes.
In another first, Mr. Thein Sein's speech was broadcast live in Myanmar, The Associated Press reported, so people at home could see for themselves the president's outspoken tribute to Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, who is widely considered the country's most popular politician and has expressed the hope of becoming president one day.
Mr. Thein Sein spoke a day after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, in a meeting with him, announced that the United States intended to ease a ban on imports from Myanmar, one of the last remaining American sanctions on the country, as a reward for his efforts. The easing could further strengthen Mr. Thein Sein's political stature in Myanmar, where the sanctions are a major impediment to the economy. Mr. Thein Sein was only removed from an American sanctions blacklist last week.
He devoted much of his General Assembly speech to enumerating the political changes in his country, including the creation of an elected legislature, an end to censorship, the granting of amnesty to hundreds of prisoners and the attempt to create a culture of political dialogue and tolerance, where citizens can disagree without fear of retribution.
''Within a short time, the people of Myanmar have been able to bring about amazing changes,'' he said. ''They have been taking tangible, irreversible steps in the democratic reform process.'' Myanmar, he said, ''is now ushering in a new era.''
He also acknowledged the country's litany of problems, including the levels of abject poverty and stunning gaps between rich and poor, and vowed that economic development would not widen those gaps.
The president also said Myanmar was still confronting protracted ethnic insurgencies, including a dispute with the Kachin, a Christian minority near the China border, and the Rohingya Muslims along the Bangladesh border. Myanmar is predominantly Buddhist. ''People inhabiting our country regardless of religion have a right to live in peace and security,'' he said.
Later in an appearance at the Asia Society in New York, the president acknowledged that the era of authoritarian rule in Myanmar had led to a significant exodus of educated people, who are desperately needed back home.
''It's true that many of our citizens -- doctors, engineers and entrepreneurs -- they are working out in foreign countries,'' he said through a translator. ''That might have something to do with the previous political systems.''

HEADLINE: Preseason Canceled; Labor Talks To Resume

BYLINE: By JEFF Z. KLEIN

 BODY:
Formal negotiations are scheduled to resume Friday between N.H.L. Commissioner Gary Bettman and Donald Fehr, the executive director of the N.H.L. Players' Association -- the first formal bargaining since Sept. 12, three days before the lockout began.
Friday's talks are expected to focus on secondary economic issues and will not address the core issue of how to split revenue. 
The remainder of the preseason schedule was canceled Thursday, including a game between the Islanders and the Devils on Tuesday that was to be the first sporting event held at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. The league's regular season is supposed to begin Oct. 11.
In recent days, several figures have voiced fears that the entire season will be lost to the lockout, as the 2004-5 season was. Those included Detroit Red Wings forward Dan Cleary, the former player Bobby Holik and the respected Canadian commentator Bob McKenzie, who said Tuesday, ''I'm not at all optimistic that there's going to be hockey this year.''
But others believe that with their N.H.L. revenue growing robustly each year, to $3.3 billion for last season, the owners have too much at stake to risk the whole season. In 2004-5 Bettman and the owners said the league was deeply in the red.
''I think the owners were willing to lose up to two seasons in the last lockout, but this time around, no,'' said Jonathon Gatehouse, a Canadian business writer and the author of ''The Instigator,'' a new biography of Bettman.
''I buy into the same idea that a lot of people have: There's too much money on the table to leave behind,'' Gatehouse added. ''Just in May, Bettman was at a sports business conference in Boston, talking about how the league has never been in a better place financially.''
He said he would not be surprised if the owners accepted a deal that gave them about 48 percent of the revenue, as opposed to the 43 percent they got in the seven-year collective bargaining agreement that expired Sept. 15. In their current offer, the owners are asking for about 53 percent.
''What's really different this time as opposed to the last lockout, is there's a significant loss for the owners if they don't run the season,'' said Rod Fort, a professor of sports economics at the University of Michigan.
''As soon as play that really matters for the owners' pocketbooks starts to be forgone, about a week before that they'll settle,'' Fort said, estimating that point would arrive by the beginning of November.
But by canceling regular-season games, the owners would also risk the lucrative sales of luxury suites to corporate buyers, said Tony Knopp, the chief executive of Spotlight TMS, a company that manages and tracks corporate ticket sales.
Since the economic collapse in 2008, many corporations have cut back on buying corporate suites and premium seats at N.H.L. arenas, where they can account for more than 40 percent of ticket and suite revenue. If the current lockout drags on much longer, it may induce belt-tightening companies to cut back on ticket purchases still further.
''Those guys leave -- and you're giving them an excuse to leave -- some of those middle-market and low-market N.H.L. teams that are already having trouble financially, they can't compete anymore,'' said Knopp, who works with seven N.H.L. teams, including the Red Wings, the Maple Leafs and the Devils.
He added: ''If the N.H.L. offers them a hand to cut off, well, they're going to do it. I don't think they understand the gravity of that. Once these companies stop buying suites, they're not coming back.''
But Knopp, who worked as a sales executive for the Los Angeles Kings during the 2004-5 lockout, said he was not certain the owners were aware how much revenue was at stake. He cited a conference of luxury suite directors in Minneapolis last June attended by sales executives from several N.H.L. teams.
''What blew everyone's hair back at the conference was the news of corporate cutbacks,'' Knopp said. ''One of our customers went from 100 luxury suites to 65 in the last three years. Another had 17 in all sports and dropped all of them in three years.''

HEADLINE: Nike Profit Falls 12% as Higher Costs Outweigh Strong Sales

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) -- Nike reported on Thursday that its fiscal first-quarter net income fell 12 percent as stronger sales of its clothing and footwear brands were offset by increased costs and advertising spending. 
The company's results, reported after the markets closed, exceeded Wall Street's expectations, but its shares fell more than 3 percent in after-hours trading as investors appeared worried about a slowing of future orders.
Nike, like other consumer product makers, is facing high costs for materials and labor, as well as an uncertain economy in Europe and a slowdown in China. Nike, which is based in Beaverton, Ore., has raised prices and cut costs in response.
Nike, one of the world's largest athletic shoe and clothing companies, said its net income for the three months that ended Aug. 31 fell to $567 million, or $1.23 a share, from $645 million, or $1.36 a share, in the year-earlier period. Analysts on average expected the company to earn $1.12 a share
Revenue rose 10 percent to $6.67 billion from $6.08 billion a year earlier. Analysts expected revenue of $6.43 billion.
Revenue rose 23 percent in North America, Nike's largest market, to $2.7 billion. In Western Europe, revenue fell 5 percent to $1.17 billion. In China, revenue rose 8 percent to $572 million. Revenue in emerging markets rose 8 percent to $867 million.
Selling and administrative expenses rose 18 percent as the company spent heavily on marketing for the Olympics and the European Football Championships.
Future orders -- those scheduled for delivery from September 2012 to January 2013 -- rose 6 percent. That compares with a 16 percent increase in the fiscal first quarter last year.
Greater China was a weak spot, with orders down 5 percent. A year earlier, greater China futures orders surged 27 percent.
Nike's shares finished the regular trading session up 51 cents at $96.

HEADLINE: Weakened, Council Bill On Sick Days Gains Favor

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
A new, watered-down version of a City Council bill that would give workers in New York City paid sick leave is quickly gaining traction among some business groups and union leaders.
The changes, which were proposed in a letter this week by City Councilman Daniel R. Garodnick, would require businesses to allow five paid days for employees. It would exclude seasonal workers, and allow employees, especially at restaurants, to swap shifts rather than take a paid sick day.
The original bill required most businesses with five or more employees to provide up to five days of paid sick leave a year, but also required that those with 20 or more workers provide each with as many as nine paid sick days. That proposal had the support of a veto-proof majority in the City Council, but was opposed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who said it would be ''disastrous'' for the local economy. 
Given the long standoff between business and labor over the issue, any movement toward a compromise would apply more pressure on the Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, a likely candidate for mayor next year.
Despite exhortations from her longtime allies in labor, Ms. Quinn has rebuffed a two-year effort to bring the issue to a vote, saying that the measure would threaten small businesses.
But the version introduced by Mr. Garodnick, who is running for city comptroller next year, got a thumbs-up from more than 100 business owners from all five boroughs, who signed a letter supporting it because it can ''reduce the cost of providing paid sick days for small businesses and ensure flexibility.''
In an interview, Jack Friedman, executive director of the Queens Chamber of Commerce, also called the proposals a ''great framework'' and ''a major step forward.'' But hours later, a flurry of business leaders clarified Mr. Friedman's comments.
''Although Council Member Garodnick's proposed changes to the bill are well meaning, this does not change our position on the paid sick day proposal,'' said Nancy Ploeger, president of the Manhattan Chamber of Commerce, speaking on behalf of the Five Boro Chamber of Commerce Coalition. ''It is an onerous bill that will put more financial burdens on the backs of the small businesses who cannot afford any more mandates and costs.''
For now, at least, the Garodnick proposal has not dimmed the enthusiasm of key labor and other supporters, like the Working Families Party and Make the Road New York.
''The speaker should really seize the opportunity,'' said Hector J. Figueroa, president-elect of Local 32BJ of the Service Employees International Union. ''It takes us several yards forward and takes us closer to scoring. We should not let this opportunity be wasted.''
And City Councilwoman Gale A. Brewer, the sponsor of the original legislation, said that she was so encouraged by Mr. Garodnick's ''great ideas'' that she expected to amend the bill in the next month or two, and hold a hearing by the end of the year.
Asked about the new bill, Maria Alvarado, a spokeswoman for Ms. Quinn, said in a statement: ''Speaker Quinn looks forward to reviewing Council Member Garodnick's proposals. As she has stated before, given the current economic reality, now is not the right time for this policy.''
San Francisco, Seattle and Washington have passed similar legislation, and Connecticut passed a statewide law last year.
Some prominent supporters of Ms. Quinn's campaign, including Gloria Steinem, have said that their backing of Ms. Quinn was conditional on Ms. Quinn's bringing the paid-sick-day bill to a vote. And Mr. Garodnick said Thursday that the timing of his compromise was optimal, given next year's elections.
''It's time to move this forward and do it at a time when everyone is engaged legislatively,'' he said.

HEADLINE: John Silber Dies at 86; Led Boston University

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN; Paul Vitello contributed reporting.

 BODY:
John R. Silber, who transformed a faltering Boston University into one of the nation's leading private schools in a volcanic 25-year presidency that promoted innovation, crushed opposition and made him America's highest-paid educator and one of its most divisive, died on Thursday morning at his home in Brookline, Mass. He was 86.
His daughter Ruth Silber-Belmonte confirmed the death. Dr. Silber had been treated for kidney disease.
A philosopher by training but a fighter by instinct, Dr. Silber believed in old-fashioned hard work and academic excellence. He arrived in Boston when protests against every value he cherished were sweeping campuses across the country. He waded in, and from 1971 to 1996 ruled B.U. with a tigerish ferocity that delighted admirers and enraged critics. There were plenty of both. 
He took a leave in 1990 to be the Democratic candidate for governor of Massachusetts. While he lost narrowly to the Republican, William F. Weld, there was talk of a presidential race. But he returned to academic life, was the university chancellor from 1996 to 2003, and retired as president emeritus with a multimillion-dollar package that touched off one more controversy in a career filled with them.
A short, tough Texan born with a withered right arm into a family of strict Presbyterians who never told him of his father's Jewish forebears or of an aunt gassed at Auschwitz, Dr. Silber had fought battles all his life: against taunting bullies as a boy, academic rivals as a University of Texas professor and restive students, professors and alumni at Boston University.
In a struggle often played out in the national news media, Dr. Silber survived sit-ins, street protests, strikes, mass resignations, death threats, a suspicious fire that destroyed his home, a Civil Liberties Union lawsuit, federal and state investigations touching on his financial dealings, and critics who called him a tyrant and worse.
But he built B.U. into a world-class research center and one of the nation's largest private universities, with a faculty boasting Nobel laureates like Elie Wiesel, Saul Bellow and Derek Walcott and distinguished economists, historians and physicists.
He raised endowments to $422 million from $18 million and research grants to $180 million from $15 million, and balanced the budget every year. He raised tuition to Ivy League levels and tightened admission standards, but enrollments nevertheless climbed to 30,000 from 20,000. He also financed $700 million in new construction and tripled the university's property holdings.
In 1989, in one of many innovations, the university took over the public school system of Chelsea, Mass., a suburb of 28,000 northeast of Boston with many minority students from poor families. The partnership with the schools lasted through June 2008.
Dr. Silber was perennially the nation's highest-paid university president, with salaries that topped $800,000, twice that of Harvard's president, and he received even more as chancellor and in retirement. In 2005, two years after he resigned, he collected $6.1 million, a record severance package from a university, including deferred compensation and a lifetime home in Brookline. There was an outcry from educational councils, but Dr. Silber and the university he rescued insisted it was justified.
John Robert Silber was born on Aug. 15, 1926, in San Antonio. His father, Paul, was a German-immigrant architect whose work dried up in the Depression. His mother, the former Jewell Joslin, a teacher, supported the family. It was a cultured household, fluent in German, with Bible verses memorized, chores performed, schoolwork mastered. John learned to use his right arm, which ended in a stump below the elbow, as a weapon against bullies.
He graduated with high honors in philosophy from Trinity University in San Antonio in 1947, and married his college debating partner, Kathryn Underwood. They had two sons and six daughters. Mrs. Silber died in 2005. Their son David died of AIDS in 1994.
Besides Ms. Silber-Belmonte, Dr. Silber is survived by his daughters Rachel Devlin, Martha Hathaway, Judith Ballan, Alexandra Silber and Caroline Lavender; another son, Charles Hiett; a brother, Paul; 26 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
After graduating from Trinity, Dr. Silber considered the ministry and attended Yale Divinity School for a year, then studied law at the University of Texas at Austin. But, resuming his undergraduate major, he settled on philosophy and earned a master's degree from Yale in 1952. He taught philosophy there for several years while working on the doctorate he received in 1956.
In 1957, he returned to Texas as an assistant professor of philosophy. He was an exacting, charismatic teacher who supported racial integration and Head Start preschool programs while opposing capital punishment. On a Fulbright scholarship, he went to Germany in 1959 and taught a year at Bonn University. There, he learned of his father's heritage and his aunt's fate at Auschwitz.
Back at Austin, he became a full professor and department chairman in 1962, then dean of the College of Arts and Sciences in 1967. In three years he replaced 22 department heads. But by 1970, his liberal politics and executive aspirations had brought him into conflict with the chairman of the Board of Regents, Frank C. Erwin Jr. Dr. Silber was dismissed as dean and began looking for a new job.
The presidency of Boston University was vacant, but a bleak prospect. The university, founded as a Methodist seminary in 1839, had always been open to both sexes and all races and religions. Graduates included the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. But falling enrollments and growing deficits had reduced it to mediocrity in the shadow of Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology across the Charles River.
In his interview, Dr. Silber shocked the search committee. He called the campus ugly, bemoaned a faculty laden with ''deadwood'' and said the university might be dying. The committee was appalled, but enthralled by his ideas. He was hired -- and soon plunged into conflicts.
He called the police to break up protests against military recruiters on campus. He froze salaries, cut budgets and refused to negotiate with professors, who eventually organized a union. There were petitions for his removal and strikes by professors, clerks and librarians. A Massachusetts Civil Liberties Union lawsuit claimed he had threatened to fire opponents. Hundreds quit. But his changes proceeded, backed by trustees and many alumni.
In 1992, a state investigation of university contracts with companies tied to trustees found that Dr. Silber had received a $386,700 bonus for helping to sell Seradyn Inc., a university biotech company. He returned the bonus and was cleared of wrongdoing.
An authority on the 18th-century philosopher Immanuel Kant, Dr. Silber lectured widely and became an advocate for traditional and early childhood education. He was an occasional White House guest, and President Ronald Reagan named him in 1983 to a commission that reviewed United States policies on Central America. The elder President George Bush spoke at a B.U. commencement.
Dr. Silber's 1989 book, ''Straight Shooting: What's Wrong With America and How to Fix It,'' was a manifesto for his race for governor, attacking Communism, sexual promiscuity and other targets. After his defeat, he was named chairman of the Massachusetts Board of Education by Governor Weld, a post he held until 1999. In 2007 he wrote ''Architecture of the Absurd,'' a scathing critique of that profession.
In his twilight as chancellor, the word on campus was that Dr. Silber had mellowed. But he railed against ''love nests'' when students asked to have overnight guests in dorm rooms, and he closed a student club that tried to bring gay and straight students together. There were more protests.

HEADLINE: Charges of Bias in Admission Test Policy at Eight Elite Public High Schools

BYLINE: By AL BAKER; Juliet Linderman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A coalition of educational and civil rights groups filed a federal complaint on Thursday saying that black and Hispanic students were disproportionately excluded from New York City's most selective high schools because of a single-test admittance policy they say is racially discriminatory.
The complaint, filed with the United States Education Department, seeks to have the policy found in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and to change admissions procedures ''to something that is nondiscriminatory and fair to all students,'' said Damon T. Hewitt, a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, one of the groups that filed the complaint. 
At issue is the Specialized High School Admissions Test, which is the sole criterion for admission to eight specialized schools that, even in the view of city officials, have been troubled by racial demographics that are out of balance.
Although 70 percent of the city's public school students are black and Hispanic, a far smaller percentage have scored high enough to receive offers from one of the schools. According to the complaint, 733 of the 12,525 black and Hispanic students who took the exam were offered seats this year. For whites, 1,253 of the 4,101 test takers were offered seats. Of 7,119 Asian students who took the test, 2,490 were offered seats. At Stuyvesant High School, the most sought-after school, 19 blacks were offered seats in a freshman class of 967.
''I refuse to believe there are only 19 brilliant African-Americans in the city; it simply cannot be the case,'' Mr. Hewitt said. ''It is a shameful practice and it must be changed.''
The test-only rule has existed for decades, as have complaints about its effect on minority enrollment. In May 1971, after officials began thinking about adding other criteria for admission, protests from many parents, mostly white, persuaded the State Legislature to enshrine the rule in state law.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said at a news conference on Thursday that the schools were ''designed for the best and the brightest'' and that he saw no need to change the admissions policy or state law.
''I think that Stuyvesant and these other schools are as fair as fair can be,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''There's nothing subjective about this. You pass the test, you get the highest score, you get into the school -- no matter what your ethnicity, no matter what your economic background is. That's been the tradition in these schools since they were founded, and it's going to continue to be.''
A bill introduced in the Assembly last session sought to give the city power over admissions to the schools. But it was not brought to a vote, said Michael Whyland, a spokesman for the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver. ''We'll look at the issue and study it,'' Mr. Whyland said. ''Of course we want to make sure everyone has equal access to all our schools.''
A city Education Department spokeswoman, Deidrea Miller, said the department ''has launched several initiatives to improve diversity.'' Those include a free test-preparation course aimed at poor students.
Daren Briscoe, a spokesman for the federal Education Department, said the complaint ''has been received and is under review.''
The complaint does not claim the test is culturally biased. But it says that its use has led to racial disparities and that there is no conclusive data showing the test predicts a student's success.
Chester E. Finn Jr., president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, an education policy group, said that in researching 165 selective high schools around the country, he found that New York City's specialized schools were the only ones that used a single test as the sole admission criterion. Others use multiple factors including grades, teacher recommendations, essays and interviews.
''They are more like college admissions procedures, or private colleges, that try to look at a kid holistically,'' said Mr. Finn, who, with Jessica Hockett, was a co-author of the recent book ''Exam Schools: Inside America's Most Selective Public High Schools.''
But he said New York's law was less worrisome to him considering the ''dozens and dozens'' of other academically high-powered schools in the city that do not use the test. ''The larger challenge for the city is to prepare its minority children so that they will do well on the various screening requirements for the city's large number of good high schools, including the ones that require this test.''
Most students interviewed Thursday at the Bronx High School of Science, one of the oldest specialized schools, said Thursday that they did not believe the test was discriminatory. When asked the uncomfortable question of why the racial imbalance existed, some students mentioned the intensive tutoring services that are out of reach of poorer families. But others did not hesitate to say that they believed the family culture of Asian and white students put a higher value on educational achievement than others.
''African-American and Hispanic parents don't always seek out extra help for their kids and their kids don't score as high,'' said Manjit Singh, a senior. ''But it's the same test for everyone, so how can it be discriminatory? If you can't handle the test, you can't handle the school, and you're taking up someone else's spot.''
Noah Morrison, a senior who is black, was not ready to change the policy, either, but he agreed that ''there needs to be more racial diversity at this school.''
''There are no black people and it's horrible,'' he said. ''The test is fine, but there need to be more opportunities for people to do well on it. There need to be more test-prep programs in underachieving middle schools with high black and Latino populations. It's a socioeconomic problem.''

HEADLINE: Standard Chartered's Next Worry Is a $1 Billion Loan in Indonesia

BYLINE: By PETER EAVIS and MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
Standard Chartered is facing another potential headache.
The British bank, which has just settled accusations of money-laundering with New York State's top banking regulator for $340 million, may be at risk of losing money on a $1 billion loan to an Indonesian mining company to make an investment that has since soured.
The exposure highlights Standard Chartered's reliance on often unstable emerging markets for the majority of its income. The bank, based in London, earned around 90 percent of its $2.86 billion net profit from developing countries like China and India in the first half of the year. 
The bank's strategy is not risk free.
In January, Standard Chartered lent $1 billion to PT Borneo Lumbung Energi and Metal, a coal mining company based in Jakarta and owned by the Indonesian billionaire Samin Tan.
PT Borneo used the money to buy a 23.8 percent stake in Bumi, a company that owns Indonesian coal mining assets and is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Mr. Tan's interest in Bumi is part of a wider boardroom standoff between the British financier Nathaniel Rothschild, who partly owns the company, and the Bakrie family, which controls another stake in Bumi.
After calling for a shareholder meeting earlier this year to reshuffle Bumi's executives, Mr. Tan took over as chairman, while Mr. Rothschild became a nonindependent director.
After the management changes, Bumi announced on Monday that it was opening an investigation into financial irregularities at one of its divisions.
The accusations relate to financial accounting records at its subsidiary PT Bumi Resources. The irregularities are in connection to investments that were marked down to zero, according to a statement from Bumi.
The news caused the shares to drop 25 percent by the end of trading on Monday. Stock in the company has fallen 82 percent over the last year.
"We see this investigation as a positive development, although we feel it does have the potential to bring to light some gross and potentially criminal mismanagement of funds," Richard Knights, an analyst at Liberum Capital, wrote in a note to investors.
For Standard Chartered, the danger is that PT Borneo may have lost money on its Bumi stake as the shares have continued to plunge.
In a default situation, Standard Chartered may have the right to collect the Bumi shares, but the stock may end up being worth a lot less than it was when Mr. Tan bought the shares in January.
Still, Standard Chartered would be able to absorb any potential losses on the loan through its $33 billion of core capital. Standard Chartered may need those reserves, given that more of its corporate borrowers are having trouble staying current on their loans. In Standard Chartered's wholesale banking division, "gross nonperforming" loans totaled $4.06 billion at the end of June, up from $3.09 billion at the end of last year.
A spokesman for Standard Chartered declined to comment on the Indonesian loan.
Scott Merrillees, a director at PT Borneo and chief financial officer of Bumi, did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment on PT Borneo's borrowings.
The investigation into financial irregularities at a subsidiary, coupled with a global financial crisis that has depressed coal prices, has hurt Bumi's prospects. The company reported a $106 million loss in the first half of the year.
The tough economic conditions also have weighed on PT Borneo, which reported a net profit of $191 million in 2011, the latest figures available. The company had $105 million of cash flow from operations over the same period.
It is difficult to ascertain the size of Standard Chartered's exposure to PT Borneo, as the bank may have sold parts of the loan to other banks since January.
In April, Bloomberg News reported that First Gulf Bank of the United Arab Emirates had made a commitment to take $200 million of the $1 billion loan, citing a person familiar with the matter. A representative for First Gulf Bank declined to comment on Thursday.
PT Borneo's chief executive, Alexander Ramlie, has also raised the possibility of a bond issuance to raise money to lower its debt to Standard Chartered, but the company's Web site does not mention any such deals being completed.
In its most recent investor presentation in June, PT Borneo mentioned the $1 billion loan. But it merely said that the Bumi stake was 100 percent financed by a $1 billion "amortizing senior debt facility provided by Standard Chartered Bank."
If the London-based bank takes a hit on its PT Borneo loan, it would be another black mark against the firm, which until recently had a reputation as a careful lender.
Last week, Standard Chartered's group executive director for wholesale lending, Mike Rees, gave an investor presentation outlining strategic goals for corporate lending. That included "balancing the pursuit of growth with firm control of costs and risks."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Stocks Gain Despite Economic Data

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks on Wall Street rose broadly Thursday, with the Standard & Poor's 500 and Nasdaq composite indexes up about 1 percent as investors were encouraged by Spain's plans for economic reform to deal with its debt crisis. 
Shares rose despite weak American data that reflected the nation's sluggish economic growth.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed with a gain of 1 percent, the Dow Jones industrial average advanced 0.5 percent and the Nasdaq composite index rose 1.4 percent.
Data showed second-quarter gross domestic product growth of 1.3 percent, against the earlier estimate of 1.7 percent. At the same time, August durable goods tumbled 13.2 percent, much more than the 5 percent drop expected.
''None of these numbers are really trending upward,'' said Tim Speiss, head of personal wealth advisers at EisnerAmper in New York. ''A lot of investors are starting to wonder how much markets are overvalued.''
Still, jobless claims dropped by 23,000 to 359,000, significantly more than the 4,000 drop that had been expected.
In China, stocks rebounded from multiyear lows on speculation that the China Securities Regulatory Commission would announce steps to support beleaguered domestic markets, which could include changes to the initial public offering market. Traders said China's central bank fed $57.9 billion into money markets this week, the largest weekly injection in history.
Spain announced a detailed timetable for economic reforms and a tough 2013 budget based mostly on spending cuts. The tension in Europe, underlined by anti-austerity measures in Madrid and Athens, had contributed to the S.&P.'s 1.9 percent drop over the past five days.
European stock markets were ahead modestly. The CAC 40 in France advanced 0.7 percent and the DAX added 0.2 percent.
In company news, Hewlett-Packard stock was up 0.6 percent after Jefferies downgraded the stock to ''underperform,'' expecting continued problems in the company's personal computer segment.
The S.&P. 500 was up 5.2 percent so far for the third quarter and 1.9 percent for September, historically a weak month for equities. Gains were largely tied to economy-boosting actions taken by the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank.

HEADLINE: Sudan and South Sudan Sign Accord, but Several Issues Are Unresolved

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN; Isma'il Kushkush contributed reporting from Khartoum, Sudan.

 BODY:
KAMPALA, Uganda -- The presidents of Sudan and South Sudan signed a long-awaited cooperation agreement on Thursday, paving the way for the resumption of oil exports and casting their ailing economies a desperately needed lifeline. But several analysts said the deal came up far short. 
The status of Abyei, a contested border area, was not settled. Nor was that of several other disputed territories, differences that have driven the countries' two leaders, historic enemies, nearly to all-out war.
''The seeds of further conflict are firmly planted in this partial deal,'' John Prendergast, a founder of the Enough Project, an antigenocide organization that watches the two Sudans closely, said by e-mail.
Last year, amid great jubilation, South Sudan split off from Sudan after decades of guerrilla struggle. But the divorce was messy. Forces from the two countries have battled intensely over the past year amid confusion over disputed areas and contested oil fields.
South Sudan has billions of barrels of oil, but the pipeline to export it runs through the north. The south shut down production last winter, which deeply wounded the economies on both sides of the border, leading to skyrocketing inflation, protests and rising discontent.
Since then, negotiations have gone around and around, with increasing pressure by the United States, the African Union and the United Nations to come to an agreement. Since Sunday, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the president of Sudan, and Salva Kiir, South Sudan's leader, had been holed up together in negotiating rooms in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, trying to hammer out a compromise. For years, the two men fought each other on the battlefield, and it seems that the history of bitterness has been extremely difficult to overcome.
On Thursday, Mr. Bashir and Mr. Kiir emerged to announce that they would demilitarize the border -- a step that had been agreed to in principle last year but was almost instantly violated when Sudan began a brutal counterinsurgency campaign in the Nuba Mountains, near the border. The two sides also committed to resuming cross-border trade and allowing citizens from each side to move freely.
And they agreed to resume oil production -- again, an issue that had been previously covered, with a deal reached in August, but had not yet taken effect because of mutual mistrust. ''This basically kicks the can down the road,'' said EJ Hogendoorn, the Horn of Africa director for the International Crisis Group, a conflict-prevention organization.
''Oil production will give both governments some breathing room, since their economies were collapsing, but unless there is a resolution to Abyei'' and other conflict-ridden parts of Sudan, he said in an e-mail, ''enormous frictions remain.''
One person close to the talks tried to put a positive gloss on them, saying the negotiating session was a ''crunch summit'' and the border deal was ''serious progress.''
But most analysts disagree.
''Of course, there will be a tremendous amount of overselling whatever agreement is signed,'' Eric Reeves, a professor at Smith College in Northampton, Mass., and a prolific blogger on the Sudans, wrote in an e-mail. ''This is a survivalist regime in Khartoum,'' the capital of Sudan, ''and the agreement signed is precisely what one would expect from survivalists. This fundamental feature won't change.''

HEADLINE: An Enduring Ritual of Politics Loud and Close

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

WESTERVILLE, Ohio -- By 7 a.m. on Wednesday, supporters hoping to catch a glimpse of Mitt Romney extended for two blocks outside Westerville South High School in this suburb of Columbus, the site of a ''victory rally'' hastily shifted from an outdoor amphitheater when the forecast called for rain.
A dozen or so demonstrators, watched over by a lone police officer, taunted the Romney supporters, waving a giant check for $250,000 made out to ''Millionaires'' and signed by Mr. Romney. ''We don't want a Bain economy!'' they shouted. ''Outsource Romney!'' 
But the millionaires were somewhere else. Plutocrats do not go to campaign rallies, not when the principal speaker takes the stage an hour after the workday has begun.
The 2,000 Romney supporters on hand were not the 1 percent. Maybe the 50 percent. There was not a jacket, a tie or a pair of Italian shoes in a crowd that favored T-shirts, sweatshirts and sneakers. This was a slice of Middle America, with not a nonwhite face in sight: mothers pulling small children by the hand, retirees, high school students who had wangled a day away from school.
A few hours later, more than 5,000 Democrats converged on the Stroh Center at Bowling Green State University, about 115 miles to the northwest, where President Obama held his own rally. It was the first stop in a two-stop tour that would take him to Kent State University in the late afternoon, while Mr. Romney, traveling by bus, made his way to Cleveland and then to Toledo, just 25 miles up Interstate 75 from Bowling Green.
University students seemed to make up nearly half of the audience at the Stroh Center. Dozens of black supporters turned up, too, in a county that is 94 percent white. No one waved an American flag, a stark contrast to the Romney rally, where supporters began the event by singing the national anthem. Instead, they held out cellphones, clicking furiously from the moment that the president, jacket off but tie on, took the stage.
Crisscrossing the state, barely managing not to trip over each other, the two candidates enacted a ritual nearly as old as the republic. Roaming hither and yon, they beat the bushes for votes, relying on the most primitive forms of political expression: the fist-pounding stump speech and the handshake.
But why? Flying hundreds or thousands of miles to deliver a stemwinder to a few thousand voters would seem to make as much sense, in the era of the blog and the tweet and the 24-hour news cycle, as making your own suit. Yet the rally persists, essentially unchanged since the days of Andrew Jackson.
''In the old days, candidates had to go to rallies,'' said Melissa Miller, a political scientist at Bowling Green. ''That was the only way for the people to hear them. Now, they're all about rallying the base, igniting a spark that motivates supporters to tell their friends, to make calls, to donate. It's much more effective than robocalls.''
Traditionally, the political rally has been first cousin to the tent revival and the traveling circus. That tradition continues, although these days it serves other purposes: to gather e-mail addresses, sign up volunteers, raise money and produce images for television and newspaper coverage.
Outside the Romney rally, souvenir peddlers worked the crowd, selling buttons, T-shirts and Mitt Romney oven mitts with the message ''Don't Get Burned.''
''Friends don't let friends vote Democrat,'' chanted one salesman, pushing a display placard of campaign buttons. ''Wake up and smell the socialism.'' Nearby, another button seller shouted, ''Vote for the Mormon, not the moron!''
Phil Phinn, a souvenir seller from Sarasota, Fla., said that he and two fellow workers drove 10,000 to 15,000 miles a month following what he called ''the hot campaigns.'' He still waits for the second coming of Sarah Palin. ''She was the goose that laid the golden egg,'' he recalled wistfully. ''She was magic. She just sold and sold and sold.''
Inside the high school, Mr. Romney, sticking to a traditional format, invited state politicians to warm up the crowd. Anne Gonzales, a state representative and a Westerville native, spoke first, followed by Representative Pat Tiberi; Gov. John R. Kasich, another Westerville product; and -- last but emphatically not least -- the Golden Bear himself, Jack Nicklaus, Columbus's hometown hero. All hit the high notes of the campaign, revving up the audience with a heartfelt medley of greatest hits: smaller government, lower taxes, a stronger military and more jobs.
Any mention of thrift, fiscal responsibility or long marriages -- Mr. Nicklaus has been married for 52 years, Mr. Romney for 43 -- went over particularly well. Mr. Romney drew thunderous applause when he said, ''You don't spend more money than you take in, or you go out of business.''
Hecklers appeared in the balcony. Mr. Romney's supporters, initially caught off guard, regrouped and began chanting ''U.S.A.'' as the protesters were led away by security officers.
Like his opponent, Mr. Obama delivered no new news, and no one minded. He whipped the crowd into a froth by calling for higher taxes on the wealthiest Americans, economic justice, social tolerance and robust government. Then, as Bruce Springsteen poured from the sound system, he moved straight for the front rows and began shaking hands.
It was hot and up-close politics for both candidates. And it did go over better than a robocall. ''I felt the history of the moment,'' Vaneta Rogers, of Gahanna, Ohio, said after the Romney rally. ''It made me think about Abraham Lincoln speaking from the stump. To think that a presidential candidate would come to a small town like ours -- it sort of gives you goose bumps.''

HEADLINE: The Senate: Reviving an Old Stumble

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
As George Allen battles to regain his seat in the United States Senate from Virginia, one important name has not been mentioned -- until now.
"Macaca."
That word -- a term that can refer to monkeys -- torpedoed Mr. Allen's re-election campaign in 2006 after he was caught on video using it to describe a young man of Indian descent at a campaign rally. The video instantly went viral online, one of the first such examples on YouTube.
The incident sparked weeks of national news about Mr. Allen's past, including allegations that the Republican senator had embraced symbols of racial hatred during his political career and in his personal life. 
Mr. Allen's opponent this year, Tim Kaine, the former governor of Virginia, has steered away from all of that, preferring to argue that Mr. Allen's economic and policy record make him unfit for a return to the Senate.
But now, a labor group backing Mr. Kaine's election is trying to raise it all again with a series of small, online advertisements that note each of the most unsavory allegations against Mr. Allen. The ads were created by workersvoice.org, a political arm of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
One notes that Mr. Allen "kept a noose in his office" and shows a picture of Mr. Allen giving a thumbs up next to a hangman's noose. Mr. Allen has always claimed the noose was a lasso intended to represent cowboys.
Another banner ad says that Mr. Allen hung a Confederate flag in his living room; he said it was a symbol of youthful rebellion. A third ad notes, correctly, that as a member of the Virginia state legislature, he voted against a holiday honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (The state celebrated Lee-Jackson-King Day for 16 years.)
A fourth ad revives the controversy over "macaca" by simply printing that word next to Mr. Allen's picture.
"George Allen kept a noose and a Confederate flag in his office and anyone who would insult the African-American and Latino people of Virginia this way is not fit to hold office," said Eddie Vale, the communications director for the group. "This is similar to, but even more offensive, than Mitt Romney secretly attacking 47 percent of all Americans."
Emily Davis, a spokeswoman for Mr. Allen, said in a statement: "It is disappointing to see that Tim Kaine and his union allies would stoop to this level rather than talk about the very serious issues facing Virginia families and small businesses. George Allen has apologized and forthrightly addresses these old accusations, but when he is on the campaign trail he is hearing from Virginia families and small businesses concerned about skyrocketing fuel costs, burdensome regulations and increased taxes that are bringing uncertainty."
The revival of questions about Mr. Allen's racial attitudes is clearly an effort to help Mr. Kaine break away from Mr. Allen in what has been one of the closest Senate elections in the country. Mr. Kaine, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, has been targeted by national conservative groups with millions of dollars of negative television ads.
Will it work?
It could. The intensity of the "macaca" coverage in 2006 made Mr. Allen toxic among donors, dashed his hopes of becoming a serious contender for the 2008 Republican presidential primary, and ultimately cost him his re-election against the Democrat, Jim Webb.
But the stories have faded now. There are plenty of new voters in Virginia who may have little memory of all that coverage. If the labor group can remind them effectively, it could cause Mr. Allen problems again.
But it also could backfire. Despite all of the negative coverage -- including, for weeks, reporting about whether Mr. Allen had used a particularly offensive racial epithet often aimed at African-Americans -- Mr. Allen came within just a few thousand votes of winning re-election. (He denied using the epithet.)
The avalanche of negativity was seen by political observers as evidence that many Virginia voters were turned off by the series of attacks. Mr. Allen could tap into that sentiment if Mr. Kaine's allies try a reprise of the 2006 campaign.
Odds are that Mr. Kaine's advisers are smart enough to avoid getting drawn into the attacks. Better for them if their allies can make the attacks work without any strings attached.
But in the end, it's also possible that the whole thing could just fizzle this time around.
The economy in 2012 is very different than it was in 2006. People are out of work. Housing values have plummeted. The appetite for personal attacks that date back decades may have faded in the face of those more serious issues.
If so, look for "macaca" to once again become part of YouTube's early viral history.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.
