PERSON: H. Anthony Williamson

HEADLINE: Anthony Williamson, 69, Human Geography Expert, Dies

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN

 BODY:
H. Anthony Williamson, a scholar in human geography, who developed innovative techniques to help the indigenous inhabitants of Labrador and the Canadian Arctic press land claims and express their concerns to the government, died on Dec. 29 in St. John's, Newfoundland. He was 69. 
 The causes were complications of colon cancer, his family said. 
 Mr. Williamson was founding director of the Labrador Institute, a center for northern studies based in Goose Bay. He administered Memorial University's outreach programs in Labrador and was known for developing the use of film and later videotape as a catalyst for community development. In the technique, named the Fogo process after an island where he first tried it, he filmed villagers telling their stories, then invited them to view the raw footage and suggest what should be emphasized or changed. The visual documentation of conditions in their villages was then presented to the government.
 In his work, he traveled about the Arctic, often by boat, dog sled and cross-country skis, while researching the native use of renewable resources and the impact of resettlement on traditional life. He gathered environmental, economic and cultural data to create a template for evaluating the land claims of northern aboriginal people.
 He also assessed the health of seal fisheries along the Labrador coast and the whitefish and sea trout fisheries on the east coast of James Bay. He documented indigenous concerns in Labrador, including mining projects and training flights by military jets that disturbed the traditional way of life. 
 Mr. Williamson was born in New York City and raised in Pawling, N.Y. As a junior at Dartmouth College, he sailed aboard the Blue Dolphin, a research schooner, doing hydrographic research along the coasts of Labrador and Greenland, igniting his passion for the Arctic. He also studied under the Arctic scholar Vilhjalmur Stefanson.
 He earned a master's degree in geography at McGill University in Montreal, and later became a Canadian citizen. 
 After retiring from Memorial University, Mr. Williamson was asked by the Labrador Inuit Association and the Federation of Newfoundland Indians to continue working as a consultant. He also applied his community development techniques in India and Southeast Asia. 
 Mr. Williamson is survived by his wife, Sharon Taylor of St. John's; a son, Eric, of Vancouver, B.C.; a daughter, Alexandra, and two stepdaughters, Victoria and Zoe Balsom, of St. John's; three sisters, Barbara Hollander of Sherman, Conn., who was his twin, Eileen Morrison of Pawling, N.Y., and Roberta Williamson of Nashville; and a brother, John E. Williamson, the president of Sterling College in Craftsbury, Vt.

HEADLINE: Winning Friends With Disaster Aid

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Carol Adelman (''A High Quality of Mercy,'' Op-Ed, Jan. 4) may be correct that private giving is a more effective means of delivering development aid than government programs. But she is wrong to measure generosity in absolute terms and to include private market transactions, such as money sent to relatives, that cannot be necessarily attributed to poverty alleviation. 
 Her statement that ''Norway's $2 billion of yearly aid is less than what American companies alone give'' rings hollow, as the United States' economy is 64 times larger than Norway's. While a full measure of American contributions to development should be considered by those who criticize the United States, Americans should not shrink from the highest standard of measuring our generosity, our giving compared with our capacity to give.

HEADLINE: French Video Game Makers Fear Their Grasp Is Slipping

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: LONDON, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
''You have the right to spy, steal, destroy and assassinate to ensure that American freedoms are protected. If captured, the U.S. government will disavow any knowledge of your existence. You are Sam Fisher. You are a Splinter Cell.''
 So begins the description of Splinter Cell, a popular video game based on Tom Clancy's action thriller novels. Would-be Sam Fishers, joysticks at the ready, may be surprised to learn that the company that developed and published the game is based in France. Even odder, perhaps, is the notion that a game celebrating the free rein of United States secret agents may be seen as a French cultural treasure. 
 But that is what happened when Electronic Arts, an American company that is the world's largest producer of video games, last month acquired a stake of nearly 20 percent in Ubisoft, the French publisher of the Tom Clancy games. 
 In the anarchic world of video games, unusual international juxtapositions are actually the norm. Electronic Arts' Battlefield Vietnam game was developed in Sweden, and Electronic Arts owns the rights to games based on the British Harry Potter book series. Meanwhile, Eidos, a British game developer, created the quintessential American video game babe, Lara Croft. And the popular Grand Theft Auto games, set in urban Los Angeles, were created in Scotland by Rockstar North, a unit of Take Two Interactive Software.
 Though the French have played this game particularly well -- 3 of the top 10 video game companies are based in France, including Atari -- they may face new threats as globalization of the industry intensifies. In the next year or so, the leading video game consoles --PlayStation 2 from Sony, Xbox from Microsoft and GameCube from Nintendo -- are to be upgraded. When that happens, game development costs, which already can approach $10 million a game, will rise further. And because these consoles will ease Internet access, the online gaming community will grow, increasing demand for globally relevant games. 
 That explains Electronic Arts' interest in Ubisoft, which may extend beyond a minority stake, analysts say. ''Bolstering their position with a big player in Europe would make a lot of sense,'' said Paul Jackson, an analyst at Forrester Research in Amsterdam.
 For now, Electronic Arts is being coy about its intentions.
 ''It's very premature for us to start thinking about what next steps might be made,'' said Tiffany Steckler, a spokeswoman for Electronic Arts in Redwood City, Calif. 
 Ubisoft has called the advances hostile. The company, based in Montreuil-sous-Bois, France, could not be reached for comment Friday.
 Analysts and news reports in France have speculated about the possibility of a protective merger between Ubisoft and the video game unit of Vivendi Universal, the media conglomerate. Ubisoft, however, has said it is not talking to any potential partners.
 More broadly, however, the possible threat to Ubisoft's independence has piqued concerns about the state of the French video game industry, which has been shedding jobs. There has even been talk in the French media that the government might try to step in to help Ubisoft, though analysts say it might have difficulty justifying any intervention.
 The industry has already successfully appealed to the government for help along the lines of that received by French moviemakers. In 2003, Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin proposed a tax break to help these companies with research and development; the measure is wending its way through the system.
 In October, a government-sponsored school to train students the skills of video game creation, the Ecole Nationale du Jeu et des Medias Interactifs Numeriques, opened in Angouleme, in western France. 
 ''If France, and more generally Europe, still want to be in interactive media in 10 years, there will have to be people who learn this,'' said Stephane Natkin, the school's director. 
 Mr. Natkin estimated that as many as one-third of French game design studios had shut down since 2000, and said that students of the school would encounter a tough job market, in France at least. The third big French game producer, Infogrames Entertainment, which owns the Atari trade name, has moved most of its development out of France. Ubisoft, too, does most of its development elsewhere, including Montreal, where it employs about 1,000 people.
 Nicolas Gaume, a video game development consultant in Paris who used to be chairman of the game company Kalisto, said that, to some extent, the French industry had been a victim of its own success.
 ''When you get to the point where North America is your major market, it's easier to have game developers based there,'' he said.

Observers Wonder If Apple Plans Low-Cost Macintosh
In what might be the next chapter in Silicon Valley's longest-running soap opera, Apple Computer's chairman, Steven Jobs, may surrender to the computer industry's received wisdom and introduce a sub-$500 Macintosh, according to several published reports.

HEADLINE: Bush Praises Choice of Abbas As New Palestinian President

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 

 BODY:
President Bush welcomed the victory of Mahmoud Abbas as president of the Palestinian Authority on Sunday as administration officials prepared to increase the tempo of American involvement in the Middle East and cautioned that Israel and the Palestinians needed to take concrete steps to capitalize on Mr. Abbas's election.
 Administration officials said there was a mood of guarded optimism among Mr. Bush's aides that, while the emergence of Mr. Abbas promised a new opportunity, progress is contingent on the Palestinians curbing terrorist activity and the Israelis easing their grip in the West Bank and curtailing settlement growth there.
 Mr. Bush, signaling what aides said would be a more visible American role, listed the combating of terrorism and the reform of Palestinian institutions as essential immediate steps. He also called on Israel to ''improve the humanitarian and economic situation'' in Palestinian areas and implement its plans to leave Gaza and part of the West Bank. 
 ''The United States stands ready to help the Palestinian people realize their aspirations,'' Mr. Bush said, adding that the United States would be looking at how to back that pledge with possible increased financing.
 Bush administration and European officials said the increased American activity would include sending Condoleezza Rice, who is likely to be confirmed by the Senate as secretary of state by Jan. 24, to a conference on Palestinian reform to be held in Britain in early March and to the Middle East at about the same time. 
 In addition, administration officials said there would be renewed American pressure on Israel to remove so-called settlement outposts in the West Bank and to work with the United States to define a freeze in ''settlement activity'' there that would stop the expansion of settlements in at least parts of the West Bank.
 On the issue of aid, administration officials said the United States might add to its $200 million annual donation to the Palestinians while pushing wealthy Persian Gulf states to increase their support. Current aid from all sources is about $1 billion a year, but the World Bank has called for a possible doubling of that sum.
 ''So far we have not seen any new flow of funds to the Palestinian Authority from the Arab states,'' said a senior administration official. ''We're told by the Palestinians that they have received a number of pledges, but now is the time for those pledges to become real. We will be watching that very closely.''
 Administration officials, who declined to be identified in part because they want major announcements to be made by Mr. Bush and Ms. Rice, said the mood of cautious hope over Mr. Abbas's election to succeed Yasir Arafat was mixed with a determination to do more to push the peace effort than they had done in mid-2003.
 At that time, Mr. Abbas served as prime minister under Mr. Arafat, but after a few months the optimism of the moment foundered because of a failure of Israel and the Palestinians to follow through on promises to take certain actions. 
 ''There is actually a fair amount of optimism in the administration that we can take advantage of this opportunity, and that it will be possible to move forward in a serious way,'' said a senior official, using what he acknowledged was guarded language.
 American, European and Arab diplomats said in interviews over the past past week that progress would depend on Mr. Abbas gaining control of his security forces, achieving further financial and political reforms, and doing much more to fill the vacuum in Gaza to be left by the Israeli withdrawal this summer. ''The Palestinians have not done anything to prepare for the Israeli withdrawal,'' the senior official said. ''There'll be lots of help from the international community, but the Palestinians need to get their house in order.''
 On the other hand, Israeli and American officials said that Israel was prepared to respond more positively to steps by Palestinians in coming weeks -- steps that Israel would not have responded to while Mr. Arafat was alive. 
 For example, in 2003, both Israel and the Bush administration said they were unimpressed by the ceasefire that occurred then because, they said, it merely gave the Palestinians time to re-arm. Now administration officials say they are encouraging Israel to respond more positively to a possible cease-fire. Israel also appears to be more willing.
 Daniel Ayalon, the Israeli ambassador to the United States, said that if Mr. Abbas ''wants to go on the political route and get a cease-fire, that's his business, and we won't tell him how to conduct his business.''
 He added that if Mr. Abbas deploys his security forces in a manner that thwarts terrorist attacks and requires that weapons not be brandished by militant groups, Israel would respond in kind. ''We will be calibrating our expectations and will respond to a first step,'' he said.
 As for steps that the administration wants from Israel, the administration was said by Israeli and American officials to be preparing to resume stalled discussions on contentious issues like Israel's unkept promises to dismantle so-called illegal settlement outposts built in the last four years in the West Bank.
 Far more tricky, those officials admit, is getting Israel to agree to what is known as a ''freeze in settlement activity'' in the West Bank, as called for in the peace plan known as the ''road map'' adopted in 2003 by the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations.
 Last April, at the height of his own reelection campaign, President Bush granted Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel what both Israeli and American officials said was a major concession, a letter saying that a final accord with the Palestinians should be expected to keep certain settlements outside Jerusalem and parts of the West Bank in Israel.
 After that letter, Mr. Sharon sought to expand the populations of those settlements, and won tacit approval from Washington for doing so provided Israeli and American technical teams reached an agreement on which settlements were to grow.
 Palestinian leaders, meanwhile, were incensed. Many charged that the arrangement had undercut the freeze called for in the road map and raised doubts about Israel's intentions in its withdrawal from Gaza. Many said they feared that the withdrawal would allow Israel to keep the West Bank indefinitely.
 Administration officials now say they must make efforts to rebut those charges by seeking Israeli action on the recently built outposts and settlement growth in general.
 ''The issue of settlement outposts cannot be postponed until after the Gaza withdrawal,'' said the senior administration official. ''This was a pledge to the president, and that pledge has to be redeemed.'' 
 On the question of defining settlement growth, he added, ''Everyone is aware of how divisive and delicate a question this is in Israel, but it's a question that Israel has to confront.''
 Many diplomats say that discussion of settlements may not accelerate until after the Gaza withdrawal. 
 At that time, however, there is expected to be renewed pressure in Europe from the Palestinians and from Arabs to do something that American and Israeli officials say they are loath to do: start talking about such issues as the final boundaries of a Palestinian state and the right of Palestinians to return to Israel.
 Israel and the United States have opposed moving to these matters, known as ''final status'' issues because they would determine the status of a Palestinian state, until it is more clear that the Palestinians are moving to disarm militant groups. 
 But that opposition may be difficult to keep up in coming months, some officials said.
 ''The honest answer is that we're going to have six months of posturing after this election,'' an Arab diplomat said. ''But I believe that once you get to negotiations in the second half of this year, whatever people may say, Palestinians will need to understand what the final outcome is going to look like before they get deeper into discussions with Israel.''

Abbas Declares Victory In Palestinian Elections
Mahmoud Abbas, who opposes continuing violence against Israel, declared victory in the election for a new president of the Palestinian Authority after two surveys of voters leaving the polls showed him winning by a large margin. The strong margin should help give Mr. Abbas a mandate for change and to try to put an end to terrorism. A1

President Bush welcomed the victory of Mr. Abbas as administration officials prepared to increase the tempo of involvement in the Middle East and cautioned that Israel and the Palestinians needed to take concrete steps to capitalize on the election. A7

The voting was largely trouble-free in the Gaza Strip. In the West Bank, too, voting took place without major difficulties, as the people chose a new leader, a rare event in the Arab world. A7

When Will the U.S. Leave Iraq?
Conversation has started on Capitol Hill, in the Pentagon, and some days even in the White House about when and how American forces might begin to disengage in Iraq. A1

Two Iraqi policemen and three Iraqi civilians were killed south of Baghdad during a gunfight for which an Iraqi spokesman initially blamed American troops. Seven Ukrainian soldiers and one Kazakh soldier were killed when a bomb accidentally detonated near Suwayra, 50 miles southeast of Baghdad. Eleven other soldiers were also wounded. A6

Expanding Tsunami Relief
Mercy Corps, an aid group based in Portland, Ore., is expanding its relief work. The group is recruiting local laborers who will help clear the disaster zones. Despite the grueling and gruesome labor, the recruited men seemed to be relieved to have something constructive to do, and to have a way to earn money. A1

Tarnished by its handling of the oil-for-food program in Iraq as it begins another multibillion-dollar program of tsunami relief, the United Nations is taking measures to ensure public accountability of how the money is spent. A8

Members of Lasker Mujahedeen, a paramilitary group that has fought Christians in Indonesia and has had links to Al Qaeda, are among hundreds of Indonesian Islamic extremists who have come to Aceh in the name of helping their fellow Muslims. A9

Peace Treaty in Area of Sudan
The Islamic government of Sudan signed a peace agreement with a Christian rebel group in the south. The agreement is fraught with potential complications but it could help bring development to one of the world's most destitute regions. The celebration was tempered by the fact that the war continues in other areas of Sudan. A3

Gale-Force Winds in Europe
Eleven people were killed and at least four were missing after gale-force winds battered northern Europe, causing flooding and transport chaos and leaving hundreds of thousands without electricity. A4

DNA Donations Requested To Solve a Grisly Murder
Police officers in Truro, Mass., are trying to get DNA from all 790 or so men in town -- or as many as will agree -- in an unusual last-ditch move for clues to the three-year-old unsolved murder of Christa Worthington, who was stabbed to death in the town's most grisly mystery. A1

Differences on Social Security
White House officials plan to describe Social Security as a system in ''crisis'' whose promises to younger workers are a ''fiction,'' in the first phase of a strategy to build support for overhauling the program. Opponents say Mr. Bush is exaggerating the problems. A14

Weather-Related Deaths in U.S.
Relentless, pounding rain produced landslides, flooding and chaos on California highways. Wicked weather was blamed for several deaths during the weekend, from Southern California to Pennsylvania. A12

Railroad Crew Questioned
Investigators seeking the cause of a train crash that released clouds of chlorine gas and killed nine people said they were looking into whether a train crew was distracted or fatigued when it was time to reset a railroad switch. Investigators said the crew had called their dispatcher seven hours earlier to report that they had completed their work. That call meant that the switch should have been re-positioned. The switch showed no sign of tampering. A13

Sheriff Firings Upstage Victory
Clayton County, Ga., opened the year with its first black-majority government, including the county commission and sheriff. But the celebratory moment has been all but eclipsed by the uproar over the new sheriff's firing of 27 employees. The county commission's chief of staff, Clark Talmage Stevens, a former adviser to presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, called it ''a blatant mass political firing.'' A12

Democrats Pick Midterm Chief
Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois was named as the new chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The appointment means Mr. Emanuel will direct the Democrats' effort to recapture the House in the 2006 midterm elections. A14

HEADLINE: On a Mission For Mercedes: Burnishing A Faded Star

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: STUTTGART, Germany 

 BODY:
When DaimlerChrysler asked Eckhard Cordes to take the helm of Mercedes-Benz last summer, he knew it was less a promotion than an anointment. Not only is Mercedes the flagship of this trans-Atlantic company, but it also has long been the crown jewel of German industry. 
 Still, these days Mercedes stands for something else. Deteriorating profits and mounting quality problems have made Mercedes a metaphor for Germany's struggle to maintain its place in the global economy.
 ''I was surprised that the outside world obviously sees this job to be in a different league,'' Mr. Cordes said in a recent interview at Mercedes's utilitarian headquarters here. ''I was totally astonished.'' 
 Once the reliable profit engine of DaimlerChrysler, Mercedes has become the company's problem child -- standing in the corner normally occupied by the resurgent Chrysler. 
 The problems start with the weak dollar, which makes all German luxury cars less competitive in the United States. But Mercedes is battling its own demons, chief among them a recognition that its once-matchless reputation for quality has slipped in recent years. 
 Now, as the world's gearheads and car fans gather for the annual Detroit auto show, Mr. Cordes has broken his silence to talk about what ails Mercedes, and how it can be cured. Mr. Cordes, a brisk, blunt-speaking 54-year-old, has done turnarounds before. He took DaimlerChrysler's truck division from $360 million in operating losses in 2002 to a profit of more than $1 billion the next year. But his tool of choice -- deep cost-cutting -- may be less effective at Mercedes, where the workers just signed a new contract.
 Analysts say production costs at Mercedes are still too high, especially in this unforgiving economic climate. The company has too many white-collar employees. Its assembly lines are too complex, and it makes too many of its own components.
 Given the status of Mercedes in Germany, Mr. Cordes must tread carefully. The man first chosen for his job, Wolfgang Bernhard, was abruptly discarded last April after his blustery statements about the need for a drastic overhaul provoked an outcry on the factory floor. Mr. Cordes, who is viewed as a prime candidate to replace DaimlerChrysler's chief executive, Jurgen Schrempp, cannot afford a misstep.
 As he prepared to present a redesigned sport utility vehicle, as well as other new models, in Detroit, however, Mr. Cordes insisted he would do whatever was necessary to restore Mercedes-Benz to its pole position among the world's luxury cars. 
 ''Once you detect a problem, tackle it, and get it out of the way,'' he said. ''From time to time, if you need to be brutal, be brutal.''
 There is little Mercedes can do about exchange rates, of course. But unlike other German manufacturers like Porsche or BMW, which have insulated themselves from exchange-rate swings through aggressive currency hedging, Mercedes is dangerously exposed, analysts say, because most of its hedges are expiring.
 Mr. Cordes would not discuss DaimlerChrysler's exposure, but he acknowledged that the stronger euro was a heavy burden for Mercedes in North America, where it generates a quarter of its sales.
 ''Coming from a world where one euro is 0.9 dollars to a world where one euro is 1.35 dollars, that is obviously quite something,'' he said. ''That is a huge challenge for us, which we do have to tackle.''
 The weak dollar has already taken a toll on Mercedes's margins, which have eroded from an average of 6.4 percent between 1999 and 2003, to 2.5 percent in the third quarter of 2004. Sales of Mercedes in the United States have fallen steadily in euro terms since 2002, when they peaked at 11.2 billion euros. This year, American sales may drop to 8.2 billion euros, according to a recent projection by Goldman Sachs.
 One thing Mercedes can do is expand production at its single American assembly plant, in Tuscaloosa, Ala. Because the plant's fixed costs are in dollars, it acts as a natural hedge against the effects of a rising euro and a falling dollar.
 Mercedes has made its M-class sport utility vehicle in Tuscaloosa since 1997. It is adding a second model, the Grand Sports Tourer, which looks like a cross between an S.U.V. and a station wagon, and the G-class, a more rugged S.U.V. The M-class initially drew complaints about poor quality, but Mr. Cordes said the cars rolling out of Alabama today were every bit as good as those made in Germany.
 Would that the German-built cars were as well made as the Mercedes-Benzes of the past. It is not that the cars run badly when they are new. But things tend to go fluky as they age, particularly electronic gadgets, which are more complex in a Mercedes than in almost any other car.
 In a J.D. Power & Associates poll of vehicle reliability after three years, Mercedes ranked below the industry average, behind even Chrysler. In a survey of customer satisfaction by the German automotive club, Allgemeiner Deutscher Automobil Club, it finished 31st in a field of 33, beating only Land Rover and Volkswagen.
 Such numbers are galling to Mercedes executives, who view any result other than No. 1 as a cause for shame. But Mr. Cordes, who made his name at DaimlerChrysler as a deal maker rather than an engineer, seems less defensive about the quality problems than some colleagues. 
 ''There is what you call a quality issue out there. Everybody knows it,'' he said. ''I would be lying if I say everything is wonderful.'' But he added, ''What currently comes out of our factory is O.K.''
 Mercedes has bolstered supervision of its assembly lines, installing a quality-control czar who reports to Mr. Cordes. It is also spending heavily to repair cars already on the road. Goldman Sachs estimates the campaign will cost Mercedes at least $330 million a year in additional costs for the next few years. 
 Mr. Cordes said Mercedes had pushed the technology envelope by integrating features like the radio and navigation systems. Other manufacturers, notably the Japanese, favor discrete systems, which are less exotic but also less prone to break.
 Some analysts say Mercedes needs to simplify its cars -- a suggestion that Mr. Cordes rejects as nonsensical. The challenge, he said, is to offer the same level of technology and integration with fewer glitches. ''We are very open and we are learning, like our German competitors,'' he said.
 Mr. Cordes said there was no evidence that the quality problems had tarnished the Mercedes brand name irrevocably. And some analysts agreed, noting that surveys of all car owners, not just Mercedes drivers, still rank Mercedes as the most powerful brand, ahead of BMW. 
 ''The public has it firmly in mind that Mercedes builds the best cars in the world,'' said Ferdinand Dudenhoffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research in Gelsenkirchen.
 Expanding the coveted Mercedes name, however, is more complicated than simply slapping its three-point star emblem on new models. The company's foray into small cars -- with its A-class line and even smaller Smart brand -- has been costly and money-losing. 
 Mercedes had been expected to introduce Smart to the United States with a new, pint-sized S.U.V. that it planned to assemble at a plant in Brazil. But the company scrapped plans to show the vehicle in Detroit, leading analysts to say that Mercedes was having second thoughts.
 In fact, Mercedes seems to be thinking smaller. Mr. Cordes noted that the original two-seat version of the Smart was popular in Canada, and might appeal to some American markets.
 Before Mr. Cordes expands Smart, however, he must stanch its losses, estimated by analysts at 500 million euros a year. Some analysts say he would be better off to shut it down.
 ''We are looking into what we have done on the marketing side, on the cost side, everything,'' he said. ''Only one thing is excluded: closure. The target is getting the whole thing into black figures as soon as we can.''

HEADLINE: Cheap Seats Provide View Of Troubles At Exchange

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
On Oct. 27, 2004, when shares of the Hollywood movie studio DreamWorks Animation SKG began trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Steven Spielberg rang the opening bell. Peering over the balcony at the hundreds of traders and clerks bustling about the trading floor, he said to John A. Thain, the chief executive of the exchange: ''There's more action down there than in any of my movies.'' 
 That action could soon wane. On Jan. 5, a seat on the exchange sold for $1 million, down 63 percent from its peak in 1999 and the lowest sale price since 1995. (Buyers and sellers of seats are not immediately identified by the exchange.) While the price reflects less robust markets, it also reveals growing uncertainty about the future of the exchange's floor model. 
 After enduring a yearlong public relations drubbing over its corporate governance and charges of unethical trading, the exchange is about to expand the way it trades stocks electronically, bypassing the floor. While investors will still be able to send orders to the floor, some predict that the Big Board's share of trading in stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange, now at 82 percent, could decline rapidly. 
 Mr. Thain, a former co-president of Goldman Sachs, inherited an emblem of American capitalism that is in the throes of an identity crisis. With the cooperation of widely diverse constituents, he must determine how firms will do business at the stock exchange and also what products and services it will offer, who will own it and whether it will remain a self-regulatory body. 
 ''Thain has done a great job of stabilizing what was essentially a perfect storm: the governance problems, the specialists, the effects of decimalization,'' said William H. Donaldson, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and a former chief executive of the exchange. ''But I think the hard part is still in front of him, figuring out the business model of the New York Stock Exchange.'' 
 Mr. Donaldson's views are widely held across Wall Street. ''There's a tremendous amount of uncertainty on the N.Y.S.E.,'' said Seth Merrin, chief executive of Liquidnet, an electronic trading firm. ''It has everything to do with whether there will be a place for human beings'' there, Mr. Merrin said.
 To critics of the exchange, those human beings are the main problem. But to the exchange, humans are its lifeblood. In addition to the trading done by the hundreds of traders, clerks and auctioneers bustling about the floor, their images are broadcast around the world and help the exchange promote its brand and attract new listings. 
 But serious challenges are being made to the world's largest equity exchange, an institution owned by its 1,366 seat holders. On an average day, the New York Stock Exchange trades 1.5 billion shares worth about $50 billion. Unlike almost all its competitors, it has traders on the floor who execute customer orders as well as their own orders in an effort to get the best price. Now the exchange has to decide how to maintain that identity while allowing more trades to be executed electronically. 
 ''The model in the industry is changing,'' said Frank Christensen, who has owned a seat on the exchange for 40 years and still trades on the floor. ''It's not going to be how much is made trading but rather what is made'' by electronic trading. 
 Mr. Thain arrived in the wake of the ouster of the former chairman, Richard A. Grasso, over a contested pay package and an investigation into whether floor traders were cheating customers, and as markets were still suffering the aftershock of moving to pricing stocks in increments of pennies instead of fractions. 
 The S.E.C., prodded by the Big Board's electronic competitors, started pushing for changes to long-held rules, including one called the trade-through rule, which is supposed to guarantee that investors get the best price for a stock (with a few notable exceptions). The trade-through rule requires that trades be executed at the marketplace that posts the best price. Some customers complained that while the Big Board appeared to have the best price, it was too slow to capture it. The S.E.C. responded by considering an elimination of the rule, which has fueled the exchange's move to increased automation.
 When Mr. Thain accepted the role of chief executive, he vowed to restore trust in the exchange and to listen to customers. Some in the industry said he was succeeding.
 ''John Thain has served the exchange well, in perhaps what has been the most difficult time in its history," said Mr. Christensen. ''The hope is that most of the problems he and the exchange are faced with are close to resolution.'' He has also exercised influence in Washington, helping to temper changes to critical rules under consideration at the S.E.C. 
 Mr. Thain serves multiple constituent groups with conflicting agendas. Many seat holders want the exchange to go public. Institutional investors want even more electronic trading capability. The S.E.C., which wields enormous authority over all exchanges, could continue to pressure it to lower trading costs by offering more automation. And competing markets are moving to increase market share. 
 ''I want the exchange to be for-profit and then I want it to go public,'' said John R. Jakobson, a longtime seat owner. ''I want what has happened to Toronto and the Chicago Merc to happen to us.'' The Toronto Stock Exchange went public in 2002.
 Public ownership has its perks. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange went public in December 2002 at $35 a share; shares closed at the end of 2004 at $277, giving the futures and options exchange a market capitalization of $7.7 billion. Using the price of a single seat multiplied by 1,366 seat holders, the Big Board has a market capitalization of $1.37 billion, though its brand is arguably much more valuable. 
 While Mr. Thain is offering new products, such as an exchange-traded basket of stocks of Chinese companies, and is contemplating ways to enter the derivatives and futures markets, he is quick to point out that the exchange has many issues to solve before it can go public. ''This still is the largest and most successful market in the world, but there is a lot of pressure right now on the membership structure,'' he said. "Before we can get at the question of should we be a public company, I think we need to focus on the business model." 
 The outcome of his choices and the exchange's ability to employ the automated market, called the hybrid market (humans in an auction, and computers matching orders) will determine whether the Big Board will keep attracting orders. If it fails, market share could fall. 
 According to Mr. Thain, the hybrid market will serve the exchange's customers while maintaining the strengths of an auction market -- namely the ability to get better prices rather than just deliver what appears on a computer screen. ''The reason people come here is we have the best price 90 percent of the time and we have the best liquidity,'' Mr. Thain said. ''The more liquidity you have the better able you are to offer the best price, the more you have the best price, the more often the order flow comes to you. You cannot have one without the other.'' 
 On Dec. 17, at 9:20 a.m., Pfizer announced that Celebrex, one of its top-selling drugs, might increase the risk of heart attacks in users who take it for chronic pain. Hundreds of traders rushed to Thomas Shafir III, the auctioneer who manages the trading of Pfizer stock. For nearly an hour, the traders massed in front of Mr. Shafir, waiting to learn the opening price of the stock. By 10:09, Mr. Shafir declared that Pfizer would open at $23.52, down $5.26 from the previous day's close. Ultimately, he managed the trading of 202 million shares of Pfizer, worth more than $5 billion.
 Still, electronic exchanges claim they can match the Big Board's performance. Archipelago, an all-electronic exchange based in Chicago, did not halt its Pfizer trading that day. Moreover, when the Big Board opened, ArcaEx, as the exchange is called, had already arrived at much the same price without using a specialist. ''Being open and trading and allowing the market to discover the price is the key. When the market's not open, are you better off?'' said Gerald Putnam, chief executive of Archipelago Holdings, the parent company of ArcaEx. 
 Thomas Peterffy, head of Interactive Brokers, an institutional trading firm, said hybrid models so far had been unsuccessful. ''There has been an experiment on hybrid on the Chicago Board Options Exchange and I do not see it working well for the users, but it works well for the floor members,'' he said. 
 Fidelity Investments, one of the toughest critics of the model, is also skeptical. ''The proof in the pudding in hybrid is whether it will eliminate the information advantage of the floor members that disadvantages institutional investors,'' said Eric Roiter, general counsel at Fidelity Investments. 
 According to critics, more automation means that the New York Stock Exchange may lose its information advantage -- the knowledge of what trades large players, such as mutual funds, are planning. Losing that knowledge could mean fewer orders. "There is a spiraling effect. As you lose the information, one customer takes his order off the floor, that translates to less information and less of an advantage,'' said Chris Concannon, executive vice president at the Nasdaq exchange. He said he believed that the S.E.C.'s new rules and a hybrid model would erode the Big Board's market share. ''No single large electronic pool of liquidity will have more than 50 percent'' of Big Board stock trading, he said. 
 Floor members, weary of a barrage of criticism, argue that the hybrid model offers investors more opportunities. ''It's a conscious choice, not a default,'' said Robert Fagenson, vice chairman at Van Der Moolen Specialists, one of seven specialist firms operating on the floor. ''We believe it gives the investor the best price. It's not as if we don't know how to put it in a black box.''
 Mr. Thain added: ''Customers act in their own economic self interest. The reason a customer gives an order to a floor broker is because a floor broker really does get them a better execution.''
 Critics and supporters agree that the New York Stock Exchange is not blessed with time. ''The New York Central Railroad saw itself as a national icon and it was obliterated,'' said Thomas Caldwell, chairman of Caldwell Asset Management and a buyer of four Big Board seats in the last year. ''It ceased to exist. So many did. New York has to have a newer vision of itself and confidence in that vision.''

HEADLINE: Talk about suspense: Anticipation builds for Steve Jobs' annual presentation at Macworld.

BYLINE: By John Markoff

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
IN what might be the next episode in Silicon Valley's longest-running soap opera, Apple Computer's chairman, Steven P. Jobs, is planning to surrender to the computer industry's received wisdom and introduce a sub-$500 Macintosh, according to several published reports.
 So much for ''Think Different.'' 
 In the past Apple has stood alone, insisting that its software and industrial design continue to command a premium from computer users willing to stray from the Windows and Intel computing standard. Is that era about to end? 
 The answer will come during Mr. Jobs's keynote presentation at Macworld, which will take place here Jan. 11 at the Moscone Convention Center. And in what has become a tradition for Mr. Jobs, speculation has heightened expectations far beyond what surrounds any other technology industry executive. 
 The Macworld event is an annual rite for the Mac faithful, who accord the conference a reverence approaching that surrounding baseball's spring training. Each year there is impassioned speculation about what Mr. Jobs may or may not be planning for the coming year. In recent years a handful of Macintosh rumor Web sites have fed the frenzy by publishing ostensibly leaked product descriptions of the coming announcements.
 That in turn has led to skirmishes between Apple's legal department and the enthusiasts. In early January, Apple escalated the conflict by filing suit against thinksecret.com, a rumor site that in December published what it said were specifications of a new low-cost Macintosh computer. The lawsuit alleges that the Web site operator, who calls himself Nick dePlume (and who has refused to disclose his real name), attempted to induce Apple employees or contractors into divulging the company's trade secrets.
 Apple refused comment on the lawsuit, which appears to acknowledge the accuracy of the reports. Mr. dePlume, who describes himself as the editor and publisher of Think Secret, said in an e-mail message that he was reviewing the lawsuit and that he was confident that his reporting would be protected by the First Amendment.
 However, even if the product descriptions, which have since been treated as gospel, are accurate, Mr. dePlume could be right about the facts but wrong about the larger picture.
 If Mr. Jobs is now actually preparing to plunge into the Best Buy and Circuit City world of razor-thin consumer electronics margins, he would finally be paying heed to the industry pundits who have repeatedly claimed during the seven years since he returned to run Apple Computer that the company was doomed by its higher-priced computers.
 The reasoning goes as follows: Having tricked the computer industry into believing that Apple was on the verge of becoming a digital music company on the strength of its wildly popular iPod music player, Mr. Jobs will suddenly reverse ground and begin selling a new iPod peripheral -- a cheap Mac desktop -- to the legions of PC owners who have eagerly purchased iPods but so far have failed to switch to the more costly Mac computer world.
 It would be a nifty jujitsu move that would finally lure the millions of PC owners who have lusted for a Mac, but have until now stuck with the Chevrolet-like price tags of Windows-based PC's.
 ''Apple wasn't building market share because of the switching costs,'' said Charles Wolf, a financial analyst at Needham & Company, a New York investment firm. ''It's such a logical move.'' 
 And yet it just does not seem likely that Mr. Jobs is now ready to descend into the brutal low-priced PC wars with the likes of Dell and Hewlett-Packard. The obvious dangers inherent in that course were underscored recently when I.B.M. released financial data showing that it had lost almost $1 billion in recent years in the ailing PC division that it just sold control of to the Chinese computer maker Lenovo.
 For Apple, the nightmare consequence of a low-cost Mac scenario is that it might do no more than cannibalize the company's high-margin markets. Unless a cheap Macintosh is artfully crippled, many existing Apple customers might decide to scale down instead of scaling up. And if a low-cost computer is crippled in some obvious way, it might fail to increase the Macintosh market by any meaningful amount. 
 And based on Mr. Jobs's history, a low-cost Macintosh seems remarkably out of character. In all his years at Apple and Next Inc. (the computer maker he started after being driven from Apple in 1985), the one surprise that has never come from Mr. Jobs is a low sticker price.
 So if Steve Jobs is really thinking differently on Jan. 11, it would make more sense that, instead of cost-cutting, he is counting on his proven ability to create new markets seemingly from whole cloth.
 Having successfully connected the music world and the computer worlds with the iPod, Mr. Jobs may have his sights on extending Apple in other new directions -- perhaps a high-priced set-top box -- rather than looking backwards. He has worked his magic in Hollywood before and would have the credibility to strike an alliance that might permit Apple to deliver movies and video to some sort of elegant digital home server.
 ''Remember, he's a mogul in both Silicon Valley and Hollywood,'' said Tim Bajarin, a Silicon Valley consultant who is president of Creative Strategies.
 To be sure, Mr. Jobs has been frequently and publicly skeptical about the efforts by Microsoft and others to create hand-held digital video players. He has been a little more circumspect about the idea of watching digital movies at home.
 Whatever he has in the works, Mr. Jobs has already succeeded in one sense. When he takes the stage at Macworld, clad (inevitably) in running shoes, jeans and a black turtleneck and carrying a bottle of spring water, he has insured that all will be there on the edges of their seats to find out what will be the Next Big Thing.

HEADLINE: For Honduras and Iran, World's Aid Evaporated

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON and NAZILA FATHI; Ginger Thompson reported from Honduras for this article and Nazila Fathi from Iran. Stephanie Strom contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras 

 BODY:
The people of San Miguel Arcangel know all too well what it is like to be struck by disaster, and they have watched the world rush to Asia's rescue with sober eyes.
 Elder Nahum Caceres said his entire community was swept off a hillside six years ago by Hurricane Mitch. In his wallet he keeps a handwritten list of the dozen international aid organizations that have come and gone since then.
 ''I don't know how much they sent, but they tell me this is a million-dollar project,'' Mr. Caceres said, looking down over an unsightly patch of flat gray houses in different stages of completion. ''I would like them to see what has happened with all their money.'' 
 Eric Moscoso, a neighbor of Mr. Caceres, was more succinct: ''We are abandoned.''
 Six years ago it was scenes from Honduras that filled television newscasts and newspaper pages. Then as now, there was a public outpouring of sympathy and support. Then as now, heads of state pledged huge amounts of aid. International relief agencies committed themselves to ''build back better,'' promising to stay for the long term and provide the tools needed to overcome the social and economic forces that make the poor so vulnerable.
 It is possible that this time will be different, that the donor nations really will come through with the aid they have promised, and there are reasons for optimism. [In Washington on Monday, President Bush promised a ''long-term commitment'' to the victims and urged Americans not to reduce charitable giving to other parts of the world. Page A10.] 
 In addition, the tsunami catastrophe, in sheer numbers of victims and countries affected, is on a scale far greater than any recent natural disaster. And in the post-9/11 world -- particularly the United States, with the war in Iraq and the fight against terrorism -- the richer countries now have a strong incentive to demonstrate their sensitivity to the concerns of people in developing countries, and particularly to Muslims, who died in disproportionate numbers in the waves. 
 But all too often when disaster strikes -- from here in Honduras to Iran, where the ancient city of Bam was shattered by an earthquake a year ago, to Mozambique, which endured floods in 2000 -- that mission seems to last only as long as the media attention. 
 After the last bodies are counted and public focus shifts, governments stop sending money, pledges are withdrawn, many private relief organizations pack their bags and the poor are left to finish reconstruction projects in the face of the same entrenched systems of corruption and neglect.
 Walking with Mr. Caceres through the dirt streets of San Miguel Arcangel, one has a hard time telling whether his neighborhood is doomed or coming back to life.
 Half of the sturdy, concrete houses have not been properly wired for electricity. A water and sanitation system was installed four months ago, but the main pump broke down over Christmas. There is a school, but mothers say the teachers have worse attendance records than their children. There is a clinic but no doctor, a police post with no officers, and a community meeting hall, but no one in the community has the keys.
 ''We have new houses, but all the rest is the same,'' Mr. Caceres said. ''It's true we were poor before. And we are still poor. But now we are forgotten.''
 As aid officials plan how to deal with the challenges facing the battered coasts of Thailand, Sri Lanka, India and Indonesia, some have cautioned that they must do things differently this time.
 ''There is still this feeling that we want to do the right thing, right now, but we don't want to stay in it for the long term,'' said Eric Schwartz, a former Clinton administration official. As a senior National Security Council official, he helped organize the United States response to Hurricane Mitch. ''Maybe the tsunami crisis could be used as a vehicle to educate ourselves about the importance of staying the course,'' he said.
 Meeting in Brussels on Jan. 7, directors of Europe's relief agencies looked back at the record of reconstruction efforts in Honduras, Iran and Mozambique to examine how those operations had fallen short.
 Mitch was the tsunami of its time, a freak of nature that hovered over this region for nearly five days, dumping rain measured in feet, not inches. It was called the hemisphere's most devastating disaster of the century, one that turned rivers into raging torrents and unleashed landslides, killing and burying its victims all at once. It cost an estimated 9,000 lives and more than $9 billion in property damage.

Pledges Unfulfilled
 Soon after the tragedy, the international community pledged about $9 billion to help rebuild Central America. Today, experts at the Center on International Cooperation at New York University say most of that money never materialized. Half of what did was offered as loans, Honduran officials said.
 Trocaire, the overseas development agency of the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland, said Europe did not even begin its $250 million reconstruction plan in Honduras until three years after the hurricane struck. And it said debt relief meant little to Honduras because the country was still obligated to make interest payments on its debt, estimated at some $219 million last year.
 Abby Stoddard, a research assistant at the Center on International Cooperation, said, ''In general, relief funds are disbursed quicker than recovery funds, which are needed after the cameras go away, and there is no mechanism for holding governments accountable for living up to their pledges.''
 That pattern was apparent in Iran, too. A year after an earthquake with a magnitude of 6.9 destroyed the central city of Bam, killing more than 40,000 people and leaving almost as many homeless, the streets there are still strewn with mounds of rubble. Tens of thousands of people who lost their homes remain crowded in prefabricated housing.
 The authorities there promised to have the ancient city rebuilt by now. But navigating Iran's byzantine bureaucracy and legal system held up projects longer than many relief organizations could wait.
 ''Time is crucial'' for the relief groups, said Patrick Parson, project coordinator of the British-based medical relief agency Merlin. ''A lot of them just got tired of waiting and pulled out.''
 As a result, Iranian officials reported that they had received only $17 million of the $1 billion pledged by the international community to help rebuild the 2000-year-old city. United Nations officials, including Secretary General Kofi Annan, have recently called on world leaders to fulfill their pledges. 
 ''Foreign aid had more positive psychological effect than anything else,'' said Dr. Hamid Reza Jamshidi, the Iranian health minister's representative in Bam. ''People had lost everything, their home and their family. They felt they were not left alone when they saw different groups of foreigners in the city.''
 Central America, as a battlefield of the cold war, has long been accustomed to foreign occupation. But the people of Honduras had never seen anything like the military operations that arrived to bring aid after Hurricane Mitch. Honduras, the region's poorest country, was the hardest hit. The scope of death and destruction pales in comparison to that still unfolding across the Indian Ocean.

Response to Hurricane
 But Mitch was considered an unparalleled natural disaster back then, and like the killer tsunamis, it stirred an enormous response. Mexico established a special air route to the affected areas and sent airplanes, helicopters and military ships to transport medicine and food. Canadian air force crews shuttled daily to deliver aid.
 The United States promised more money than it had for any previous disaster -- some $900 million -- and sent a military relief force of a scale not seen since the Berlin airlift 50 years earlier. At least nine countries deferred debt payments.
 When the waters began to recede, relief workers and Central American authorities looked into the face of the disaster and saw opportunities. They promised more than bricks and mortar to rebuild communities. 
 In a meeting in Stockholm in 1999, about six months after the storm, donor countries and Central American governments committed themselves to channeling money into long-term programs to transform the region. 
 Donor governments insisted on close scrutiny of the spending. Japan and Switzerland hired only subcontractors from their own countries to rebuild Honduras's major bridges, recalled Moises Starkman, the former Honduran minister of international cooperation. The United States approved only those infrastructure projects that had been examined by the Army Corps of Engineers.
 But just as the first new bricks were being laid, the United States Congress set a two-year-deadline on Washington's reconstruction programs, contending that the money was for emergency relief. And when the federal money was gone, so were many private organizations, whether their projects were finished or not.
 Phil Gelman, regional adviser for the United States Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, was working in Honduras for Care International at the time. That deadline, he said, doomed American projects to fail at achieving long-term goals.
 'You can build a house in three years,'' he said. ''You can build a house in three months. But rebuilding systems is a different thing.
 ''These countries did not get to be the way they are overnight. They don't change overnight.''
 That becomes clear during a visit to places like San Miguel Arcangel. It is one of several sprawling housing complexes built for those displaced by Hurricane Mitch in an area known as Amarateca, about 15 miles north of Tegucigalpa.
 The project began with a single great promise: to provide safe, affordable housing to people who had never had it before. There are some places where the promise for a better life seems clearer, but they are the exception, not the rule.
 Not far from San Miguel Arcangel is a community built with support of the Spanish government and the Red Cross, called Ciudad Espana. The 1,300 units have electricity and running water. There is a library, a police post, an elementary and a junior high school, three day care centers and a senior center.
 Luis Felipe Quiroz is a leader on the newly elected community council. ''The hurricane took everything from me,'' he said. ''From that moment on I was nothing. Now I have my life back.''
 Most of those left homeless by Hurricane Mitch had lived in slums perched on the banks of the Choluteca River, which cuts through the center of the capital. They had unreliable sources of electricity and water. And they were squatting on land declared uninhabitable because of the potential for deadly floods.

Little Time for Planning
 Three years after Mitch, 20,000 people were still homeless and living in temporary shelters. Relief agencies complained that the Honduran government provided almost no help in finding sites inside the capital to build new housing complexes. By the time they identified Amarateca -- far from ideal because of a 45-minute bus ride from jobs-- relief agencies had little time for urban planning.
 They rushed to put up walls and roofs, before municipal authorities installed basic services. Then the government reneged on its promise to provide the services. The hurricane victims rebelled.
 In 2002, about 200 people stormed into a church in the capital and told the priest that no one could leave until the families were permitted to move into permanent housing. Relief agencies relented, but there was no electricity, running water and sanitation in the new homes.
 A year later, angry residents blocked the major northbound highway to demand basic services.
 Mr. Caceres said they finally got electricity six months ago. The United States Army Corps of Engineers installed a water system four months ago; it promptly broke down.
 Today, people in San Miguel Arcangel say the houses built by the international community are better than anything they could have ever dreamed of buying on their own. But many are unemployed, and costs have risen. 
 ''Just as fast as we built this community, it will disappear, because people do not have what they need to live,'' Mr. Caceres said.

HEADLINE: Nation's Health Spending Slows, but It Still Hits a Record

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
The torrid pace of growth in national health spending cooled a bit in 2003, but the spending, at $1.7 trillion, topped 15 percent of the gross domestic product for the first time, the government said on Monday.
 Total health spending rose 7.7 percent in 2003, compared with an increase of 9.3 percent the year before, in part because of state cutbacks in the Medicaid program and a slower increase in drug spending. But it grew much faster than the economy as a whole, and now accounts for 15.3 percent of the nation's output, the government said in its annual report on health spending.
 ''Prescription drug spending growth slowed more sharply than growth of any other service, increasing 10.7 percent in 2003, compared with 14.9 percent in 2002,'' said Cynthia Smith of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the principal author of the report, published in the journal Health Affairs. 
 Retail sales of prescription drugs totaled $179.2 billion in 2003, the government said. Though drug sales increased more slowly than in 2002, they are still growing faster than overall national health spending, the data showed.
 The figures indicated why drug costs remain a combustible political issue: consumers often pay a large share of the price. Prescription drugs accounted for 11 percent of national health spending, but 23 percent of total out-of-pocket spending by patients. 
 Consumers dipped into their own pockets to pay 30 percent of prescription drug costs -- $53.2 billion of the $179.2 billion spent on prescription medicines in 2003. Consumers have much more extensive insurance for hospital costs; they pay just 3 percent of those costs from their pockets.
 In the last decade, public spending on health care has grown somewhat faster than private spending, but in 2003, the reverse was true. Private spending rose 8.6 percent in 2003, after rising 9 percent the year before.
 By contrast, economists saw a sharp deceleration in the growth of Medicaid, the federal-state health program for low-income people. Medicaid spending rose 7.1 percent in 2003, to $267 billion, following growth of 12.1 percent the year before.
 Spending on Medicare, the federal health program for the elderly and the disabled, grew 5.7 percent in 2003, to $283.1 billion, compared with an increase of 7.6 percent in 2002. 
 Out-of-pocket payments were the only major source of health spending to increase faster in 2003 than in 2002, the administration said. Federal health officials offered two reasons: the number of people without health insurance is increasing, and employers who provide coverage are requiring workers to bear more of the costs.
 In the last few years, Ms. Smith said, ''employers have been more willing to pass on cost increases to employees by increasing co-payments for physician visits, requiring separate hospital deductibles and raising drug plan co-payments.''
 Payments for private health insurance, in the form of premiums, increased 9.3 percent in 2003, compared with an increase of 10.6 percent in 2002, the report said. But benefits did not grow as fast as did the premiums collected by insurers. ''Administrative costs and insurer profits accelerated as benefit growth decelerated,'' the report said.
 Mary Carol Barron, a health economist at the Department of Health and Human Services, said that ''at least 34 states took measures to control Medicaid costs in 2003,'' typically by tightening eligibility or restricting benefits. 
 Factors contributing to the slowdown in the growth of drug spending included a smaller increase in the number of prescriptions; greater use of low-cost generic drugs; higher co-payments, which tend to discourage use of some drugs; and the conversion of Claritin, the popular allergy drug, to over-the-counter status. 
 Consumer purchases from Canadian pharmacies, estimated at $1.1 billion in 2003, were not counted in health spending for the United States. American sales of generic drugs grew at twice the rate of brand-name drug sales in 2003. ''When offered a choice, consumers opt for a generic drug almost 90 percent of the time in chain drug stores,'' the report said.
 President Bush, campaigning for limits on malpractice lawsuits, said last week that ''we have the best health care system in the world.''
 But the United States devotes a much larger share of its economic output to health care than other industrial countries do. Among the 30 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the countries with the next largest shares, Switzerland and Germany, spend less than 12 percent of G.D.P. on health care.
 Health spending continues to grow in most industrial countries, with rapid advances in medical technology and aging populations, even when economic growth is slow.
 Paul B. Ginsburg, president of the Center for Studying Health System Change, a private group that tracks health costs, said those trends could pose problems for the United States because of the way it finances health care.
 ''Health insurance premiums are growing faster than what people earn,'' Mr. Ginsburg said. ''Government health care spending is growing faster than federal revenues, crowding out other priorities.''
 The report said that health spending in the United States averaged $5,670 a person in 2003, up $353 from 2002.
 Hospital care accounts for nearly one-third of all health spending, and slower growth in spending for hospital services was a significant factor in the national trend. Hospital spending rose 6.5 percent in 2003, to $515.9 billion, following an increase of 8.5 percent in the prior year. 
 Many states, wrestling with budget problems, froze Medicaid payments to hospitals. Medicaid spending on hospitals grew 5.3 percent in 2003, about six percentage points less than the year before.
 Medicaid and Medicare alike curbed spending for nursing home care. Medicaid payments to nursing homes grew just 1 percent in 2003, to $51 billion, following an increase of 8.1 percent in 2002. 
 Likewise, the government said, Medicare payments to nursing homes ''increased only 1.3 percent in 2003, following three years of rapid growth that averaged 16.2 percent a year between 1999 and 2002.''

HEADLINE: Your Call (and Rants on Hold) Will Be Monitored

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: MELVILLE, N.Y. 

 BODY:
It is the opening line on so many phone conversations these days: This call may be monitored for quality assurance purposes.
 The taped message is so common that many callers might assume that no one is ever listening, let alone taking notes. But they would be wrong.
 Monitoring is intended to track the performance of call center operators, but the professional snoops are inadvertently monitoring callers, too. Most callers do not realize that they may be taped even while they are on hold. 
 It is at these times that monitors hear husbands arguing with their wives, mothers yelling at their children, and dog owners throwing fits at disobedient pets, all when they think no one is listening. Most times, the only way a customer can avoid being recorded is to hang up.
 ''You could have a show on Broadway just playing the calls,'' said Mike Schrider, president of J.Lodge, a call monitoring service based in Hammonton, N.J. 
 Call monitors eavesdrop on millions of exchanges a year, and listening to the mumblings and rants of people on hold comes with the job. Over all, about 2 percent of the hundreds of millions of calls made to call centers are monitored by a company's own managers or, increasingly, by third-party monitoring companies, which have come on the scene in the last couple of years.
 Tapping into calls from his cubicle in Melville, N.Y., Stuart Pike is one of an army of listeners employed by these companies. He has an unrestricted view of how corporate America deals with the public -- and how the public talks back.
 The business of assessing the behavior of operators has taken on a new urgency in recent years. With so many companies selling similar products at similar prices, competent and professional customer service agents are more and more the difference between a sale and a lost opportunity, a burnished brand and a tarnished one.
 That reality has turned third-party call monitoring into a fast-growing industry watching over the nation's six million call center operators as well as hundreds of thousands offshore. And people like Mr. Pike, who listens to about 150 calls a week, have become the equivalent of factory foremen policing America's service economy. 
 Recently, Mr. Pike stumbled onto a call where a young male customer was flirting with a female service agent at a cellphone company. After some giggles and banter, the woman relented and gave her personal phone number to the customer. Mr. Pike quickly alerted the cellphone company to the phone date.
 ''You'd be surprised how casual it can get,'' said Mr. Pike, who works at Aon Consulting, one of the nation's biggest third-party call center monitors. ''It's like watching TV. There's always something interesting on.''
 Some privacy advocates worry that monitors, as well as operators, can steal customer passwords and other sensitive data. Thus far, few documented cases of identity theft have been unearthed involving monitors, and most monitoring companies screen their applicants. State wiretapping laws generally do not provide protection against recording of call center conversations (the taped message at the start of the call is in most cases considered an adequate privacy warning). 
 Fears of identity theft have not slowed the monitoring business. In fact, under tighter scrutiny by regulators, most financial institutions are now taping all their calls.
 The growth of monitoring has also been fueled by the advent of Internet phone technology, which has substantially cut the cost of long-distance calls and made call monitoring as easy as clicking a mouse. Sophisticated software that automatically records conversations has increased the number of calls monitors can assess.
 As more call centers move offshore, companies are starting to outsource the monitoring, too. From any corner of the globe, call monitors with just a computer and an Internet connection can oversee workers virtually anywhere. For instance, Mr. Pike on Long Island listens to service agents in India who may be talking to customers in Indiana. Monitors in Britain are likely to listen to customers in New York talking to German operators in Frankfurt.
 In effect, monitors have become referees on an international scale. ''We act as the conscience of the company,'' said Paul Kowal, the president of Kowal Associates, an industry consultant and a third-party monitor. 
 Sometimes, refereeing means reporting off-color calls -- known in call center parlance as a ''hot line'' -- like the flirtation that Mr. Pike overheard. Plenty of other calls also raise red flags, including customers and operators who shout, swear, talk politics or threaten bodily harm. Anyone hanging up -- either an operator or an angry customer -- sends out warnings, too.
 Just a few years ago, most companies simply ranked their operators on how quickly they picked up calls and ended them. Now call monitors rate operators by checking off boxes on detailed electronic questionnaires that assess qualities like efficiency, conversational skills and ability to mollify frustrated customers. The scores from each monitored call are collected to rank an operator's performance. 
 Handling angry callers ''is like dealing with road rage,'' Mr. Pike said.
 Operators who can defuse aggression -- a not-insignificant talent -- win plaudits. Operators also have to deal with the slow talkers, the lonely chatterers and the absent-minded. At night, the drunks come out.
 Hearing this hidden side of American commerce turns the monitors into amateur experts in American phone etiquette. ''Bad calls stick in my mind because I can't believe what I've heard,'' said Renee Rea, who sits, with headphones on, a few rows from Mr. Pike in a room largely silent except for fingers tapping on keyboards.
 To do the job, Ms. Rea and her colleagues need an aptitude for listening, a rare commodity in a culture where the opposite of talking is waiting to talk. Indeed, finding monitors willing to sit in silence all day is not easy, and turnover is a problem for jobs that involve a mix of industrial psychology and Marketing 101.
 Monitors typically score operators on their ''openings,'' like the friendliness of their greeting. They flag annoying habits like using run-on sentences or talking in a monotone, and even gauge the mood of calls by noting whether operators sound like they are smiling as they talk.
 Operators are given demerits for transferring customers without asking, keeping someone on hold for too long and blaming others instead of trying to solve problems. Providing incorrect information is another no-no.
 Occasionally, monitors will right mistakes they hear. Michael Betts, another Aon assessor, once heard an operator book a hotel room for a customer on the wrong date. Mr. Betts, a former comptroller who says he is ''a born editor,'' alerted the hotel, which notified the customer and undid the error.
 Sometimes, monitors are privy to domestic disputes that erupt in the background during a call. But intervening on those calls is rare because many are recorded and are assessed hours after they take place; often the monitor does not know the caller's location. 
 Joyce Van Doren, an assessor for J.Lodge, recalled one man who canceled the cable service that was in his name because, he said, he had just divorced. The man, however, failed to hang up the phone when the customer service agent ended the call, so the tape kept rolling.
 That is when Ms. Van Doren heard him reveal his real motive to a friend in the room: getting back at his former wife, who was going to be livid when she came home to find the cable TV disconnected.
 Other calls are more poignant. Ms. Rea at Aon recalled with a tinge of sadness a woman who called a financial institution to change the name on her account because her husband had died. Rather than offering condolences and making an emotional connection with the customer, however fleeting, the agent robotically asked for her account number. Ms. Rea marked the agent down for failing to show empathy.
 Operators can also be marked down for being too helpful. Ms. Van Doren recalls one who told a customer about a special promotion on a cable service that was to start two weeks later. The customer was delighted, but the operator was reprimanded for failing to make the sale the day the customer called. 
 With thousands of call center jobs moving overseas, monitors are also noticing a growing reaction against operators with foreign accents. More customers now ask to speak to an American after they hear an operator with an Indian accent, said Miriam Nelson, who helps run Aon Consulting's center.
 ''In India, the operators are doing a lot of the courtesies they are trained to do,'' Ms. Nelson said, but they often miss the nuance of conversations. She added that some Indian call centers show their operators episodes of ''Seinfeld'' and ''Friends'' to teach them about American culture.
 Nothing on television, though, can prepare an Indian operator for chatty American consumers who like to talk about the ups and downs of the New York Yankees or the latest blizzard in Chicago. 
 Perhaps inevitably, monitoring is also moving offshore. HyperQuality, which is based in Seattle, has 100 call monitors in New Delhi who eavesdrop on call center workers around the United States. Those raters, oceans away, are trying to make sense of hot lines and hotheads, too.

HEADLINE: I.B.M. to Give Free Access To 500 Patents

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
I.B.M. plans to announce today that it is making 500 of its software patents freely available to anyone working on open-source projects, like the popular Linux operating system, on which programmers collaborate and share code.
 The new model for I.B.M., analysts say, represents a shift away from the traditional corporate approach to protecting ownership of ideas through patents, copyrights, trademark and trade-secret laws. The conventional practice is to amass as many patents as possible and then charge anyone who wants access to them. I.B.M. has long been the champion of that formula. The company, analysts estimate, collected $1 billion or more last year from licensing its inventions. 
 The move comes after a lengthy internal review by I.B.M., the world's largest patent holder, of its strategy toward intellectual property. I.B.M. executives said the patent donation today would be the first of several such steps.
 John Kelly, the senior vice president for technology and intellectual property, called the patent contribution ''the beginning of a new era in how I.B.M. will manage intellectual property.'' 
 I.B.M. may be redefining its intellectual property strategy, but it apparently has no intention of slowing the pace of its patent activity. I.B.M. was granted 3,248 patents in 2004, far more than any other company, according to the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The patent office is announcing today its yearly ranking of the top 10 private-sector patent recipients. 
 I.B.M. collected 1,300 more patents last year than the second-ranked company, Matsushita Electric Industrial of Japan. The other American companies among the top 10 patent recipients were Hewlett-Packard, Micron Technology and Intel.
 I.B.M. executives say the company's new approach to intellectual property represents more than a rethinking of where the company's self-interest lies. In recent speeches, for example, Samuel J. Palmisano, I.B.M.'s chief executive, has emphasized the need for more open technology standards and collaboration as a way to stimulate economic growth and job creation.
 On this issue, I.B.M. appears to be siding with a growing number of academics and industry analysts who regard open-source software projects as early evidence of the wide collaboration and innovation made possible by the Internet, providing opportunities for economies, companies and individuals who can exploit the new model. 
 ''This is exciting,'' said Lawrence Lessig, a professor at Stanford Law School and founder of the school's Center for Internet and Society. ''It is I.B.M. making good on its commitment to encourage a different kind of software development and recognizing the burden that patents can impose.'' 
 I.B.M. has already made substantial contributions to open-source software projects in the last few years. The company has been the leading corporate supporter of Linux. It donated computer code worth more than $40 million to an open-source group, Eclipse, which offers software tools for building programs. Last year, I.B.M. gave to an open-source group a database program called Cloudscape, which cost the company $85 million to develop. 
 Those past contributions, however, have gone mainly to projects that serve to make Linux -- fast becoming a viable alternative to the operating systems Windows from Microsoft and Solaris from Sun Microsystems -- more attractive to corporate customers. In that respect, supporting Linux helps to undermine I.B.M.'s rivals and can be seen as a smart tactic for I.B.M. The company's commercial software strategy is focused largely on its WebSphere software, which runs on top of operating systems. 
 Today's move by I.B.M. is not aimed at a specific project, but opens access to 14 categories of technology, including those that manage electronic commerce, storage, image processing, data handling and Internet communications.
 ''This is much broader than the contributions we've made in the past,'' said Jim Stallings, vice president for standards and intellectual property at I.B.M. ''These patents are for technologies that are deeply embedded in many industry uses, and they will be available to anyone working on open-source projects including small companies and individual entrepreneurs.''
 I.B.M. executives said they hoped the company's initial contribution of 500 patents would be the beginning of a ''patent commons,'' which other companies would join. I.B.M. has not yet approached other companies, Mr. Stallings said.
 I.B.M. will continue to hold the 500 patents. But it has pledged to seek no royalties from and to place no restrictions on companies, groups or individuals who use them in open-source projects, as defined by the Open Source Initiative, a nonprofit education and advocacy group. The group's definition involves a series of policies allowing for free redistribution, publication of the underlying source code and no restrictions on who uses the software or how it is used.
 Just how far I.B.M. intends to go in granting open access to its patents is uncertain. The 500 patents are a small slice of its corporate patent trove of more than 40,000 worldwide and 25,000 in the United States. In recent years, software patents have accounted for about half of the patents granted to I.B.M.

HEADLINE: Shares Up Slightly at Close After Wave of Late Selling 

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks finished slightly higher yesterday as investors bet that companies would report higher fourth-quarter earnings, although a late-afternoon wave of computerized trades wiped out part of the gains.
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 17.07 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 10,621.03. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.06 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,190.25. The Nasdaq composite index was up 8.43 points, or 0.40 percent, to 2,097.04. 
 Comcast jumped 2 percent, or 66 cents, to $33.23, after it raised the stakes in its competitive battle against telephone companies by announcing plans to ramp up its residential phone service.
 Stocks failed to get a lift from a late-day fall in the price of oil -- usually a boost as lower crude helps corporate earnings and consumer spending. Crude for February delivery settled at $45.33 a barrel, down 10 cents, after a volatile day when the price jumped over $47 a barrel.
 ''The market was interesting in the sense that it was up all day even though oil was high all day, and then oil prices sold off sharply right at the end, and the market retreated -- whereas normally it would go up,'' said Tom Schrader, managing director of United States equity trading at Legg Mason Wood Walker in Baltimore.
 Part of the fallback came from the trimming of gains in shares of energy companies as oil slipped back. Exxon Mobil rose as high as $50.50, but closed just 19 cents higher at $49.98. ChevronTexaco gained 23 cents, to $51.38.
 Investors were focused on earnings news, before the start of the fourth-quarter reporting season this week.
 ''This is what we call the pre-enthusiasm period for fourth-quarter earnings,'' said Ned Riley, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston.
 Earnings from technology companies like Intel and Apple Computer this week will give a ''pretty good insight'' into the health of the technology sector, he said. 
 Intel rose 8 cents, to $22.88, although Apple, which holds its annual trade show this week, fell 29 cents, to $68.96.
 Edward Keon at Prudential Equity Group was relatively bullish about earnings, saying in a note that annual earnings growth could top 20 percent for the fourth quarter if results ''continue to blow away expectations.''
 Alcoa posted a lower net profit after the closing bell as it took a charge for shedding noncore businesses. Its shares closed the regular session down 22 cents, at $30.47, and slipped 3 cents lower, to $30.44, on the Inet electronic exchange.
 Tobacco shares got a lift during ordinary trading, after Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the stock of Altria, the parent of the cigarette maker Philip Morris. Altria climbed 1.3 percent, or 80 cents, to $62.20.
 Fox Entertainment jumped nearly 10 percent, or $3.06, to $34.28, after the News Corporation, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch, said that it would buy out the other shareholders of its Fox Entertainment affiliate through an exchange offer worth $6 billion. Shares of the News Corporation fell 2 percent, or 38 cents, to $17.85.
 Shares of housing stocks rebounded strongly, regaining some ground lost the first week of the year. The Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index rose 3.28 percent. 
 In a research note, a UBS analyst, Margaret Whelan, said she expected the top 10 home builders to gain market share and post a higher return on capital even as housing demand slowed in 2005. 
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note fell 1/32, to a price of 9926/32. The note's yield was unchanged at 4.27 percent.
 Here are the results of the three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: U.S. Official Faults China On Textile Trade Moves 

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
China's imposition of tariffs on apparel exports two weeks ago does not address the concerns of the United States, which wants Beijing to remove barriers to American fabric exports and end local and provincial subsidies for apparel factories, a senior American trade official said here on Monday.
 The complex global system of quotas that has governed international trade in textiles and apparel for more than three decades expired on Dec. 31. That has prompted fears in the United States that low-cost Chinese exports may flood American and European markets and bankrupt local companies.
 The American official, Grant D. Aldonas, the under secretary of commerce for international trade, said at a news conference here that the tariffs were so low that they would have a negligible effect on Chinese exports of clothing to the United States. At most, the tariffs may discourage some Chinese exports to developing countries, he said. 
 But Mr. Aldonas stopped short of threatening any specific retaliation if China did nothing more to curb the growth of its share of the American market. An unexpected court ruling at the end of December has limited the Bush administration's ability to restrict Chinese apparel exports, depriving American negotiators of the cudgel they had been using in talks with Beijing.
 Mr. Aldonas and the departing commerce secretary, Donald L. Evans, will go to Beijing this week for trade talks. Mr. Aldonas said the team would discuss the lack of full convertibility of China's currency, but he declined to discuss growing international calls for Beijing to permit its currency to appreciate.
 ''The main message to our friends in Beijing is that China's role in the world economy is changing, its impact on world trade is changed,'' he said. ''There is an obligation that goes along with the role to which China aspires in the world trading system and the world economy as a whole.'' 
 The Bush administration and the American apparel industry had been counting on the reimposition of quotas on Chinese apparel exports under special ''safeguard'' provisions that China accepted as part of the price of its joining the World Trade Organization in November 2001. 
 But the United States Court of International Trade in New York unexpectedly agreed on Dec. 30 to a request by American retailers for a preliminary injunction barring the safeguard quotas.
 The retailers had argued that the Bush administration was wrong to proceed based on the threat that imports would disrupt American markets, instead of waiting to see if any disruption actually occurred. Jim Leonard, the deputy assistant secretary of commerce for textiles and apparel, said here that Justice Department lawyers were studying whether to file an appeal.
 Mr. Aldonas said on Monday that local and provincial governments were lending money to textile and apparel factories without requiring repayment and were offering rent-free space in factories. But garment industry executives and experts here have consistently said that with a few exceptions, apparel factories in China receive few subsidies. 
 ''I'm sure there are cases where certain provinces or municipalities might look kindly on any industry coming in,'' said Peter Shay, the managing director of MMG Asia Ltd., a fashion industry consulting and investment banking firm. But he added that ''apparel is not the flavor of the month.''
 ''This is not what is being promoted by the Chinese government; it's not a pillar industry.''
 International trade laws permit countries to impose tariffs on imports that are subsidized by foreign governments. But the Bush administration has not pursued this remedy, which requires elaborate documentation of the subsidies. 
 Beijing set export tariffs on apparel on Dec. 27 as a fixed sum, typically 2 to 6 cents a garment, rather than as a percentage of the price of the garment.
 Mr. Aldonas said that Chinese officials had told him that the tariffs worked out to 2 to 4 percent of the export value of Chinese apparel shipments. But the tariffs actually work out to a smaller percentage of the value of the mostly costlier garments exported to the United States, he said, and a larger percentage of the value of less expensive garments shipped to developing countries.
 ''The 2 percent to 4 percent impact is negligible in terms of anything that would come to the United States,'' Mr. Aldonas said.
 Most of the cost of clothing sold in stores in the United States involves design, transport, financing, insurance, store rent and so forth, while the shirts, pants and other garments by themselves often cost only $1 or $2 to produce.
 Mr. Aldonas has been widely cited in Washington as a leading candidate to succeed Robert B. Zoellick as the United States trade representative. President Bush announced on Friday that he intended to nominate Mr. Zoellick to become deputy secretary of state.
 Mr. Aldonas was the director of South American and Caribbean affairs in the trade representative's office in 1984 and 1985.

HEADLINE: Making the Cuts, Keeping the Benefits

BYLINE: By Cindy Williams. 
Cindy Williams, a principal research scientist in the Security Studies Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is the editor of ''Filling the Ranks: Transforming the U.S. Military Personnel System.''

DATELINE: Cambridge, Mass. 

 BODY:
IN an effort to reduce the growth of the military budget, the Bush administration is poised to cut back a wide array of Pentagon programs, from jet fighters to a missile defense system. Pentagon leaders say the cuts will save more than $55 billion over six years.
 Whether these reductions herald the end of the rapid rise in military spending that began in 1999, however, is open to question. While fewer weapons systems than planned will be purchased during the next six years, in financial terms, putting an end to the buildup will require cutting far more than what is now on the chopping block. One reason is that much of the recent rise in spending has been fueled not by new tanks or missiles, but by new costs associated with military personnel -- especially retirees. These costs amount to a permanent increase in the military budget. Unlike spending on equipment, they cannot be canceled or deferred. 
 Since the start of the buildup, the rising costs of military pay, retiree benefits, health care and family housing have greatly outstripped inflation and added more than $40 billion to annual Pentagon budgets, even though the number of active-duty troops has essentially stayed the same. Moreover, the annual costs continue to grow rapidly. The program reductions that are reported to be under consideration would not be enough to offset the growth in spending for military pay and benefits anticipated during the next several years. Even holding the increases in the military budget to the level of inflation would require tens of billions of dollars in annual reductions.
 To the extent that added pay and benefits ensure the nation does right by the men and women who fight for it, these increases would seem worthwhile. Unfortunately, a large share of new spending is devoted not to helping soldiers serving today, but to improving the benefits for military retirees -- that is, the small minority of veterans who stay in the military for 20 years or more and are eligible for immediate benefits upon their retirements.
 In recent years, Congress has expanded retiree benefits substantially, making them the fastest-growing category of entitlements for military personnel. In 1999, Congress reversed a 1986 law that would have trimmed pensions for retirees who joined the military after 1986. That change costs the Defense Department some $1 billion annually. A health care entitlement granted by Congress in 2000 pays virtually all medical expenses for older retirees and their spouses -- including the cost of prescription drugs -- that are not covered by Medicare. That entitlement costs the Defense Department nearly $4 billion now and its costs will rise over the coming years. 
 Another benefit, granted by Congress last year and scheduled to be phased in over a decade, will permit retirees who depart the military with moderate to severe disabilities to collect retirement pensions in addition to their disability payments. Its cost, about $500 million this year, will rise to some $2.5 billion a year in six years. In addition, a change authorized in October 2004 will enrich the pensions of spouses who outlive retired service members, at a cost of about $200 million this year and nearly $1 billion in 2011. As expensive as these new benefits are, advocates are pressing Congress for more. 
 These deferred entitlements do nothing to help men and women now in uniform. These members of the military face long and frequent family separations, deployment to distant lands, fighting in a dangerous counter-insurgency and more. Cash bonuses, improved family services, modern and well-maintained equipment and increases in troop strength (which would mean less frequent call-ups and deployments) are far more likely to serve their needs.
 In fact, most active-duty military will never get anything -- because they will leave the service before they are eligible to retire with benefits. Fewer than one in 12 of today's living veterans qualify for retiree benefits, and fewer than one in five of today's active-duty service members are expected to stay for the 20 years it takes to receive them. 
 Moreover, deferred benefits will not help the Army or the National Guard overcome the recruitment and retention problems they face as a result of the war in Iraq. The prospect of receiving such benefits in the distant future is virtually worthless in helping the military to persuade an 18-year-old to join the military or encourage a 23-year-old to re-enlist.
 The rapid growth of retiree benefits has already greatly complicated the budget picture for military leaders. Even if Congress decides against further expansion of such benefits, the ones it has already granted will make it hard to slow budget growth without further reducing the size of the military. Giving in to pressure for another round of entitlements, in the face of the challenges facing the troops serving in Iraq and elsewhere, would be irresponsible.

HEADLINE: Social Security: Is There a Crisis?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Honest people of good intentions, when discussing President Bush's Social Security privatization plan, assume that Republicans want to fix or reform Social Security. But they don't. They want to abolish it.
 Ever since President Franklin D. Roosevelt instituted social safety net programs to protect Americans from economic misery, Republicans have been waiting for a chance to kill off those programs. They think the time and opportunity are now here. 
 Since Social Security is neither broke nor in crisis, Democrats will need to stick together to protect this successful program from Republican assault.

 BODY:
A lawsuit filed by a Camden teacher claims that the Board of Education and several top administrators transferred her after she revealed grade inflation at a city high school, and that the officials then tried to cover up the situation. The lawsuit filed in federal court on Friday by the teacher, Paula Veggian, is centered on statements she made in July, when she said that transcripts at the Charles E. Brimm Medical Arts High School, the city's top secondary school, were changed improperly. Harvey Johnson, school board solicitor, denied any wrongdoing.

HEADLINE: Bid by Standard Chartered Wins a South Korean Bank

BYLINE: By ANDREW SALMON

DATELINE: SEOUL, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
After a tight bidding race with HSBC Holdings, Standard Chartered said on Monday that it would acquire Korea First Bank for $3.3 billion, the biggest foreign investment ever in South Korea's financial sector.
 The move signals a further stage in the opening of the financial service sector to foreigners; Citigroup entered the market last year with its $2.6 billion purchase of KorAm Bank.
 ''This acquisition provides Standard Chartered with a strong platform in the 10th-largest economy in the world,'' Kai Nargolwala, Standard Chartered's group executive director for Asia, said at a news conference. ''Korea is also the third-largest banking market in Asia, and has a banking revenue pool of $44 billion.'' 
 Analysts said that Standard Chartered had agreed to a high premium for Korea First. ''Standard Chartered paid 1.87 times book value for the bank. Even with an M.&A. premium, that is a lot,'' Ri Chae Won, a banking analyst at Goodmorning Shinhan Securities, said. ''Citibank paid 1.7 times book value for KorAm, and Korean banks typically trade at 1.1 to 1.2 times book.''
 Standard Chartered plans to use its own capital and the proceeds of $:1 billion in shares it sold to buy Korea First, executives said.
 The executives added that they would seek to upgrade the bank's business in consumer loans, credit cards, mortgages, wealth management and services for small and medium-size companies. 
 ''Korea First has 6 percent of the market in Korea, 10 percent of bank branches, and 8 percent of the mortgage market,'' said Mike DeNoma, Standard Chartered's group executive director for consumer banking. ''It has one of the lowest levels of nonperforming loans, and offers excellent shareholder value.''
 Korea First fell into difficulty during the Asian economic crisis in 1997. In 2000, Newbridge Capital, the United States investment fund, bought a 51 percent stake for $420 million. The remaining stock, held by the government, was to be sold at the price negotiated by Newbridge. The bidding began last November, and many expected HSBC to emerge as the winner. Both HSBC and Standard Chartered are based in London. 
 The divestment of Korea First by an investment fund also indicates another stage in the entry of foreign financial institutions to Korea's market. Because Newbridge sold its stake in Korea First to Standard Chartered, and the Carlyle Group sold its stake in KorAm to Citigroup last year, the only remaining bank controlled by a foreign investment fund is the Korea Exchange Bank, by Lone Star Funds, based in Dallas. 
 The deal for Korea First Bank, the country's seventh-largest lender, has been approved by shareholders and only awaits regulatory approval, Mr. Nargolwala said.

HEADLINE: Schwarzenegger Budget Plan Includes No Tax Increases

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger on Monday presented a $109 billion budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1 that tries to rein in the growth of state spending and keeps his promise not to increase taxes.
 Mr. Schwarzenegger said that spending would have been nearly $10 billion higher had he not taken steps to reduce the escalation in the costs of education, health and human services and prisons, which together consume nearly 80 percent of state spending. 
 For the second straight year, the governor, a Republican, proposed to balance California's sprawling budget -- which is larger than the gross domestic product of more than 100 countries, including Egypt, Hungary and Venezuela -- without raising taxes. He said that imposing new taxes on California's fragile economic recovery would be ''financial suicide.''
 He complained of what he termed the lunacy of the California budget system, in which initiatives passed by the voters over the last 25 years have limited state tax revenues and dictated how billions of dollars are to be spent under rigid formulas.
 ''If we don't get control of our auto-pilot spending,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger said, ''there will be deficits as far as the eye can see. Increasing taxes is out of the question because we don't have a revenue problem, we have a spending problem. On top of all that, we have a formula problem.''
 The governor, who entered office 14 months ago after a recall election that ousted Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, proposed replacing the current system of formulaic spending with one that would trigger across-the-board cuts whenever spending outstripped revenues. Mr. Schwarzenegger called a special session of the Legislature to consider that plan and several other proposals, including converting the state's huge public employee pension plan to a 401(k)-type plan favored by many private businesses. 
 Mr. Schwarzenegger threatened to take the measures to the public for a vote if the Legislature did not enact them. Leaders in the Democratic-controlled Legislature have said they will consider the governor's plan, but they have not endorsed it.
 A year ago, in his first budget submission, Mr. Schwarzenegger proposed cuts in education and social services, including aid to the elderly and the developmentally disabled. He backed off after protesters in wheelchairs surrounded the Capitol. His original $99 billion spending plan increased to more than $104 billion after he restored those cuts and agreed to other spending proposals from Democratic lawmakers.
 This year his plan includes a 7.1 percent increase in spending for education and a 4.6 percent increase in health and human services, in part to avoid the bloody political battles of his rookie year. Tax revenues are projected to rise $5 billion from the current year, and the governor proposes to use $1.7 billion in bond funds and to borrow from the state's transportation fund to help balance the budget.
 He proposed to save money by increasing co-payments for some services, eliminating cost-of-living increases for welfare recipients and shifting some Medicaid recipients to managed-care plans. He also anticipates saving more than $1 billion by negotiating discounts from pharmaceutical companies for drugs for state Medicaid recipients and hospitals.
 But Mr. Schwarzenegger acknowledged that the changes would bring real financial pain to many of California's poorest residents.
 ''Of course it rattles the cage,'' he said. ''Of course people will be angry about it. But for years we have been promising all these kinds of things, but we don't have the money. We have to live within our means.''
 Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access California, a consumer group, said the governor was likely to see renewed protests over cuts in benefits that affect children, the elderly and the disabled.
 ''He's making certain choices with this budget,'' Mr. Wright said. ''He has made a choice to take taxes and other revenues off the table and has instead chosen to make these cuts. That's a deliberate choice that has real consequences for people.''
 The governor's budget relies on continued borrowing, using some of the proceeds of a $15 billion bond issue that Mr. Schwarzenegger won voter approval for last year. Although the bond proceeds helped to get the state through a severe fiscal crisis, the borrowing will have long-term consequences, said Fred Silva, a budget expert at the Public Policy Institute of California and a former fiscal aide in the state Legislature.
 ''The amount of borrowed money is going to be a budget overhang for many years,'' Mr. Silva said. 
 In years past, he said, state policy makers tried to keep the cost of debt service below 4 percent of state revenues. ''Now it's going to be twice that,'' Mr. Silva said. ''That's real money.''

HEADLINE: Oil Find Hints at a Less Dependent Cuba

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
On Dec. 25, President Fidel Castro said he had some information to lift the spirits of Cuba's 11 million people: two Canadian energy companies, Pebercan and Sherritt International, had discovered oil in the Gulf of Mexico in an area under Cuba's control. 
 Mr. Castro, in an announcement that raised eyebrows in the executive suites of energy companies here, disclosed that the Canadian companies had discovered estimated reserves of 100 million barrels. That was the good news. It was also the bad news. 
 The deposits, which are expected to produce oil as early as next year, may provide Cuba's government with some relief as it presses forward with efforts to use hard currency for purposes other than petroleum purchases from abroad. Shortly after Mr. Castro announced the discovery, the central bank said it was tightening measures intended to centralize the control of dollars circulating in the Cuban economy.
 ''Cuba simply needs the money,'' said John S. Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council in New York, which tracks trade activity in Cuba. 
 Still, the discovery, while considered something of a lifeline for a country still recovering from the loss of Soviet-era subsidized oil imports more than a decade ago, is no panacea. The prospective output by the Canadian companies would cover only about three to four years of oil production by Cuba, which now imports much of its oil from Venezuela on favorable terms. 
 Yet the deposits showed how tantalizingly close Cuba has come to altering the dynamics of oil exploration in the Gulf of Mexico, an area that also provides one of the largest sources of oil for the United States. The economic outlook for Cuba is not as dire as it was a decade ago, with growth reaching 5 percent in 2004, according to government estimates; at least a small part of that economic growth was spurred by investments by international energy companies searching for oil.
 Last month's discovery already has Cuba watchers here and officials there pondering potential changes in relations with the United States. American companies are currently prohibited from drilling in waters 100 miles or so from the coast of Florida.
 American energy companies quietly chafe at restrictions that make Cuban territory off limits to them while Canadians, Spaniards and Brazilians search Cuban waters for offshore wildcatting possibilities. A significant oil discovery, one that could turn Cuba into an oil exporter from an importer, might prompt calls for reviewing policies that exclude the great majority of American companies from trading with Cuba.
 ''The Canadians aren't there because they like Castro's aunt or a good Cuban coffee,'' remarked Jorge Pinon Cervera, a Miami-based consultant who closely follows Cuba's energy industry and a former high-ranking executive in Latin America for Amoco. ''They're in Cuba because it's almost a virgin exploration province right in the backyard of the U.S.'' 
 The Cubans, since introducing policies in the early 1990's aimed at encouraging investment by foreign energy companies, have increased oil production to more than 75,000 barrels a day in 2004 from 18,000 barrels a day in 1992. The discovery last month by Pebercan of Montreal and Sherritt of Toronto illustrates how companies from other countries stand to benefit from the American embargo on most dealings with Cuba.
 Shares in Pebercan soared on the Toronto Stock Exchange after Mr. Castro's announcement, climbing nearly 50 percent in the two and a half weeks since; thanks in part to the Cuba find, the company's stock performance ranked second in 2004 among North American energy-exploration companies tracked by John S. Herold of Norwalk, Conn., an energy analysis company. 
 Sherritt, a diversified minerals company, is a minority partner with Pebercan in the discovery and is already Cuba's largest oil producer through exploration ventures elsewhere on the island. Its stock also appreciated after the oil find was made public, rising more than 15 percent since Christmas. 
 A spokeswoman for Sherritt declined to comment on the discovery, citing limits on such disclosures from securities regulators. A spokeswoman for Pebercan, Cynthia Lane, also would not comment.
 Mr. Castro, however, seemed eager to discuss details of the oil find, pointing out in comments carried in the official media that the deposits were lower in sulfur than those from Cuba's other oil fields.
 Thus, the Canadians may have discovered lighter-grade, higher-quality oil than the mostly heavy oil now produced in Cuba. This in turn may enable the Cubans to refine the oil for use in vehicles or to export crude oil in exchange for hard currency. 
 Most oil now produced by Cuba is used largely for fueling power plants or producing cooking oil -- 75,000 to 80,000 barrels a day, according to Cuban government estimates for the first half of 2004. It imports at least 53,000 barrels a day from Venezuela, much of it already refined into gasoline, under an agreement that allows it to have the oil at below-market prices. 
 Energy analysts say that Cuba separately imports as much as 25,000 barrels of oil a day to meet growing transportation demands; Venezuela is thought to supply much of this fuel. 
 In one of the most closely followed wildcatting efforts in the Gulf of Mexico last year, Repsol YPF of Spain spent more than $20 million to lease a Norwegian drilling rig to search for oil in Cuban waters. Ramon Blanco, Repsol YPF's chief operating officer, told investors in July that the first well drilled had ''met partially our initial expectations,'' but was not considered commercially viable. 
 Still, Mr. Blanco said in comments on a conference call with investors that the company had been able to prove the presence of ''high-quality reservoirs.'' Analysts following Cuba's energy industry said they expected Repsol YPF to continue drilling in Cuban waters later this year or in early 2006, together with Union Cubapetroleo, an energy concern controlled by the Havana government. 
 In the meantime, news of the find by the Canadian companies and the potential for larger discoveries of oil in the portions of the Gulf of Mexico controlled by Cuba are fueling speculation about how the emergence of Cuba as a promising oil exploration area might affect relations with the United States. 
 ''If Cuba is able to show that it has higher-quality crude at sufficient levels,'' Mr. Kavulich of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council said, ''the Bush administration would come under pressure to permit, at a minimum, purchases of Cuban-origin oil.'' 
 ''Politically in Cuba, the stakes are even higher,'' he added. ''Even if Cuba needed all the oil that was found, the government might sacrifice energy independence to sell oil to the U.S. and other countries.'' 
 The Canadian oil discovery underscored the importance of hard currency for Cuba. In the days after the announcement, Cuba said that all revenue from state-run ventures must be channeled through the central bank, a move further tightening the control of hard currency. 
 Francisco Soberon, the central bank president, said in a statement that revenues related to the oil discovery, as well as those from recent agreements with China and Venezuela, ''must be tightly controlled to ensure their optimum use.''

HEADLINE: Bush Names Friend to Head Economic Council

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
President Bush has chosen Allan B. Hubbard, a longtime friend and fund-raiser who helped shape Mr. Bush's platform in the 2000 campaign, to be director of the National Economic Council, the White House said on Monday.
 In his new job, which does not require Senate confirmation, Mr. Hubbard will coordinate economic policymaking across the administration and serve as a senior economic adviser to Mr. Bush. Currently the president of E&A Industries, a manufacturing company based in Indianapolis, Mr. Hubbard served in the administration of the president's father as executive director of the Competitiveness Council, a White House group established to reduce regulation on business, and as deputy chief of staff to Vice President Dan Quayle. 
 Mr. Hubbard has known Mr. Bush since the two attended Harvard Business School at the same time in the mid-1970's. He was one of the top fund-raisers for Mr. Bush's 2000 and 2004 presidential campaigns. He replaces Stephen Friedman, a former Wall Street executive who is stepping down after two years in the job.
 In the 2000 campaign, Mr. Hubbard helped develop Mr. Bush's domestic policy agenda and recruited a number of advisers who stayed with Mr. Bush when he moved into the White House. They included Lawrence B. Lindsey, who preceded Mr. Friedman as director of the economic council, and Michael Gerson, who has remained Mr. Bush's top speechwriter.
 Mr. Hubbard is expected to start his new job next week, at a time when Mr. Bush is pushing an ambitious set of economic policy proposals, including overhauls of Social Security and the tax system and restricting lawsuits and jury awards against businesses and doctors. 
 The post is one that, more than many other senior White House jobs, has reflected the style and influence of the person holding it. Under Mr. Friedman, who rarely appeared on television or gave interviews, it largely disappeared from public view, reflecting in part Mr. Bush's desire for internal policy debates to remain behind closed doors.
 People who have worked with Mr. Hubbard said that he was likely to be more visible than Mr. Friedman in selling Mr. Bush's agenda publicly but that his main goal was likely to be keeping the administration's economic team marching together as it confronts policy and political tradeoffs on prominent issues like Social Security and taxes. 
 In that sense, they said, Mr. Hubbard's appointment continues the trend of consolidating policymaking within the White House staff and populating the administration with people of proven loyalty to Mr. Bush.
 ''Al is one of those guys who understands the theory and the substance of economic policy, but he also understands the politics and how to get something done,'' said David McIntosh, a former Republican House member from Indiana who worked with Mr. Hubbard in the administration of the first President Bush. ''He'll bring a lot of energy, and politely but effectively rally everyone behind the president's proposals and keep everyone on point.''
 Jim Pitts, a Republican lobbyist who worked with Mr. Hubbard in Mr. Quayle's office, said Mr. Hubbard would bring to the job a very different perspective from Mr. Lindsey, an economist, or Mr. Friedman, a Wall Street executive, because he has spent much of his career running an industrial company.
 ''He comes out of the job-creation world, having started companies and met payrolls,'' Mr. Pitts said.
 Perhaps more important, he said, Mr. Hubbard will enjoy the influence that comes with his reputation as one of Mr. Bush's closest friends and most trusted advisers.
 Mr. Bush filled another job on Monday, naming Candida Wolff, a former aide to Vice President Dick Cheney, to become the White House's chief liaison to Congress. She replaces David Hobbs, who is stepping down after two years.

Former Senator Joins Law Firm
By The New York Times
 WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 -- Former Senator John B. Breaux, a Louisiana Democrat who spent 32 years in Congress before retiring at the end of last year, has joined the law firm Patton Boggs. He will carry the title senior counsel at the bipartisan firm, which is one of the highest-earning lobbying shops in Washington, and will advise clients in areas like health care and energy policy. Mr. Breaux, who had a reputation as a moderate and a deal maker in Congress, was named last week by President Bush to help lead an advisory panel on taxes.

HEADLINE: The Iceberg Cometh

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Last week someone leaked a memo written by Peter Wehner, an aide to Karl Rove, about how to sell Social Security privatization. The public, says Mr. Wehner, must be convinced that ''the current system is heading for an iceberg.'' 
 It's the standard Bush administration tactic: invent a fake crisis to bully people into doing what you want. ''For the first time in six decades,'' the memo says, ''the Social Security battle is one we can win.'' One thing I haven't seen pointed out, however, is the extent to which the White House expects the public and the media to believe two contradictory things. 
 The administration expects us to believe that drastic change is needed, and needed right away, because of the looming cost of paying for the baby boomers' retirement. 
 The administration expects us not to notice, however, that the supposed solution would do nothing to reduce that cost. Even with the most favorable assumptions, the benefits of privatization wouldn't kick in until most of the baby boomers were long gone. For the next 45 years, privatization would cost much more money than it saved. 
 Advocates of privatization almost always pretend that all we have to do is borrow a bit of money up front, and then the system will become self-sustaining. The Wehner memo talks of borrowing $1 trillion to $2 trillion ''to cover transition costs.'' Similar numbers have been widely reported in the news media.
 But that's just the borrowing over the next decade. Privatization would cost an additional $3 trillion in its second decade, $5 trillion in the decade after that and another $5 trillion in the decade after that. By the time privatization started to save money, if it ever did, the federal government would have run up around $15 trillion in extra debt. 
 These numbers are based on a Congressional Budget Office analysis of Plan2, which was devised by a special presidential commission in 2001 and is widely expected to be the basis for President Bush's plan.
 Under Plan2, payroll taxes would be diverted into private accounts while future benefits would be cut. In the short run, this would worsen the budget deficit. In the long run, if all went well, cutting benefit payments would reduce the deficit.
 All wouldn't go well; I'll explain why in another column. But suppose that everything went according to plan. Even in that unlikely case, privatization wouldn't even begin to reduce the budget deficit until 2050. This is supposed to be the answer to an imminent crisis?
 While we waited 45 years for something good to happen, there would be a real risk of a crisis -- not in Social Security, but in the budget as a whole. And privatization would increase that risk.
 We already have a large budget deficit, the result of President Bush's insistence on cutting taxes while waging a war. And it will get worse: a rise in spending on entitlements -- mainly because of Medicare, but with a smaller contribution from Medicaid and, in a minor supporting role, Social Security -- looks set to sharply increase the deficit after 2010.
 Add borrowing for privatization to the mix, and the budget deficit might well exceed 8 percent of G.D.P. at some time during the next decade. That's a deficit that would make Carlos Menem's Argentina look like a model of responsibility. It would be sure to cause a collapse of investor confidence, sending the dollar through the floor, interest rates through the roof and the economy into a tailspin.
 And when investors started fleeing because they believed that America had turned into a banana republic, they wouldn't be reassured by claims that someday, in the distant future, privatization would do great things for the budget. Just ask the Argentines: their version of Social Security privatization was also supposed to save money in the long run, but all it did was move forward the date of their crisis.
 A responsible administration would reverse course on tax cuts and the botched 2003 Medicare drug bill, both of which pose much greater threats to the government's solvency than the modest financial shortfall of the Social Security system. But Mr. Bush has declared his tax cuts inviolable, and he says that his drug bill will actually save money. (The Medicare trustees say it will cost $8 trillion.)
 There's an iceberg in front of us, all right. And Mr. Bush wants us to steam right into it, full speed ahead.

HEADLINE: For Bloomberg, This Speech Is an Election-Year Speech

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG; David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is to use his fourth annual State of the City address today to begin building what aides describe as a months-long election-year case that the city is finally moving in the right direction and that this is not the time to change leaders.
 With crime on the decline, the city's economy rebounding and the mayor pushing ahead with his plan to overhaul public schools, Mr. Bloomberg's aides say they hope the speech will present a compelling case for a second term and help him swipe potential issues away from his likely challengers before they begin to step up their own campaigns. He plans to announce some new initiatives and bring back some others that were popular, like the $400 property tax rebate that he also championed last year. 
 Among the new initiatives are a vocational program to help high school dropouts and failing students get equivalency diplomas and learn new skills, and a commission to promote diversity in the construction trades. 
 Mr. Bloomberg's early election strategy goes to the heart of what appears to be his most pressing political problem: even as polls show that a majority of New York City voters believe the city is heading in the right direction, they are not ready to give all the credit to Mr. Bloomberg, whose own approval ratings have not budged much.
 Mr. Bloomberg's aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity while discussing the speech so as not to upstage the mayor today, said they considered the address, at Hostos Community College in the Bronx, to be a key opportunity to connect the mayor more directly with the city's successes, adding that they took great pains while devising it over the past few weeks. 
 In an interview Sunday night at a forum sponsored by The New York Times at the CUNY Graduate Center, the mayor suggested that he had brushed aside advice from aides who felt he should avoid extensive new election-year proposals when he already has so much in front of him, from the controversial plan to build a West Side stadium to his effort to overhaul the schools. 
 ''I keep telling the people I work with -- they say, 'Look, maybe we should not address any controversial issues as you get close to the election,''' he said. ''I say, 'Look, the worst thing in the world would be to compromise your values and lose.'''
 He added, ''I've got to make sure that our administration doesn't slow down in implementing change and coming up with new ideas.''
 A senior administration official said the vocational initiative to be announced today would seek to place thousands of struggling students and dropouts into a program to help them obtain equivalency diplomas while teaching them vocational skills and offering them assistance in finding jobs. The official would not say how much the program would cost or what skills would be taught.
 The proposal seems to be in keeping with a broader reorganization of programs devised to increase the number of students who earn their high school diplomas and lower the dropout rate.
 It would come just a few months after officials closed dozens of facilities aimed solely at preparing children for the equivalency exam without teaching them vocational skills. At the time they said they were seeking better options for students struggling in regular school settings.
 Mr. Bloomberg's opponents have been suggesting that he would propose a major schools initiative because they believe him to be vulnerable on the issue. Education advocates will most likely view his new vocational initiative as a safe, if welcome, move and nowhere nearly as controversial as his proposal in last year's State of the City address to impose strict new promotional requirements on third graders.
 The city gradually phased out vocational education efforts in recent decades as schools emphasized college preparation and as the city's manufacturing base declined. But education officials have become more open to such efforts under Mr. Bloomberg. Mr. Bloomberg was asked about vocational programs as recently as Sunday night, when a woman in the audience at the forum lamented a lack of vocational training in the public schools.
 Before promising to address her question in greater detail on Tuesday, the mayor said, ''Apparently 20 or 30 years ago it became, politically incorrect isn't quite the right word, but less desirable to have a track that led towards college and a track that led towards a job when you got out of school.''
 But, he said: ''You could not be more right. There are basic skills you have to have before you can get any job in this day and age.''
 Administration officials said that proposal would fit well with the mayor's announcement that he is naming a commission to improve diversity in the construction force as the city embarks on some huge projects. That proposal seems to be aimed at emphasizing that the West Side stadium project the mayor has sought would bring jobs to the minority groups that will be so crucial to his re-election.
 The mayor's strategists clearly had an eye on those voters when they chose to hold the address in the Bronx, home of one of his most likely opponents this fall, the former Bronx borough president, Fernando Ferrer, a Democrat.
 An adviser to Mr. Ferrer suggested that he would be primed to seize on any openings for criticism in the speech today. ''I hope the mayor answers three questions,'' the adviser said. ''Does anyone in New York City make the minimum wage, do poor people get better health care than the wealthy, and how would New Yorkers rate the job he's doing leading the N.Y.C. school system?''
 Mr. Bloomberg is also likely to hear today from the City Council speaker, Gifford Miller, another likely opponent who has made it clear that he will focus most specifically on the mayor's education policies in his own early run for the Democratic nomination.
 Mr. Bloomberg and his aides say they believe that they have accomplished so much in the last three years that their challengers will not be able to make much of a case against him. 
 During the interview on Sunday, Mr. Bloomberg stopped just short of predicting certain victory.
 ''I think if I went to the public today, I'd get re-elected relatively easily because all of the numbers are going in the right direction,'' he said. ''Crime down; streets cleaner; schools getting better; jobs coming here; throughout all of the boroughs relations with people with different groups are better than they've been in a long time, and those are things that should matter in the city.'' 
 The challenge for the mayor today will be to make sure that those who are inclined to agree with him give him the credit for it.

HEADLINE: Mandate in Hand, Abbas Declares He's Ready for Talks

BYLINE: By GREG MYRE

DATELINE: GAZA, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
Fresh from a landslide victory in the Palestinian presidential election, Mahmoud Abbas said Monday that he hoped to renew peace negotiations with Israel after more than four years of violence.
 ''We extend our hands to our neighbors,'' Mr. Abbas said in the West Bank city of Ramallah. ''We are ready for peace, peace based on justice. We hope that their response will be positive.'' 
 Mr. Abbas's election triumph earned him ringing endorsements from world leaders, and Israel reiterated its willingness to work with him, though it is calling for a crackdown on militants. Meanwhile, Mr. Abbas's Palestinian supporters expressed hope that the election outcome would signal an improvement in their fortunes.
 In a sign that Mr. Abbas's victory could usher in a new round of diplomacy, President Bush said he was prepared to meet the new Palestinian leader in Washington -- a step he refused to take with Yasir Arafat.
 ''It is essential that Israel keep a vision of two states living side-by-side in peace; and that as the Palestinians begin to develop the institutions of a state, that the Israel government support the development of those institutions,'' Mr. Bush said at the White House.
 The official results from the election on Sunday gave Mr. Abbas 62 percent of the vote, easily outdistancing his main challenger, Dr. Mustafa Barghouti, who received just under 20 percent.
 Mr. Abbas, 69, is a pragmatist calling for an end to Palestinian attacks against Israel, and for negotiations leading to Palestinian statehood. 
 He did not face any candidates of his stature, and had full backing of Fatah, the dominant Palestinian political movement founded by Mr. Arafat. 
 Still, with his decisive win in an election staged without serious problems, Mr. Abbas could reasonably claim to have the strongest democratic credentials of any Arab leader. 
 ''It could be the beginning of a new era,'' said Ziad Abu Amr, a Palestinian legislator and a former cabinet member who is a close ally of Mr. Abbas.
 ''We may be laying the foundation for the second working democracy in the Middle East,'' Mr. Amr said, referring indirectly to Israel, which often calls itself the region's only democracy.
 Nonetheless, Mr. Abbas can expect only a brief honeymoon.
 Israel will judge him on whether he can prevent the Palestinian attacks he has denounced. And Palestinians want him to deliver on a host of issues that include removing the travel restrictions imposed by Israel, rebuilding the shattered economy, rooting out Palestinian corruption and imposing law and order on the streets.
 Mr. Abbas, who is expected to be sworn in on Wednesday, will replace Mr. Arafat, who died Nov. 11 after nearly four decades as the pre-eminent Palestinian leader. His death raised concerns that the Palestinian areas could descend into anarchy. But so far, the transition has been relatively smooth and orderly. 
 Mr. Abbas went straight to work on Monday, holding a series of meetings in Ramallah that included talks with the prime minister, Ahmed Qurei.
 With the election over, Mr. Qurei and the cabinet must resign in accordance with Palestinian law. But Mr. Abbas says he will select Mr. Qurei to form a new government.
 Former President Jimmy Carter, who led an international group monitoring the elections, met Mr. Abbas on Monday and said he won ''a remarkably wonderful victory.''
 ''This opens up an opportunity, in my opinion, for renewed peace negotiations,'' Mr. Carter said afterward. 
 Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel refused to deal with Mr. Arafat and accused him of encouraging violence against Israel. But Mr. Sharon held several meetings in 2003 with Mr. Abbas, when he served briefly as the Palestinian prime minister. When he resigned, Mr. Abbas expressed frustration with Israel, saying he received little help as he attempted to carry out reforms.
 Still, Mr. Abbas and Mr. Sharon have both said that they would be willing to meet in the near future. Mr. Sharon's main demand is a halt to violence.
 ''The Palestinians are still not fighting terror, and while his declarations in the framework of the election campaign were encouraging, he will be tested by the way he battles terror,'' Mr. Sharon told Senator John Kerry during his visit to Israel, according to a statement released by the prime minister's office.
 Mr. Abbas says he will not use the Palestinian security forces against armed factions but hopes to persuade the groups to lay down their weapons. The militant group Hamas, which has carried out many of the suicide bombings against Israel, has rejected Mr. Abbas's call for an end to attacks. 
 Hamas declined to field a candidate in the presidential election and urged its voters not to take part in the polls. Still, the group has been holding talks with Mr. Abbas and said those contacts would continue.
 ''We are going to deal with him, and we depend on dialogue as the only way to resolve Palestinian disputes,'' said Sami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas spokesman in Gaza. But, he added, ''we emphasize our refusal to negotiate with the occupier.'' He said Hamas would continue with its ''resistance project.''
 Mr. Abbas had been looking for a big victory to give him a mandate to carry out difficult reforms. While his margin of victory was large, as expected, the voter turnout was relatively low. 
 The Palestinian Central Elections Commission declined to give a figure for the percentage of eligible voters who cast ballots. The commission cited confusion over procedures on Sunday that opened up the voting to all Palestinians age 18 or older, even if they had not registered in advance.
 It appeared that well over half the registered voters cast ballots. But out of all the potential voters, both registered and unregistered, it appeared that fewer than half went to the polls.

HEADLINE: Overhaul Plan For Pensions Is Outlined 

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH; Barnaby Feder contributed reporting from New York for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
The Bush administration outlined an ambitious plan on Monday to shore up America's pension funds and the federal agency that insures them, calling for a sharp increase in premiums for pension insurance and new controls on how companies with poor credit ratings should handle their plans.
 Under the plan, the premiums that companies must pay to insure their defined-benefit pension plans would rise for the first time since 1991, to $30 a year for each active worker and retiree in the plan from the current $19. In the future, the premium rate would also be indexed, to rise with wages.
 That would make a dent in the record $23.3 billion deficit of the insurance program, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. But the administration also intends to charge even higher premiums to companies with credit ratings below investment grade. Such a move would further increase the agency's revenue and give companies an incentive to keep their pension plans in line with what they can afford to pay. 
 Companies with below-investment-grade credit ratings would also have to meet a higher standard for funding pension plans.
 Companies that offer pensions and whose credit ratings are below investment grade include Delta Air Lines, Qwest Communications, Goodyear Tire and Rubber, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings, United States Steel, Lucent Technologies and Cummins, according to Fitch Ratings.
 The administration proposal is the first attempt to link corporate creditworthiness and the freedom companies have to offer pensions to their employees. And the proposal, which must be approved by Congress, comes as the administration is also pushing for a broad overhaul of retirement benefits, promoting a plan to let workers put some of their Social Security taxes into personal savings accounts. 
 But Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao said radical changes in the pension system were necessary because both the pace and the size of plan failures had been growing.
 ''We will put a stop to financially strapped companies promising generous new retirement benefits they cannot afford,'' Ms. Chao said in a speech on Monday at the National Press Club.
 ''If nothing is done, the financial integrity of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation will be compromised,'' Ms. Chao said. ''And more importantly, the pension security of 34 million workers and retirees will be put at risk.''
 Business groups mostly supported the administration's effort. 
 James A. Klein, president of the American Benefits Council, said his group's members -- large and medium-size companies with pension plans -- value pensions as a primary recruiting and retention tool and did not want to see them wither away. "We look forward to working with the administration and with Congress to rapidly enact pension reform that can arrest the disturbing trends of recent years," he said in a statement. 
 James Castellani, the president of the Business Roundtable, said, ''The administration has taken an important step toward reforming our nation's defined-benefit plans." 
 The proposed creation of two classes of companies based on credit rating may also help win support from business. 
 ''The gamble seems to be that the mild support of many healthy companies will outweigh the shrieks of pain from the smaller number of less healthy ones,'' said Douglas J. Elliott, president of the Center on Federal Financial Institutions, a research institute.
 Mr. Klein said that companies would be willing to consider an increase in premiums, although they were not yet familiar with the details.
 A jump in the premium rate from $19 to $30 a participant might sound large, but it is probably not enough to make many companies terminate their pension funds. 
 Terminating a pension fund is costly because any deficit must be paid off immediately. And terminating a pension fund would deprive a publicly traded company of the financial advantages to be had by running a pension fund. 
 The financial reporting standard for pensions -- something the administration did not mention changing -- allows companies to factor assumed pension-investment returns into the cost of offering pensions. Because companies assume their investments will do well over time, they can generally use the anticipated success of their pension funds to reduce a given year's labor costs, bolstering the corporate bottom line.
 When a company pension plan is terminated, its invested assets are transferred to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which takes over paying the retirees their benefits within certain limits. 
 The agency's finances have been severely strained in the last three years by a string of large pension defaults, mostly in the airline and steel industries.
 Ms. Chao, the labor secretary, said pension failures were on the rise, in part because of the current funding rules, which have grown so ''complex, confusing and ineffective'' that they now allow struggling companies to evade their contributions while blocking cash-rich companies from contributing as much as they might wish.
 She said the administration had decided to wipe the slate clean, scrapping some parts of the rules and creating a simpler standard that would more closely reflect the true market cost of offering pensions.
 Measuring this cost means making sure companies factor the correct interest rate into their calculations, since pension values move inversely with interest rates, much as bond prices do. Companies have leaned toward using above-market interest rates in recent years, because that has the effect of reducing the value of their pension promises, which in turn allows them to set aside less money.
 The administration proposal calls for using a corporate bond rate -- something companies may like, because it is higher than other rates economists have recommended. But the administration also wants companies to use rates for corporate bonds of durations that match their scheduled payments to retirees. 
 Officials of the Treasury Department have called for this approach in the past, and lobbyists for companies that sponsor pension plans have opposed it staunchly, complaining it is too complicated.
 Companies with junk-grade credit ratings would be required -- in addition to revising their pension calculations -- to report the amounts promised and the level of funding on the assumption that the plan would terminate immediately. Companies do not currently use such an assumption routinely. When asked to do so, they usually complain that such a calculation is inappropriate because they have no intention of terminating their pension plans.
 Senior administration officials also said they wanted to end the practice of allowing companies to keep credits on their books for large contributions in prior years, if the investments subsequently lost value in the financial markets.
 Those paper credits can make a pension plan look robust when in fact it is ailing. United Airlines has not made any contributions to its four employee pension plans for a number of years, for example, even though it now says those plan are terminally ill and must be taken over by the government. United made its yearly contributions using the paper credits on its books.
 Companies whose credit ratings are already below investment grade were generally unwilling to comment on the administration's proposal yesterday, saying they knew too little about it to state any opinion.
 ''No one wants to pay more, but we obey the rules,'' said Mark D. Land, a spokesman for Cummins, a manufacturer of engines in Columbus, Ind. He said that Cummins hoped to regain an investment-grade rating in the first half of this year, which would keep it out of the proposed category of ''at risk'' pension sponsors.

HEADLINE: As U.S. Aids Tsunami Victims, Bush Urges Donors Not to 'Shortchange' Other Parts of World

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER and ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
President Bush pledged Monday that the United States would stay committed over the long term to helping the Asian nations recovering from the tsunami last month, but he asked that Americans not let their contributions to the relief effort replace their charitable giving to other parts of the world.
 In a speech to officials of the Agency for International Development and other relief groups, Mr. Bush said his administration recognized that the recovery from the disaster would take years.
 ''This is one of those projects that's not going to happen overnight,'' the president said in remarks at the Ronald Reagan Building near the White House. ''The intense scrutiny may dissipate, and probably will, but our focus has got to stay on this part of the world.'' 
 But Mr. Bush, reacting to concerns from charitable groups that the outpouring of private aid to the tsunami victims might hurt donations to other relief efforts, asked Americans not to ''shortchange'' the poor at home and abroad.
 ''It is essential that your contribution not replace the ongoing contributions you're making to help the NGO's of America,'' Mr. Bush said, using the abbreviation for the nongovernmental organizations that work on humanitarian issues. ''You should view the tsunami relief effort as extra help.''
 With more than $2 billion pledged to the Asian countries affected by the tsunami, senior officials at the World Bank and the United Nations said Monday that they are meeting with aid officials from wealthy governments this week to ask them not to forget the needs of the rest of the world.
 ''The aid for the tsunami victims has to be new, additional funds, absolutely,'' said James Adams, vice president of the World Bank, in a telephone interview.
 ''Let's say that everybody is very pleased with the level of resources pledged -- it is a great testimony to the heart of the world -- but Africa is in the minds of many people when they say, 'Don't abandon other countries,''' said Zephirin Diabre, the associate administrator of the United Nations Development Program.
 Mr. Adams of the World Bank will brief individual donor countries at a global conference in Geneva on Wednesday, where one of the chief topics is how to preserve aid for other countries while answering the compelling needs of the tsunami victims. Already the group Doctors Without Borders has temporarily suspended requests for new donations for the South Asian emergency and is emphasizing needs in other crises, like Darfur in Sudan.
 The international concern reflects discussions last week in Congress, where lawmakers of both parties said they were determined to replenish some, if not all, of the $350 million pledged for the tsunami to ensure that money is not taken from programs to help impoverished AIDS victims in Africa or farmers in Central Asia.
 The aid quandary is based in part on the still-slow increase in overseas aid after nearly two decades of decline. In the 1970's, the wealthy nations of the world promised to spend 0.7 percent of their gross domestic product on foreign aid, but after more than three decades almost no country has sustained that goal.
 According to a report last month by Oxfam, an international relief agency founded in Britain, the aid budgets of rich nations are now half of what they were in 1960 relative to gross domestic product. Wealthy nations spend more on their militaries and on farm subsidies than they do on foreign aid. 
 The United Nations will issue a report later this month on how well the world is meeting goals such as eradicating extreme poverty and hunger and improving the education and health of impoverished children. That report is expected to highlight the need for more development aid.
 Earlier in the day, Mr. Bush indicated again that there was a possibility the United States government would increase the $350 million it has pledged so far to tsunami relief, but that in the future the dollars would be ''demand-driven,'' meaning that the government would assess specific needs before committing more money. 
 In comments to reporters in the Oval Office after a meeting with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Andrew S. Natsios, the director of the Agency for International Development, Mr. Bush said his goal was to ''make sure the money that is available actually achieves a coordinated objective.'' 
 In his speech to the aid agency officials, Mr. Bush said he was grateful to former Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton -- ''Dad and Bill,'' he called them -- for leading the effort in the United States to raise money for the tsunami victims. 
 In New York on Monday, Mr. Clinton announced the creation of a fund to provide sanitation systems and safe drinking water to tsunami victims. The Tsunami Water and Sanitation Fund, a joint project of the Clinton Foundation and the United Nations Children's Fund, is to enable Unicef to expand its distribution of safe water and water purification tablets. 
 Carol Bellamy, the executive director of Unicef, said in a statement that ''the tsunami has shown how water can take lives; this initiative will demonstrate how water can save lives.''

HEADLINE: Wall Street Hears Pitch for Social Security Plan

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary John W. Snow began a three-day sales effort on Monday to drum up Wall Street support for President Bush's plans to overhaul Social Security.
 Despite what some see as the potential boon to the stock market from allowing younger employees to invest part of their Social Security tax payments in personal accounts, many Wall Street economists are dubious about the costs. Administration officials acknowledge that their plan could require the government to borrow as much as $2 trillion over the next two decades, to pay for costs during a transition period when the government still has to pay full benefits to existing retirees.
 In private meetings, Mr. Snow will confer with top executives from the biggest bond-trading firms on Wall Street and is expected to argue that such borrowing would more than pay for itself at the end of 75 years. 
 Industry executives said the meetings would include firms like Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan Chase and Lehman Brothers. Mr. Snow is also expected to meet with brokerage firms and mutual fund companies that could end up managing the personal savings accounts.
 ''The secretary will make the case that reform is needed to guarantee retirement benefits for today's youth, given the system's insolvency,'' said Robert Nichols, a spokesman for Mr. Snow. ''The byproduct will put the nation's fiscal affairs in order by addressing the $10 trillion in unfunded obligations, a move that will be well received by the financial markets.''
 But several Wall Street economists expressed doubts about the potential impact on interest rates from floating hundreds of billions of dollars of additional government bonds at a time when it is not clear how the Bush administration is planning to reduce the existing budget deficit. 
 ''The overall impact on the Treasury market would be negative,'' wrote Kathleen Bostjancic, a senior Merrill Lynch economist, who estimated that the administration plan could lead to increased government borrowing of $54 billion to $120 billion a year for the next 20 years.
 Administration officials argue that the new borrowing should have no impact on the market, because investors already know the government faces at least $3.7 trillion in unfunded Social Security obligations over the next 75 years -- $10.4 trillion if projected over an ''infinite horizon.''
 Supporters of the proposal say bond investors have already accepted the argument that any extra borrowing will only be transitional and will be repaid in future decades.
 Other analysts note that the increased government borrowing will be offset by the money that flows into personal savings accounts. ''It would be a wash, with no change to overall savings,'' said Lyle Gramley, a former Federal Reserve governor.
 Indeed, thus far bond investors have shown little discomfort about the prospect of vast additional federal borrowing. Even as President Bush has made it clear that overhauling Social Security is his top domestic priority, long-term interest rates have remained very low, at about 4.2 percent.
 But many Wall Street analysts say that bond investors have not yet focused on what the future impact of the plan might be if it became law. 
 ''There is no question that the markets have not reacted negatively,'' John Lipsky, a supporter of personal Social Security accounts who is chief economist at J.P. Morgan Chase. ''Is it because they are O.K. with it, or is because they don't think it will happen? My guess is that a lot of people haven't thought very clearly about it.''
 A number of economists argue that a substantial need for additional Treasury borrowing over the next decade or two could put extra pressure on interest rates relatively soon, while future benefits are so uncertain that most bond market investors do not take them into account when deciding where to put their money. 
 ''The government has no legal obligation to pay anything in the future,'' said Richard Berner, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley. ''But once the debt is issued, it will be out there with the full faith and credit of the government behind it. The benefits -- that's a different story.''
 Wall Street support is crucial to Mr. Bush's plans. Financial firms would end up managing much of the money that people would be allowed to divert, under Mr. Bush's approach, from payroll taxes to personal accounts.
 Despite the apparent windfall in business that could create, many Wall Street executives are less than enthusiastic about administering tens of millions of very small accounts if, as is likely, the government forces them to charge much lower fees than on traditional mutual funds.
 But administration officials have already signaled that the government would probably take responsibility for accounts of less than $5,000, relieving financial companies from dealing with millions of accounts that would probably be unprofitable.
 ''I think Wall Street will react fairly favorably,'' said Stanley Fischer, vice chairman of Citigroup, at a conference of economists last weekend.
 Far more important is support from bond market investors. If investors gag at the prospect of vast new federal borrowing, the value of Treasury bonds could plunge and interest rates would rise. 
 Even a hint of panic in the bond markets would be enough to kill support for Mr. Bush's plans in Congress.
 Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP, a bond-market research firm in New York, said bond investors might become inured to huge government borrowing -- about $1.8 trillion in additional federal debt over the last four years.
 But Mr. Crandall said the Social Security plan could require less borrowing than expected, if only because people might adopt personal accounts more reluctantly than either Mr. Bush or his critics anticipate.
 Few specialists, however, accept the administration's argument that the huge borrowing years ahead would have no impact on Treasury prices.
 Bond investors would be confronted with a very tangible deluge of new Treasury securities to buy and a much hazier promise to reduce borrowing in 30 to 60 years as the government cuts back on future Social Security benefits.
 ''What if the government comes under pressure to bail out people in the future?'' asked Ms. Bostjancic of Merrill Lynch. ''You could have even more borrowing.''
 ''Theoretically, if we are all sitting in Bonds 101, the math makes sense. But I think the actual market reaction would be different.''
 Administration officials have said they also would like to drastically change the way future benefits are calculated, indexing them to rises in consumer prices rather than to increases in wages. Because wages grow faster than prices over the long term, congressional analysts estimate the change would reduce a person's initial retirement benefit in 2065 by more than 40 percent from what is promised under current law.
 But Mr. Berner, of Morgan Stanley, said it was impossible to assume that the government would cut benefits for people who retire 60 years from now.
 ''I don't know how you can figure out a law that says what benefits will be in 75 years,'' Mr. Berner said. As a result, he continued, investors could conclude that the future cuts were unrealistic and that Mr. Bush's plan would ultimately make borrowing higher rather than lower.''

HEADLINE: Secrecy Stripped From Oregon Utility Sale

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
The Texas Pacific Group, after fighting to keep secret 700 pages of documents about its proposed purchase of Portland General Electric, reversed course yesterday and said it would make the documents public. The decision came after an alternative newspaper, Willamette Week, obtained most of the documents for an article published last week. 
 Nearly every major economic interest in Oregon opposes the purchase, but until now these groups could say little about their reasons for joining consumer groups in opposing the deal because the Oregon Public Utility Commission issued a broad secrecy order at Texas Pacific's request. 
 Lawyers for the opponents and for consumer groups said that the documents showed that Texas Pacific used the secrecy order to mislead the public, an accusation that Texas Pacific characterized as false and unfair. 
 Texas Pacific, founded by David Bonderman, is a $13 billion investment fund based in Fort Worth that buys distressed companies. It plans to pay $2.35 billion, in a debt-laden deal, to acquire the Portland utility.
 The Oregon case has significance beyond Portland. It illustrates what consumer and industry lawyers in California, Texas and Washington said yesterday was a growing use of secrecy in utility cases to the detriment of ratepayers. It raises questions about moves in Congress to repeal a 1934 law that protects customers. And it illustrates the growing interest in electric utilities by leveraged buyout firms like Texas Pacific and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company in New York. 
 K.K.R.'s planned purchase of Tucson Electric Power was rejected last month by Arizona utility regulators, who ruled it was too risky for ratepayers. 
 Congress may vote soon on repealing the 1934 law, the Public Utility Holding Company Act, a move that opponents say would open the door to short-term speculators and distant owners with little interest in the long-term reliability of electric service. Texas Pacific has said that unless the Securities and Exchange Commission exempts it from that law, it will not complete the deal. 
 The 1934 law was adopted after one of the biggest business scandals of the Depression, the 1932 collapse of the Insull Trusts, a network of heavily indebted utilities that included Portland General Electric, which is now owned by Enron.
 Dan Meek, the lawyer for the Utility Reform Project, a Portland consumer group, said that the Oregon Public Utility Commission grants secrecy orders on request, which he considers improper. 
 ''It amounts to a government-sponsored dog and pony show for the utility and its allies to make their own case, unchallenged,'' Mr. Meek said, adding that even after opponents make important discoveries in closed-door proceedings ''the public is not allowed to hear about it.''
 Bob Valdez, a commission spokesman, confirmed that requests for confidentiality had increased in recent years, an issue the commission will study this year. 
 The documents show that Texas Pacific may resell the utility in three years, The Oregonian reported on Sunday after Texas Pacific gave it some of the documents. Last week, Texas Pacific emphasized that it planned to hold on to Portland G.E. for up to 12 years. 
 Erik Sten, a Portland commissioner who wants the city to buy the Portland G.E.'s assets, said Texas Pacific's release of the documents threw doubt on the legitimacy of the secrecy order. Documents cannot be both ''meaningful and in need of secrecy and at the same time not important, which is what Texas Pacific is now saying,'' Mr. Sten said. ''Either the protective order was given too freely or Texas Pacific is now misrepresenting its due diligence to the public.''
 Texas Pacific said yesterday that the documents, which it has testified were developed for $7 million, were analytical and should not be considered as policy or plans.
 Mr. Sten called for reform of the laws allowing secrecy in utility cases. ''The idea that the public should grant a monopoly to a speculative firm without access to the business plans is unreasonable,'' he said. ''Public bodies can only exercise judgment on behalf of the public when they have heard the public's opinion -- and that opinion has been manipulated through false public statements.''
 The newly disclosed documents also contradict public statements by Texas Pacific that the most likely way it would dispose of Portland G.E. was through an initial public offering, said Jason Eisdorfer, a lawyer for the Citizens Utility Board, a consumer group in Portland.
 The documents ''show that they stand to make hundreds of millions of dollars more on a sale than on an I.P.O.,'' said Mr. Eisdorfer, who has seen the documents. He said Texas Pacific had a duty of loyalty to its investors, including the Oregon public employees' pension fund, to obtain the highest price. An initial public offering at a lower price makes no sense legally or financially, he said.
 Texas Pacific has maintained that the documents are mere analysis and consultant opinions, and that therefore no contradiction exists. Yesterday, an organization representing major Portland landlords, the Building Owners and Managers Association, asked the commission to reopen testimony in the case.

HEADLINE: Mayor and Council Reach Deal on West Side Development

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI and MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's ambitious plan to transform part of the West Side into a new high-rise business district took a significant step forward yesterday after his administration reached an agreement with City Council leaders over housing, development rights and financing. 
 The mayor's plan calls for replacing the brick warehouses, factories and parking lots that dominate the area with office towers, parks and a new boulevard, while extending the No. 7 subway line one mile, from Times Square to 11th Avenue and 34th Street. The Council agreed yesterday to reduce the total cost of the 30-year plan to $3 billion from $4 billion by appropriating money from the city's operating budget to make early interest payments annually over the first decade.
 In exchange, the Council won an agreement from the administration that a quarter of the 13,600 new apartments planned for the 59-block district would be affordable for moderate- and low-income New Yorkers. That compares with only 16 percent, or 2,176 units, in the mayor's original plan. 
 At the same time, the Council's leaders took steps to sever any connection between the redevelopment of the West Side and a separate but far more disputed proposal to build a $1.4 billion football stadium with a retractable roof for the Jets over a rail yard on the west side of 11th Avenue between 30th and 34th Streets. Under the agreement, none of the money appropriated for the redevelopment can be used for the stadium. 
 The local community board and other critics, however, were disappointed that the compromise did not cut the density of the commercial development planned for the district more sharply. Both sides agreed to allow for 24 million square feet of office space, down from 26 million, within a district west of Eighth Avenue that stretches from 28th to 42nd Streets. 
 Mr. Bloomberg yesterday called West Side redevelopment ''probably the single most important economic project that this city has undertaken in decades.'' He said it would revitalize the neighborhood and create thousands of jobs. 
 His initiative is picking up steam, with the approval last month of state legislation for the $1.4 billion expansion of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, and now, the pending rezoning of the West Side, the largest in recent city history. 
 Still, in both cases, legislators moved to break any links between the respective projects and the stadium. The compromise reached yesterday also prohibits the city from using revenues generated by new development on the West Side to pay for projects west of 11th Avenue, such as a $30 million tunnel connecting the proposed stadium to the Javits Center, or two nearby pedestrian bridges over 12th Avenue. 
 ''We've effectively divorced the stadium from the financial resources that his plan will generate,'' said Councilwoman Christine C. Quinn, who was active in the negotiations and represents the West Side. 
 The move may have been more symbolic than substantive. The Bloomberg administration has been vague about how it would pay for either the tunnel or the pedestrian bridges. 
 The Empire State Development Corporation is expected to approve the stadium project this month. But construction is not assured. It still needs approval by legislative leaders in Albany. The project also faces two lawsuits challenging the stadium on environmental grounds.
 The mayor emphasized yesterday that the stadium was one element of a multipart plan in which development would progress more slowly ''if you don't do any one of the parts.'' 
 For its part, the Jets said the idea that the stadium was linked to West Side redevelopment was a concoction of Cablevision, which has waged a multimillion-dollar campaign against the stadium. Cablevision, which owns Madison Square Garden, sees the stadium as competition.
 ''The Sports and Convention Center financing was never part of the rezoning process,'' said Matt Higgins, a vice president of the Jets. ''But if Cablevision wants to claim a hollow victory, so be it.''
 Council members and stadium opponents wanted to make clear that redevelopment was in no way dependent on the stadium.
 Council Speaker Gifford Miller said yesterday that the Council's support for the West Side plan did not temper his opposition to the stadium. He said Council leaders could have shown their opposition to the stadium by voting down the rest of the West Side project, but decided not to because they support its objective of revitalizing that part of Manhattan.
 ''We're not going to cut off our nose to spite our own face,'' he said, adding: ''The financing we're talking about has nothing to do with the stadium. It's neutral to the stadium. I believe that this agreement will move forward whether the stadium moves forward or not.''
 The Citizens Union, a civic group, said the Council should be part of the approval process for the stadium, a position Mr. Bloomberg opposes. While it favors development, the group said the Council might have lost a chance to influence the decision to build a stadium by giving up its leverage on the redevelopment.
 The entire Council is scheduled to formally adopt the plan on Jan. 19.
 Under the agreement reached yesterday, the number of affordable apartments would rise to 3,400. The two sides also reduced the proposed commercial density on 11th Avenue, between 36th and 41st Streets, by one million square feet, or 14 percent. 
 ''This is a step in the right direction,'' said Walter Mankoff, chairman of Community Board 4. ''We were never against the development of the Hudson Yards. We wanted it done correctly. The only area where we don't see much gain is the density issue.''
 The city will begin making payments for public works projects in the $3 billion redevelopment plan in fiscal year 2006, with an initial payment of about $6 million. The payments will peak at $162 million after five years and then fall to $25 million by 2015. At that point, the remainder would be paid with tax revenues from new commercial projects.
 William C. Thompson, the city comptroller and a critic of the city's financial scheme, called the new plan more stable and cost-effective. 
 The money will come from the city's $47 billion operating budget, meaning that the mayor and the Council need to find a way to pay that extra expense while grappling with multibillion-dollar deficits projected for the foreseeable future. Mr. Bloomberg recently abandoned plans to spend $200 million a year to cut long-term interest costs on $13 billion in school construction projects, saying the city could not pay for it with operating funds.
 Mr. Miller said the new financing structure would save the city at least $620 million, and possibly as much as $1.3 billion, over the life of the project, and he criticized the Bloomberg administration's earlier plan to delay debt payments as needlessly costly. He said he had always favored making payments immediately, to eliminate ''the fiction that the city isn't on the hook'' for the project's success.

HEADLINE: Companies Set Program to Cut Prices of 275 Prescription Drugs

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
Ten major pharmaceutical companies said on Tuesday that they were joining in a new program to cut 25 percent to 40 percent from the retail prices of prescription drugs sold to uninsured people of modest means younger than 65.
 The drug makers, like many Democrats in Congress, painted a grim picture of life without health insurance, saying that millions of Americans went without life-saving drugs because they lacked coverage. 
 People who enroll in the new program, known as Together Rx Access, will receive plastic cards that can be used to obtain substantial savings at local drugstores.
 The program is the latest effort by drug makers to meet public demand for their products while dispelling public anger about the prices. 
 The federal government has no role in the program, but Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, joined drug company executives at a news conference announcing the initiative.
 ''I'm sure there are some cynics out there who will say that this is not enough,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''But it's an exciting opportunity to provide more people with access to prescription medicines.''
 The number of uninsured Americans has been rising at a brisk pace, reaching 45 million in 2003, the last year for which official figures are available. Sponsors of the new card estimated that 36 million of those uninsured would be eligible for it. 
 But experience with other discount cards, including those endorsed by the government for Medicare beneficiaries, suggests that the number of those who sign up will be much lower. Many consumers say they have been confused by similar cards and disappointed with the savings.
 Pfizer already offers a 30-day supply of many of its drugs to certain Medicare beneficiaries for a flat fee of $15, about a fifth of the average price charged to a person with no insurance.
 J. Patrick Kelly, a vice president of Pfizer, said the existing card ''has not had a material impact'' on the company's earnings. He added that ''we do not expect the Together Rx Access card'' to have an adverse effect on earnings either.
 ''As much as we want people to take advantage of these programs,'' he said, ''the uptake has been slow.''
 Several consumer groups voiced support for the new program, while emphasizing that it was no substitute for comprehensive health insurance.
 The new program offers savings on 275 drugs including Crestor and Lipitor, for high cholesterol; Norvasc, for high blood pressure; Nexium, for heartburn and ulcers; Viagra, for erectile dysfunction; and Zoloft and Paxil, for depression.
 The companies participating in the new program are Abbott Laboratories, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Novartis, Pfizer, Sanofi-Aventis, Takeda and TAP Pharmaceutical Products.
 Industry officials said that if the cards worked as intended, they could reduce the public clamor for legislation to allow the import of low-cost drugs from Canada and elsewhere.
 People can qualify for the cards if they are younger than 65 and not eligible for Medicare, if they have no public or private coverage for drug costs and if their incomes do not exceed certain levels. The limit is $30,000 for an individual, $40,000 for a couple, $50,000 for a family of three and $60,000 for a family of four.
 Roba J. Whiteley, executive director of Together Rx Access, said that each company decided which of its drugs would be offered in the program and what level of savings would be provided.
 Mr. Kelly, of Pfizer, said that the savings to consumers resulted from discounts offered by pharmacists as well as manufacturers. Thus, he said, a person may be charged different prices for the same prescription at different drugstores.
 Ms. Whiteley said a majority of pharmacies nationwide would accept the card by mid-February. But she said she could not name any participating chain drugstores because ''negotiations are still under way.''
 The legal and economic arrangements for the new program are complex. Each of the 10 drug makers has agreed to provide a subsidy -- 15 percent of the list price, or wholesale acquisition cost -- on drugs bought with the card. 
 If drugstores want to participate, they must agree to limits on what they will be paid for various drugs. These limits set a cap on the combined payment from the drug manufacturer and the consumer.

PERSON: Robert L. Heilbroner

HEADLINE: Robert Heilbroner, Writer And Economist, Dies at 85

BYLINE: By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE

 BODY:
Robert L. Heilbroner, an economist and writer of lively and provocative books that inspired generations of students with the drama of how the world earns, or fails to earn, its living -- books that made him one of his profession's all-time best-selling authors -- died on Jan. 4 in Manhattan. He was 85. 
 His death, at New York Presbyterian Hospital, was announced Monday by the New School University, where he was professor emeritus on the graduate faculty of political and social science. The cause was a brain stem stroke after a three-year bout with Lewy body disease, a brain disease similar to Alzheimer's, his son David said.
 Dr. Heilbroner's first book, ''The Worldly Philosophers: The Lives, Times and Ideas of the Great Economic Thinkers,'' written before he received his doctorate, is one of the most widely read economics books of all time. He was also a prominent lecturer as well as the author of 19 other books, which sold more than 10 million copies and, in many cases, became standard college textbooks. 
 A witty writer, he called himself a ''radical conservative,'' an oxymoron suggesting that, like Don Quixote, he wanted to rush rapidly forward, break the mold -- and end up right where he was. But in that he was only half joking. He did indeed want to conserve the basic separation of the national economy from the national government, as suggested by Adam Smith in the 18th century. But he believed, too, that when the economy was hit with severe recessions or high unemployment or yawning income gaps, for example, government had to intervene with public spending that stimulated economic activity and generated jobs and the construction of public works that contributed to higher living standards. 
 Although popular with students and the general reader, he was regarded by mainstream economists as a popularizer and historian whose insights made no great contribution to the study of the field. He, in turn, saw their reliance on mathematics and computer modeling as narrow in vision and as losing sight of the very purpose of economics -- to help improve the well-being of people at work and of the society they work in. 
 ''The worldly philosophers,'' Dr. Heilbroner said in a 1999 interview, ''thought their task was to model all the complexities of an economic system -- the political, the sociological, the psychological, the moral, the historical. And modern economists, au contraire, do not want so complex a vision. They favor two-dimensional models that in trying to be scientific leave out too much and leave modern economists without a true understanding of how the system works.'' 
 Dr. Heilbroner himself was the first to admit that he was not an economists' economist. He preferred writing to plotting the sale of widgets and calculating the effects of a heat wave on corn futures. And he was interested more in the history of economics and in what he considered its true dynamics than in working within the field itself. He liked to say that his chief accomplishment was in conning millions of students into thinking that the field was both interesting and in tune with their social ideas. 
 ''The Worldly Philosophers,'' published in 1953 (Simon & Schuster) and still in print, is widely regarded as one of the best texts for infusing clarity and excitement into the history of economic thought. 
 John Kenneth Galbraith, the Harvard economist who, like Dr. Heilbroner, was often shunned as an outsider by mainstream economists, called the book a ''brilliant achievement handled nearly to perfection.'' It went into its 10th edition in 1998 -- 35 years after it was first published while Mr. Heilbroner was pursuing a doctorate at the New School for Social Research in Manhattan. 
 Mainstream economists, while critical of the way Professors Heilbroner and Galbraith practiced economics, nevertheless acknowledged the importance of several of their observations. Milton Friedman, the godfather of American conservative economists, who shared both assessments, said Professor Heilbroner was right on point, for example, with his attack in ''The Crisis of Vision in Modern Economic Thought'' (Cambridge University Press, 1996; written with William Milberg). By the end of the 20th century, the authors argued, economists had lost their concern for the social or political implications of their work, seeing themselves solely as sophisticated mathematical or statistical analysts. 
 ''He was correct,'' Mr. Friedman said. ''There was an increasing tendency to move economics in highly specialized directions without any real view of its broader aspects.'' 
 Robert Lewis Heilbroner was born on the Upper West Side of Manhattan on March 24, 1919, the third child and only son of Louis and Helen Heiler Heilbroner. His father was raised in a poor family in North Carolina but later prospered with a chain of men's clothing stores he founded in New York. He died when Robert was 5. The family business was sold, and he and his sisters were sent to private schools. 
 The family chauffeur served as a surrogate father for 10 years, Dr. Heilbroner later said, playing a major role in shaping his thinking. As a student at Harvard, Dr. Heilbroner planned to major in writing but took a course in economics and, he said, ''I took to it like a duck to water.'' After Harvard, he went to work in New York at the retail chain founded by his father and found that he hated the job. It took him 23 years after leaving Harvard to earn his doctorate in economics, however. 
 Moving to Washington at the start of World War II, he worked with the Federal Office of Price Administration until he was drafted, assigned to Army intelligence and sent to the University of Michigan to learn Japanese. Over the course of the war, he interviewed some 2,000 enemy prisoners in the Pacific, gaining valuable information from voluble captives. The war taught him that he had a facility with language and words, and, after a brief term with a Wall Street commodities firm, he began writing freelance magazine articles on economics. He sold several to Harpers magazine, and caught the attention of editors at Simon & Schuster, who suggested that he write a book. He took their advice, quit business forever and from then on rarely stopped writing. 
 In 1952, he married Joan Knapp, an author of children's books, and they had two children, Peter and David. His sons survive him, as does Ms. Knapp, from whom he was divorced in 1975, the year he married Shirley Eleanor Davis, who also survives him.
 Mr. Heilbroner completed his doctoral course requirements by 1952 and finished ''The Worldly Philosophers'' the next year. The book was an account that laymen could easily read about the lives and theories of the economic superstars of the past, among them Adam Smith, Robert Malthus, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill, Karl Marx, Alfred Marshall, Thorstein Veblen, John Maynard Keynes and Joseph Schumpeter. It was an immediate hit, and eventually sold millions of copies. 
 But his Ph.D. took him 10 more years. He started and abandoned three dissertations. After ''The Worldly Philosophers'' was published his faculty advisers scolded him, saying the book would have filled the bill beautifully. So he submitted his next manuscript, ''The Making of Economic Society,'' and was promptly awarded his doctorate. Later books included ''The Limits of American Capitalism'' (1966); ''Between Capitalism and Socialism'' (1970); ''Marxism: For and Against'' (1980), with Lester Thurow; ''The Nature and Logic of Capitalism'' (1985); and ''Behind the Veil of Economics (1988). 
 In ''21st Century Capitalism,'' (W.W. Norton & Co., 1993), Dr. Heilbroner explained his radical conservatism with a bow to Adam Smith. Dr. Heilbroner agreed with Smith that the separation of the economy and the state was central to capitalism and a nation's economic health, and essential for political liberty. But he believed that from time to time the people's government had to wade in with major repairs.
 He said in an interview in 1998 that ''feelings of dismay'' penetrate the contemporary mind over unstable or depressed world economies and the widening income gap. He also noted capitalism's shortcomings in dealing with ''externalities'' -- for example, ''the higher laundry bills and health costs of people living in Pittsburgh before the pollution of the steel mills was brought under control.'' ''Negative externalities,'' particularly the pollution of land, water and air by private enterprises intent on holding down costs cried out for government intervention, he said, whether in the form of taxes, subsidies, legislation or regulation.

HEADLINE: 2 Large Industrial Unions Plan to Merge

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
The United Steelworkers of America announced a merger yesterday with the union representing paper, chemical and energy workers to form the nation's largest industrial union, with about 825,000 members.
 Officials with the steelworkers and with the Paper, Allied Industrial, Chemical and Energy Workers International Union, known as PACE, said the merger would enable the unions to contend better with corporations as they grew larger.
 ''Our primary sectors are in manufacturing, and our manufacturing jobs are going overseas,'' Boyd Young, president of PACE, said in a telephone news conference. ''We are dealing not with domestic companies, but with multinational companies that are merging and going global, and I believe unions have to do the same thing.'' 
 Under the merger agreement, Leo Gerard, the steelworkers' president, will become president of the combined union, assuming that the two unions ratify the merger at their conventions in April. Steelworkers' officials said their membership was 550,000, and officials with the paper and allied industrial union said theirs was 275,000.
 ''We're going to be the largest union in a number of crucial sectors of the North American economy,'' Mr. Gerard said. ''We'll be able to bargain better agreements and better represent our members, and by doing that, we think we can do a better job organizing additional workers.''
 Union officials said the combined union would be a major political force in the Midwest and would spend $30 million a year on organizing additional workers.
 Mr. Young of PACE said his union's bargaining leverage would be strengthened because it would be able to use the steelworkers' $150 million defense fund to sustain workers during strikes. 
 The merged union will have its headquarters in Pittsburgh, the steelworkers' home, but will maintain a secondary headquarters in Nashville, where PACE is based. The new union will be called the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied-Industrial and Service Workers International Union.
 ''One obvious benefit would be the economics of scale realized in terms of serving the members, having a single legal department and all that kind of stuff,'' Paul Clark, a professor of labor relations at Pennsylvania State University, said. ''And it may well be that a larger union with greater resources gives them a greater advantage in each of their sectors. But I'm not sure.''
 Mr. Gerard said the two unions had already been the products of 18 mergers. In 1995, the United Rubber Workers merged into the steelworkers' union. PACE was created in 1999, when the United Paperworkers International Union combined with the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers.
 Mr. Young said, ''We believe we're creating the most powerful industrial organization in the United States, if not the world.'' 
 While the new union will be significantly smaller than several other unions -- the service employees union has nearly 1.7 million members and the Teamsters nearly 1.4 million -- it will be bigger than two other major industrial unions. The United Automobile Workers has about 700,000 members, and the International Association of Machinists has 470,000. At its peak, the steelworkers' union had 1.2 million members. 
 In 1995, the steelworkers, auto workers and machinists announced that they would merge to form the nation's largest union, but in 1999, union officials quietly disclosed that the three-way merger had collapsed.

HEADLINE: An Anchor Bookstore for a College and Its Neighborhood

BYLINE: By SUZANNE HAMLIN

 BODY:
PrattStore is determined to be more than just another college bookstore. Housed in a sleek contemporary building with large glass windows, the new art-and-design store, which will open this month on Myrtle Avenue in Brooklyn, has been purposely built to serve both town and gown. 
 The store, a 15,000-square-foot soaring space, is a warehouse of books, publications and tools for every category of the arts. It combines bits of art shops and bookstores like Barnes & Noble, Rizzoli, MoMA, Pearl Paint and the Harvard Coop, all together in a wide-open merchandise display. 
 ''There is nothing else quite like it anywhere in the country,'' said Thomas F. Schutte, the president of Pratt Institute, the nation's oldest and largest art and design school. ''Obviously, it will be a tremendous resource for our students but, because of its location, for the community as well.''
 Community in this case is a broad concept. Pratt, which has more than 5,000 undergraduate and graduate students and more than 800 faculty members, is on 25 acres in the middle of Clinton Hill. Founded in 1887 by Charles Pratt, an oil industrialist and philanthropist, who built his own home nearby, Pratt's 19th-century founding precepts -- an ideal merging of art and commerce -- seem much in evidence today. 
 The highly visible new PrattStore, built on a corner of the Pratt campus on part of a school parking lot, is at Emerson Place and Myrtle Avenue, a low-rise commercial thoroughfare for both traffic and pedestrians that wends through Brooklyn's multiethnic, mixed-economic residential neighborhoods of Fort Greene, Clinton Hill and Bedford-Stuyvesant. While no hard figures exist, these high-density areas have a relatively high share of artists, sculptors, photographers, filmmakers and architects as residents.
 For them, PrattStore may become a regular shopping destination. Revenue for the store's first fiscal year, July 2005 through June 2006, is projected at $3 million. ''Every penny of the net profits will flow directly back into Pratt operations,'' said Dr. Schutte, who has a doctorate in business administration.
 Constructed for $2.2 million and designed by the architect Richard Scherr, director of facilities planning and design at Pratt, the pale gray all-steel store was created from prefabricated components supplied by Butler Manufacturing of Kansas City, Mo., a leading manufacturer of pre-engineered metal building systems. 
 The building's distinctive features include a striking red canopy on the exterior and poured concrete counters and wood seats inside. The interior space has been divided into a large, open ground-floor merchandise arena and a mezzanine overlooking the main floor, reached by open steps. The display cases are movable, so the space can be reconfigured at any time.
 The display racks are filled with art supplies, dorm supplies, Pratt logo merchandise and a big selection of books (about a third are textbooks with the rest being trade books) on painting, sculpture, photography, architecture, interior design, digital media, furniture, woodworking, fashion, ceramics and jewelry. 
 The mezzanine has more books and design and fashion magazines as well as an open area that will be a performance space for readings and lectures by artists and writers. A 750-square-foot exhibition and retail space is evolving into ''Pratt by Design'' -- featuring products and artwork created by Pratt alumni and faculty. 
 Mezzanine seating encourages customers to stay as long as they want and an espresso bar is planned. 
 Donald Condrey, general manager of the store, is a longtime retailer who ran the campus bookstore at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. 
 The previous Pratt bookstore was in a cramped space in the basement of an administration building. The new store is the latest of several changes during Dr. Schutte's tenure that have increased Pratt's visibility. PrattStore's official opening party is scheduled for Jan. 27. But last weekend, on a rainy late afternoon, PrattStore already appeared like a brightly lighted beacon on Myrtle Avenue, and passers-by continually stopped, knocked and mouthed through the glass doors, ''Are you open yet?'' 
 The supplicants were a diverse group, older women carrying shopping bags, parents with strollers, bearded men wearing berets and children. Nodding toward one wall of the store, Mr. Condrey noted, ''We do have a large kids' art supply section, and we're working with local schools on a discount program for students.'' 
 Mr. Condrey said the store would welcome ideas from its customers. ''At the front of the store, we're going to have a big bulletin board called Soap Box, where people can post their ideas about service, merchandise, even programs,'' he said. ''We expect we'll get plenty of suggestions, and we plan to take them very seriously.''

HEADLINE: More Borrowing Clout for Ground Zero Developer

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
The developer Larry A. Silverstein was authorized yesterday by the New York City Industrial Development Agency to borrow an extra $75 million through tax-exempt Liberty Bonds for his $1.355 billion 7 World Trade Center project.
 Mr. Silverstein won preliminary approval two years ago for $400 million in Liberty Bonds but returned to the agency facing higher interest costs and having received less of an insurance payout than he expected. Seven World Trade Center, a silvery 52-story parallelogram across Vesey Street from the main trade center site, is to open early next year. It is already clad almost completely in glass but does not yet have any prospective tenants except Silverstein Properties. 
 That 7 World Trade Center is rising at all is ''thanks in large part to the Liberty Bond program,'' said Andrew M. Alper, who is chairman of the agency, which unanimously approved the financing. He is also president of the city Economic Development Corporation.
 The agency expects Mr. Silverstein, who holds the commercial lease on the main trade center site, to return soon to seek $3.5 billion in Liberty Bonds for the other office towers planned on the site. If granted, that would represent nearly 90 percent of all remaining Liberty Bond financing for commercial projects in New York City.
 The advantage of Liberty Bonds to borrowers is that lenders accept lower interest rates because the proceeds are exempt from federal, state and city taxes. 
 Since Mr. Silverstein first applied for financing, the estimated total project cost has risen to $1.355 billion from $1.196 billion. The largest single item is $516 million to pay off the mortgage on the previous 7 World Trade Center, which Mr. Silverstein developed and owned. It burned and collapsed on Sept. 11, 2001, hours after the attack.
 The rest of the budget includes so-called hard construction costs of $378.3 million; soft costs like architectural fees and insurance, $119.5 million; the building of tenant space, $131.8 million; interest, $179 million; and operating expenses, $30.5 million.
 Much of the financing -- $819 million -- is to come from insurance proceeds. This is $42 million less than the face value of the policy, which reflects a settlement between Mr. Silverstein and the building's insurer, according to the agency. 
 The rest of the financing will come from $475 million in Liberty Bonds, $3.94 million in interest income from the insurance proceeds and a $57.23 million investment by 7 World Trade Company, which is owned by Mr. Silverstein and his wife, Klara.
 Because of delays in retiring the mortgage, Mr. Silverstein faced a $113 million increase in interest expense. According to an analysis by the development corporation, a delay in arranging bond financing and the need to keep insurance proceeds available for construction on an interim basis ''has postponed the use of those insurance funds to pay off the existing mortgage.''
 Under federal law, Liberty Bonds cannot be used to satisfy an existing mortgage. Instead, the bond financing will pay both for current construction costs and to reimburse Mr. Silverstein for construction costs that he has already paid with insurance proceeds.

HEADLINE: No Pundit Left Behind

BYLINE: By Andrew J. Rotherham. 
Andrew J. Rotherham, director of education policy at the Progressive Policy Institute, writes the blog Eduwonk.com.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
IT is clear the top leadership at the Department of Education is the gang that can't flack straight. How else to explain the department's decision to pay the commentator Armstrong Williams $240,000 to promote the No Child Left Behind Act in his work and to his colleagues? Ultimately, this is a second-tier scandal, but it takes a place among a series of bad decisions that risk scuttling the most ambitious effort in a generation to improve education for poor and minority youngsters.
 Mr. Williams strenuously claims he supported the No Child Left Behind law before he accepted any money, and there is no reason to doubt him. But this defense just adds ineptitude to the already shady nature of the deal. If Mr. Williams was a proponent of the law, then the political appointees at the Department of Education spent almost a quarter of a million dollars paying off someone already on their side. Ethics notwithstanding, this is a stunningly inefficient use of public dollars -- every bit as redundant as paying football fans to watch the Super Bowl. 
 Moreover, the Bush team knew where to look for more cost-effective marks -- that is, ones who needed persuading. At least until recently, the administration kept rankings of reporters based on their coverage of the law and its efforts on education. Reporters were graded on a 100-point scale depending on whether their stories were critical or favorable toward the law.
 Bravely jeopardizing incalculable points, Ben Feller of The Associated Press broke that news last October. Yet here again, the deed itself is actually less worrisome than the implicit message about the department's top leadership: hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent on the outside consultants who actually did the rankings.
 Can political appointees who botch the simple economics of a payoff -- or cannot figure out by themselves which news articles are favorable to them and which aren't -- put into effect a law as complicated as No Child Left Behind? It's no laughing matter. Large policy changes require sustained, intensive and expert attention.
 So far the administration's record fails to inspire confidence. Initially, it was slow to work with states and school districts and explain what the new education law requires, causing confusion among all parties. Those problems persist to this day. And when it finally did get regulations and information out, some were overly restrictive and subsequently needed revision, causing more confusion and costing support.
 Playing politics with the law's financing also gave its critics an easy target. Considering the overall lack of fiscal constraint typical of this administration, its decision to suddenly become stingy on crucial programs called for in the law is inexplicable.
 And then there were missteps like Secretary of Education Rod Paige's characterization of the National Education Association as a ''terrorist organization.'' While unrelated to specific policies, such statements further weakened the administration's credibility.
 Meanwhile, liberal Democratic stalwarts like Senator Edward Kennedy and Representative George Miller gamely resist efforts by groups like the teachers union to gut the law's accountability requirements. The stream of almost entirely avoidable problems and Department of Education gaffes makes it even harder for Democratic supporters of the law to resist the pressure. 
 Repealing a law passed with broad bipartisan support is usually an uphill struggle. In this case, however, the law's critics enjoy a powerful ally: the Department of Education. It is nearly impossible to buy the sort of bad publicity the department has lately been giving away. The new secretary of education, Margaret Spellings, should focus on getting the policy right, and let the public relations take care of itself.

HEADLINE: Character Is Destiny

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE. 
E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
What's the secret to long-run success? 
 For a person, it's useful to have the smarts, look great, be lucky and exude charisma. All that is not enough.
 For a political party, it helps to have good organization, articulate candidates and pollsters to discern a popular set of issues. Not enough. 
 For a nation, success can seem assured by natural resources, free enterprise, a culture of compassion and a free press. It can still go under.
 For a person, a party and a nation, the element essential to success is character, a word that grew out of the Greek for ''to mark, to engrave.''
 We can see that mark on individuals under stress: Lincoln, taking on the bloody burden of conflict to uphold majority rule. Or engraved in the unknown brain scientists of today, who break beyond the necessary treatment of mental suffering to the artificial enhancement of the human mind -- and debate in their own minds if and when it is ethical to ''play God.''
 Such men and women shape their character in life's personal decisions, weighing the warmth of loyalty against the cool of independence. They choose careers to gain the power to do good, or to build and support family, or to fulfill artistic talents -- but forge character in sacrifices made in choosing one path over another. 
 We also see the mark of character, or lack of it, in political parties. The Republican Party today is characterized by a mission to defeat terror while exporting freedom abroad, and a policy to restrain taxes while increasing social spending at home. 
 Such a sharply defined character has led to electoral success and control of the White House, the Congress, state legislatures and the Supreme Court. Though George W. Bush is not an overwhelmingly beloved leader, he won a clear majority because most swing voters felt he resolutely stood for what he believed in. Their votes for character had coattails.
 The G.O.P. personality will split in a couple of years, as all huge majorities do in America. Idealistic neocons will be challenged by plodding, pragmatic paleocons, who, by fuzzing the party's present character, will someday lead it down the road to defeat.
 If I were starting out in politics or its commentary today, I'd become a Democrat. That's because the party now is six disconsolate characters in search of an author. 
 Adlai Stevenson called 1952 Republicans ''out of patience, out of sorts and out of office.'' That tight shoe now fits liberals, who have been drifting toward isolationism abroad and fiscal conservatism at home, which for Democrats are out of character. The spirit of Senator Henry ''Scoop'' Jackson is needed to return the party to ideological consistency: interventionist at home and abroad. 
 Although opportunism is often cited as the opposite of character, not so in politics: this is the opportune time for the Democratic minority to take advantage of its bantamweight agility and ''stand for something.''
 What of a nation's character -- does it presage long-run success? In northern Iraq, the Kurdish ''nation'' is self-defended, democratic and prosperous, its success based on the fiercely independent nature of Muslim Kurds. 
 The British historian D.W. Brogan wrote 60 years ago that the unique achievement of Americans to form a continental nation -- without sacrificing liberty or efficiency -- led to the temper of the pioneer, the gambler and the booster: ''the religion of economic and political optimism.'' 
 History has shown that U.S. optimism has not been misplaced. But what of reports of global griping at America's superpower arrogance -- at our government's triumphalism? Has our character been warped by victories in three world wars?
 Call me a chauvinist unilateralist, but I believe America's human and economic sacrifices for the advance of freedom abroad show our personal, political and national character to be stronger and better than ever. This moral advance will be more widely appreciated as an Islamic version of democracy takes root. (What's triumphalism without a triumph?) 
 It is that growing strength of national character -- more than our individual genius or political leadership or military power -- that ensures the future success of America and brightens the light of liberty's torch.

HEADLINE: China's Trade Surplus May Stir Currency Debate

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER and ELIZABETH BECKER; Keith Bradsher reported from Hong Kong for this article and Elizabeth Becker from Washington.

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
China reported on Tuesday that its trade surplus grew for the seventh consecutive month, to a record $11.1 billion in December. The surplus helped send China's foreign currency reserves soaring further, lifting the economy to another year of extremely strong growth, Chinese officials announced. 
 The robust performance, however, is a double-edged sword for China. It is likely to increase pressure for Beijing to allow China's currency, the yuan, to rise in value against the dollar as foreign investment and export earnings alike pour into the country at an accelerating pace. China's ballooning surplus also serves as a convenient backdrop for an increasingly polarized debate in the United States over whether trade with China is good or bad for the economy. 
 While the Bush administration often highlights the benefits of trade, especially the lower cost of imported goods, even some White House officials have begun blaming China for the growing level of trade friction. 
 As if on cue, United States Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans, arriving in Beijing with a team of American trade negotiators, prepared to hand China a stern warning of restiveness among lawmakers and businesses in the United States. 
 In remarks set for delivery on Wednesday, Mr. Evans cautioned that China's surplus, and what United States officials describe as unfair practices, including alleged government subsidies to exporters and patent violations, could spark retaliation.
 ''China must forcefully do more to lift barriers to free trade and confront widespread intellectual property theft that is undercutting American workers,'' Mr. Evans said. ''China's willingness to tackle these challenges head-on will be the most important measure of the success or failure of its efforts.''
 Adding more fuel to the fire, a research group in Washington reported on Tuesday that, had the United States not run deficits with China since 1989, the country would have 1.5 million more jobs today. The trade deficit with China grew to $124 billion in 2003 from $6.2 billion in 1989. The study was prepared for the United States-China Economic Security Review Commission, a Congressionally appointed panel, by Robert E. Scott, the senior international economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank. 
 The report said that jobs were lost in every state, but the highest numbers came from California, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas. Among the hardest-hit states as a share of total state employment were Arkansas, Maine, Massachusetts and North Carolina. 
 The job losses were not just in labor-intensive industries, like textiles and plastics, but also from new sectors once thought to be out of China's reach, such as high technology.
 ''What is really shocking is the rate that China has moved into the production of high-skill, high-technology product,'' Mr. Scott said. ''China is now entirely responsible for our $32 billion deficit in advanced technology products like computers, electronics.'' 
 Not everyone agrees with Mr. Scott's conclusions. Daniel T. Griswold, the director of the center for trade policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, disputed both the report's methods and its findings. 
 ''There is no connection between employment and our trade with China,'' Mr. Griswold said. ''But even if the finding of 1.5 million jobs is correct, it is spread over one decade and a half and that mounts to less than 1 percent of job displacement over the entire period.''
 Instead of focusing solely on job losses, Mr. Griswold said the report should have included the money China invests in United States Treasury bills that keeps interest rates down. 
 China's exports of everything from clothing to consumer electronics have been rising rapidly for 2004, and were 33 percent higher last month than in 2003, its ministry of commerce announced. But high oil prices combined with China's attempts to build emergency oil reserves inflated the cost of the country's imports, until recently offsetting the big expansion of exports. Lower oil prices are now allowing China's remarkable export performance to show up in bigger and bigger trade surpluses.
 To prevent the yuan from rising in value, China's central bank has been buying up the extra dollars flowing into the country from the trade surpluses and from growing investment by multinationals and speculators alike. Reuters reported from Beijing on Tuesday that the country's foreign currency reserves had surged to $609.9 billion by the end of December, up 51.3 percent from in 2003.
 Chinese officials also said on Tuesday that the economy grew more than 9 percent in 2004, without providing a more precise figure, and estimated that investment in new factories and other fixed assets rose by 25 percent in 2004.
 The December trade surplus and the accumulation of foreign currency are so large that they are certain to bring renewed calls for Beijing to let the yuan appreciate, which could limit somewhat the competitiveness of Chinese exports, economists said. But Chinese leaders have been resisting such calls for more than two years, and may prove just as intransigent now, the economists warned.
 ''The pressure will grow because of the simultaneous release of rapid growth in foreign exchange reserves and record trade surplus,'' said Desmond Supple, the managing director of Asian research in the Singapore office of Barclays Capital. But he added, ''There's a very sizable difference between political pressure and a change in policy.''
 Forward contracts based on the value of the yuan a year from now were trading in Singapore late Tuesday at the equivalent of 7.89 yuan to the dollar. That suggests investors expect the currency to appreciate from its current, government-managed level of 8.28 to the dollar. The contracts are not for the actual delivery of yuan because of the many restrictions that Beijing still imposes on money flowing in and out of China.

HEADLINE: Intel, Citing Brisk Demand, Posts 10% Rise In Revenue

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
Intel, the world's largest computer chip maker, reported strong demand for its products on Tuesday, a day after a main Silicon Valley rival, Advanced Micro Devices, warned that it expected to report lower profits because of a price war with Intel in the flash memory market.
 Intel said that its revenue was up nearly 10 percent in the fourth quarter, to $9.6 billion, while its profit dipped slightly, to $2.1 billion, or 33 cents a share, compared with $2.2 billion, also 33 cents, in the quarter a year earlier. 
 At the same time, it gave an upbeat forecast for the coming year, suggesting that the company was making progress in overcoming some of its production problems and excessive inventories arising from troubles matching supply with demand. 
 The chief financial officer, Andy Bryant, said that ''2004 was a year of growth for Intel,'' attributing the strength of its product line to a successful holiday selling season for computers and digital devices as well as a continued expansion of spending by corporations. 
 Intel's earnings report is considered a leading indicator of the health of the technology sector but it also appeared to reflect a comeback of sorts in the company's battle with A.M.D., which has made substantial inroads into Intel's dominant position as the leading microprocessor maker.
 Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., has fought back in part by challenging A.M.D. in its own critical stronghold -- producing a variety of chips known as flash memory that are used in cellphones and other portable digital devices. 
 Intel made its announcement after the close of regular trading on Tuesday. Its stock, which had fallen 34 cents to $22.54, rose 68 cents after hours, to $23.22. By contrast, A.M.D. shares plunged 26 percent in response to the profit warning it issued on Monday evening, closing at $14.86, down $5.27.
 Paul S. Otellini, Intel's president, said the company was particularly benefiting from robust spending on all types of digital products as innovation in the technology business is increasingly being energized as much by consumer demand as by corporate spending. ''What gave Q4 a nice boost was the retail business,'' he said.
 Analysts had projected that Intel would report $9.4 billion in revenue and earnings of 31 cents a share. In December, Intel raised its revenue forecast to a range of $9.3 billion to $9.5 billion, from the $8.6 billion to $9.2 billion it had predicted at the end of the third quarter. 
 ''The results are likely to be perceived as reassuring coming from an industry leader,'' said Tim Luke, an analyst at Lehman Brothers. 
 Intel executives said the company expected to increase capital spending by at least $1 billion in 2005, as it moves toward so-called dual core processors that are intended to offer better performance than today's chips. Spending on research and development will increase to $5.2 billion from $4.8 billion, Mr. Bryant said, the highest level in Intel's history.
 Company executives said gross profit margins were 56 percent in the fourth quarter, a sharp decline from 63.6 percent a year earlier. Intel attributed the decline to increased competition from Advanced Micro, leading it to reduce prices.
 Over the last few quarters, Intel has struggled to overcome an inventory glut. Mr. Bryant said on Tuesday that in correcting the problem last quarter, it might have been overly aggressive.
 ''We did try to slam the door on inventory and we may have gone too far,'' he said in a conference call with analysts. The company ran into spot shortages of high-end microprocessors, Mr. Bryant said, and was unable to fully meet the demand for them.
 Apjit Walia, an analyst with RBC Capital, noted that both business and consumer spending were growing faster than Intel had anticipated. ''The fact that they said they would have shipped $100 million more, had they had the inventory, says something about demand,'' he said. ''They're saying enterprise and retail came back.'' 
 By contrast, Advanced Micro Devices said Monday that its operating income for the fourth quarter would be lower than its forecast last month. While the company projected that total sales would be up ''slightly,'' analysts had expected them to rise as much as 9 percent from the third quarter.
 Advanced Micro, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., attributed its problems to competitive conditions in the market for flash memory chips. Analysts said that its loss in the fourth quarter was Intel's gain.
 Intel executives said their company regained its position as market leader in core flash products during the quarter, pushing Advanced Micro into second place. Mr. Otellini said that prices for flash products had been lower, but that was more than offset by an increase in unit shipments. Flash memory accounts for more than 40 percent of Advanced Micro's overall sales but only 7 percent of Intel's.
 For all of 2004, Intel's revenue was $34.2 billion, surpassing its record of $33.7 billion in 2000. Net income for the year was $7.5 billion, up 33 percent from 2003. Earnings were $1.16 a share, a 36 percent improvement over the previous year. 
 Looking ahead, the company projected revenue at $8.8 billion to $9.4 billion this quarter, and most analysts are expecting it to come in at the top of that range. Intel did not forecast earnings, but predicted that its gross margins would probably slip to around 55 percent for the quarter before improving later in the year.

HEADLINE: Small Clinical Trial Gives Johnson & Johnson Stent a Bit of a Lift

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
The clinical trial was a small one in Germany dealing with an increasingly rare medical problem. But Johnson & Johnson hopes the results, published late yesterday in The Journal of the American Medical Association, will aid its drive to erode Boston Scientific's dominance in the $5 billion market for drug-coated stents.
 Stents are mesh cylinders inserted in blood vessels to prop them open after blockages are cleared. The new report studied the small subset of patients who receive a bare metal stent but need further treatment after new blockages develop within their stent. 
 Both the Cypher stent from Johnson & Johnson and the Taxus from Boston Scientific performed well compared with an alternative treatment of simple angioplasty, in which the blood vessel is reopened by temporarily inflating a small balloon. But 19 of the 100 patients who received the Taxus stent later needed further treatment for blockage in the vessel, compared with 8 of the 100 patients who had Cypher stents. 
 The German trial is one of several research projects suggesting that Cypher, which is coated with a drug called sirolimus, has advantages in some types of patients over Taxus, which is coated with paclitaxel. 
 The results of the German trial were first reported last fall at medical meetings. Johnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., hopes publication of the peer-reviewed analysis will lend its stent added credibility.
 ''These are all chapters in a story,'' said Dr. Brian G. Firth, vice president for medical affairs and health economics at Cordis, the Johnson & Johnson subsidiary that makes the Cypher. Boston Scientific and practicing cardiologists say trials with such small numbers of subjects do not provide convincing evidence of any difference between the stents. 
 ''The key body of evidence is the nearly one million patients who have received a Taxus stent,'' said Paul Donovan, a spokesman for Boston Scientific, who predicted that Taxus would continue to be the first choice of most physicians. Taxus is widely viewed as easier to insert than Cypher, an attribute important to many physicians.
 Dr. Adnan Kastrati, leader of the team of German investigators, cautioned that the trial did not study whether Cypher is a better choice than Taxus for patients receiving stents for the first time.
 Cypher and Taxus are the only drug-coated stents approved for use in the United States. Potential rivals to them are not expected to gain clearance before 2007. 
 Taxus's American market share was at 70 percent as recently as September, according to Boston Scientific, which is based in Natick, Mass. Since then, Cordis has raised production, and analysts estimate that Taxus now has 65 percent of the market. 
 Boston Scientifc shares, down 14.7 percent since the end of September, declined 38 cents to close at $33.90 yesterday. Johnson & Johnson shares fell 22 cents, to $62.88.

HEADLINE: Meeting the Everymen of Iraq, Courtesy of a Returning Poet

BYLINE: By DANA STEVENS

 BODY:
''About Baghdad,'' produced and directed by an independent collective of artists and scholars, traces the journey of Sinan Antoon, a poet and journalist who left Iraq in 1991 to flee what he calls ''the whole stifling atmosphere of Saddam and tyranny.''
 After 12 years teaching and studying Iraqi literature in the United States, Mr. Antoon returned to Baghdad in July 2003 to spend three weeks interviewing ordinary Iraqis: manual laborers, cabdrivers, writers, government workers and children. These brief, fragmentary encounters are strung together over a soundtrack of Iraqi classical songs. 
 It's a grim index of the situation in Iraq that July 2003 now seems a long time ago. The Baghdad of these images, just several months after the American invasion began, looks relatively intact and secure compared with the images of chaos and violence now flooding our television screens. The film's most persistent theme is the Iraqi will to self-determination: words spray-painted in Arabic on a building read: ''Iraq will be ruled by Iraqis.'' A student expresses hope that future textbooks will read: ''Baghdad did not fall. Baghdad was occupied.'' Again and again, those interviewed bear witness to the humiliation of living under another's rule, be it Saddam Hussein's or that of a foreign occupier. 
 Unlike last year's similarly structured documentary ''Voices of Iraq,'' produced by three Americans, in which an apparent plurality of voices slowly converged into what was essentially a pro-occupation stance, ''About Baghdad,'' which opens today at the Two Boots Pioneer Theater in the East Village, manages to present a true diversity of opinion. 
 Although those interviewed unanimously despised the government of Mr. Hussein (the only exception is, literally, a madman who chants old Baathist slogans in the ruins of an asylum), the speakers are divided on the subject of the American presence in Iraq. They evince a complex set of attitudes toward their new American occupiers, by turns angry, resigned, hopeful and even witty. One woman watches L. Paul Bremer III, then the chief American administrator in Iraq, on television: ''He is a very handsome and good-looking man. Yes, this president of ours is handsome! But we don't want him. We want an Iraqi government.''
 In one of the most bracing encounters of the film, a cabdriver with a chemistry degree upbraids Mr. Antoon for blaming the United States for Iraq's ills: ''As Iraqis, who is responsible for us, Bush or Saddam?''
 At times, these interviews could be better placed in context: only three or four of the dozens of speakers are identified by name and occupation. As a result, we learn that Iraqis hold differing opinions about the war, but not how those opinions divide along economic or social lines. The inexplicable use of split screens and multiple images (an interviewee appears in one inset box, while another box displays a Baghdad street scene) does little to bolster the power of the speakers' testimony. If anything, the technique is a distracting reminder of hyperstylized television shows like Fox's ''24.'' Material as emotionally and intellectually challenging as this requires no gimmicks at all.

HEADLINE: Mayor Cites Gains In Annual Address With Political Edge

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG; David M. Herszenhorn and Elissa Gootman contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg delivered a feel-good State of the City address heavy with campaign-year pomp yesterday. He declared the city had risen from the ashes of the Sept. 11 terrorist attack under his leadership, and he promised a host of new initiatives clearly aimed at the traditionally Democratic constituencies he will need for his re-election. 
 Mr. Bloomberg, a Republican, promised not only to keep existing programs for gifted and talented students, which are particularly popular with white middle-class voters, but also to expand them into poor and minority areas. 
 He declared a reversal of the city's long retreat from vocational training with a program that will focus on getting degrees and jobs for dropout students. He also vowed to ensure that the thousands of construction jobs expected to accompany large new projects will extend to people of all backgrounds, in all boroughs. 
 There was no mention of an expected $2 billion gap in the coming fiscal year's $47 billion budget. He passed over glitches in his plan to overhaul the schools. He called again for tax rebates for homeowners, but did not propose any singular new large initiative, a marked contrast to last year, when he first called for the rebate and imposed strict guidelines for the promotion of third graders. 
 Rather, Mr. Bloomberg used the speech aggressively to promote a list of accomplishments that even some of his opponents have had to acknowledge, like a reduction in crime and the city's economic rebound. 
 Speaking before the kind of slogan-bedecked and flag-covered backdrop that often accompanies the appearances of President Bush -- ''Safer Streets,'' ''City of Opportunity,'' ''Better Schools'' -- Mr. Bloomberg told the gathering of current and former elected officials, union leaders and reporters gathered at Hostos Community College in the Bronx, ''The state of the city is strong and we are going to make it even stronger for the future.''
 In similarly proud vein, Mr. Bloomberg said: ''The progress we're making in reforming our schools, in reviving our economy, in driving crime down and in enriching our quality of life didn't just happen. It's the product of independent leadership, a commitment to the kind of government New Yorkers deserve.''
 If there was any doubt that the address was the unofficial start of the campaign season, the five Democrats most frequently mentioned as potential challengers to Mr. Bloomberg were there as well: the City Council speaker, Gifford Miller; the former Bronx borough president, Fernando Ferrer; the Manhattan borough president, C. Virginia Fields; Representative Anthony D. Weiner of Brooklyn and Queens; and City Councilman Charles Barron of Brooklyn. They used the address as an opportunity to take their own shots at the mayor. 
 ''Your interpretation of the state of the city really depends where you're looking at it from,'' Mr. Ferrer said in a telephone interview set up by his political strategists after the address. ''It looks different from his perch than it does from a two-family home in Bayside or a walk-up in Flatbush.''
 Mr. Miller held what amounted to a rebuttal to Mr. Bloomberg's address upstairs from the college auditorium where the mayor gave it, focusing most specifically on education reform. He said the mayor had excluded parents from his efforts to overhaul the schools, had failed to give teachers the respect they deserved and had erred in setting up a school safety initiative focused on the most dangerous schools instead of all schools.
 ''This mayor has not focused on the fundamentals of educational reform,'' Mr. Miller said. ''It's not as complicated as he would like to suggest it would be: smaller classes, better teachers, safer schools, strong after-school programs.''
 Edward Skyler, a spokesman for the mayor, responded in an interview to the Democrats' comments by saying, ''Since these mayoral wannabes don't have a vision for the city or the slightest clue how they would run it, they resort to these lame cheap shots.''
 Advisers to some of Mr. Bloomberg's opponents have said they consider education to be his most vulnerable issue, since the mayor himself has asked voters to judge him on his performance in this area and has portrayed a second term as necessary to finish what he started. 
 Mr. Bloomberg devoted a sizable portion of his 21-page address to what he pointed to as the strides of his school overhaul efforts. ''Our schools are getting safer,'' he declared, ''parents are now welcome partners in education; we're setting and enforcing standards; test scores are rising; and Chancellor Klein and his team are well on their way to creating the best public school system in the nation.''
 None of his opponents were willing to argue with a program to teach dropout students new skills or expand the programs for gifted and talented students.
 Chancellor Joel I. Klein's senior counselor for education policy, Michele Cahill, said in a conference call with reporters later in the afternoon that the vocational program would be devised to engage students most likely to not complete high school or to get an equivalency diploma. She acknowledged the difficulty in getting the most troubled students to meet state requirements of passing five Regents exams to get a regular diploma.
 She said the program would cost $14 million and serve 2,600 students in its first year. 
 By announcing the continuation of gifted and talented programs, Mr. Bloomberg was appealing to middle-class parents by allaying fears that he would eliminate or weaken them. By announcing an expansion to underserved areas, he was reaching out to the minority voters he will need for his re-election. 
 Mr. Ferrer, a Puerto Rican, would be likely to be a bigger threat among minority voters than was Mr. Bloomberg's opponent in 2001, Mark Green. A senior adviser to Mr. Bloomberg acknowledged yesterday that his speech was devised with an eye on them and middle-class voters.
 The mayor's address focused heavily on quality-of-life issues that helped ensure the re-election of the last Republican mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani. He announced a new system to help the Police Department keep track of crime patterns; he called on the City Council to move to enact a new noise code and unveiled a new initiative to reduce graffiti with 80 police officers. 
 And he pointed to statistics even his predecessor would envy: the fewest fire fatalities during any three-year period since the Fire Department began keeping such records in 1916, a 14 percent drop in crime from the already low levels of three years ago, and the fewest pedestrian and auto accident fatalities last year since the city began keeping track of them in 1910.
 He did not shy away from pushing his controversial plan for a new football stadium for the Jets on the Far West Side of Manhattan, part of a larger development plan. Declaring the city to be ''at the dawn of a major new era of construction and development,'' he said he was appointing a commission to make sure that ''all New Yorkers'' get a shot at the 230,000 new construction jobs he said his West Side plan would create. He said Representative Charles Rangel, who represents Harlem, would sit on the commission.
 Douglas A. Muzzio, professor of political science at Baruch College, said the mayor did what he had to do in the speech. ''This is an overly Democratic city, a liberal, blue city; he needs to talk to those folks,'' he said. ''He did it very explicitly today. Clearly it was targeted to Democrats and, more importantly, to liberal Democrats.''

HEADLINE: Bush Presses His Argument For Social Security Change

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
President Bush stepped up his campaign on Tuesday to sell Americans and a skeptical Congress on the need to overhaul Social Security by painting a dire picture of a bankrupt future for millions of young workers.
 ''If you're 20 years old, in your mid-20's, and you're beginning to work, I want you to think about a Social Security system that will be flat bust, bankrupt, unless the United States Congress has got the willingness to act now,'' Mr. Bush said at an event that the White House billed as a ''conversation on Social Security'' with ordinary citizens. 
 The president, who offered no new details on a White House proposal to allow workers to divert part of their Social Security payroll taxes into personal investment accounts, added, ''If we don't address the problem now, it will only get worse with time.'' 
 Mr. Bush said many in Congress -- including a number of Republicans -- did not have a proper sense of urgency about the issue. ''You know, the problem is that some in Congress don't see it as a problem,'' he said. ''They just kind of think that maybe things will be O.K.''
 Many Democrats and economists say that Mr. Bush is exaggerating the problem, and that Social Security could be fixed with modest tax increases and a cut in benefits. Even without changes, Mr. Bush's critics say, the system would be able to pay three-quarters of promised benefits four decades from now, when baby boomers have long retired. 
 Democratic leaders quickly stepped forward on Tuesday to challenge the president. Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the party's whip, accused Mr. Bush of ''fear mongering,'' and Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, a senior Democrat on the Social Security Subcommittee, said his party's priority should be to ''prevent the president from wrecking the bedrock of income security protection.''
 Tuesday's event, at the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium here, was reminiscent of an event in Mr. Bush's re-election campaign, when participants selected by the administration sat on stools near the president and made points that underscored White House policy.
 At the event, Sonya Stone, a chief financial officer at a financial consulting firm in Virginia and the former controller of the conservative Heritage Foundation, enthusiastically endorsed the president's position on Social Security. 
 ''I would very much like to see the current Social Security system improved with the establishment of personal accounts, so that families could harness the power of the capital markets to allow them to build a nest egg over the course of their lifetimes that could be passed on to their families,'' said Ms. Stone, who sat onstage with the president and five other participants. She said she was at the event as the divorced mother of three children who is worried about their future.
 Another participant, Scott Ballard, an ambulance company owner from Wenatchee, Wash., did not adhere as closely to the White House talking points. When Mr. Bush asked Mr. Ballard if his younger employees ever talked about Social Security, Mr. Ballard replied, ''Not really.''
 He quickly added, ''But I think if some of the changes that you are proposing are implemented, I think they will talk about it a lot more.''
 The event was part of an intensified White House campaign to promote Mr. Bush's Social Security proposals this month. Treasury Secretary John W. Snow has been selling the plan on Wall Street, and Vice President Dick Cheney and Joshua B. Bolten, the White House budget director, will give speeches on Social Security this week. N. Gregory Mankiw, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, will give a speech next Tuesday.
 Several organizations are also starting advertising and lobbying campaigns. A group supported by the National Association of Manufacturers, the Alliance for Worker Retirement Security, is running advertisements for Social Security overhaul on CNN and Fox News. AARP, the influential lobby for older Americans, is rallying opposition to Mr. Bush's plan and running newspaper advertisements opposed to it.

HEADLINE: Argentina Starting Drive To Emerge From Default

BYLINE: By TODD BENSON

 BODY:
Three years after declaring the biggest sovereign debt default in history, Argentina will begin a global roadshow today, hoping to persuade wary investors to accept a write-down on about $100 billion of holdings. Many analysts and lending officials say that Argentina may succeed.
 The campaign will start at the Economy Ministry in Buenos Aires, where Roberto Lavagna, the minister of economy and production, will outline the remaining details of what the Argentine government insists is its final offer to repay part of the defaulted debt. From there, officials will travel to the United States and Europe to push for the proposal with foreign bondholders, many of whom have already criticized the idea in outline form. 
 Under the terms of the proposed deal, Argentina would replace some $103 billion in defaulted debt and interest with up to $41.8 billion in new securities bearing lower interest rates and longer maturities. For bondholders -- who have not received anything on their investments since the end of 2001 -- that means potentially getting 25 cents to 30 cents on the dollar, according to most analysts' estimates. 
 In all, the government wants to swap 152 bonds in eight currencies for three new bonds in four currencies. Investors have until Feb. 25 to subscribe to the deal -- or ignore it.
 If accepted, the debt swap would seem to close a painful chapter in Argentine history when its economy and finances largely collapsed -- setting off a severe political crisis and pushing millions of Argentines into poverty.
 A successful exchange would also be a striking political victory for Mr. Lavagna, who has personally handled the restructuring process, and for President Nestor Kirchner.
 Since taking office in May 2003, the left-leaning Mr. Kirchner has been a tough antagonist to Argentina's creditors, arguing repeatedly that a larger payout would jeopardize the country's recovery and divert funds from much-needed social programs. 
 While that stance has been popular with Argentines, it has put President Kirchner at odds with bondholders and lenders like the International Monetary Fund, whose support Argentina needs if it is ever to regain access to global capital markets.
 Even though several groups of individual investors remain opposed to the deal, many analysts say that the government may have sufficiently worn down larger investors.
 ''Right now, the momentum is in favor of the Argentine authorities,'' said Paulo Vieira da Cunha, head of Latin America research at HSBC in New York. ''The probabilities of the deal being a success have increased considerably over the last few weeks, and mainly for reasons that don't have much to do with Argentina.''
 For one thing, he noted, Argentine debt prices have risen in recent months in line with other emerging-market bonds, and that has increased the potential value of the new securities the government would offer. When Argentina first presented the offer in June, most analysts valued it lower -- around 20 cents to the dollar.
 Also, by already spinning out the restructuring process for almost three years, battle fatigue may have set in. Bondholders who just six months ago denounced the proposal as unacceptable now say that they might be willing to endorse it if the government sweetens it just a bit.
 ''In my mind, all it takes is a modest improvement from the last terms that we saw, and the combination of fatigue and the external environment would cause the deal to be successful,'' said Michael Conelius, who manages the T. Rowe Price Emerging Markets Bond Fund and holds $80 million in Argentine debt. 
 It would be simple for Argentina to improve its offer, he said, if only because the initial offer was so low. 
 One way the government could improve the deal, some say, is by offering a cash payment upfront for some of the estimated $22.5 billion in interest that has accrued since the default. To be sure, economists broadly agree that Argentina can afford to pay more than it has offered. The economy has grown 8 percent annually for two years, leaving a windfall of tax revenue, some of which could be used to repay creditors, they say.
 But other bondholders, especially individuals, are so angered by what they see as Argentina's refusal to negotiate in good faith that they have pledged to sit out the debt swap in the hope of derailing the process, which they calculate would force the government to start all over again.
 By boycotting the swap, these bondholders seek to keep the acceptance rate among investors below 70 percent, a threshold that analysts say Argentina needs to surpass if the restructuring is to be considered a success. 
 But institutions like banks and funds hold about 60 percent of the debt, and are better able to take a loss than individual investors. This time they may agree to the terms offered, the analysts say.
 That notion offends small creditors. ''The person who accepts this is hostage to a government that can do whatever it wants,'' said Horacio Vazquez, treasurer of the Argentina Bondholders' Association in Buenos Aires, which says it represents more than 7,000 individual investors.
 ''We'd rather battle this in court,'' Mr. Vazquez added, noting that the terms of the debt swap also made it harder for bondholders to take the government to court.
 The Kirchner administration has shown no indication of backing down and insists that this is its last offer. This week, it began a flashy public relations campaign to promote the debt swap, taking out newspaper ads in Argentina and abroad.
 One ad includes a warning to any bondholder thinking of joining the boycott. ''Argentina,'' it says, ''isn't contemplating future payments on eligible bonds that don't enter the swap.''

PERSON: James Forman

HEADLINE: James Forman Dies at 76; Was Pioneer in Civil Rights

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
James Forman, a civil rights pioneer who brought a fiercely revolutionary vision and masterly organizational skills to virtually every major civil rights battleground in the 1960's, died on Monday at a hospice in Washington. He was 76.
 The cause was colon cancer, his son Chaka Esmond Fanon Forman told The Associated Press.
 As executive secretary of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee from 1961 to 1966, Mr. Forman was at the barricades of the civil rights movement from Selma to Birmingham to the Mississippi Delta to the March on Washington. Few outside the movement knew the extent to which he choreographed the now-legendary demonstrations and campaigns. 
 Known by its initials SNCC, pronounced ''snick,'' the group viewed itself as the shock troops of the civil rights movement. In many Southern towns, its field organizers were the first professional civil rights workers to arrive.
 Mr. Forman's job was to keep a haphazard organization of idealistic young leftists functioning. He raised money, paid the bills, mapped strategy and insisted on keeping records. 
 Mr. Forman set up a research department and a print shop in the group's office and made the decision to move the office to Jackson, Miss., in the summer of 1964, the ''freedom summer'' when volunteers went to Mississippi to campaign for voting rights for blacks. He and Bob Moses, another SNCC organizer, were the principal organizers of the operation.
 But Mr. Forman did not neglect larger intellectual and ideological issues. He encouraged his members to read Mao and other leftist writers, and organized a field trip to Africa for SNCC leaders in 1964. Almost eagerly, he put his body on the line.
 ''Every now and then, he got out there and got arrested and went to jail like the rest of us,'' Representative John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat who was chairman of the group from 1963 to 1966, said in an interview yesterday.
 Julian Bond, the chairman of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said, ''He really was the personality and the glue that held us all together.''
 Mr. Bond said Mr. Forman was ''extremely forceful'' without ''shouting and screaming.'' 
 Mr. Forman was called James Rufus when he was born in Chicago on Oct. 4, 1928. The man he thought was his father was James Rufus, a stockyard worker. Not until he was 14 did he learn that his biological father was Jackson Forman, a jitney driver in Chicago.
 Mr. Forman spent his early life on a farm in Mississippi with his grandparents. They worked their land with a mule-drawn plow. An aunt who was a schoolteacher, nurtured his early interest in books.
 Mr. Forman, in a 1996 interview with Emerge magazine, said that one day when he was 8 years old his uncle took him to town, where he failed to say, ''Yes, ma'am,'' to a sales clerk. Men in the store told the uncle that if he took young James to town again they would lynch the child.
 His grandmother assured the boy that she would protect him. ''Those kinds of things are things I grew up with,'' Mr. Forman said.
 The boy soon returned to Chicago where he sold copies of The Chicago Defender, a prominent black newspaper. He read with interest the articles about discrimination and lynching and also pored over the works of black intellectuals like W.E.B. DuBois and Booker T. Washington.
 Mr. Forman attended junior college and then joined the Air Force where he found segregated military bases and ''a dehumanizing machine which destroys thought and creativity in order to preserve the economic system and political myths of the United States,'' according to his autobiography, ''The Making of Black Revolutionaries'' (Macmillan, 1972).
 After his discharge, he attended the University of Southern California, where he was falsely accused of robbery and beaten in a police station. He was never charged.
 Traumatized, he returned to Chicago and graduated from Roosevelt University. In 1958, he got an assignment from The Defender to report on Northern civil rights workers in the South. After teaching in Chicago schools and studying French at Middlebury College, he was invited by a subcommittee of the Chicago branch of the Congress of Racial Equality to work with dispossessed tenant farmers in Tennessee.
 He joined SNCC as executive secretary in 1961, and soon traveled to Albany, Ga., as part of a ''freedom train.'' He and seven others were arrested for trying to challenge the segregated seating policy in Albany's Union Railway Terminal.
 He spoke out against people who wanted to invite the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to Albany, arguing that a monolithic leader hurt the development of what he called ''a people's movement.'' It was hardly his last criticism of Dr. King. In 1963 in Birmingham, he said Dr. King was being too conciliatory with local officials in order to curry favor with the Kennedy administration.
 Mr. Forman said Dr. King ''had proven to have feet of clay.'' Mr. Forman also opposed Dr. King's march from Selma to Montgomery to demand voting rights as insufficiently aggressive.
 But in 1963, when 200,000 demonstrators went to Washington to demand civil rights, Mr. Forman found himself in the odd position of trying to appease the Kennedy administration himself. The White House believed the fiery language in Mr. Lewis's speech could harm passage of its civil rights bill. Mr. Forman persuaded Mr. Lewis to remove a threat to someday march on Washington ''the way Sherman did'' through Georgia, a phrase thought to be less than felicitous to Southerner ears. But with the full endorsement of A. Philip Randolph, the chief organizer of the march, they kept another provocative phrase: ''We're involved in a serious revolution. The black masses are restless.'' 
 Mr. Forman resigned as executive secretary of SNCC in 1966, but continued as an administrator for another year. He then briefly served as minister of foreign affairs with the Black Panther Party.
 In 1969, Mr. Forman presented what he called the Black Manifesto at a conference in Detroit. It demanded that Protestant and Jewish organizations pay $500 million in reparations for crimes perpetrated by generations of blacks during slavery. He pressed the claim, part of a long and continuing legacy of such demands, at Riverside Church in Manhattan, where he dramatically interrupted services in May 1969.
 He then wrote and studied, earning a master's degree from Cornell and a doctorate from the Union Institute. He later was president of the Unemployment and Poverty Action Committee in Washington, where he was active in Democratic Party politics.
 In addition to his son Chaka, Mr. Forman, who was twice divorced, is survived by another son, James Robert Lumumba Forman, and a granddaughter.


CORRECTION-DATE: January 13, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An obituary of the civil rights leader James Forman yesterday misstated a word in describing his call, in 1969, for reparations to be paid by Protestant and Jewish groups for the crimes of slavery. Mr. Forman asked for $500 million for crimes perpetrated against generations of blacks, not ''by'' them.

HEADLINE: U.S. and Europe Agree to Handle Airline Industry Dispute Without W.T.O.

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER and PAUL MELLER; Elizabeth Becker reported from Washington for this article and Paul Meller from Brussels.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 

 BODY:
The United States and Europe backed away on Tuesday from suing each other over subsidies worth billions of dollars that each accuses the other of giving to its biggest civilian aircraft maker.
 The Bush administration and the European Union were poised to file formal complaints against each other at the World Trade Organization over support given to Boeing and Airbus. Such a case would have been the biggest ever heard by the group's dispute-settlement arm.
 Instead, with the profitability of an important industry at stake, they agreed to try to negotiate a new agreement over the next three months. 
 The deal was completed in a three-hour trans-Atlantic phone conference on Monday between the top trade negotiators of the sides, ahead of a Thursday deadline for filing the complaints. 
 The aim of the negotiations will be to end government subsidies to the aircraft industries and agree to ''fair market competition'' for the development and production of large civilian aircraft in the European Union and the United States, the agreement said. 
 ''There is much work to be done if we are to be successful in negotiating an ultimate agreement, but today does mark an important step in trying to end subsidies for large commercial aircraft,'' said Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative.
 Peter Mandelson, the top trade commissioner for the European Union, said at a news conference in Brussels that the agreement would ''strengthen the economic partnership between the E.U. and the U.S., which is vital to both of us.''
 The agreement was also timely. President Bush will visit Europe next month as part of his campaign to reach out to his European allies, and a trade dispute would have been unwelcome. ''This improves the atmosphere,'' said Ambassador John Bruton, the head of the European Union's delegation to the United States. ''There was a risk that if this had gone ahead, both the U.S. and the E.U. would have had egg on their faces.''
 The United States filed the initial suit against Europe at the W.T.O. last October after Mr. Bush promised to protect the United States aircraft industry from what he called unfair competition from Airbus.
 The administration was worried that if the talks drifted without resolution, Airbus would be able to develop a plane and receive loans worth billions of dollars that would be protected under a new agreement.
 The United States wants European countries to end direct loans to Airbus, which it says has been the beneficiary of as much as $40 billion in government aid through low-interest loans called launch loans.
 In their counterclaim, European trade officials said that the United States paid Boeing ''massive illegal subsidies that damage Airbus,'' like tax benefits and subsidized research and development.
 The Europeans filed a countersuit with the W.T.O. on the same day that the administration filed its suit.
 The dispute stems from a 1992 agreement that outlined how governments could support their airline industries.
 Talks to review that agreement broke down this year over how to define government subsidies and whether the goal was complete elimination of those subsidies.
 Since the original agreement, Airbus has surpassed Boeing as the world's leading supplier of commercial aircraft and the two companies are now poised to compete over a new generation of aircraft.
 Boeing, the nation's largest civil aircraft exporter, expressed relief about the new arrangement. 
 Harry C. Stonecipher, chief executive of Boeing, said in a statement that he hoped that the two sides would reach an agreement to end subsidies and ''establish much-needed balance in the commercial aircraft market.''
 The chief executives of the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, or EADS, Airbus's parent, and BAE Systems, which has a 20 percent stake, said in a statement that they welcomed the deal. 
 ''Today's decision is a very positive step forward, but much work remains to be done in order to ensure a level playing field,'' the statement said.
 The agreement that was announced on Tuesday gives the two sides three months to reach an agreement to end subsidies to large producers of civilian aircraft. During this period, the two trading partners agreed to refrain from pursuing the case at the W.T.O. or providing new subsidies.
 The agreement to back off from litigation was good news for the world's airlines, which are already reeling from price wars and not looking forward to paying higher prices for equipment as the case winds its way through the W.T.O.
 It also made sense for the companies themselves.
 ''This case should never have gone this far since both sides receive government subsidies but differently,'' said John Newhouse, who is writing a sequel to his book on the airline industry, ''The Sporty Game'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 1982).
 ''It's not in their interests at all to carry the dispute to where it would languish for years and eventually lead to the loss of all their government support.''
 Still, even on Tuesday, differences remained. Administration officials said that they were pleased that Europe had finally agreed that elimination of all subsidies was the ultimate goal. But Mr. Bruton of the European Union said that while this was the goal, subsidies might be allowed in the final agreement so long as they were fair and open.
 Scrapping all subsidies could also make it easier for new competitors to enter the market. The Canadian aircraft maker Bombardier, for example, is lobbying the Canadian government to help finance the development of a new range of large civilian aircraft to compete with those made by Boeing and Airbus.
 The deal reached on Tuesday does not affect current aid programs for Boeing, based in Chicago, or Airbus, which is based in Toulouse, France. 
 Billions of euros lent for the development and debut of Airbus's A380 555-seat super jumbo will not be renegotiated.
 But the temporary aid suspension rules out any loans or subsidies for new projects like the 7E7 Dreamliner from Boeing, as well as the A350 that Airbus may build to challenge it. 
 The 7E7 and the A350 are long-distance aircraft designed to fly to large and midsize airports; the A380 is intended to replace Boeing's 747 and will fly only to big airports.
 Both sides said that they hoped the talks would lead to a new agreement, but that if it did not, the case could still be brought before the W.T.O.

HEADLINE: Fodder for Reform's Cynics, and a Blot on Bipartisanship

BYLINE: By Samuel G. Freedman. 
E-mail: sgfreedman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
TWICE upon a time, or at least twice within the past dozen years, an American president issued the audacious promise to solve a seemingly intractable social problem. To do so, each of those presidents embraced some of the most cherished beliefs and policies of his partisan opposition. A coalition straddling the normal chasm in Congress passed the resulting legislation.
 The bills that those presidents signed into law were simultaneously utopian and humanly flawed. They promised absolute results. They lacked sufficient money to achieve them, at least in the view of many critics. Yet they served as a kind of enlightened shock therapy, challenging the pervasive, almost blithe acceptance of an entrenched underclass. 
 One of these measures was the welfare reform act that Bill Clinton called for during his first race for the White House, when he vowed to ''end welfare as we know it.'' That bit of intemperate oratory ultimately took the form of a Democratic president appropriating the traditionally conservative Republican view that welfare had become for too many poor people a permanent condition, and that a variety of financial incentives actually made low-wage work less attractive than the dole. As of last fall, eight years since the law was enacted, welfare rolls had shrunk by more than half.
 The other measure, years later, was the No Child Left Behind law that President Bush championed. It, too, represented in many ways a concession to ideological foes, because it acknowledged the longstanding premise of liberals that the quality of public schools varied drastically according to race and class. By uncoupling himself from the Republican orthodoxy that all failure is individual failure, that there is no such thing in America as structural inequality, President Bush's bill won the co-sponsorship of no less a liberal than Senator Edward M. Kennedy.
 How distant, how unreal, that fact seems now, three years almost to the date from the signing of the bill. With last week's report by USA Today that the federal Department of Education had paid the columnist and radio host Armstrong Williams $250,000 to promote No Child Left Behind, particularly among fellow African-Americans, the Bush administration has dealt the latest blow to what looked not so long ago like a welcome example of bipartisan common sense in a fiercely divisive era.
 ''The Education Department has done so many things to turn would-be allies into opponents,'' said Andrew J. Rotherham, the director of educational policy for the Progressive Policy Institute, a Washington research organization with a neoliberal Clintonian bent. ''This has created a golden opportunity for the law's critics.''
 Let us call the Williams contract by its true name: a bribe. And let us note that it was uncovered only several months after the Department of Education admitted to having poured $700,000 into creating public-relations television segments about the education law that were meant to be slipped on air as if they were genuine journalism.
 No one can benefit from these escapades in spin except for those on the right and left flanks who have reasons of their own for loathing No Child Left Behind -- the right because the law increases Washington's role in local education, and the left because the law dares to insist on standards and accountability based on standardized tests, the bete noire of progressive educators.
 No one loses more than the centrists and moderates, including the blacks Mr. Williams was supposed to persuade, who saw even in an imperfect law some essential elements of education reform. Chief among these is the law's requirement that schools separate test scores by race, which means shining the harsh light of accountability on the deficient performance of many schools in teaching minority pupils. And regardless of frequent complaints from Democrats during the last presidential campaign that the law remained billions of dollars below ''full funding,'' the federal government has increased aid to education during the Bush years (albeit partly because Congress increased the president's budget requests).
 William L. Taylor, a fixture in several major civil rights organizations, said he had listened with chagrin as Democratic critiques of No Child Left Behind, often echoing the platform of the National Education Association, began to sound increasingly like efforts to blunt its impact. The Armstrong Williams bribery report, he went on, only gives aid and comfort to those foes, though they lack a plausible alternative of their own. 
 ''It will increase the cynicism,'' said Mr. Taylor, who chairs the Citizens' Commission on Civil Rights, a private bipartisan group. ''The administration has simply shot itself in the foot, and for no good reason.'' 
 He continued, ''The thing that worries me most is that this law is only going to work if the people who are in the system -- teachers, administrators -- can become believers and see the positive side, rather than see it as a law that's out to get them.''
 The signs are not especially good. Polling last fall by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington research group that focuses on African-American issues, found that 23 percent of blacks rated No Child Left Behind as good or excellent, while 67 percent called it fair or poor. (The corresponding figures for all respondents, regardless of race, were 32 and 56.) The last time the center took on a survey on the welfare reform law, in comparison, fewer than one-fifth of blacks deemed it a failure.
 ''With the welfare law, there was evidence that it was a success,'' said David Bositis, a senior political analyst at the center. ''People aren't seeing the proof that No Child Left Behind is a success.''
 INDEED, the vaunted reform of public schools in Houston, which helped propel Rod Paige from superintendent there to federal secretary of education in Mr. Bush's first term, turned out to have been based on cooked books -- specifically the number of high school dropouts. 
 Both the $700,000 campaign of pseudojournalism and the payoff to Mr. Williams reflect at bottom an insecurity in the Bush administration about what real journalists will find in real schools. Which is again self-defeating, because, speaking from experience, I have seen salutary effects from No Child Left Behind in districts as disparate as Topeka, Kan., and Gainesville, Ga.
 ''If anything, this makes reporters more suspicious of No Child Left Behind than they were before,'' said Mary Jane Smetanka, president of the National Education Writers Association. ''I mean, if they have to bribe someone to promote it ----''
 She did not need to complete the sentence for her meaning to be apparent.

HEADLINE: Agency to Issue O'Hare Expansion Plan Early

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN; Gretchen Ruethling contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
The Federal Aviation Administration will issue a 5,000-page analysis of the city's plan to expand O'Hare International Airport on Thursday, a month ahead of schedule, a step that Mayor Richard M. Daley said ''moves us closer to accomplishing our goal of dramatically improving the nation's busiest airport.''
 The report, a draft environmental impact statement, comes amid pressure from the federal government to reduce flights at O'Hare, which had a record number of delays last year. Its early release could move up a final decision on the $15 billion project, now expected in September.
 ''It's very significant because, like anything else, I want things done quickly,'' Mayor Daley, who has made O'Hare a priority in his relationship with Washington, said at a news conference on Wednesday. ''When people talk about flying, they don't want to go to an airport that has all the delays. That's why it's really a national emergency.'' 
 The city contends that the proposed overhaul of O'Hare, which includes adding and reconfiguring runways, building two terminals and modernizing existing facilities, would slash weather-related delays by 95 percent and delays over all by 79 percent, saving passengers and carriers $750 million a year. An aviation agency study last fall estimated that delays would be cut to five minutes a flight -- down from a recent average of 16 to 26 minutes -- when the expansion was complete in 2013.
 Opponents say those are false promises. They say that the new runway configuration would limit use in bad weather and that the added capacity, to perhaps 1.15 million flights a year from 950,000 flights, is not worth the cost. Joseph Karaganis, a lawyer who represents suburbs and churches trying to block the plan, said the city faced other obstacles, including financing and court battles over cemeteries in the building zone.
 ''The F.A.A. cannot do that which is prohibited by law,'' Mr. Karaganis said. ''There's a phrase from a movie a few years ago: 'Show me the money,' '' he added. ''Daley is whistling Dixie on showing them the money. He doesn't have the money. The airlines don't have the money. The federal government doesn't. This is all a charade.''
 The City of Chicago has not applied for an F.A.A. grant to help pay for the expansion, but Mr. Daley and the director of the project, Rosemarie Andolino, expressed confidence on Wednesday that the airport could use bonds to underwrite much of the expense, despite the financial troubles of United Airlines. Another hurdle is getting Congressional approval to raise a per-ticket passenger service fee to $6 from $4.50. 
 While the mayor celebrated the early release of the report, Tony Molinaro, an aviation agency spokesman, said it should ''absolutely not'' be considered a green light for the project. Mr. Molinaro said the new schedule simply gave the agency more time to review public comments in the next two months, including testimony at public hearings Feb. 22-24. 
 ''The draft analysis is simply an analysis, it doesn't offer any decisions whatsoever, it doesn't even make a choice between their proposal and any other alternatives we're looking at,'' he said. ''It's environmental analysis in a macro-sense, not just air and water and animals. What does this mean for noise? What does this mean for air quality? What does this mean for economics in various suburbs? It's all those numbers that people have been waiting for.''
 The report, with an executive summary that alone runs 45 pages, is available for review at 33 public libraries in the Chicago area.

HEADLINE: City to Begin Building Luxury Ship Passenger Terminal in Brooklyn

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
The city will begin building a $30 million passenger terminal for luxury ships in Red Hook, Brooklyn, in February, officials said yesterday. 
 The terminal is part of a $200 million effort by the Bloomberg administration to make the city friendlier to the booming luxury cruise industry. The terminal, planned for Piers 11 and 12, is expected to open by the end of the year. 
 Community leaders in Red Hook have generally been receptive to the idea of a passenger ship terminal there. But the announcement was quickly followed by renewed concern that the terminal would result in the end of American Stevedoring, a shipping company that has been operating in Red Hook for the past decade and says it employs 600 people.
 The concern came after Kate Ascher, an executive vice president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, indicated during a City Council waterfront committee hearing yesterday that the city hoped eventually to open other Red Hook piers to the cruise industry, including those used by American Stevedoring, whose lease expires in 2007.
 David Yassky, the Brooklyn councilman who is the waterfront committee chairman, said he took Ms. Ascher to mean ''the city intends to shut down the Red Hook container terminal in 2007.'' A spokesman for Ms. Ascher, Michael Sherman, said that there was no plan to take over piers used by American Stevedoring and that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, not the city, held the company's lease anyway.
 Still, he added that the city was open to building other terminals on other piers eventually. And Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding, said in an interview that the city was certainly aiming to greatly expand the number of cruise ships that leave from here.
 ''It's a growing segment of the tourism industry,'' he said.
 In a joint released yesterday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki announced a five-year lease deal for the piers -- controlled by the state -- where the city plans to build the terminal. The city said it would pay the Port Authority roughly $560,000 a year for the space. It has an option to renew the lease for 10 more years. The city said the terminal would create at least 600 new jobs.
 Officials said that the Brooklyn terminal would be used by the Norwegian Cruise Line and the Carnival Corporation, but that they were hoping others would use it as well.

HEADLINE: Federal Reserve Is Monitoring Housing Prices, Official Says

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
A Federal Reserve governor, Edward M. Gramlich, said on Wednesday that the central bank was monitoring housing prices but that it did not consider them to be at levels warranting any specific policy action.
 Answering questions at a panel session on low-income housing organized by the Center for Economic and Policy Research, Mr. Gramlich said housing prices were not by themselves a topic that monetary policy makers at the Fed considered. 
 But he said the Fed was closely watching prices for homes.
 ''We are going to keep an eye on it,'' he said.
 He told the group that while it was possible that house prices were in a bubble, factors including a scarcity of land for building were among reasons explaining lofty prices.
 Mr. Gramlich said the Fed was aware of regional disparities in housing prices and noted, ''We are always looking for signs that some relative prices are out of line.''
 He also signaled some concern about the subprime mortgage market, which provides loans to people with poor credit. Subprime loans barely existed a decade ago and now make up about 25 percent of mortgages.
 ''This evolution of the subprime market has put a lot of people into homes while some of them are in trouble and may have been better renting,'' he said.
 ''There is a problem in the growth of mortgage brokers who don't have an incentive to make sure that a loan is repaid,'' he added. ''The incidence of mortgage brokers without a stake in the game is getting pretty big. That has created a significant problem: brokers not doing careful underwriting and much higher delinquencies and defaults.''
 Mr. Gramlich also said the Fed was concerned about the rising use of mortgages with low or no down payments. He said such loans were riskier than traditional ones and had caused concern among Fed economists.

HEADLINE: Sparring Begins Among Democrats for Mayor

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
The Democratic candidates for mayor have so far refrained from attacking one another, avoiding the internal squabbling that many critics say undermined the party in the 2001 mayoral race.
 But City Council Speaker Gifford Miller appears to have been considering a campaign strategy portraying Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president, as someone who did not stay around to fight for New Yorkers during the recession years after Sept. 11, and Representative Anthony D. Weiner as an ineffectual leader with few accomplishments in Congress. 
 This strategy is outlined in a detailed memo, under a section known as ''counterefforts.'' The memo has been quietly circulating among top advisers to Mr. Miller and was given to The New York Times by one of his supporters, who had seen the memo and wanted to highlight his record. It lays out a carefully staged, week-by-week strategy emphasizing Mr. Miller's legislative agenda and challenging the Bloomberg administration on education issues. 
 Aides to Mr. Miller, who declined to comment, said privately yesterday that they had favored the strategy as a way to differentiate the speaker from the other candidates. But last night they publicly tried to distance themselves from the memo. Brian Hardwick, a campaign manager for Mr. Miller, said: ''This memo does not reflect the plans for the campaign. The advice in this memo has been rejected.''
 The fact that Mr. Miller's campaign considered attacking fellow Democrats so early in the race has drawn criticism from opponents as well as from party loyalists and political consultants and professors. They fear that such an approach could lead to the kind of racial and ethnic squabbles that divided voters in the last mayoral election and helped clear the way for a Republican, Michael R. Bloomberg, to win in an overwhelmingly Democratic city.
 ''I don't think it's a good sign for the party, and I don't think it's a good sign for Gifford,'' said William B. Eimicke, a professor of public administration at Columbia University. He added that the strategy could potentially backfire on Mr. Miller because it might alienate voters and lead them to blame him for undermining the party, no matter who eventually wins the Democratic nomination. 
 In the 2001 mayoral race, Mr. Ferrer, a Puerto Rican who draws staunch support from Hispanic voters, was accused of running a campaign that was racially and ethnically divisive. Mr. Ferrer, in turn, countered that the campaign of his opponent in the primary runoff, Mark Green, engaged in racist tactics. In the end, neither man could unite the party, which went down to defeat in the general election.
 The memo for Mr. Miller's campaign called for it to focus on Mr. Ferrer, who is considered a formidable candidate, through efforts ''to generate coverage of his candidacy whenever possible to make the argument that 'Freddy did not stay and fight''' for the city over the last few years.
 Regarding the Weiner mayoral campaign, the memo said that another core message of Mr. Miller would be to ''look to raise questions whenever possible about Anthony's weak record of accomplishments.''
 ''Tag him as an ineffective leader,'' the memo said. 
 It did not specify whether Mr. Miller himself or his aides would convey those ideas, or how they would do that. The memo indicated that that approach would be part of an overall campaign strategy that would intensify after the speaker's annual address to the city early next month and lead up to his official announcement as a mayoral candidate.
 The memo does not address two other Democratic challengers for mayor: Charles Barron, a city councilman from Brooklyn, and C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president.
 Mr. Weiner countered yesterday that Mr. Miller had to resort to attacking his record because the speaker's record was so lacking. Mr. Weiner said he had secured millions of dollars in federal aid for New York to improve security and parks and even to combat an infestation of Asian longhorn beetles in Brooklyn and Queens.
 In contrast, Mr. Weiner said, Mr. Miller's legacy at the City Council had largely been ''to rubber-stamp'' some of Mayor Bloomberg's most controversial proposals, including the increase in property taxes in November 2002 (though Mr. Miller did negotiate a smaller tax increase than the mayor had initially proposed).
 ''It would be very difficult for Gifford to stand on his own here,'' Mr. Weiner said. ''So the law of political gravity dictates that he has to tear down those who are ahead of him.''
 When asked whether he planned to attack Mr. Miller in his campaign, Mr. Weiner responded that ''I come from Brooklyn and I've never backed down from a fight before.''
 Jen Bluestein, a spokeswoman for Mr. Ferrer, disputed the memo's strategy toward Mr. Ferrer. She said Mr. Ferrer had been working to help the poor and the disadvantaged in recent years as the president of the Drum Major Institute for Public Policy, a nonprofit group founded by supporters of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to promote social justice. 
 ''Fernando Ferrer is not concerned by or focused on other candidates' strategies or what they may say about him,'' Ms. Bluestein said. ''Mr. Ferrer is completely focused on providing an alternative vision for New York City, and providing real leadership to address the affordability crisis New York's families are facing: finding affordable housing, after-school programs for their kids, health care.''
 At least one Democratic politician who considered running for mayor, City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. has already decided against entering the race partly because of concerns about the possibility of another ethnically and racially divisive primary.

HEADLINE: China Goes Beyond Oil in Forging Ties to Persian Gulf

BYLINE: By BORZOU DARAGAHI

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
Lured by the world's largest oil reserves and some markets considered too risky by Western companies, China is quickly becoming a major economic player in the Persian Gulf, making deals in transportation and technology, showcasing its consumer goods and shoring up agreements to meet its enormous energy needs.
 ''The current state of business ties between China and the gulf states is definitely growing, with an interest from both sides to expand ties,'' said Christian Koch, program director at the Gulf Research Center, an independent institute based in the United Arab Emirates. ''Oil is certainly the most central aspect to the relations, but ties should not be seen exclusively through that prism.''
 Trade volume between China and the six rich countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman -- was expected to reach $20 billion in 2004, up from $16.9 billion in 2003, according to the National Bureau of Statistics in China. 
 Trade between China and Iran is expected to have totaled $7 billion in 2004, up from $5.6 billion in 2003, according to the Iran-China Chamber of Commerce, which was established in 2000. 
 China and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries began talks to try to strike a free trade agreement last summer.
 Middle East analysts say they have noticed increased business between Chinese officials and companies and their gulf counterparts. The increase has been ''in scale and scope,'' said John Calabrese, an editor at The Middle East Journal, a scholarly quarterly in Washington, who wrote his doctoral thesis on relations between China and the Middle East. The surge in wheeling and dealing hardly represents a triumph of free enterprise. The trade mostly amounts to state-owned companies in China and the gulf nations pairing up to get oil and natural gas to China, and state-owned Chinese consumer and technology companies exporting their wares to the gulf.
 Recently, Chinese symbols have begun appearing on the sandy dunes of the Middle East. Last month, for instance, officials in Dubai, the glittering city-state of the United Arab Emirates, opened the Dragon Mart, a 1.6-million-square-foot shopping mall built in the shape of a dragon and heralded as a showcase for Chinese products. China has been buying crude oil from anywhere in the world that sells it since 1993, when its explosive economic growth turned it into a net importer of oil. But in the last few years, analysts say, the country has realized it must vie more aggressively and have a greater physical presence in the region to gain access to the Middle East's diminishing reserves at a time of increasing competition for them. 
 ''They realize they can't just buy crude,'' Mr. Calabrese said in a telephone interview. ''They've got to play ball now in producer countries and develop refining capacity in the region.''
 And there was a lot of ball-playing last year. In one of the biggest deals of a busy year between China and the gulf, the China Petroleum and Chemical Corporation, known as Sinopec, signed an agreement in March with Saudi Aramco to spend $300 million to develop natural gas resources in Saudi Arabia near the Ghawar field.
 The deal raised eyebrows for its high risk and potentially low returns. But Colin Lothian, senior analyst for the Middle East at the energy consultant firm Wood MacKenzie in Edinburgh, said it put China in a good position for the future.
 ''It's a political deal,'' he said. ''It's about forming relations with Saudi Arabia in order to secure China's long-term energy needs so when they do come looking for crude they'll be viewed favorably.''
 Across the gulf in Iran, Sinopec agreed to buy 250 million tons of natural gas over 30 years, to jump-start the country's stalling natural gas industry. In exchange, Iran will export 150,000 barrels of crude a day to China after Sinopec has developed the Yadavaran oil field in a package deal worth $70 billion. 
 Zhuhai Zhenrong, a Chinese oil-trading firm, signed a 25-year natural gas deal in Iran last March worth $20 billion. And the China National Petroleum Corporation bought the Iranian subsidiary of Sheer Energy of Calgary, Alberta, giving it a 49 percent stake in the Masjed-i-Suleiman oil field, in a seven-year deal worth $121 million. 
 According to Amy Myers Jaffe, a fellow at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University in Houston, ''The Chinese companies have a policy of trying to find oil and gas deals where they don't have to compete with the U.S. oil companies.''
 ''They tend toward countries where the U.S. has sanctions like Sudan, Iran and Iraq,'' she added, in an e-mail message. 
 China has been active in Iraq as well, despite security concerns there, though it now imports no more than four million barrels of Iraqi oil a month. In September, Sinopec signed a $15 million deal to build oil storage operations in Basra, while China National Petroleum continues to make noises about a memorandum of understanding it received from Saddam Hussein to develop the Ahdab oil field in Iraq. 
 China has long had some ties to the Middle East, often marketing weapons to regimes that Washington abhorred as well as selling cheap consumer goods.
 In the 1980's, China's main exports to the Middle East were ''plastic fly swatters and Silkworm missiles,'' Mr. Calabrese, the scholar, said. ''Though it had an interest in penetrating the Middle East economically, it didn't have the ability.''
 China's nonpetroleum businesses in the gulf now go much deeper. FiberHome Communication Technology, a Chinese maker of equipment for fiber optic networks, won a contract to help build a broadband network in Iran, while the Hisense Electric Company, a state-owned television maker, has built a factory there. 
 Iran is also home to the first foreign assembly plant of the Chery Automobile Company, based in rural Anhui Province of China. Built last year, the plant is on track to turn out as many as 50,000 cars a year in partnership with an Iranian company, Sanabad Khodro Tus.
 The China North Industries Corporation, or Norinco, has signed a $680 million deal to build a line of Tehran's expanding subway system. Huawei Technologies, China's largest telecommunications equipment maker, won the contract to upgrade the broadband capacities of cellular networks in the United Arab Emirates, and a deal to build a G.S.M. network in Saudi Arabia. Also, the Sinoma International Engineering Company of Beijing won contracts last year worth $376 million to build cement plants in Saudi Arabia and the emirates. 
 Oil needs may also motivate such nonpetroleum deals, Mr. Lothian, the analyst, said. ''If you're showing willingness to invest in those areas,'' he said, ''it can only help in securing the oil supply.''
 Few experts say the Chinese can subvert the dominant economic position of the United States in the region, at least anytime soon. Trade between the United States and Saudi Arabia alone totaled $22 billion in 2003, up from $18 billion in 2002, according to reports by the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Washington. 
 Still, America's military and political dominance in the Middle East does not seem to bother the Chinese. Indeed, analysts said, Beijing seems happy to sit back and let Washington manage the region's myriad security and stability issues.

HEADLINE: Olympics, Italian Style, in Turin Next Year

BYLINE: By BILL PENNINGTON

DATELINE: TURIN, Italy 

 BODY:
Looming over the Piazza Castello, a vast square in Turin's heart where elaborate nightly medal presentations will be staged during the 2006 Winter Olympics, is a 100-foot-high castle incorporating Roman, Renaissance and Baroque architecture. Across nearly eight centuries of the city's history, layer upon layer was added to the Palazzo Madama, a simultaneous tribute to change and tradition. 
 A short walk from Piazza Castello, in another city square, two futuristic structures and a skating rink were recently built around a 130-year-old statue. Exhibits inside the structures educate local residents about the reformation of their graying Olympic city, while the rink, packed from lunchtime to midevening, enables the postindustrial populace to learn how to skate.
 On the outskirts of the city, a jagged facade of a soccer stadium commissioned by Benito Mussolini in 1932 is being restored under watchful eyes. 
 The new plate glass windows, by city mandate, had to match the original design, but the rooftop superstructure enveloping the old crumbling stone walls contains 44 skyboxes. On Feb. 10, 2006, Stadio Olimpic, site of the opening ceremony, will be the first showpiece of the 20th Winter Olympiad.
 The Winter Games, smaller and less urbane than its summer sister, will arrive in this out-of-the-way city in western Italy and its surrounding mountains in a little more than a year. After the agita of the Athens Olympics, and the judging and bribery scandals of the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City, the Olympics will turn to Turin for an odd mix of Old World solace and dynamism.
 The Olympic movement needs something old -- a simple, scandal-free Olympic Games -- and it needs something new -- an Olympic Games with sold-out arenas and a modern buzz.
 Turin, steeped in the layers of its 2,000-year history and attempting to transform itself once again, aims to be the place. It is the essence of Turin's Olympic mission.
 ''We have something to offer the identity and image of the Olympics, and that is an Olympic Games imbedded in the Italian culture,'' Valentino Castellani, president of the Turin Organizing Committee, said. ''Past Olympics may have been too focused on the athletic competition and not enough on a cultural Olympics. We want these Games to concentrate on participation and passion.
 ''We gather in our piazzas, our town squares, for events and we've tried to replicate the feel of an Italian piazza in our competition venues. Our medal ceremony will be in a piazza. The lesson of the Athens Games is that there was no place for people to socialize. Most of the local people were on vacation. At our Olympics, we want the holiday going on in the city.''
 In Turin, they have taken to calling these the Piazza Olympics, a tribute to speed skating, ski jumping, snowboarding and a certain elegant Italian silk style. If all goes as planned, these Olympics are supposed to make winter sports fans pause in the village and city squares to appreciate the mountains and the marble as much as the Olympic medals.
 ''To host fans from around the world, you have to make them feel welcome,'' said Silvia Tracchi, manager of the Olympic Stadium, which is adjacent to the new 12,000-seat ice hockey arena.
 The area surrounding these arenas is designed to be parkland, laid out like a Japanese garden, which it will become in the spring. Inside the main stadium, there will be no fence, railing or barrier separating the first row of 30,000 seats and the infield, the setting of the opening and closing ceremonies.
 ''Everyone should feel part of the celebration,'' Tracchi said.
 That the construction of the main stadium, and virtually every Olympic arena, appears on schedule may be more a cause for celebration, especially within the offices of the International Olympic Committee.
 ''The stadium will be done, as scheduled, by the end of September,'' Remo Mendolicchio, the head engineer of the project, said, standing in the rows of the refurbished grandstand. ''For sure. There is no doubt whatsoever. None.''
 Massimo Pianotti, the manager of the nearby ice hockey arena, supervised the bustle of two and three shifts of workers laboring on the same day and gave a similarly firm prediction with the same construction timetable. Several arenas have already been the site of competitions. The European figure skating championships will be held in the new figure skating arena on Jan. 24. A World Cup slalom was held in the mountain village of Sestriere last month and a World Cup ski jumping event will be staged in the adjacent town of Pragelato in mid-February.
 Some construction, like the speed skating oval and Olympic Village, will not be completed until the summer.
 ''But the construction does not have to be finalized right now, because the Olympics are not this year, they are next year,'' Gilbert Felli, the I.O.C.'s executive director of the Olympic Games, said. ''We don't foresee any problems with the construction; we are pleased with the progress. They are on schedule. Of course, as long as there is construction going on anywhere, we have to watch the pace.''
 Like the systemic renovation efforts going on throughout Turin -- construction workers are busy in every sector -- the creation of the Olympic competition sites has frequently recast existing structures for new uses. It is part of the Turin Olympic plan to use the city's historical resources, both for the local flavor they will provide and to keep the scope of the Olympic infrastructure understated.
 They did this so there would be fewer large, empty buildings in the post-Olympic period, and not coincidentally, fewer large buildings with swaths of empty seats during the Olympic Games 13 months from now.
 For example, the Palavela, the arena that will be host of the figure skating and newly popular short-track speed skating competitions, has a capacity of fewer than 9,000, which should not be hard to fill for any of the prime attractions. The decision on the arena's size was made before the 2004 Games, but when television cameras caught the unoccupied seats at many events in Athens, Turin officials felt especially satisfied with their choice of a smaller, cozier facility for the marquee event of the Winter Games.
 The Palavela is likely to be one of the landmarks of the Turin Games. Its outer shell, a giant cast-concrete structure weighing 35,000 tons and shaped like a three-point sail attached to the ground, was built in 1961 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the unification of Italy. The new figure skating arena was built up beneath the immense sail.
 The Olympic Village, the huge media and broadcast center, and the speed skating oval will take up part of the more than 21 million square feet of former industrial space being overhauled for Olympic use. 
 Most of that space comes from buildings that were once factories for Fiat, the auto company that in its heyday employed 130,000 people in the region and brought Turin a nickname: the Detroit of Italy. Fiat's presence in the city has waned in the last 20 years, and construction for the 2006 Games has helped bring new life to abandoned industrial wastelands.
 But for all their efforts to use space economically in the city, the Turin Olympic organizers could not bridge one significant geographic gap that will certainly define the 2006 Games. They could not move the mountains closer to the city.
 It is likely the Turin Olympics will be, in effect, two Olympics: city and mountain peaks. The Alpine and freestyle skiing, snowboarding, bobsled, luge, skeleton, ski jumping, biathlon and cross-country skiing will all be contested in six mountain locales.
 Ordinarily, these sites are not much more than a 90-minute drive from Turin. But during the Olympics next year, some people estimate the trip from Turin to Sestriere, site of most of the Alpine events, could take double the normal time, or more. There are highways to the foothills, but the roads from there go through twisting mountain passes and are often perched on narrow cliffs. These passageways will likely struggle to handle the high volume of official Olympic bus traffic.
 ''The transportation issue is going to be a difficult one,'' Felli of the I.O.C. said.
 The transportation problem begat another problem: accommodations in the mountains. Once the topography was understood, more of those expecting to participate in or cover the Olympics requested lodging in the mountains, outpacing Turin organizers' initial projections by several thousand hotel rooms.
 But an additional 2,000 rooms have been located and tourism officials say they will find hundreds more this winter. In some parts of the mountain region, organizers are going street by street to encourage owners of vacation houses in the various mountain villas to rent their homes during the Olympics.
 ''They have worked very hard to fill all the requests,'' Felli said. ''There may be some need for temporary lodging, but we will know more later this month.''
 The I.O.C. has been more focused on a familiar Olympic predicament: cost overruns. There has also been a particularly familiar Italian state of affairs, political squabbles.
 In November, Turin officials faced a $242 million budget shortfall and police officers arrived in the organizing committee's office to inspect financial records. Mario Pescante, a government undersecretary and an I.O.C. member, was appointed to serve as a new supervisor for the 2006 Olympics.
 Castellani, a former mayor of Turin, threatened to resign. Some Turin officials felt politicians from Rome were trying to take over the Games. After working out a power-sharing agreement with Pescante, Castellani remained in his post.
 ''We clarified that he is joining our team, not substituting it,'' Castellani said.
 Then, in December, the Turin Olympic committee announced that a combination of aid from the Italian government and corporate sponsorships would add as much as $200 million to the budget for the Games.
 ''We had to push on some issues in the fall, but the direction has changed positively,'' Felli said. ''The income in Italy will be secure. We're pretty safe there. There is some work to do, but they have the money to keep working.''
 There remains the question of whether all of Italy will support the Winter Olympics. As Castellani conceded, ''Sicily is far away and they are not much for snow.''
 But this is Turin's Olympics, its chance to put a new face on the 20th version of the Winter Games. Every Olympics, like layers of history, remakes the image of the Olympic movement in some way.
 The first foundation for the Palazzo Madama in the Piazza Castello, which will be home to 50 medal presentations next winter, was laid in 1276. 
 On a recent night, skateboarders mimicking the moves of Olympic snowboarders flipped their boards and leapt on the smooth marble in front of the palace. Spotlights trained on the castle cast the skateboarders' freestyling athletics in long shadows across the square, which was filled with a slow-moving, if animated, before-dinner crowd.
 Five blocks away, people from men in their 70's to toddlers formed a collective gaggle wobbling to skate around the new ceremonial rink. Standing next to a large official logo of the 2006 Turin Olympics, a line had formed waiting to test the experience.

HEADLINE: Saudi Court Orders Lashings for 15 Demonstrators

BYLINE: By HASSAN M. FATTAH

DATELINE: DUBAI, United Arab Emirates, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
In a rare public display, the Saudi government announced on Tuesday that a religious court had sentenced 15 demonstrators, including one woman, to public lashings and prison terms for taking part in demonstrations against the government. 
 The punishments were announced in the newspaper Okaz. Normally, such floggings are carried out in public but without prior notice. The fact that these floggings were announced was taken as an indication that the government wanted to make an example of the demonstrators. The demonstrators, members of the Movement for Islamic Reform in Arabia, were among a small crowd that took part in protests in Jidda in mid-December. Another demonstration took place in Riyadh at the same time. Government officials were not available for comment. 
 The religious Shariah court handed down sentences ranging from two to six months and 100 to 250 lashes. Under Saudi religious law, lashings are administered with a thin reed by a man holding a book under his arm, so that the arm cannot be raised above the shoulder. According to Saudi Arabia's English-language newspaper, Arab News, the state's prosecutor decried the sentences as being too lenient.
 Many people were surprised by the government's announcement of the sentences of flogging, which is seen as an ultimate humiliation and carries connotations of heresy. Dissidents are often jailed, said Khaled M. Batarfi, managing editor of Al Madina, a newspaper in Jidda, ''but this is much stronger and has this religious dimension of being punished for ethical crimes.'' 
 Many dissidents point out that the government recently encouraged demonstrations against terrorists. ''This means that demonstrations are not contrary to Islam,'' said a writer and dissident, Mansour al-Nogaidan. ''But in this demonstration, they were considered heathens, which is why they are getting flogged.''
 A London-based dissident, Saad al-Fagih, called for the Dec. 16 demonstrations, which advocated replacing the royal family with an elected leadership, an independent judiciary and a new constitution guided by Islamic law. Less than a few hundred people took part in the demonstrations, said Mr. Batarfi, who witnessed the protests in Jidda. Heavy security on the day of the planned protest -- especially in the capital, Riyadh -- helped thin the number of demonstrators, organizers say. 
 Saudi Arabia accuses Dr. Fagih of being a radical Islamist exploiting social and economic discontent in the kingdom. Last month, at the urging of the United States and the Saudi government, the United Nations placed Dr. Fagih on a list of those having connections with Al Qaeda.
 ''They have given us huge publicity and cleared us in the public eye,'' Dr. Fagih said from his home in London. ''A substantial part of the community believed that we were manufactured by Western intelligence, so now this is actually quite good for us.''

HEADLINE: Raising the curtain on the dynamics of pricing tickets for Broadway shows.

BYLINE: By Hal R. Varian. 
Hal R. Varian is a professor of business, economics and information management at the University of California, Berkeley.

 BODY:
EVERY night in New York, about 25,000 people, on average, attend Broadway shows.
 As avid theatergoers know, ticket prices have been rising inexorably. The top ticket price for Broadway shows has risen 31 percent since 1998. But the actual price paid has gone up by only 24 percent. 
 The difference is a result of discounting. Savvy fans know that there are deals available for even the most popular shows, with the most popular discounts being offered through coupons, two-for-one deals, special prices for students, and through the TKTS booth in Times Square.
 Why so much discounting? The value of a seat in a theater, like a seat on an airplane, is highly perishable. Once the show starts or the plane takes off, a seat is worth next to nothing. 
 In both industries, sellers use a variety of strategies to try to ensure that the seats are sold to those who are willing to pay the most.
 This phenomenon was examined recently by a Stanford economist, Phillip Leslie, in an article, ''Price Discrimination in Broadway Theater,'' published in the autumn 2004 issue of the RAND Journal of Economics.
 Mr. Leslie was able to collect detailed data on a 1996 Broadway play, ''Seven Guitars.'' Over 140,000 people saw this play, and they bought tickets in 17 price categories. Some price variation was due to the quality of the seats -- orchestra, mezzanine, balcony and so on -- while other price differences were a result of various forms of discounting.
 The combination of quality variation and discounts led to widely varying ticket prices. The average difference of two tickets chosen at random on a given night was about 40 percent of the average price. This is comparable to the price variation in airline tickets.
 The highest price, for full-price orchestra seats, was about $55, while the lowest-price balcony seats were about $17. The average price over all performances was about $36.
 The ticket promotions also varied over the 199 performances of the show. Targeted direct mail was used early on, while two-for-one tickets were not introduced until about halfway through the run.
 The tickets offered for sale at the TKTS booth in Times Square are typically orchestra seats, the best category of seats available. But the discounted tickets at TKTS tend to be the lower-quality orchestra seats. They sell at a fixed discount of 50 percent, but are offered only for performances that day.
 Mr. Leslie's goal was primarily to model the behavior of the theatergoer. The audience for Broadway shows is highly diverse. About 10 percent, according to a 1991 survey conducted by Broadway producers, had household incomes of $25,000 or $35,000 while an equal number had incomes over $150,000 (in 1990 dollars).
 The prices and discounting policy set by the producers of Broadway shows try to use this heterogeneity to get people to sort themselves by their willingness to pay for tickets.
 You probably will not see Donald Trump waiting in line at TKTS; presumably, those in his income class do not mind paying full price. But a lot of students, unemployed actors and tourists do use TKTS.
 Yes, it is inconvenient to wait in line at TKTS. But that is the point. If it weren't inconvenient, everyone would do it, and this would result in substantially lower revenues for Broadway shows.
 Mr. Leslie uses some advanced econometric techniques to estimate the values that different income groups put on the various categories of tickets. He finds that Broadway producers do a pretty good job, in general, at maximizing revenue. The average price set -- which is different than the average price paid -- was about $55. According to Mr. Leslie's estimates, the best price to maximize revenue would be about $60.
 Mr. Leslie was also able to examine what would happen if the producers changed the way tickets were sold. For example, suppose the producers moved to flat-rate pricing, where they sold every ticket at the same price. In this case, his model predicts that the average price set would be about $50.
 Mr. Leslie also looked at various possibilities involving the TKTS booth. He found that the current 50 percent discount is too low if the goal is to maximize revenue. He calculates that a 30 percent discount would raise revenue by about 7 percent, albeit at the cost of reducing attendance by about 1.6 percent.
 Of course, this estimate is based on data from only one show. 
 The availability of the TKTS booth stimulates attendance at dozens of shows. Even though any single show might wish for a lower discount and higher revenue, the overall industry could easily benefit from the low prices and the variety of choice offered by the Times Square booth.
 There are other variations in ticket pricing that could be considered. For example, rather than sell good orchestra seats at full price and not-so-good seats at half price at the TKTS booth, why not split these seats into two categories? It is difficult to estimate the impact of such a change with the data Mr. Leslie used, but theater owners might want to consider such an experiment.
 We are likely to see more and more goods and services sold using the same sort of differential pricing. As more and more transactions become computer-mediated, it becomes easier for sellers to collect data, to experiment with pricing and to analyze the results of those experiments.
 This, of course, makes life more complicated for us consumers. The flip side is that pricing variations make those good deals more likely.
 Last time I was in New York, I was pleased that I managed to get a ticket to ''The Producers'' for half price. It almost made up for the fact that I had to book my airline ticket two weeks in advance and stay over a Saturday night.

HEADLINE: Trade Deficit At New High, Reinforcing Risk to Dollar

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit soared to a monthly record of $60.3 billion in November, the Commerce Department reported on Wednesday. The figure confounded predictions that the deficit would diminish with the weakening of the dollar and an easing in the price of oil.
 Instead, the trade gap has created increased pressure for the dollar to drop even further.
 In New York trading on Wednesday, the dollar fell 1.1 percent against the euro and 0.9 percent against the Japanese yen. At $1.3271, the euro is not far from its record high of $1.3667, which it reached against the dollar on Dec. 30. The dollar fell to 102.35 yen, not far from a five-year low of 102.08 on Dec. 3. 
 The jump in the trade deficit showed a surprising weakening in exports across the board, from farm products to capital goods like aircraft and semiconductors. Exports decreased to $95.55 billion in November from $97.79 billion in October; imports increased to $155.84 billion from $153.79 billion. 
 The figures, released by the Commerce Department, showed that the deficit is on track to exceed $600 billion for 2004, up from $496.5 billion in 2003. With November's report, it has already reached $561 billion.
 Economists said that the trade deficit data was distressing and they contended that several things would have to change if the trend were to be reversed. First, they said that Americans would have to save more and that United States businesses must sell more goods and services overseas. In addition, they said that currency exchange rates needed to be adjusted, pointing in particular to China, whose currency, the yuan, is now linked to the dollar.
 But persuading trade partners to adjust their policies to improve the United States' trade imbalance will be difficult at best. These same countries are underwriting American debt by purchasing Treasury obligations. 
 The net debt position of the United States now stands at $2.4 trillion, a debt that is costing Americans roughly $333 a person a year in interest.
 ''A trade deficit of this magnitude is not good,'' said Richard DeKaser, chief economist at the National City Corporation. ''The problem is how do you tell these countries like China to change when they are funding the U.S. government. We'd like the Chinese to change their currency rate and at the same time continue to lend to us.''
 As usual, the largest trade deficit was with China: $16.6 billion in November. That was more than double the next largest, a $7.297 billion deficit with Canada and $7.285 billion with Japan. Still, those two increased in November by at least 24 percent.
 The Bush administration took a different view, maintaining that the deficit showed the strength of the United States economy, not its weakness, as many economists contended.
 Treasury Secretary John W. Snow said in a telephone interview that the deficit was a sign that the American economy ''is growing faster than those of our trading partners in the euro zone and in Japan.''
 ''The economy is growing, expanding, creating jobs and disposable income,'' Mr. Snow said, ''and that shows up in the demand for imports.''
 He blamed wealthy American trading partners for growing too slowly and failing to buy more American goods and services. And he underlined Washington's view that the Europeans and the Japanese had to expand their economies, a subject that he said would be discussed at a meeting in London in two weeks of the Group of 7 leading industrial nations.
 Some analysts argued that Mr. Snow's comments showed the administration was likely to do little to try to stop the dollar's decline 
 ''In reaction to today's release of record trade deficit figures,'' Peter D. Schiff, chief global strategist at Euro Pacific Capital, said in a message to clients, ''Treasury Secretary John Snow continued with his Rumpelstiltskin routine of characterizing disastrous economic news as if it were just the opposite.''
 European officials also disagreed with Mr. Snow's analysis, saying it was not evident that Europeans would buy more American goods even if their economies expanded by a percentage point to match that of the United States.
 Anthony Gooch, spokesman for the European Union in Washington, said there were many factors at play. 
 ''There are many reasons why the United States is running its trade deficit,'' he said, ''but if it produces American goods of quality and at a competitive price, they will sell themselves.. They always have and they always will.''
 Among the strongest American exports are capital goods like commercial aircraft and computer semiconductors, food and beverages, household appliances, industrial supplies, weapons, information technology and biotechnology. 
 The biggest import for the United States is oil. ''Nearly half the $4.3 billion jump in the deficit was due to a surge in the petroleum deficit, which should now have peaked,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, an economic analysis group.
 Americans are buying more consumer goods, like low-cost toys, household goods and clothing as well as luxuries like jewelry and premium wine. They are also buying planes, computers, and telecommunications equipment made abroad.
 Few economists said they saw any immediate sign that the trend would reverse. The main remedies that they had hoped would help stabilize the deficit -- lowering the value of the dollar and a fall in the price of oil -- had failed.
 ''We now have the Grand Canyon of trade deficits and we can't be certain it won't widen further, '' said Joel L. Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors. ''Even if foreign companies start raising prices, we could still keep buying their goods at higher prices.''
 David Greenlaw, economist at Morgan Stanley, said there was some truth in the administration's arguments that other nations needed to expand and buy more American goods. He also said China had to give up its fixed currency rate.
 ''If we keep heading in this direction,'' Mr. Greenlaw said, ''and I don't see any sign of a change soon, you're going to have to have a meaningful further shift in currency values, especially if China doesn't budge.''
 Mr. Gooch, of the European Union, noted that both the euro and the yen were bearing the brunt of the falling dollar and said that Europeans were worried that their products would become too expensive for sale in the United States.
 With this latest increase of 8 percent in the trade deficit, some economists warn that there could be a hard landing for the United States economy. ''The trade deficit is a crisis waiting to happen,'' said Robert E. Scott, senior international economist at the Economic Policy Institute here. ''We can't continue to borrow $650 billion from the rest of the world to finance our consumption.''
 But Mr. Shepherdson cautioned against too much pessimism. ''The underlying trend in the trade numbers is unfavorable, but the true rate of deterioration is nothing like as fast as the astonishing November data suggest,'' he wrote in a report on Wednesday. He predicted a ''hefty rebound'' in December but acknowledged that the trade deficit would continue to drag down American economic growth.

HEADLINE: Transit Officials Make the Rounds, Pushing a Plan to Improve Commuter Rail Service

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
An influential group of New York business leaders has thrown its weight behind a plan to build a $5 billion rail tunnel under the Hudson River that would bring commuters to a new train station at the foot of Macy's flagship store on 34th Street.
 The directors of the Partnership for New York City, concerned about relying on century-old infrastructure for getting their employees to work, decided late last year that the proposed tunnel should be a priority for government financing, said Kathryn S. Wylde, president and chief executive of the partnership. 
 Before that, Ms. Wylde said, the city's business leaders were not convinced that New York needed another hole in the ground.
 But after hearing from officials of New Jersey Transit as well as the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the partnership changed its list of priorities for 2005, saying that building the tunnel is as critical to the economy of New York as a new transit hub downtown and an extension of the No. 7 subway to the Far West Side, she said. 
 ''The commuter tunnels under the Hudson are a lifeline for hundreds of Manhattan businesses, both in terms of bringing employees in from New Jersey and in terms of their work forces moving back and forth between locations,'' Ms. Wylde said. She added that the group decided that ''a commuter rail tunnel into 34th Street would be a significant benefit to the New York economy and would provide an important service to maximize the value of the commercial development sites on the Far West Side.''
 Swaying the group, whose board includes the chairmen of American Express, J.P. Morgan Chase and Federated Department Stores, could give the tunnel plan a fighting chance in competing against a growing list of transportation projects. Drawing boards around the region are filled with multibillion-dollar ideas, including a rail tunnel from Lower Manhattan to Brooklyn and a freight-train tunnel under New York Harbor.
 ''We can't build them all at once,'' said Anthony R. Coscia, chairman of the Port Authority.
 Mr. Coscia said that the Hudson tunnel plan, also known as Access to the Region's Core, or ARC, ''should be the region's priority,'' and he pledged to advocate ''a significant contribution'' from his agency. Much of the money should come from the federal government, Mr. Coscia said, but local sources would have to provide at least $2 billion and the Port Authority and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority should be among them.
 Mr. Coscia and George D. Warrington, the executive director of New Jersey Transit, have rounded up support from politicians west of the Hudson, including New Jersey's acting governor, Richard J. Codey, and its two United States senators, Frank R. Lautenberg and Jon S. Corzine. Mr. Warrington has also been calling on business and community leaders in New York to pitch the unusual notion of letting an out-of-state agency like New Jersey Transit dig into Manhattan and build a train station under 34th Street, between Avenue of the Americas and Eighth Avenue.
 ''You can't play in their sandbox without a lot of consultation,'' Mr. Warrington said, sitting at the head of a conference table in the New Jersey Transit headquarters in downtown Newark. 
 New Jersey Transit operates trains that carry more than 40,000 commuters under the Hudson and into Pennsylvania Station each weekday morning. Three of every four new jobs in Manhattan are being filled by people who live across the river, Mr. Warrington said, but the commuter train system is almost at full capacity. In the decade it would take to build the tunnel, New Jersey Transit could run out of space on its trains and its platforms at Penn Station, he said.
 ''There really isn't an appreciation out there for how tenuous, how fragile, the entire system is,'' Mr. Warrington said.
 But he is working on that. With a PowerPoint presentation about the commuter crunch, he has ventured off his home turf to reach out to every organization that might help or hurt his cause. His tour made one of its first stops in a Macy's conference room in late September. There, Mr. Warrington and some of his top assistants offered an early glimpse of the station plan to representatives of the Midtown business community.
 ''We were shocked at how far along they were in their planning,'' said Daniel A. Biederman, president of the 34th Street Partnership. After hearing that the station could be built from below, with little disruption of activity at street level, the audience deemed it ''a clever plan,'' he said.
 As currently imagined, the station would be like a subway station with several platforms, directly below 34th Street, extending to just east of Seventh Avenue from Eighth Avenue. Commuters would be able to connect underground to Penn Station and several subway lines or ascend to the street near Macy's and Herald Square.
 It would effectively double the number of trains and passengers that could travel in from New Jersey and points north and west, and planners hope it will take many riders and drivers out of the buses and cars that clog the George Washington Bridge and the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels.
 In the last 10 years, New Jersey Transit has more than doubled the number of trains going into Manhattan during the morning rush, to 186 last year from 88 in 1994. But the existing tracks, in use since 1910, cannot accommodate any more, said Richard T. Roberts, New Jersey Transit's chief planner. Every weekend, one of the tracks in the existing tunnel, which runs to Penn Station from North Bergen, N.J., has to be shut down for maintenance, he said.
 The tunnel would yield economic benefits too, Mr. Roberts said. A study that the agency commissioned estimated the project could create 44,000 permanent jobs in the region and increase its economic output by more than $9 billion by 2025.
 Those numbers spurred the interest of the Partnership for New York City, said Ms. Wylde, who acknowledged the political hazards of backing the plan in the midst of a chess match among various city and state interests.
 ''For New York to support a New Jersey project is difficult because we're competing for scarce resources,'' Ms. Wylde said. ''We still see this primarily as a New Jersey initiative, but one that deserves regional support. We would urge New York and New Jersey to work together on the ARC project.''
 Mr. Coscia and Mr. Warrington still have work to do on that front. Charles A. Gargano, a vice chairman for the Port Authority, said last week that the tunnel and station ''could be a project of the future.''
 But, he added: ''It's certainly not in the immediate plans. We only have so many projects we can handle at one time. I'm not being negative, but we have to be realistic.''
 At the moment, Mr. Gargano has other transportation plans on his mind. He is leading the drive for the expansion of Penn Station into the James A. Farley Post Office across Eighth Avenue, a move that Mr. Warrington agrees is needed. Mr. Gargano is also pushing for one of Gov. George E. Pataki's favorite ideas -- digging a tunnel under the East River that would provide a direct rail link to the Wall Street area from Long Island and Kennedy International Airport.
 That project would cost $6 billion, and Mr. Pataki and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg are trying to ensure its future with $2 billion of unused federal tax credits that were earmarked to rebuild downtown after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack. They also expect to get $560 million for it from the Port Authority and another $400 million from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
 ''We will have almost $3 billion for this project,'' Mr. Gargano said. ''Right now, I don't see that for ARC.''

HEADLINE: Slump Ends in City, With No Jump Start From Wall Street

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
For the first time in 40 years, New York City is wrestling its way out of a recession without its traditional economic engine -- Wall Street employers -- leading the way. 
 Defying the expectations of many economists, real estate prices are soaring, commercial vacancy rates are down and more people are employed in the hospitality industry than in 2001, when jobs in that sector previously peaked.
 On the tourism front, the number of foreigners visiting New York has risen for the first time since 2001, thanks in part to a weak dollar. 
 The city's unemployment rate for November, the latest available, was its lowest since March 2000, and, more significant, civilian employment in the city rose 3.2 percent in the first 10 months of 2004. The region's ports are bustling, and in October, the subways had more daily riders than in any October in more than 30 years. 
 But in stark opposition to past recoveries, employment at financial service companies has remained almost flat since late 2001, when the bottom fell out after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 and the drop of Internet stocks.
 ''In past downturns, securities employment has turned up before everything else,'' said Jason Bram, a regional economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. ''It's very clear that in this case, unlike all others, Wall Street is lagging.'' 
 There is no doubt that New York's recovery continues to trail the rest of the nation's. Payroll growth rose nearly 1 percent last year, compared with 1.5 percent nationwide, said Mark M. Zandi, the chief economist for Economy.com., a research and consulting firm. States in the Southwest and Southeast are doing better still. For example, payroll growth in Florida was up 2.5 percent for the same period. 
 Since December 2000, the city has lost 205,700 jobs, of which 126,900 were lost since September 2001. Only 33,100 jobs were added in all of 2004, according to the comptroller's office. 
 The fact that the city's economic turnaround -- a plodding march that took New Yorkers through the effects of Sept. 11, property tax and transit fare increases and a fiscal crisis before winding slowly toward a period of crowded hotels and rising restaurant prices -- could happen without a Wall Street employment boom does not mean that the city has been weaned from its dependence on the financial services industry, economic experts say. 
 Indeed, salary bonuses generated by Wall Street traders and executives, which were estimated at $15.9 billion for 2004, have been largely responsible for the city's increased tax revenues this fiscal year.
 But this highly unusual turn may well signal a new era in the financial flexibility of a city freed somewhat from depending on Wall Street employment the way Nebraska depends on rain. 
 Though Wall Street will continue to be the most important of the city's economic sectors, the growth of other areas, fueled by the constant influx of new New Yorkers undaunted by the prospect of trying to make it here, appears to be providing some cushion.
 ''Wall Street will, for the foreseeable future, dominate in terms of income,'' Mr. Bram said. ''But the city has been able to grow without job growth on Wall Street. So when and if that industry does kick in, it would be like not having your most valuable player during the game and then having him come back in.''
 While economists and analysts anticipate some employment growth in the financial industry in the coming months, they say that the reshuffling of many lower-paying jobs -- moved in many cases from New Jersey to Florida to India, or eliminated through technology -- signals a cultural shift in the city's financial sector to one dominated by the most highly paid employees. 
 ''There is no doubt about the fact that the culture of Wall Street has changed as it relates to New York,'' said Richard X. Bove, a Wall Street analyst for Punk, Ziegel & Company. ''The firms are in magnificent condition. They have the contacts, the technology and the intellectual capital to dominate this business. The issue is, that doesn't mean the money is going to filter down to the middle-class guy who used to work in the back office. That guy once could make himself a large salary. He had options, he had stock, he had a fat pension. He is now replaced by a machine or an office in Bangalore, India.''
 Between January 2001 and August 2003, the city's financial sector lost 60,000 jobs, and it has recovered only 500 since, said Barbara Byrne Denham, an economist at the real estate services and investment management firm Jones Lang LaSalle, which analyzes data from the Department of Labor.
 During that same period, 70,200 jobs were lost in the category known as professional services -- accounting, law, advertising and other professions -- and only 17,400 have been added back. 
 Most of the 33,100 jobs that were added in New York in 2004 were in professional services, hospitality, retail and other fields, according to the comptroller's office. This job growth was fueled in part by the weak dollar, which is helping tourism, and the rebounding national economy, which is contributing to a growth in income and spending power. 
 Economists and analysts note that financial sector jobs have probably been creeping up in recent months, and will continue to do so this year. But several factors have contributed to the sluggish job growth. As with manufacturers decades ago, financial service companies have found ways to move many back-office functions to cheaper locations, or to mechanize them. 
 In addition, after Sept. 11, many Wall Street firms realized that having all of their operations centralized in Manhattan might be imprudent. Several banks and other investment firms have moved parts of their operations to New Jersey, and other firms have sent some functions out of the area altogether. Many companies that in the past began to hire in anticipation of a recovery felt victimized by the Internet bubble, and have become more wary of hiring too many workers too soon.
 ''Profit margins on trading and investment banking and everything have narrowed,'' Ms. Denham said.
 She added, ''Clearly the companies were feeling risk-averse.'' Ms. Denham noted that several firms have signed leases on millions of square feet of office space in Midtown and to a lesser degree in Lower Manhattan in recent months, which could signal job growth this year.
 ''Clearly they see a more optimistic horizon,'' she said.
 Ronnie Lowenstein, the director of the city's Independent Budget Office, a publicly funded agency, said it expected the city to add 46,800 jobs over the next year, including modest amounts in firms that populate the financial sector. ''We don't expect them to regain the 2000 level in this decade,'' Ms. Lowenstein said. ''But it is the first time in several years where we expect to see growth, even if it is only modest.''
 But other areas of the city are doing better than they have in three years. As of November, there were 269,000 people working in the city's hospitality industry, compared with the previous high of 265,000 in 2001.
 Hotel occupancy is hovering well over 80 percent now; in 2003 it averaged about 73 percent. The number of foreign visitors rose to 5.3 million in 2004, up from 4.81 million in 2003, but still far from the 6.8 million in 2000. ''I think we have more work to do, but we are very pleased,'' said Cristyne L. Nicholas, president of NYC & Company, the city's tourism office. 
 The average sales price of a Manhattan apartment in the last three months of 2004 was $1.04 million, or 15.3 percent above the average for the same quarter in 2003. Commercial real estate prices are equally buoyant, and in the first three quarters of 2004, the commercial vacancy rate in the city fell to 11.4 percent, compared with 12.5 percent in 2003, according to the city comptroller's office. The number of new building permits authorized rose 9.6 percent last year, the largest increase since 1998, that office found.
 ''The city is rebounding really well,'' said Robert Kurtter, who tracks the city's economy for Moody's Investors Service. ''It has not reached a pre-9/11 peak in terms of jobs. But I would suspect if you look at real estate values and vacancy rates, those may not be back to pre-9/11 levels, but property values have probably exceeded 9/11.''
 Immigration and other factors continue to push up the city's population, which in turns fuels the growth in housing prices. 
 The jobs that Wall Street has maintained are paying more than ever, filling the city's coffers with increased revenue from personal income taxes. ''We are seeing more wealth and income created in the jobs that are on Wall Street now,'' Mr. Zandi said. ''A job created in financial services today is much more highly compensated than one 10 years ago.''

HEADLINE: World Briefing Americas: Canada: Cull Weighed After New Mad Cow Case

BYLINE: By Colin Campbell (NYT)

 BODY:
Alberta's premier, Ralph Klein, left, said that a cull of older cattle may be necessary to manage the mad cow crisis in Canada, after two cows tested positive for the disease in the last 10 days. He offered no details as to how many animals might be culled, but the fact that such an action is being considered shows how seriously the industry is reacting to the outbreak and to the possibility that the United States might not reopen the border to imports of young Canadian cattle in March, as announced two weeks ago. The latest cow found to be infected was born months after restrictions on feed were put in place to prevent mad cow disease, raising new concerns about the the effectiveness of Canada's feed regulations.

HEADLINE: Lincoln Center Chairman Is to Resign

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
Bruce Crawford, who was brought in as Lincoln Center's chairman three years ago to be a stabilizing force in an institution roiled by infighting, will step down in June, he said in an interview yesterday.
 A search for a successor will begin immediately.
 ''I think the time is right, for Lincoln Center and for me,'' Mr. Crawford said. ''The biggest job at Lincoln Center these days is redevelopment. And redevelopment will be in a good place by the time I go.'' 
 When he assumed the post in June 2002, he said he would stay three to five years. In the interview in his office yesterday, Mr. Crawford, who turns 76 in March, said there was no significance to his leaving on the early side of that projection. ''I'm at a stage when I would like a lighter schedule,'' he said. 
 Throughout his time at Lincoln Center, he has also served as chairman of Omnicom Group, the marketing and communications conglomerate, a position he plans to retain. 
 Mr. Crawford's decision, to be formally announced today, comes in the midst of an ambitious fund-raising campaign for the first phase of Lincoln Center's major redevelopment plan: a $475 million overhaul of the institution's main artery, West 65th Street. 
 The plan, by Diller, Scofidio & Renfro, includes widening the street, installing new marquees and redesigning Alice Tully Hall, the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the Juilliard School. Work is to begin in 2006.
 Lincoln Center Inc., the center's parent organization, has committed itself to raising $320 million of the total cost -- the individual arts institutions involved in the plan are responsible for the rest -- and aims to have $200 million of that pledged by March. So far, Lincoln Center Inc. has raised about $66 million in private pledges and hopes to receive as much as $90 million from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs.
 ''I think it's quite doable,'' Mr. Crawford said of the plans. ''I'm not concerned.''
 The chairman of Lincoln Center Inc. oversees 12 constituent groups, ranging from the Metropolitan Opera to the Chamber Music Society. The position is unpaid and can be part time, although Mr. Crawford's predecessor, Beverly Sills, went to the office nearly every day. 
 The role has expanded along with that of Lincoln Center Inc. itself. Once primarily the landlord of the campus, Linc Inc., as it is commonly called, has become an active producer, presenting some 400 events a year under rubrics like Great Performers, the Lincoln Center Festival and Mostly Mozart. The redevelopment project has also forced Lincoln Center's chairman to play a more prominent role as a fund-raiser and as the public face of the institution.
 Mr. Crawford's planned departure leaves Lincoln Center looking for a new chairman just as the situation was beginning to become smoother at the organization, the country's largest performing arts center. The redevelopment -- first announced as a $1.5 billion plan in 1999 -- was hampered by clashes among the center's constituent groups, an economic downturn and turnover among senior executives.
 Mr. Crawford was appointed largely to address this turmoil. With an elder statesman's gravitas and a businessman's no-nonsense manner, he has been, by many accounts, a welcome antidote to the bickering and occasional backstabbing among the center's various arts groups. 
 Mr. Crawford was considered particularly suited to dealing with the mercurial Joseph Volpe, general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, who had stymied the redevelopment at key junctures because of his opposition to the plans. As a former president and general manager of the Met, Mr. Crawford has a long history with Mr. Volpe. Mr. Volpe has announced his own departure in 2006; he will be succeeded by Peter Gelb. 
 ''He's gotten everybody to focus on, not just the big picture, but the minutiae of what it takes to do this,'' said Kate D. Levin, the New York City cultural affairs commissioner. ''To make something that seemed so big and many-headed into a process that has obvious next steps and a sense of collegiality that is essential to getting it done.''
 Nevertheless, considerable hurdles to the redevelopment project remain, namely the redesign and capital campaign for Lincoln Center's South Campus. This area includes its largest and most influential arts groups: the Metropolitan Opera, the New York Philharmonic, the New York City Ballet and the New York City Opera.
 The Diller firm's designs for the South Campus -- including the fountain plaza and Damrosch Park -- are to be completed in about a week, Mr. Crawford said, adding that they would be considerably more modest than the plans for West 65th Street. 
 Also ahead is the renovation of Avery Fisher Hall. A design by the architect Norman Foster is expected in the next few weeks. The plan builds on the idea of extending the stage into the audience to improve acoustics, Mr. Crawford said. The hall's reconstruction is to be conducted in segments over a two- to three-year period, so that the orchestra can stay put during the renovation. 
 Other approaches, discarded as too costly, included gutting the hall and rebuilding it from scratch. A merger between the Philharmonic and Carnegie Hall fell through in 2003. 
 A final estimate for the Avery Fisher Hall project is still pending, Mr. Crawford said, adding that it would be lower than the initial projection of $300 million.
 Tan from a recent trip to Florida but nursing a slight cold, Mr. Crawford stressed yesterday that he would remain active in Lincoln Center until he leaves in June. He said he believed that the redevelopment was in good hands with Reynold Levy, Lincoln Center's president. Mr. Levy, who sat in on the interview, pointed to what Lincoln Center had accomplished under Mr. Crawford: an expansion of the board, the revitalization of the Mostly Mozart Festival, the expansion of the American Songbook series and the opening of Frederick P. Rose Hall, the new home for Jazz at Lincoln Center. ''I will miss him,'' Mr. Levy said. 
 It is too soon to speculate about who might succeed him, Mr. Crawford said yesterday. But the more obvious candidates include Frank A. Bennack Jr., the vice chairman of Lincoln Center's board, who heads the nominating committee, and Bruce Kovner, the chairman of the Juilliard School, who has been the prime mover behind the 65th Street project. Mr. Kovner is expected to contribute substantial sums of his own money to that renovation; he has already pledged $25 million toward the Juilliard portion.
 Other potential successors are Katherine G. Farley and Roy L. Furman, both members of the Lincoln Center board.
 Mr. Crawford, a devoted opera fan, said he planned to remain a trustee of the Met. He served as its president in 1984 and 1985, becoming its general manager afterward. He left for Omnicom in 1989. He was re-elected Met president in 1991 and served until May 1999, when he retired. 
 ''I found this a very challenging and at times frustrating endeavor,'' he said, ''but over all a very happy one.''

HEADLINE: Poker Itself Is the Winner, Along With the Grifters

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
God does not play dice with the universe, but Universal Studios is playing God with the dice.
 Gambling, and especially poker, has invaded almost every form of television. ''Las Vegas,'' the NBC drama about a Nevada casino, is just the prime-time tip of the iceberg. Celebrity poker, championship poker and casino-based reality shows abound on cable and broadcast networks. (A&E's ''Caesar's 24/7'' began this week, picking up where Fox's reality show ''Casino'' left off.) 
 So it stands to reason that ESPN, the sports cable network that covers the World Series of Poker with a hushed reverence once reserved for Wimbledon, would develop a drama about cardplayers. ''Tilt,'' which begins tonight, is a cable version of ''Las Vegas.'' But unlike the righteous security experts and floor supervisors who are the stars of the NBC drama, grifters and high rollers are the heroes of ESPN's drama. Networks cannot idealize gamblers in prime time any more than they could broadcast ''The Sopranos,'' but cable has no such inhibitions. 
 ''Tilt'' follows three young cardsharps who team up to take down the reigning king of poker, Don Everest, a mean, cool and corrupt card champion known as the Matador. He is played by Michael Madsen, whose granite face and smoky voice are familiar from ''Kill Bill Vol. 2.''
 ''The Matador'' rules Las Vegas, not just by skill but also by cheating. The three rookies are a kino card version of ''Mod Squad'': Miami, a beautiful blonde (Kristin Lehman); Eddie, a moody hunk (Eddie Cibrian); and Clark, a cool black man (Todd Williams III). The trio has a mysterious older backer who has a grudge against Everest; Everest is in league with a smooth-talking casino operator. 
 ''You didn't even look at your hand,'' a Midwestern rube exclaims when the Matador makes his play. ''I didn't have to,'' he replies silkily, ''cuz I saw you look at yours.'' 
 The atmospherics are more compelling than the plot. ''Tilt'' takes great pride in burrowing past the gaudy touristy slot machines and holiday theme buffets to bleak, gritty back-room poker games where players wear do-rags and pull handguns when the cards go wrong. 
 Two of its creators are David Levien and Brian Koppelman, the team that wrote ''Rounders,'' a 1998 movie about lowlife gamblers starring Matt Damon, and they have a great flair for the seamy, glitter-free underside of Las Vegas. 
 And that alone is appealing. The more the gaming industry tries to gild and mainstream its vices, the more connoisseurs veer toward the margins. ''What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas'' is a happy-talk ad slogan along the lines of GE's ''We bring good things to life'' -- strictly for amateurs. 
 And we have become a nation of poker professionals. Gambling has always been popular, despite the Puritans' ban on it or perhaps because of the ban. (Chance was considered the province of the Divine.) Even though more Americans are likely to die of clogged arteries in a day than of terrorist attacks in a decade, the world since Sept. 11 feels riskier. The lure of gambling is highest when the economy is so uncertain that people would rather spend than save. It's becoming a common personal finance strategy: biographies and how-to books about poker and gambling are piled up in bookstores the way investment guides like ''The Beardstown Ladies' Common-Sense Investment Guide: How We Beat the Stock Market -- and How You Can, Too,'' were in the late 1990's. At a time of deficit spending and talk of the privatization of Social Security, risk has never seemed safer, particularly when television keeps harping on the possibility of a spectacular payoff. 
 Casino gambling fits our contradictions: we are risk-averse lovers of danger (horror movies, Space Mountain, Outward Bound), a workaholic nation that exalts leisure and a deeply religious country that lets Mammon into the pews.
 And in a reality show culture, we are poker voyeurs: armchair gamblers. 
 And unlike so many cable shows that cater to the elusive male viewer (bass fishing, Nascar-racing and soon, no doubt, tobacco-spitting), poker is gender-blind entertainment. People talk to each other at the card table, and few other games so quickly expose the personality quirks of the players. Players are judged not just on how well they play but also on how gracefully they lose -- and the camera captures every tic and tell. That helps explain why ''Celebrity Poker'' has a strong following: even the suavest movie star can look foolish when bluffing against an inside straight.
 ''Tilt'' tries to restore some of the old-fashioned romance of gambling, a louche veneer that has been stripped off as television cameras invade the back rooms. (The winner of the 2004 World Series of Poker and its $5 million first prize was not named Amarillo Slim or Nick the Greek. It was Greg Raymer, 39, of Stonington, Conn., a patent lawyer for Pfizer Pharmaceuticals.)
 ''Tilt'' is not the ''Cincinnati Kid,'' but it creatively evokes an earlier era when gamblers were rogues, not chairmen of the Rotary Club.

HEADLINE: Rally in Semiconductor Issues Spreads to Broader Indexes

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks gained yesterday, aided by a rally in semiconductor shares after Intel said sales this quarter would beat analysts' estimates.
 The benchmark indexes erased earlier declines that followed disappointing earnings from United Parcel Service and an unexpected widening of the nation's trade deficit.
 ''The market's generally just a bit worried about earnings season, but I would look more at Intel's news,'' said Jessica Caie, who helps oversee $2 billion, including Intel shares, at Cohen Klingenstein & Marks in New York. Intel's forecast is ''indicative of other technology companies and of demand,'' she said. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 4.71 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,187.70. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 61.56 points, or 0.6 percent, to 10,617.78, and the Nasdaq composite index added 12.91 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,092.53. 
 Three stocks rose for every two that declined on the New York Stock Exchange. Some 1.5 billion shares changed hands on the Big Board, 3 percent more than the three-month average.
 Intel shares climbed 62 cents, to $23.16. The company said net income last quarter was 33 cents a share on sales of $9.6 billion. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial expected profit of 31 cents and $9.42 billion in sales, on average.
 An index of chip-related shares rose 1.8 percent, the biggest advance among the S.&P. 500's 24 industry groups.
 Applied Materials, the No.1 maker of semiconductor production equipment, rose 38 cents, to $16.53. Intel plans to spend at least $4.9 billion in 2005 on new plants and equipment, up from $3.8 billion in 2004. KLA-Tencor, which makes chip-inspection gear, gained $2.03, to $44.45.
 Some investors are bearish on the outlook for company earnings even after Intel's forecast.
 ''Does the strength of what you saw with Intel follow through across the board?'' said Kurt Brunner, who helps manage $1.9 billion at the Swarthmore Group in West Chester, Pa. ''I don't know that you can say that right now. People are just trying to get their feet back under them.''
 The Dow average is down 1.5 percent this year. Before the afternoon rally, it was about 50 points shy of wiping out its entire 2004 advance. The late-day rally also helped trim the S.&P. 500's decline this year to 2 percent. The benchmark slid 2.1 percent last week, its worst five-day start to a year since 1991.
 U.P.S. plunged $6.12, or 7.4 percent, to $77.18, for the steepest loss in the S.&P. 500. The company, which ranks No.1 in package delivery, said a drop in shipments helped cause fourth-quarter earnings to miss its forecast. Excluding a tax benefit, profit was at least 75 cents a share. On that basis, U.P.S. had forecast a range of 83 cents to 87 cents.
 FedEx, the nation's second-largest package-delivery company, fell 94 cents, to $94.47, even though it reaffirmed its forecast for the fiscal third quarter, after a ''strong'' holiday season.
 A government report showed the trade deficit grew to a record $60.3 billion in November as demand for oil and consumer goods drove imports higher. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News expected the deficit to narrow to $54 billion. The dollar had its biggest drop in five weeks against the euro after the Commerce Department report.
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note gained 1/32, to a price of 1004/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, dipped to 4.23 percent from 4.24 percent on Thursday.
 Here are the results of yesterday's auction of five-year notes:

HEADLINE: Beaches for the Svelte, Where the Calories Are Showing

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Jan. 6 

 BODY:
Fat Brazilians? In a body-conscious society whose gifts to global culture include the girl from Ipanema, the tanga bikini and Gisele Bundchen and other supermodels, the idea seems heretical. Yet a controversial government study released late last month confirms it: Brazil is experiencing an epidemic of obesity.
 According to the report, conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics and issued right as summer arrived and people began flocking to the beaches in skimpy clothing, just over 40 percent of Brazil's adult population is overweight. Overall, 1 adult in 10, or more than 10 million people, are obese, by international standards, compared with fewer than four million who were deemed to be undernourished. 
 President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva immediately disputed the findings. Since taking office two years ago this month, the left-leaning Workers' Party government that he leads has always maintained that hunger, not obesity, is Brazil's main social problem and, as a result, has made a Zero Hunger program the centerpiece of its health and public welfare agenda.
 ''Hunger isn't something to be measured by research,'' Mr. da Silva contended. ''Not everyone wants to recognize that they are going hungry. They are ashamed.''
 But the statistics show what nutritionists and doctors regard as undeniable proof of an alarming growth of obesity since the mid-1970's, when the survey was first done in its current form. As elsewhere around the world, the main culprits, they say, are an unbalanced diet and a sedentary lifestyle, with some variants that are particularly Brazilian.
 Brazilians have, for example, a pronounced sweet tooth, perhaps natural in a country that is the world's largest exporter of sugar. People routinely sprinkle sugar on naturally sweet fruits like pineapple or papaya, and it sometimes seems that half the mass of a cafezinho, the espresso coffee consumed everywhere in the country, is sugar, not liquid.
 ''Brazil and the United States are the countries that have the highest levels of consumption of sugar in the world, accounting for about 19 percent of calories,'' said Carlos Augusto Monteiro, a nutritionist at the University of Sao Paulo who was a consultant to the government study. ''Consumption of soft drinks, for example, has grown 400 percent in the last 30 years, and we think that could play an important role in Brazil's growing fatter.''
 In addition to incorporating increasing amounts of fatty, processed foods in recent years, the Brazilian diet is also unusually heavy in starches and other carbohydrates. A typical luncheon plate, especially in the countryside or in poor neighborhoods, will contain not only a small piece of meat and beans for protein but also rice, potatoes, pasta, bread and cassava too. 
 Like people in more economically developed countries, Brazilians also lead a more sedentary life these days. Between 1940 and 2000, Brazil's population, now 175 million, went from being 80 percent rural and 20 percent urban to 80 percent urban and 20 percent rural, which has resulted in a marked decrease in physical activity.
 Brazilian notions of what is considered beautiful or sexy may also be a factor in encouraging plumpness. Traditionally, the idealized feminine form here has been the ''guitar-shaped body,'' a woman with a slender bust and waist and an ample rear end.
 ''American men may focus on breasts, but the Brazilian man has always wanted something to grab on to,'' said Constanza Pascolatto, one of the country's leading commentators on issues of esthetics, fashion and beauty. ''Women were always being told, 'You have to eat or else you're going to look like a stick,' and were encouraged to be fleshy.''
 While that preference may still be strong, especially in rural areas and among the poor, the urban middle and upper classes seem to have succumbed to the global preference for slimness. Dr. Monteiro noted that in Sao Paulo there are now clinics to treat anorexia and bulimia, problems that barely existed 30 years ago but are appearing now because of the ''mixed messages that are being sent'' through the media about desirable body types.
 The poor, who the study found are the group most likely to be overweight, receive the same messages but do not have the money to explore other options. Jose Roberto Lucena, for example, is a street vendor here who stands 5 feet 7 inches tall, weighs 231 pounds and worries about his health but argues that he is doing the best he can raising a family on wages of less than $200 a month.
 ''I certainly can't afford to go to a gym, and though I know that vegetables are good for me, they are very expensive,'' he complained. ''My 5-year-old daughter is overweight too, and even after the doctor ordered her on a diet last month, it's been hard to get her to eat things like salad.''
 Some commentators here have suggested that Mr. da Silva's unwillingness to accept the study may stem in part from his personal history. As he never tires of reminding Brazilians and the foreign leaders he meets, he experienced hunger himself as a poor peasant child and can vividly recall the sensation of going to bed on an empty stomach.
 Today, though, Mr. da Silva is one of those Brazilians who struggles to keep his weight under control. With a mixture of sympathy and amusement, the national press has chronicled his efforts to limit his consumption of barbecue, beer and buchada, a fatty tripe dish native to his home region that is the bane of nutritionists.
 ''The truth is that Lula's hunger has not faded away,'' the columnist Arnaldo Bloch speculated recently in the Rio daily O Globo. ''As much as the president eats and drinks and eats and drinks, the hunger and thirst remain. It is a hunger and thirst that is ancestral, that returns to strike daily'' and which he, like others who were once poor, ''has never overcome.''

HEADLINE: Bloomberg From the Block

 BODY:
In a State of the City address this week that served as a kind of opening bell for his re-election campaign, Mayor Michael Bloomberg was lively, charming, persuasive and, at points, even tough. And he seemed right at home, even though he was not in Manhattan, but in the Bronx -- the borough of Jennifer Lopez, as he noted. When he spoke a little Spanish, the translation was less important than its real meaning. It was a brazen notice to a field of Democratic mayoral hopefuls in a decidedly Democratic town: be afraid -- be very afraid. 
 Mr. Bloomberg stressed the good news, of course, but he had quite a bit of it to stress. Crime has continued to go down since he inherited the city from the crime-fighting Rudolph Giuliani. Fire deaths are down, too, and even pedestrian and traffic fatalities are at new lows. The city is, over all, clean and safe despite four years of belt-tightening.
 If the speech had a downside, it was that it ignored the downsides of the city. While the mayor offered homeowners another round of $400 property tax rebates, there was no explanation of how the city could afford that with another multibillion-dollar budget shortfall upon it. Mr. Bloomberg proudly pointed out that unemployment in New York was now even with the national average, yet the numbers belie a larger picture in which the gap between the haves and the have-nots has sometimes seemed to approach Dickensian proportions. The current and future economic pain disproportionately affects the minorities the mayor needs to win over, and he made at least a start with proposals for housing and jobs programs to help lower-income New Yorkers. 
 ''Where once there was doubt,'' the mayor said, ''New Yorkers believe again.'' Mr. Bloomberg was talking about the city, but the observation could have been about himself. The mayor once prided himself on lacking political skills, but now he jokes about giving Randy Johnson advice on handling the press and comfortably scolds Washington for shortchanging the city on antiterrorism funds. For New York, the state of the campaign is in high gear.

HEADLINE: Pakistan's Army to Confront Nationalists in the Southwest

BYLINE: By SALMAN MASOOD

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Jan. 12 

 BODY:
Army troops have been sent to Pakistan's largest natural gas field, in southwestern Baluchistan, after attacks by Baluchi nationalists forced the authorities to close the plant, officials said Wednesday. Pakistan pledged tough action against the nationalists, who are demanding greater royalties for the gas extracted in their area.
 Speaking at a news conference in Islamabad, the capital, Interior Minister Aftab Ahmed Khan Sherpao said ''punitive action'' would be taken if the tribesmen did not halt their attacks on ''national assets.'' 
 At least eight people have died and several have been wounded since Friday in clashes between government forces and the nationalists. On Tuesday, the tribesmen stormed the plant and tried to take control, according to Pakistani officials. They were driven back after a fierce gun battle, but the attacks damaged high-pressure pipelines at the purification plant, which was closed for fear of leaks of poisonous gas. 
 Gas supplies to parts of the country, particularly industrial operations, were suspended as a result. Officials said the supplies would be restored in the next couple of days. 
 The Sui plant meets 22 percent of Pakistan's gas needs. 
 Baluchistan is the largest of Pakistan's four provinces, and is rich in mineral and natural resources. But it also has high illiteracy, unemployment and poverty, which have fueled grievances against the government. 
 A low-level insurgency, which has been simmering for years, has gained momentum in recent months. Baluchi tribesmen want a greater share of natural resources and oppose additional garrisons by the military, and have criticized the development of a giant port project in Gwadar, in the southwest.
 The violence poses a mounting challenge to President Pervez Musharraf, an important ally of Washington in fighting terror. 
 In a television interview on Tuesday, General Musharraf issued a stern warning to the nationalists: ''Don't push us. It's not the 70's, when you can hit and run, and hide in the mountains,'' he said, alluding to the military operation to quell a rebellion in Baluchistan in the 1970's. ''This time, you won't even know what hit you.''
 But official warnings seem to have little effect on the disgruntled tribesmen, who have continued their attacks across the province, on government installations and personnel. Low-intensity rockets have hit the provincial capital, Quetta, several times in the past six months. A deadly bomb attack there in December killed 11 and wounded 30, and according to Pakistani news reports. 
 In an apparently unrelated development on Wednesday, unidentified gunmen in Rajanpur, in southern Punjab, which borders Baluchistan, kidnapped 11 workers of the Water and Power Development Authority, the state-owned power company. Three engineers were among those taken captive. The cause of the kidnapping remained unclear, according to police officials.

HEADLINE: College Degree Still Pays, but It's Leveling Off

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Ever so gradually, the big payoff in wages from a college education is losing its steam, which calls into question the emphasis that the White House, under both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, has placed on a bachelor's degree as a sure-fire avenue to constantly rising incomes. 
 Men and women with four years of college earn nearly 45 percent more on average than those with only a high school diploma, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The spread is as high as it has ever been, but it has been stuck in the 45 percent range since the late 1990's, and through the 1990's it rose much more slowly than in the 1980's. 
 Although the payoff from a college education is leveling off, income inequality continues to grow. That suggested to some economists at the annual meeting last weekend of the American Economic Association that employers are making wage decisions on criteria that have little to do with the supply of and demand for educated workers. 
 The leveling off of the wage premium for a four-year college degree has lasted long enough to suggest that it is not just a pause in an otherwise constantly rising payoff for those with bachelor's degrees, but another significant shift in labor market dynamics. The payoff for a college education fell in the 1970's only to reverse course, rising sharply in the 1980's and then leveling off in the 1990's, even showing signs of beginning to fall in the current decade.
 ''We always knew that the return in wages to a college education fluctuates, but we forgot,'' said Cecilia E. Rouse, a Princeton University labor economist, ''and now we are being forced to remember.'' 
 The 1980's experience gave birth to the skills-mismatch thesis -- the view that millions of workers lacked the college training required for the increasingly high-tech jobs that the new economy generated. Out of that thinking came stepped-up federal spending on college scholarships, tuition tax credits and the like. That put the burden on individuals to get the necessary education, with the government playing a supporting role as financier. 
 The portion of the population with bachelor's degrees today is about 30 percent, not much above where it was in the 1980's. That limited supply of baccalaureates would suggest strong demand for them and a continual increase in the spread between what college graduates earn and what the much more numerous high school graduates earn. 
 The dynamics, however, do not work that way. For one thing, the wage spread between high school and college graduates is determined by what happens to each side of the equation. During the 1980's, high-school-educated blue-collar workers lost well-paying jobs by the hundreds of thousands as domestic manufacturers increasingly lost out to foreign competitors. As their incomes fell, the spread widened rapidly. 
 The wages of the high school educated did not begin to increase again until the late 1990's, when tight labor markets increased the demand for their services. Now, the incomes of the high school educated are rising almost as quickly as the incomes of the college educated, according to an analysis of wage data by the Economic Policy Institute. That brings into question how much value a college education adds.
 ''The obsession with education has become a mantra to avoid tough political choices,'' said Harley Shaiken, a labor economist at the University of California, Berkeley. While education is essential, Mr. Shaiken and other economists argue, it is not enough. They would put more of the burden on government to close the wage gap, through such additional steps as raising the minimum wage and strengthening the laws governing collective bargaining. 
 That argument may undervalue the advances that are being made in high school education, says Richard Murnane, a specialist in the economics of education at the Graduate School of Education at Harvard. He notes that many states now require high school seniors to pass ''exit exams'' to get their diplomas. 
 Because these exams require considerable proficiency in reading and mathematics, ''employers are beginning to see that high school graduates have more skills than they used to have,'' Mr. Murnane said. If college graduates ask for too much money, he said, employers may hire these high school graduates instead. 
 Another dynamic also undermines the value of a college degree, says David H. Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. While the college premium appears to be leveling off, the spread between the incomes of the highest-earning Americans and those in the middle expanded almost as fast in the 1990's as it did in the 1980's. 
 ''If I may speak somewhat loosely, there continues to be rising demand for people who have very strong cognitive, managerial and communications skills,'' Mr. Autor said. ''The vast middle, whether they are college educated or not, are not in that upper category of cognitive elite. The elite is college educated, but not all the college educated are those people.''
 The leveling off of the college premium came up in various panel presentations at the American Economic Association meeting in Philadelphia and in interviews with economists. One panel explored what Richard B. Freeman, a Harvard labor economist, described as the seemingly inexhaustible supply of immigrants with advanced college degrees who hold or seek jobs in America, depressing the demand for and the wages of all well-educated job seekers, immigrants and native Americans alike.
 Another study, presented by Robert G. Valletta, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, found that wage increases associated with computer use at work were ''relatively constant across educational categories'' from 1984 through 2003, favoring the college educated only from 1997 to 2001, the era of the dot-com boom. A third study, presented by Ms. Rouse and Lisa Barrow of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, found that the payoff from schooling was roughly the same across ethnic and racial groups -- rising in tandem in the 1980's and tending to level off in the 1990's. 
 Their study, they said, knocked down the view, held by some economists, that the return to education was higher ''in individuals who come from more advantaged families.'' The study also added to the documentation that the income return for schooling rose in the 1980's, adding roughly 10 percent to a worker's wage in 1990 for each year of education, up from 7 percent in 1980. Since 1990, however, the added value has remained at 10 percent.
 That puts Mr. Freeman of Harvard on the spot. He first made his name as a labor economist with the publication in 1976 of a book entitled ''The Overeducated American,'' which argued that the college wage premium, which was then falling, would continue to fall. His reasoning was that the demand for college-educated workers was being suppressed by the large number of educated baby boomers taking jobs, while the growth in exports was sustaining the demand for high-school-educated factory workers. All too soon, Mr. Freeman turned out to be dead wrong. 
 ''The only reason the payoff for a college degree went up in the 1980's was that there was a wonderful relative shift in the demand for educated workers,'' he said. ''But there is no rule of law that says demand for educated labor will always rise faster than the supply. It could go the other way.''

HEADLINE: 28 Religious Leaders Appeal to Bush for Special Envoy to Push for Mideast Peace

BYLINE: By The New York Times

 BODY:
The leaders of 28 major Christian, Muslim and Jewish groups have signed an appeal to President Bush urging him to appoint a special presidential envoy to work full time on peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.
 ''The timing is right, with the new Palestinian leadership and our president beginning his second term,'' one of the signers, Cardinal William Keeler, the archbishop of Baltimore, said yesterday. 
The religious leaders are scheduled to announce their appeal at a news conference in Washington today. 
 The signers represent groups that have sometimes been at odds over how to resolve the Middle East conflict. Besides Roman Catholics, they include Muslim and Jewish organizational heads, the top leaders of the Greek Orthodox, Methodist, Presbyterian, Episcopal and Lutheran Churches, the United Church of Christ and several evangelical Christian organizations. 
 Rabbi Paul Menitoff, executive vice president of the Central Conference of American Rabbis, a Reform group, said in an interview, ''The United States is still the only power that can exert the kind of influence that will be necessary to keep these negotiations on course.''
 The statement endorses a two-state solution, and calls for the Bush administration to negotiate a timetable and to take the lead in raising economic aid for the Palestinians. 
 ''In the name of religions we have killed each other,'' said Imam Yahya Hendi, the Muslim chaplain at Georgetown University, who signed the appeal to the president. ''Maybe it's about time in the name of the very same religions we bring about peace.''

HEADLINE: Bulletin: No W.M.D. Found

 BODY:
The world little noted, but at some point late last year the American search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq ended.
 We will, however, long remember the doomsday warnings from the Bush administration about mushroom clouds and sinister aluminum tubes; the breathless reports from TV correspondents when the invasion began, speculating on when the ''smoking gun'' would be unearthed; our own failures to deconstruct all the spin and faulty intelligence.
 The search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq may have been one of the greatest nonevents of the early 21st century, right up there with the failure of the world's computers to crash at the end of the last millennium. That Y2K scare at least brought us an updated Internet. Fear of the nonexistent W.M.D. brought us a war. 
 Even after most of the sites were searched, the places that had been identified in spy photos as sinister weapons-production sites had been shown to be chicken coops, and the scary reports about nuclear weapons ready to be detonated proved to be the fantasies of feckless intelligence analysts, die-hard supporters of the invasion insisted that something would turn up. This proves once again the difficulties of debunking hard-held convictions: Mr. Bush did such a good job selling the weapons-hunting nostrum that 40 percent of Americans recently said the weapons were there. 
 The fact that nothing was found does not absolutely, positively prove that there wasn't something there once, something that was disassembled and trucked over the border to Syria or buried in yet another Iraqi rose garden. But it's not the sort of possibility you'd want to fight a war over. What all our loss and pain and expense in the Iraqi invasion has actually proved is that the weapons inspections worked, that international sanctions -- deeply, deeply messy as they turned out to be -- worked, and that in the case of Saddam Hussein, the United Nations worked. Whatever the Hussein regime once had is gone because the international community insisted. It was all destroyed a decade ago, under world pressure. 
 This is not a lesson that many people in power in Washington are prepared to carry away, but it is what the national adventure in the reckless doctrine of preventive warfare has to teach us.
 The findings issued last fall by the Iraq Survey Group, which concluded that the W.M.D. threat did not exist in Iraq when Mr. Bush decided to go to war, will apparently stand as its final conclusions. The Washington Post reported that the leader of the search team, Charles Duelfer, is working on some additions that will be included when the report is published in book form, but quoted an intelligence official as saying there was ''no particular news'' in the extra material. The 1,200 military men and women who were assigned to his search team are now fighting Iraqi insurgents. We hope they succeed. If they do not, large swaths of Iraq could become a no man's land, where terrorists will be free to work on W.M.D. projects and United Nations weapons inspectors cannot go to thwart them.

HEADLINE: Europe's Ambitious Bank Picks a Bold Design

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
The European Central Bank, seeking a home worthy of its growing stature in the financial world, on Thursday awarded the design of its new headquarters here to a Viennese firm, Coop Himmelb(l)au, which proposed a bold pair of twisted towers linked by a soaring atrium.
 The design, selected from among three finalists after an 11-month competition, is the most ambitious and costly of the three. It will now undergo a further review to ''minimize costs,'' though the bank declined to give a budget figure or discuss how much the plans may have to be modified.
 Lucas Papademos, the bank's vice president, who headed the selection process, said the design ''reflects quite well the values of the E.C.B.'' 
 But that terse summary, offered at a news conference about interest rates, does not capture the drama of a competition that lured some of the biggest names in architecture and was caught up in politics as the city of Frankfurt pressured the bank to choose an eye-catching design.
 Design professionals were pleasantly surprised by the choice, saying that the bank's headquarters would be a landmark on Frankfurt's skyline -- perhaps even a powerful symbol of Europe's economic integration -- provided it was not watered down too much during the building process.
 ''It's quite amazing that they chose it, because there are several risks, both from a building point of view and an image point of view,'' said Hanno Rauterberg, architecture critic of Die Zeit, the German weekly.
 ''The bank's image is one of stability and solidity, but Coop Himmelb(l)au likes to say that good architecture has to burn,'' he said. ''It shows how over time, the avant-garde has gone mainstream.''
 Founded in 1968, Coop Himmelb(l)au -- the name translates roughly as Blue Sky Collaborative -- has designed museums in the Netherlands and in Akron, Ohio, and a customer delivery center for BMW in Munich. It is best known for an apartment tower in Vienna and an ultramodern cinema in Dresden.
 Despite the firm's self-consciously hip image, its managing partner, Wolf D. Prix, said he was confident that Coop Himmelb(l)au's design would prevail over the two rival, more conventional designs -- one by a German firm, the other a joint submission by German and Malaysian firms.
 ''Our design is not only functional, it is an emotional skyscraper,'' Mr. Prix said in a telephone interview from Vienna. ''It will be an icon for the European community in the new century.''
 For all its success as an economic venture, the European Union has yet to produce much memorable architecture. Its administrative offices in Brussels are housed in drab blocks. The bank's headquarters are in a leased Frankfurt tower that is lost next to its more swaggering neighbor, the Commerzbank tower, designed by the British architect Norman Foster.
 Frankfurt's leaders lobbied vigorously for the new design. They worried that the European Central Bank was leaning toward the second of the three finalists, a Berlin-based firm, ASP Schweger Assoziierte, for cost reasons. The bank has suffered losses recently because of the decline of the dollar against the euro.
 In an interview last fall, Frankfurt's director of planning, Edwin Schwarz, said the Coop Himmelb(l)au design would be a ''landmark, an eye-catcher, that would give the E.C.B. a worldwide image.'' City officials were not available for comment on Thursday.
 Mr. Prix disputed reports that the Himmelb(l)au design was much more expensive that the other two finalists, saying that notion was planted by rivals during the competition for the commission. German newspapers have reported that the building could cost up to 700 million euros ($924 million).
 Frankfurt has taken a keen interest in the project because it hopes it will revitalize the eastern side of the city. The bank will sit in a neglected industrial quarter, on the banks of the Main River. The centerpiece is a cavernous market hall, which was built in 1920 during the Weimar Republic.
 The bank is taking over the hall, known as the Grossmarkthalle, from the city, and it stipulated that the architecture firms integrate it into their designs for the headquarters. Coop Himmelb(l)au proposes to place a pair of twisted towers, 603 feet tall, in front of the market hall. They would be linked by a latticework of stairways, bridges, and hanging gardens -- all swathed in glass.
 Mr. Rauterberg said the design would symbolize the diversity of the European monetary union, which has 12 members and will grow to 25, with the entry of Poland and other Central European countries.
 The bank kept a tight lid on the selection process, which was narrowed to three finalists by a jury last February. The winner was chosen by the bank's 18 governors in their monthly meeting, where they also sifted through economic statistics and decided not to change Europe's interest rates. Mr. Papademos said he would offer more details about the project next week.
 Even Mr. Prix professed to know little about the next step. He was only told of his success in a call from the bank on Thursday afternoon. ''I have to admit that 11 months of waiting for a decision costs a lot of nerves,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Consumers Spent More In December

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
Retail spending rebounded sharply in December, the government reported Thursday, as American consumers confounded earlier expectations of a slowdown and spent vigorously through the holiday season.
 The Commerce Department reported that retail and food service sales picked up from a virtually flat November to show 1.2 percent growth last month -- pushing sales for 2004 to more than $4 trillion, 8 percent above their level in 2003.
 While the prolonged shopping spree has virtually eaten up consumers' savings, economists predicted that shoppers would nonetheless keep on spending through 2005. 
 ''Consumer spending is quite firm,'' said Jan Hatzius, senior United States economist at Goldman Sachs. ''If you go out several years, spending is going to slow a lot. But it is unlikely that this is going to happen quickly.'' 
 According to preliminary figures reported by the Commerce Department, sales of motor vehicles accounted for much of December's spending increase, rising 4.3 percent as customers responded to automakers' panoply of year-end financial incentives. Consumers bought cars and light trucks at the fastest pace in years.
 Americans did not limit their spending to cars. Furniture and home furnishing sales grew 2.2 percent in December, as a strong housing market continued to fuel home improvement purchases. Nor did they restrict their spending to stores: sales by nonstore retailers -- like catalogs and Internet merchants -- grew 1.9 percent. 
 Excluding purchases of cars and gasoline, overall sales increased 0.6 percent.
 ''We were pleasantly surprised by how sales performed through the holiday period,'' said Tracy Mullin, president and chief executive of the National Retail Federation in Washington. 
 In Tallahassee, Fla., Rick McAllister, who leads the retail federation of Florida, noted that not even the hurricanes that struck the state in the second half of 2004 stopped Floridians from buying. ''Even spending in places that were hit was up,'' he said. ''And in 2005 there's going to be a lot of consumer spending based on insurance reimbursements.'' 
 American consumer spending is one of the most resilient features of the world economy, growing since 1991, despite a recession three years ago. Consumers' main pillar of support has been low interest rates, which have fueled a relentless rise in housing prices. American families' net worth has risen from a recent trough in 2002 to a record of $46.7 trillion in the third quarter of last year. 
 Feeling on solid ground, consumers have taken advantage of cheap money to borrow. They have bought cars on credit and taken out home equity loans to refurbish their homes. In the third quarter, total household debt grew more than 9 percent. And the personal savings rate has plummeted to merely 0.3 percent of disposable income in November -- virtually nothing.
 Americans' insatiable appetite for stuff is essential to producers across the world. Consumer spending today amounts to 70 percent of the American economy. With domestic growth slowing in China and a strong euro damping growth in Europe, American consumers have become one of the world's last sources of spending -- pulling in imports at a record rate.
 Many economists point out that this arrangement, which requires the rest of the world to lend money to the United States so Americans can buy the rest of the world's products, must eventually come to an end, or the nation's foreign debt would mushroom beyond measure. 
 Interest rates are already rising. They may rise faster than expected if the fall in the dollar against the world's major currencies feeds through into higher inflation. As declining interest rates underpinned the unparalleled consumption of the last few years, rising interest rates are likely to put a damper on the spending spree. 
 Yet most economists say that consumer spending growth will not wane anytime soon, though it may encounter some headwinds. As the Federal Reserve continues to increase interest rates, and long-term bond yields rise, the higher cost of money will take some steam out of the housing market and make it more expensive for car companies to offer incentives like no-interest financing.
 But Richard Rippe, director of economic research at the Prudential Equity Group, said Americans had no incentive to curtail their spending substantially and start saving now. ''In the current environment, I don't expect consumers to substantially raise their savings rates,'' he said.
 If interest rates rise gradually, as most economists expect, an improving labor market and rising housing prices will continue to underpin spending, which should slow only moderately -- from just under 4 percent last year to about 3 percent in 2005, Mr. Rippe said.
 In other economic news, the Labor Department said yesterday that the number of people filing for first-time jobless benefits rose by 10,000 to a higher-than-expected 367,000 last week. The four-week average, which is less volatile, increased to 344,000, from 331,250.

HEADLINE: U.S. Panel Sees Iraq as Terror Training Area

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
The war in Iraq could provide an important training ground for terrorists, according to a government forecast that also says the key factors behind terrorism show no signs of abating over the next 15 years.
 The forecast, issued Thursday by the National Intelligence Council, describes a world in 2020 in which the United States remains the world's foremost power and political Islam remains a potent force. It describes the prospect of a terrorist attack using biological agents or, less likely, a nuclear device, as the greatest danger facing the United States. 
 ''A counterterrorism strategy that approaches the problem on multiple fronts offers the greatest chance of containing -- and ultimately reducing -- the terrorist threat,'' the report says. Beyond military force, the report advocates the promotion of education and political and economic development across the Muslim world. 
 The report, a consensus of American intelligence agencies, says that the rise of China and India will transform the geopolitical landscape and that forces including globalization will increase economic, political and cultural insecurity.
 In the former Soviet Union and in Southeast Asia, the report says, democratization may be partly reversed, but democracy could gain ground in the Middle East.
 The report also sketches alternative outcomes, including the prospect that a new Islamic religious leader could emerge in the Middle East with broad, transnational political authority, and the prospect that security measures intended to combat terrorism and weapons proliferation could lead to an assault on civil liberties, possibly introducing an Orwellian world.
 The discussion of the war in Iraq is limited to two paragraphs in the 119-page report, and its potential impact on terrorism is described only in general terms. But the report says that the war, as well as other possible conflicts, ''could provide recruitment, training grounds, technical skills and language proficiency for a new class of terrorists who are 'professionalized' and for whom political violence becomes an end in itself.'' 
 ''Even in the best of scenarios, there is a likelihood that jihadists not killed in Iraq will dissipate to various countries or sanctuaries,'' David Low, the National Intelligence Office for Transnational Threats, said in response to a question during a briefing on Thursday at Central Intelligence Agency headquarters.
 President Bush has described the war in Iraq as the central front in the campaign against terrorism, and he has said its role in attracting foreign fighters has had the beneficial effect of luring Islamic militants who might otherwise have plotted attacks against the United States. 
 The report says ''experienced survivors of the war in Iraq'' may supersede current leaders of Al Qaeda to become major players in international terrorism, a possibility neither Mr. Bush nor his top advisers have given prominence to.
 More broadly, the report says, ''we expect that by 2020 Al Qaeda will have been superseded by similarly inspired but more diffuse Islamic extremist groups, all of which will oppose the spread of many aspects of globalization into traditional Islamic societies.'' 
 The report says the danger of a conflict between great powers that could develop into total war is now less likely than at any time since 1900. 
 The United States ''will retain enormous advantages, playing a pivotal role across the broad range of issues -- economic, technological, political, and military -- that no other state will match by 2020.''
 But it says the likelihood that Iran, North Korea and possibly others may possess chemical, biological or nuclear weapons increased the threats to the United States.

HEADLINE: U.S. Tech Exports Slide, but Trash Sales Are Up

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
WHO says the United States cannot compete? Trade statistics may indicate the country is slipping in technology, but we're still tops in trash.
 In the late 1990's, those who counseled Americans not to be worried about the growing trade deficit pointed to ''advanced technology products'' -- a category tracked by the government that reflects what it calls leading-edge technologies. The United States was running a sizable trade surplus in that area, and shipments of those products were rising much more rapidly than other exports.
 All that has changed. In November, the United States had a record trade deficit of $5.8 billion in advanced technology products. For the most recent 12 months, the deficit was $36.9 billion, also a record. 
 And where is the strength? The trade surplus in what the government calls ''scrap and waste'' is rising. The 12-month total of $8.4 billion in such exports is up 31 percent from a year earlier. 
 ''What is effectively rubbish,'' said John Lonski, the chief economist of Moody's, ''serves as one of the U.S.'s fastest-growing export categories.''
 Compare the annual levels of exports in those two areas with those of 1999, and you get a stark picture. 
 Exports of advanced technology products are down 21 percent, while those of scrap and waste are up 135 percent. To some extent the technology decline reflects the bursting of the bubble, but imports of technology products are up 28 percent, indicating that it's not just the bubble at work.
 There are easy jokes to be made about trash and technology, but to make them is to risk overlooking the real importance of the deteriorating trade picture, which is that American competitiveness is waning rapidly, and the lower dollar has done nothing to correct that.
 ''Businesses and plants that might have weathered a few years of uncompetitive exchange rates are being permanently shut down,'' wrote Bob Prince of Bridgewater Associates, a money management and advisory firm, after the November trade numbers came out. 
 ''If prices adjusted more fluidly, these businesses and plants would recover once the dollar fell,'' he wrote.
 Instead, China, which runs the biggest trade surplus with the United States, does not allow its yuan to rise against the dollar, and other Asian countries have similar policies. 
 Mr. Prince calculates that the dollar is down only 5 percent against a basket of currencies weighted to reflect current American imports, although it is off 20 percent against a basket reflecting imports in 2000.
 The willingness of China to put its money into Treasury securities has served both to prevent changes in currency values and to hold down American interest rates, thus encouraging more American consumption and bigger trade deficits. In the words of Cathy E. Minehan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, ''Unavoidable economic logic suggests that eventually this situation will prove unsustainable.''
 But eventually can be a long time, and in Washington no one seems eager to deal with the root problems. The administration blames Europe and Japan for not growing rapidly enough, and thus wanting more American exports, which conveniently ignores questions of American competitiveness. Some other politicians hope to use the dismal trade numbers to gain support for protectionist legislation to benefit one industry or another. 
 It is not clear what will end this trend. For now, foreigners seem happy to lend Americans money -- largely through purchases of government and corporate bonds -- thus allowing Americans to buy things and keep the foreigners working. The Americans are happy to keep borrowing and buying. 
 But eventually there may be limits both to how much money foreigners will lend and to how much trash the United States can export.

HEADLINE: SUNY's Chief Refuses to Quit, Foiling a Deal

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON and PATRICK D. HEALY

 BODY:
In a bizarre twist, the chancellor of the State University of New York yesterday refused to go along with a plan for him to step down immediately in exchange for a $170,000 leave of absence -- surprising and irritating SUNY trustees as well as Gov. George E. Pataki and his aides, who together had hammered out the plan to overhaul SUNY's leadership.
 Mr. Pataki was reported by several advisers to be ''very unhappy'' after the chancellor, Robert L. King, withdrew his formal request for a six-month sabbatical, to have begun immediately. SUNY trustees had sought Mr. King's departure and Mr. Pataki had consented in hopes of seeing a smooth transition at the top of SUNY, not least because Mr. King is a friend and a Republican ally, advisers said. Instead, Mr. Pataki and the trustees came across as faltering on a personnel change and embarrassing Mr. King in the process, the aides said. 
 ''You have trustees who wanted King gone, a governor who agreed even though King was his friend, and yet King refuses to play ball and is staying for now,'' said a senior adviser to Mr. Pataki, who, along with other aides in the governor's office, spoke on the condition of anonymity out of sensitivity to the two men's relationship. ''No one here is happy with what's happened.''
 Two people close to SUNY said, however, that Mr. King had now agreed to leave the university in the next six months. The two people spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the issue.
 SUNY's trustees, who had grown unhappy over a host of internal management decisions, brokered a deal in recent weeks with their chancellor -- with Mr. Pataki's blessing -- that would allow for a graceful exit, they believed: a paid leave worth $170,000, equal to six months' salary and housing allowance. The leave would ultimately become a permanent departure, paving the way for a new chancellor who would enjoy more prestige in the academic world and greater enthusiasm from trustees.
 The plan fell apart after Mr. Pataki's aides criticized the chancellor in interviews and some Democratic leaders in Albany denounced the sabbatical as extravagant in light of the $600 annual tuition increase that Mr. King proposed only last week.
 Mr. King, appearing yesterday at a SUNY board meeting convened to consider the sabbatical, abruptly announced that he would remain in his job because of ''the challenges facing the university at this time.'' At a short news conference afterward, he said in response to a question that he had been ''stunned'' to learn of the criticisms of him, both by the substance and by the willingness of the governor's aides to make them.
 Asked if he and the governor were still friends, he said, ''Yes, absolutely.'' Asked if they were close friends, he said, ''I hope so.''
 According to the two people close to SUNY and advisers to Mr. Pataki, SUNY officials told the governor's staff last month that they wanted to make a leadership change at the 64-campus system.
 They said they needed someone who was more capable of making SUNY better known and respected in academic circles, and who was less of a political lightning rod in Albany. Both Pataki aides and Democratic and Republican legislators and staff said this week that Mr. King made enemies during his tenure as Mr. Pataki's budget director and as chancellor.
 Aides to Mr. Pataki also supported the idea of injecting fresh blood and ideas into the university, which Mr. Pataki credited in a speech last week for helping spur economic development in the state.
 The governor agreed that the time had come for his friend to leave SUNY's top job. Through aides, however, the governor made it clear to SUNY officials that he did not want to be seen as the prime mover behind Mr. King's departure, Mr. Pataki's advisers said. 
 ''The governor did not want to be involved or be seen as pushing people out, especially his friend for so long,'' a top adviser to Mr. Pataki said. 
 That departure, however, backfired yesterday when the chancellor announced that he did not want to take a leave now. Aides to the governor said they were caught by surprise, and the trustees appeared so, as well. The board had arranged for a special meeting to approve the sabbatical, and had also planned to approve the appointment of an interim chancellor.
 The board meeting convened late because the chancellor was meeting privately with SUNY's chairman, Thomas F. Egan. When they finally started, Mr. King read a short statement saying he planned to stay on, and then the meeting was adjourned.
 Mr. Egan declined to comment yesterday. Mr. Pataki released a statement saying that Mr. King ''has done an outstanding job as chancellor'' and added, ''I'm happy that he'll continue to provide his strong leadership.''
 The drama reflected the SUNY trustees' perception that while the system had made strides in some areas, as in attracting better students and stronger campus presidents, it was being hampered by the recurring political battles surrounding Mr. King.

Broadway

++ 'BROOKLYN THE MUSICAL' The enterprising design team of Mark Schoenfeld and Barri McPherson's aggressively maudlin show has come up with all sorts of ideas for converting everyday urban detritus into glamorous props and accessories. But the whole production, directed by Jeff Calhoun, is a kind of cultural recycling of discarded showbiz forms. An urban fairy tale told by street singers, ''Brooklyn'' is a throwback to the simple and whimsy-laden little musicals that blossomed off Broadway several decades ago. Try to imagine a sanitized ''Hair'' or a secular ''Godspell,'' with a helping of funky 70's disco, all filtered through the throat-stretching vocal pyrotechnics of ''American Idol.'' If that hybrid appeals to you, you're welcome to it. If not, you may find yourself feeling like a cranky commuter in a subway car, trapped with a perky team of harmonizers who say they just want to leave you with a smile on your face (1:45). Plymouth, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $96.25.
BEN BRANTLEY

+ 'LA CAGE AUX FOLLES' This alternately pallid and garish revival of the 1983 musical, with songs by Jerry Herman and a book by Harvey Fierstein, comes to life only when its cross-dressing chorus line takes over. This story of a gay couple who run a nightclub in St.-Tropez has two bright stars in Daniel Davis (as the manly part of the couple) and the wonderful but slightly miscast Gary Beach (as the womanly one). But Jerry Zaks's production often gives the impression of merely going through the motions, amiably but robotically, of its gag-laden, sentimental plot. What makes ''La Cage'' worth visiting for people whose diet does not include canned corn and packaged sugar is the plumed and spangled all-male ensemble of dancers. Each one emerges as a saucy individual, and as a team they have been choreographed by Jerry Mitchell with a feisty sense of humor and an athletic verve that should make Arnold Schwarzenegger think twice about using ''girly men'' as a pejorative term (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, between 45th and 46th Streets, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $100.
BRANTLEY

*+ 'DAME EDNA: BACK WITH A VENGEANCE!' It was nearly a half-century ago that Edna Everage (damehood still awaited her) was invented by a young Australian drama student named Barry Humphries, whose body the mauve-haired entertainer continues to take over for public appearances. Rather like the plant in ''The Little Shop of Horrors,'' the initially blowsy Edna kept becoming larger, glitzier and hungrier as she fed on the adulation of fans over the years. As her exhaustingly funny new show makes clear, that growth process hasn't stopped. When she last appeared on Broadway five years ago, she was merely a megastar, Dame Edna condescendingly tells her audience; now she is ''a glittering gigastar.'' In this singing, dancing shrine to herself, she proves it by brilliantly exploiting our culture's masochistic obsession with the rich and famous (2:30). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $67.50 to $87.50.
BRANTLEY

*+ 'DEMOCRACY' Michael Frayn's glorious study of the mutations of politics and the men who practice it, directed by Michael Blakemore, is one of those rare dramas that don't just dare to think big but that fully translate their high aspirations to the stage, with sharp style and thrilling clarity. For New York theatergoers who have endured the recent spate of dutiful revivals and misconceived star vehicles, watching this gripping study of the fraught glory years of Chancellor Willy Brandt of West Germany and the spy who loved him is like riding a wave after dog paddling in shallow waters (2:30). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $60 to $95.
BRANTLEY

+ 'GEM OF THE OCEAN' Theatergoers who have followed the work of August Wilson will find in this grandly evangelical drama a touchstone for his great cycle of plays chronicling the African-American experience in the 20th century. Set in 1904 in Pittsburgh, ''Gem'' is chronologically the first chapter in the cycle. As such, it is a swelling overture of things to come, a battle hymn for an inchoate republic of men and women just beginning to discover the price of freedom. It is also the least dramatically involving of Mr. Wilson's plays. Directed by Kenny Leon, with a strong cast led by Phylicia Rashad as a former slave who is more than 280 years old, ''Gem'' has passages of transporting beauty. But the metaphorical resonance of events and relationships eclipses dramatic immediacy here (2:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $86.
BRANTLEY

+++ 'PACIFIC OVERTURES' The director Amon Miyamoto dazzled New Yorkers at the Lincoln Center Festival two years ago with his visiting Japanese-language production of Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman's 1976 musical about American gunboat diplomacy as visited on 19th-century Japan. Now Mr. Miyamoto has revisited the show with an English-speaking, predominantly Asian-American cast, including B. D. Wong as the wryly omniscient narrator. The show's scenic and conceptual elements are essentially the same. including the amusing representation of Commodore Perry as a feral barbarian. But something has definitely been lost in the retranslation. The production does give beguiling due to Mr. Sondheim's silken, silvery score with orchestrations by Jonathan Tunick. But an uneasy tentativeness pervades the stage like a mist of perspiration (2:30). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $36.25 to $91.25.
BRANTLEY

+ 'THE RIVALS' Here she is at last! Dear old Mrs. Malaprop! The delightful Mrs. M, who, with a disdainful nod to Richard Brinsley Sheridan, misspoke her way to immortality in the pages of the Oxford English Dictionary. You know the word, you've probably made the mistake, and now, courtesy of the new Broadway revival of ''The Rivals,'' Sheridan's celebrated 1775 comedy of manners, you can finally make the acquaintance of the famous dame who generously bequeathed her name to a linguistic error. As personified by Dana Ivey, an actress of blissfully well-honed comic instincts, Mrs. Malaprop is indeed the main event in Mark Lamos's plumply upholstered production. But despite a largely zesty cast and a first-class production, the uncomfortable truth is Sheridan's comedy is one of those approved-and-certified classics that require unexpected reserves of patience and fortitude. Intermittently adorable, it is also, and not infrequently, tedious (2:30). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $85.
CHARLES ISHERWOOD

'700 SUNDAYS' This one-man memoir of a play by Billy Crystal, the beloved comic actor and perennial Oscar host, has been carefully set up to suggest a night of home movies with a buddy from your high school days who is equal parts attention-grabbing showoff and softhearted sweetie pie. In resurrecting the boy he was and the parents who made him the man he is, Mr. Crystal does indeed show flickering faded films from his childhood, projected onto the windows of a replica of the house on Long Island where he spent his youth. You would be hard-pressed to find a Broadway show with a more artfully calculated comfort factor. Directed by Des McAnuff, ''700 Sundays'' makes the characters in Neil Simon's domestic comedies look as tortured as figures out of Eugene O'Neill. And Mr. Crystal has a way of making even the ostensibly exotic feel as wholesome as apple blintzes (2:20). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200 Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $71.25 to $91.25; extremely limited.
BRANTLEY

*+++ 'TWELVE ANGRY MEN' This stage adaptation of Reginald Rose's celebrated television drama from 1954 (made into a film in 1957) suggests that sometimes the best way to present a fossil is just to polish it up and put it on display without disguise, annotation or apology. As a tidy portrait of clashing social attitudes in a jury room, it definitely creaks with age. But somehow the creaks begin to sound like soothing music, a siren song from a period of American drama when personalities were drawn in clean lines, the moral was unmistakable and the elements of a plot clicked together like a jigsaw puzzle without a single missing piece. Even those who like their theater hip and cerebral might want to lower their eyebrows for this 90-minute production. With an ensemble that includes Boyd Gaines, Philip Bosco, Mark Blum and Peter Friedman, this is a showcase for some of New York's finest character actors, who all manage to chew the scenery without smacking their lips (1:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $46.25 to $86.25.
BRANTLEY

+ 'WHOOPI' Whoopi Goldberg has been working in Hollywood for two decades now. Presumably she has met a lot of directors out there. But scan the program for Ms. Goldberg's solo show, which has returned to Broadway for a 20th-anniversary engagement, and you'll find none listed. This movie star and television personality has chosen to dispense with one in remounting her collection of monologues, just as she did when this career-igniting show made its debut on Broadway. Twenty years ago the omission could be forgiven as the boundless confidence of a bright young talent. At 49 Ms. Goldberg is an established performer and the oversight looks more like folly. Ms. Goldberg's most ardent fans may be happy to make the acquaintance of the half-dozen characters she portrays here. But even the funniest monologues would benefit from judicious editing (1:30). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 7 and 10 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $26.25 to $76.25.
ISHERWOOD

*+ 'WONDERFUL TOWN' (Tony winner for choreography). Standing on high heels that transform her into the tallest, most self-conscious figure onstage and mugging with the rubbery animation of Desilu-vintage Lucille Ball, Brooke Shields is game, gawky, a little unsteady and supremely likable as Ruth Sherwood, the man-scaring writer from Ohio who arrives in Manhattan in 1935 as green as a spring tomato. In this delicious revival of the 1953 musical, Ms. Shields is an unexpected and unpretentious delight, adding a goofy sweetness to a production whose charms have only mellowed since it opened last fall. No, she doesn't rival the impeccable polish of her predecessor, Donna Murphy. But Ms. Shields appealingly emphasizes the inner naif of a character whose worldly sophistication keeps slipping off like an ill-fitting cocktail hat. Leonard Bernstein's happiest score is played as ravishingly as ever by the onstage orchestra. And the crackerjack supporting cast includes the appealingly relaxed Gregg Edelman and the honey-voiced Jennifer Hope Wills, as Ruth's luscious sister, Eileen (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $51 and $101.

Off Broadway

* 'DOUBT, A PARABLE' This tight, absorbing and expertly acted play by John Patrick Shanley is far more complex than surface descriptions might suggest. Set in the Bronx in 1964, it is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's balance of conflicting viewpoints, its austere institutional setting and its sensational front-page subject at first bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas of truth and falsehood that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions. ''Doubt'' hews closely to its reassuringly sturdy, familiar form, the better to explore aspects of thought and personality that are anything but solid. And under the eloquently reserved direction of Doug Hughes, Ms. Jones and Mr. O'Byrne, both superb, find startling precision in ambiguity (1:30). Manhattan Theater Club, at New York City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $60.
BRANTLEY

'FAT PIG' Neil LaBute's latest work is on one level yet another demonstration that men are paragons of bad faith and cowardice, a judgmental tradition that this writer established with his screenplay for ''In the Company of Men.'' Yet ''Fat Pig,'' directed by Jo Bonney, is also the most emotionally engaging and unsettling of Mr. LaBute's plays since ''Bash'' five years ago. A show that might have been merely a point-proving exercise is immeasurably enriched by Mr. LaBute's empathy and by the skill and honesty of Jeremey Piven (of ''The Entourage'' on HBO) as a charming rising executive, and Ashlie Atkinson, the overweight woman he falls for. Andrew McCarthy and Keri Russell (late of ''Felicity'') round out the taut ensemble (1:40). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. Mondays and Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2:30 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $50.
BRANTLEY

*++ 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' Gerard Alessandrini, the writer and creator of the 22-year-old ''Forbidden Broadway'' series of satirical revues, would seem to be as steamed-up and homicidal as Dirty Harry in a den of crooked cops. This means he is in particularly good form. The New York theater's favorite practitioner of tough love has put on the brass knuckles for this round. The production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars (Patti LuPone, Hugh Jackman). But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as Mr. Alessandrini's lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). Douglas Fairbanks Theater, 432 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Mondays, Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays at 8:15 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2:30 p.m.; Saturdays at 4 p.m.; Sundays at 3:30 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $49.50 to $57.
BRANTLEY

+ 'JEWTOPIA' In a word, oy. Actually, even that small but spectacularly useful Yiddish word, with its infinite capacity for inflection, won't suffice to register the proper dismay at this slapdash, feeble-witted comedy. Written by and starring Bryan Fogel and Sam Wolfson, the cheerfully vulgar ''Jewtopia'' is aimed squarely at Jewish audiences not above indulging in a little lowbrow ribbing of their common ground. Make that a lot of lowbrow ribbing, most of it is about as fresh as a kugel from last year's Seder. Mr. Fogel and Mr. Wolfson flail away at hoary old stereotypes with a lack of ingenuity and a coarseness that are as numbing as they are dispiriting. The director John Tillinger, hired to polish the production for its New York engagement (it ran for more than a year in Los Angeles), has done little to tame its tacky excesses or shore up its slipshod construction (2:00). Westside Theater (Downstairs), 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $59.50 for Tuesdays through Thursdays; $65 for Fridays through Sundays.
ISHERWOOD

*+ 'NINE PARTS OF DESIRE' The voices are a study in contrasts: vivid and subdued, sophisticated and naive, seductive and standoffish. But they cohere to form a powerful collective portrait of suffering and endurance in Heather Raffo's impassioned theatrical documentary about the lives of contemporary Iraqi women. A solo piece written and performed by Ms. Raffo, an actress of Iraqi and American heritage, the play is a welcome reminder that the costs of tyranny and violent conflict are borne not by some amorphous, insentient collective population but by individuals, in this case women whose lives have been frayed and fractured, sometimes beyond repair, by the tortured history of their country (1:30). Manhattan Ensemble Theater, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55; limited number of $20 student rush tickets available at the box office one hour before the show.
ISHERWOOD

* 'A NUMBER' Since the 1970's, Caryl Churchill has produced studies of a world quaking under constant siege in which style somehow always uniquely mirrors content. In this stunning, elliptical play about a father's experiment with genetic engineering, this invaluable dramatist considers a threat to the very cornerstone of Western civilization since the Renaissance: the idea of human individuality, a subject she manages to probe in depth in a mere 62 minutes of spartan sentences and silences. Every word, gesture and pause in this dramatic fugue for two actors -- meticulously directed by James MacDonald and performed by Sam Shepard (yep, that one) and Dallas Roberts -- sets off echoes of multiple meaning. Beginning Tuesday, Arliss Howard replaces Mr. Shepard. The play trenchantly makes the point that we no longer have the apparatus, verbal or psychological, to accommodate the changes in a time when science is moving faster than society. It is hard to think of another contemporary playwright who combines such economy of means and breadth of imagination (1:05). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 and 7 p.m. Tickets: $65.
BRANTLEY

*+ 'THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE' Oh, spare a tear for dear old Gilbert and Sullivan! Too wordy to sit comfortably in the opera house, too quaint and old-fashioned for Broadway. Oh, bother not. They're doing just fine, thank you, as the prized property of devoted fans the world over. The New York Gilbert & Sullivan Players have been tending the legacy with loving care for three decades, and are in residence at City Center with an endearing production of ''The Pirates of Penzance.'' Alfred Bergeret, the artistic director of the company, has conscripted Hal Linden at the Major General. The rest of the cast is culled from regulars with the company. Equal measures of experience and affection are blended in their spirited, vocally confident performances (2:30) City Center, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 3 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $40 to $85.
ISHERWOOD

'A SECOND HAND MEMORY' Woody Allen's unrelentingly glum new play at the Atlantic Theater Company is a drama about two generations of defeated dreamers in 1950's Brooklyn. As the play opens, Eddie Wolfe (Nicky Katt) has been called home from Hollywood to help turn around the family jewelry business, for which he never had much affection. Eddie has an unwanted new wife and a baby on the way, but his permanently darkened brow telegraphs despair and a burning desire to escape. Eddie's moral quandary -- should he stay or should he go? -- generates little suspense. The actors provide some leavening warmth, but it's hard to escape the feeling that Mr. Allen's characters are simply serving out their sentences, railing against an unjust fate by incessantly flailing away at one another (2:15). Atlantic Theater Company, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 and 7:30 p.m. Tickets: $60.
ISHERWOOD

+ 'UNDER THE BRIDGE' Kathie Lee Gifford, best known for purveying chitchat on morning television, has re-emerged in showbiz behind the scenes, as the author of a new musical aimed at family audiences. ''Under the Bridge,'' with book and lyrics by Ms. Gifford and music by David Pomeranz, tells the heartwarming story of a spunky group of homeless children who befriend a cranky but lovable old bum. As his hard heart is softened, the urchins and their widowed mother find the home they've long dreamed of. A new family is born. All this in Paris, yet. As that precis suggests, in adapting a popular children's book by Natalie Savage Carlson, Ms. Gifford does not exactly strive tirelessly to avoid the cliched. The score is competent if generic. Mr. Pomeranz's melodies are pleasant and neatly tailored, while Ms. Gifford's lyrics are doggedly rhymed if rarely graceful. Despite energetic performances all around (special kudos to the likable Ed Dixon as the hobo), Eric Schaeffer's production feels inert (2:10). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. Fridays at 7 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 7 p.m.; Sundays at 1 and 6 p.m. Beginning Tuesday, the performance schedule is Tuesdays through Fridays at 7 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2:30; Saturdays at 2 and 7 p.m.; Sundays at 1 p.m. Tickets: $55.
ISHERWOOD

+ 'WHITE CHOCOLATE' Think of it as ''Black Like Moi.'' William Hamilton's play about a rich white couple who wake up to discover they've turned black is a shrill, sporadically funny situation comedy that is at heart nothing more than its central situation. Mr. Hamilton is famous for his cartoons in The New Yorker, which portray willowy, patrician figures poised over cocktails and crudites. Throughout ''White Chocolate,'' which is directed by David Schweizer as if it were a traffic jam, there are sharp, shiny lines that might work as captions for Hamilton cartoons. (''She may not want a Scotch, Brandon. It's not dark yet, and she's only half-WASP.'') But they are lines that tell you less about character than class. And as a comedy of social identity, ''White Chocolate'' never looks far beneath the veneers it pretends to be peeling away (2:15). Century Center for the Performing Arts, 111 East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 to $60.

Last Chance

'THE FOREIGNER' Matthew Broderick brings his sad-sack slouch and adenoidal uneasiness to ''The Foreigner,'' Larry Shue's deliberately doltish comedy of improbabilities from the mid-1980's. There is no denying that Mr. Broderick, who plays a gray-souled British proofreader on vacation in rural Georgia, has this persona as securely nailed down as any performer since (he should pardon the comparison) Jerry Lewis. Directed by Scott Schwartz, the production allows Mr. Broderick a few joyous interludes of precisely rendered, raging goofiness. But despite a top-drawer supporting cast, what's between the bright comic riffs brings to mind the sort of contrived television sitcom that you wind up watching, passively and masochistically, when you're too depressed to change the channel (2:45). Roundabout Theater Company at the Pels Theater, Steinberg Center, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. Tonight at 7:30; tomorrow at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets: $61.25 to $71.25.

Now Playing

'THE ASSASSINATION OF RICHARD NIXON' Starring Sean Penn, Don Cheadle, Jack Thompson and Naomi Watts. Directed by Niels Mueller (R, 95 minutes). On Feb. 22, 1974, Samuel Byck, a onetime tire salesman and failing family man, entered the ranks of pseudo-celebrity by trying to commandeer a commercial airliner and crash it into the White House. He didn't get far, which is why the man who would be Booth is a footnote to history rather than a chapter. Earlier this year, three decades after Byck's flameout, this provocatively titled film had its premiere at the Cannes festival. Directed by a first-timer, it stars Mr. Penn as a character inspired by the man who hoped to drop a 747 on the White House and incinerate Dick Nixon. Mr. Penn, as is his wont, acts up a storm with the aid of some facial embellishment, in this case a mustache that broadcasts the fanfare for the common man with all the discretion of Aaron Copland.
MANOHLA DARGIS

'THE AVIATOR' Starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Directed by Martin Scorsese (PG-13, 169 minutes). The famously eccentric and reclusive empire builder Howard Hughes was born alone and died alone, the two times in his life when he was no different from anyone else. For the rest of his life, the high-flying Hughes seemed to have drifted in from some distant aerie where exotic birds hatch far from everyday worries. At 18 he was both an orphan and a millionaire, and while he could never be called ordinary, in the following two decades his wealth and all that it afforded brought him a very American kind of celebrity. It is that celebrity, fueled by money, stoked by matinee looks and playboy style, which preoccupies ''The Aviator,'' Mr. Scorsese's visually sumptuous if disappointingly hollow account of Hughes's early life. Written by John Logan, the story principally covers the late 20's through the 40's, when Hughes, played by Mr. DiCaprio, was gadding about both Hollywood and the aviation world.

'BEYOND THE SEA' Starring Kevin Spacey, Kate Bosworth and John Goodman. Directed by Mr. Spacey (PG-13, 118 minutes). The matching of two slithery chameleons, the singer Bobby Darin (who died in 1973 at the age of 37) and his latter-day doppelganger, Mr. Spacey (now 45), sparks a weird bluish flame that suggests a wax yule log posing as wood in the season's teeming fireplace of movie biographies. When ignited, it releases acrid, waxy fumes that feel queasily chemical. The movie, which the star directed and helped write and in which he sings (wonderfully), smacks of the same kind of obsession that brought Bob Fosse's ''All That Jazz'' to creepy reptilian life. Its vision of show business in the 50's and 60's is as tawdry as Fosse's and as incisive in suggesting it's a grubby rags-to-riches circus. (Ms. Bosworth plays Sandra Dee, the bimbo movie princess Darin strenuously wooed and married.) The movie also touches on the ugly reality of show business mothers who force their children to act out their dreams.

'CLOSER' Starring Natalie Portman, Jude Law, Julia Roberts and Clive Owen. Directed by Mike Nichols (R, 110 minutes). Four characters in search of an objective correlative for their needy, angry, compulsive states of feelings. Mr. Nichols's smooth, nimble direction improves Patrick Marber's verbose, pretentious play yet exposes some of its flaws. Two American women (Ms. Portman and Ms. Roberts) are entangled with two Englishmen (Mr. Law and Mr. Owen) in a four-handed game of deception, self-delusion and betrayal that skips and leaps over a period of several years. The formal trickiness of the narrative strips the characters of any daily context that would give their emotions meaning, and the movie is a succession of scenes, some quite powerful on their own, that don't really add up to much. The actors work hard to give their schematic, overwritten roles some nuance and individuality, but only Mr. Owen -- raw, brash and witty -- succeeds.

'FAT ALBERT' Starring Kenan Thompson and Kyla Pratt. Directed by Joel Zwick (PG, 93 minutes). One of the truisms of contemporary pop culture is that just when you think it couldn't get any worse, its purveyors any more shameless, you are proved decisively wrong. Based on Bill Cosby's corpulent charmer and his band of brothers, the ''Fat Albert'' movie opens just days after the release of the DVD compilations of the original show. DVD's for the program are featured so prominently in the movie and the movie feels so much like an extended-play sitcom, I half expected Mr. Cosby to pop up on-screen to sell me the discs along with a Coke. From 1972 through 1984, the animated television series ''Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids'' enjoyed enormous success. The cartoon was austere but eminently watchable and featured one of those sitcom tunes that etch a permanent groove in your head. Just as memorable was Mr. Cosby's basso-profundo delivery of Fat Albert's trademark ''hey, hey, hey,'' a mantra that signaled that no matter what happened, all would be right in the end. In ''Fat Albert,'' that trademark is resurrected to depressingly diminished ends.

* 'HOTEL RWANDA' Starring Don Cheadle, Sophie Okonedo, Joaquin Phoenix and Nick Nolte. Directed by Terry George (PG-13, 121 minutes). This wrenching political thriller performs the valuable service of lending a human face to an upheaval so savage it seemed beyond the realm of imagination when news of it filtered to the West. The movie certainly isn't the first screen depiction of a nation consumed by ethnic strife. But its vision of the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis by the ruling Hutu tribe in Rwanda during a 100-day bloodbath in 1994 offers a devastating picture of media-driven mass murder left unchecked. The story is based on the real-life experiences of Paul Rusesabagina (Mr. Cheadle), the soft-spoken Hutu manager of the Hotel des Mille Collines, in Kigali, who with his Tutsi wife, Tatiana (Ms. Okonedo), and children, narrowly escapes death several times. Mr. Rusesabagina was directly responsible for saving the lives of more than 1,200 Tutsis and Hutu moderates by sheltering them in the hotel and bribing the Hutu military to spare them. The movie, which is squeamish about showing the full extent of savagery, hammers every button on the emotional console.
HOLDEN

'IN GOOD COMPANY' Starring Dennis Quaid, Topher Grace and Scarlett Johansson. Written and directed by Paul Weitz (PG-13, 106 minutes). This gently revisionist fairy tale about good versus evil is set on the battlefield of contemporary corporate culture, a site of our leading blood sport. Mostly, though, the movie is about men. The two men at the story's engaging center are Carter Duryea (Mr. Grace), a young executive who has been promoted beyond his abilities to run the advertising department of a magazine with the resonant name of Sports America. The man whom Carter is meant to make redundant is the 51-year-old Dan Foreman, a ruggedly appealing adult who brings out the best in everyone. Dan has a picture-perfect family and is the kind of unabashedly old-fashioned masculine type Mr. Quaid has been slow-cooking to perfection over the years and which, on American screens at least, has lately gone missing.

'LEMONY SNICKET'S A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS' Starring Jim Carrey, Liam Aiken, Emily Browning, Kara Hoffman and Shelby Hoffman. Directed by Brad Silberling (PG, 108 minutes). Since the publication of the first installment in Lemony Snicket's (a k a Daniel Handler's) charmingly malignant book cycle ''A Series of Unfortunate Events,'' the three Baudelaire children -- Violet, Klaus and Sunny -- have been trying to find safe harbor in a world fraught with danger. For 11 consecutive books, the children have passed from the care of one well-intentioned adult to another, braving the sort of peril usually faced by silent-screen heroines named Pauline and leaving a trail of corpses in their wake. To date, the cause of their misfortunes has been their onetime guardian, Count Olaf, who hopes to steal their fortune. But now the characters have embarked on one of the most dangerous adventures known in literature: their story has been turned into a major Hollywood movie -- and with Jim Carrey, no less.
DARGIS

'THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU' Starring Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Cate Blanchett, Anjelica Huston, Willem Dafoe and Jeff Goldblum. Directed by Wes Anderson (R, 118 minutes). More elaborate whimsy from Mr. Anderson, who confected a parallel-universe Manhattan in ''The Royal Tenenbaums'' and who now goes even further, inventing tropical islands and species of exotic fish when the mood strikes him. Somehow, though, this movie is more charming than irritating, partly thanks to Mr. Murray's performance -- a tour de force of comic minimalism -- as Steve Zissou, an ocean adventurer with a boatload of problems. ''The Life Aquatic'' is thick with potential narrative complications -- involving, for starters, Zissou's long-lost son (Mr. Wilson), estranged wife (Ms. Houston), slimy archrival (Mr. Goldblum) and needy first mate (Mr. Dafoe) -- but Mr. Anderson is less a storyteller than a curator of odd specimens and curious situations. The pleasures of this movie are like those of a beautifully illustrated, haphazardly plotted picture book, which precocious children (and nostalgic adults) can linger over, feeding their reveries and fantasies.
SCOTT

'A LOVE SONG FOR BOBBY LONG' Starring John Travolta and Scarlett Johansson. Directed by Shainee Gabel (R, 119 minutes). In this first feature directed by Ms. Gabel, Mr. Travolta delivers a hammed-up scenery-chewing variation of the brainy good ol' boy he played in ''Primary Colors.'' This is the story of a down-at-the-heels former star professor and his protege rotting in the New Orleans house bequeathed them by a legendary folk-blues singer and their partial redemption when the singer's alienated daughter comes to live with them. The film dawdles along aimlessly for two hours before coming up with a final revelation that is no surprise. The movie's hokey solemnity suggests ''The Mundane Secrets of the Ya-Ya Brotherhood'' or ''The Notebook Goes to the Big Easy.'' The movie is another example of Hollywood going soft and squishy when it goes South.

'MEET THE FOCKERS' Starring Robert De Niro, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand, Blythe Danner, Teri Polo and Owen Wilson. Directed by Jay Roach (PG-13, 114 minutes). Like ''Meet the Parents,'' the follow-up new comedy ''Meet the Fockers'' hinges on the well-traveled idea that there's something comic about being Jewish in America. Not the Philip Roth, take-no-prisoners funny, in which Jewish identity is good, bad, happy, sad, a historical chip on the shoulder, a sign of radical difference. Rather, the post-Borscht Belt funny of the genial sitcom Jew whose difference is amorphous enough to be thoroughly unthreatening; the Jew as an ethnic accessory that non-Jews on both sides of the camera can enjoy without anxiety, like the cute cabala string Madonna likes to wear. And so, just as Bernie loved Bridget, and Rhoda loved Mary, so does Greg Focker (Mr. Stiller) love Pam Byrnes (Ms. Polo). And because Greg loves Pam, Pam's father, Jack (Mr. De Niro), doesn't love Greg. Not because no man could ever be good enough for his daughter, but because Greg doesn't look like Pam's old squeeze, the fair-haired Kevin (Mr. Wilson).
DARGIS

* 'THE MERCHANT OF VENICE' Starring Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, Joseph Fiennes and Lynn Collins. Directed by Michael Radford (R; 127 minutes). Shakespeare's most problematic play -- at least with respect to modern sensitivities -- receives an intelligent intepretation from Mr. Radford and from a superb cast. Mr. Pacino, showing welcome restraint after a series of overdone stage and screen performances, emphasizes Shylock's grief and estrangement, turning him into a fragile monster. But his villainy, however much it smacks of blood libel, cannot be discarded without compromising the play's complex ideas about justice and duty, and Mr. Radford does not try to wash away the stain of anti-Semitism that is woven into the heart of his source. He does remind us how much more is going on in the play, and along with his talented production designer and cinematographer, he renders Venice as a series of Renaissance paintings -- tableaus that immerse us in the ferment of early modern Europe. Mr. Irons is quietly mesmerizing in the title role, a creature of mysterious melancholy whose soul seems at once pure and rotted. The movie really belongs to Ms. Collins, who gives Portia her rightful wit and charisma, and makes her the play's cruel and lovely moral center.
SCOTT

* 'MILLION DOLLAR BABY' Starring Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman. Directed by Mr. Eastwood (PG-13, 135 minutes). Mr. Eastwood takes what appears to be a conventional boxing-melodrama plot about a crusty old trainer whose heart is melted by a spirited young fighter and turns it into a glowing, somber meditation on friendship, ambition and death. The picture's scale is small, and its pacing leisurely, which gives you a chance to savor three lovely performances: from Ms. Swank as the young boxer, Mr. Freeman as a world-weary former contender and Mr. Eastwood as the trainer, Frankie Dunn. At 74, Mr. Eastwood has achieved a level of mastery that leaves him with nothing to prove, and so, unafraid of sentiment and willing to risk cliche, he has made a graceful, lyrical, devastating masterpiece -- the best film released by a major Hollywood studio this year.
SCOTT

* 'OCEAN'S TWELVE' Starring George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle and Scott Caan. Directed by Steven Soderbergh (PG-13, 120 minutes). At a certain point in the enjoyable, unabashedly trivial caper flick ''Ocean's Twelve,'' crooks played by Mr. Damon, Mr. Cheadle and Mr. Caan start running through the different ways they can get out of their immediate jam. Things have gone badly for these likable rogues and now most of their crew -- including the smooth piece of work who gives the film its title, Danny Ocean -- played by the equally silky Mr. Clooney -- has landed in the clink. The crooks are looking for a get-out-of-jail-free card, which, given the film's criminally underdone plot and smog of self-satisfaction is something that Mr. Soderbergh may have wanted to stash up his own sleeve. As anyone within spitting distance of a television set knows, ''Ocean's Twelve'' is the high-profile sequel to Mr. Soderbergh's big box office entertainment ''Ocean's Eleven.'' Once again Mr. Clooney's Danny is the leader of the pack, Mr. Pitt plays his second in command, Rusty Ryan, and Mr. Damon plays Linus, a puppy that desperately wants to be a dog but may not have sprouted the requisite fangs.
DARGIS

'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Starring Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum and Minnie Driver. Directed by Joel Schumacher (PG-13, 143 minutes). ''Far too many notes for my taste,'' a minor character remarks, apropos of the threatening letters being sent by the micromanaging phantom. That pretty much sums up the problems with Andrew Lloyd Webber's bombastic score, which is well matched by Mr. Schumacher's production. For all the invocations of ''the angel of music,'' this film, adapted from the curiously popular stage musical, will most likely leave you with a devilish headache. The songs are unlistenable, which also makes them hard to sing, but Ms. Rossum and Mr. Butler show some impressive vocal technique, and Ms. Rossum, in addition to being lovely, has enough movie star luminosity to avoid being buried in the busy sets and elaborate costumes. This 2-hour-and-20-minute barrage may drive you back to the 1925 version of ''Phantom,'' which starred Lon Chaney and which has many virtues. For one thing, it is short. For another, it's silent.
SCOTT

'THE SEA INSIDE' Starring Javier Bardem and Belen Rueda. Directed by Alejandro Amenabar (PG-13, 125 minutes; in Spanish with English subtitles). As the camera restlessly circles the sky and the ocean, taking in the radiance of northern Spain, the story of a quadriplegic activist fighting for the right to die struggles to transcend the disease-of-the-week genre to which it belongs. Yet there is no escaping the fact that the true story of Ramon Sampedro, a former ship's mechanic seeking a final exit after three decades of agonizing immobility, is defined by its theme. To its credit it avoids becoming a formulaic dialogue that pits religious and secular cheerleaders against each other in predigested arguments. Sensitively portrayed by the great Spanish actor Javier Bardem, Ramon, 55, regards his life in the wake of a crippling accident in his mid-20's as a cruel, cosmic joke. In the emotional kernel of the movie, Ramon contemplates the impossibility of consummating his passion for his beautiful new lawyer (Ms. Rueda) who suffers from a debilitating disease.
HOLDEN

'SPANGLISH' Starring Adam Sandler, Tea Leoni and Paz Vega. Directed by James L. Brooks (PG-13, 110 minutes). Mr. Brooks, one of the smartest and sunniest men in Hollywood, turns his attention to class division, cultural misunderstanding and marital discord in Los Angeles, all subjects ripe for the kind of warm-hearted comedy in which he specializes and all treated with astonishing smugness and dishonesty. Mr. Sandler plays John Clasky, a successful chef who almost falls for his maid, Flor (Ms. Vega), a situation that Mr. Brooks rescues from sleaziness by making Jack's wife, Deborah (Ms. Leoni), a thoroughgoing monster: irredeemably selfish, vain and ridiculous. Deborah, a bad mother and a useless wife, serves as the film's scapegoat, and her demonization contrasts with the idealization of Flor in a way that manages to be both overtly misogynist and implicitly racist. Mr. Sandler smiles through it all, playing a nice guy who unwittingly personifies the film's self-adoring liberal bad faith.
SCOTT

'A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT' Starring Audrey Tautou. Directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet (R, 133 minutes; in French, with English subtitles). If you like battleground carnage delivered with aesthetic brio, the kind that ensures that when a soldier explodes into confetti, his flesh will dapple a trench mate as decoratively as pink rosettes on a cake, this new French film will serve you nicely. Set during World War I and its immediate aftermath, the film follows the adventures of a young woman, Mathilde (Ms. Tautou), who holds fast to the hope that her young soldier fiance will return home from his apparent grave. Even when death seems to part them, the cord of her love remains unbroken. Best known for ''Amelie,'' a modern fairy tale also starring Ms. Tautou, Mr. Jeunet is in the possession of a distinctive visual style that's part Rube Goldberg, part F. A. O. Schwarz, and generally enjoyable for about 15 minutes.
DARGIS

'WHITE NOISE' Starring Michael Keaton, Chandra West and Deborah Kara Unger. Directed by Geoffrey Sax (PG-13, 101 minutes). A laugh-laced cheap thrill that has nothing to do with the Don DeLillo novel of the same title, ''White Noise'' was directed by Mr. Sax, whose resume hopefully notes that this would-be auteur comes from a long and venerable line of BBC-trained directors. It is a long and venerable line that on the evidence of his feature filmmaking debut, Mr. Sax may bring to an unintended end. It's impossible to say exactly who takes the brunt of the blame here, although the screenwriting credit belongs to Niall Johnson. Mr. Johnson apparently wrote ''White Noise'' in 2002, several years after the Japanese horror movie ''Ringu'' helped trigger the recent fad for Asian horror and, as in numerous Japanese and Korean titles, his script hinges on the premise that there are ghosts in the machine anxious to reach out and touch us. Often, the person on this side of the death divide is a spunky woman or a high school girl in a miniskirt and knee socks, but here the hero reaching across time, space and genre is played by Mr. Keaton.
DARGIS

'THE WOODSMAN' Starring Kevin Bacon, Kyra Sedgwick, Mos Def, Benjamin Bratt, David Alan Grier and Eve. Directed by Nicole Kassell (R, 87 minutes). Ms. Kassell directs this story of a paroled child molester struggling to re-enter society after 12 years in prison in a lean, unassuming style, which suits the subject matter and gives the fine cast room to explore their complicated, unhappy characters. The story is not always plausible, and the atmosphere sometimes feels programmatically grim, but the film is a serious, compassionate attempt at psychological realism, anchored by Mr. Bacon's precise, unsettling performance as a man trying to untangle his decent impulses from his destructive, predatory urges.

* AN ALBATROSS, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 653-1703. Hardcore compression gets extreme in the fast, jolting songs of An Albatross, which are full of quick changes and shrieked vocals. But with two keyboards upfront instead of guitars, its gnashing riffs can veer toward a circus-like oom-pah or blippy electro, adding comedy to the frantic songs. Tomorrow night at 9, with Mitsuko, the Cinema Eye and Aqui opening; admission is $7.
JON PARELES

FROG HOLLER, Rodeo Bar, 375 Third Avenue at 27th Street, (212) 683-6500. Frog Holler, from Berks County in Pennsylvania, plays roots-rock that leans toward the country side. It's equally at home with bluegrass picking or stately songs that echo the Band, full of feisty determination. It has just released a new album, ''The High, High's & the Low, Low's'' (ZoBird). Tonight at 10; admission is free.

* THE GAME, Club Speeed, 20 West 39th Street, near Fifth Avenue, (212) 719-9867. Dr. Dre's newest protege has a thunderous voice, an ever-present scowl and a desire to end L.A.'s hip-hop drought -- the city has produced surprisingly few rappers over the last decade. He is scheduled to appear at this long-running Sunday night party; expect to hear his thunderous current single, ''How We Do,'' and maybe some tracks from his highly anticipated debut album, ''The Documentary'' (Aftermath/Interscope), due out on Tuesday. Sunday night after 10; the first 500 women are to be admitted free; everyone else should expect to pay, though the price may depend upon when you show up.

She doesn't sound like her father, Lowell George of Little Feat; she's more dreamy than bluesy, and her songs lean toward airy pop-folk, mixing surrealism with gentle barbs. 'If I was you, I wouldn't talk, I'd just keep dancing,' she sings. Tonight at 8; admission is free.

In the early 1980's Mission of Burma was one of the best American post-punk bands: burly and arty, dissonant and gruffly impassioned.

On its albums, just reissued, Suicide's songs are robotic updates of rockabilly, garage-rock and the Doors. It used to play its repetitive riffs until the audience rebelled; now, there's more tolerance and humor on both sides. Thee Majesty is the latest vehicle for the free-thinking manifestos of Genesis P-Orridge, formerly of Psychic TV and Throbbing Gristle and one of rock's most extreme self-experimenters.

On this Martin Luther King day weekend, he is to preside over one of Sunday night's latest celebrations -- so late, in fact, that it doesn't begin until 10 a.m. on Monday morning. Expect to hear the usual digitized disco and euphoric synthesizer lines, but don't be surprised if, at some point during his scheduled 10-hour set, Junior Vasquez also finds time to play thicker and darker rhythmic tracks; he knows the crowd will follow him wherever he roams. Monday morning -- yes, morning -- at 10; tickets are $30 in advance, more at the door.

* BILL CHARLAP TRIO, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080. The pianist Bill Charlap has a steady trio with Peter Washington and Kenny Washington; over the last five years or so his performances have become extraordinary displays of discipline and improvisation -- the wonders of an organized imagination. Sets are tonight and tomorrow at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30 and there is $10 minimum .
BEN RATLIFF

SCOTT COLLEY TRIO, 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883. A particularly in-demand bass player who has worked with Herbie Hancock, among others, Scott Colley has also led his own bands and made his own impressive records; in his band this weekend are two other major figures among young players, the saxophonist Chris Potter and the drummer Antonio Sanchez. Tonight and tomorrow at 10 pm; cover charge is $10.
RATLIFF

MARC COPLAND TRIO, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626. Starting out on saxophone, then changing to piano and growing considerably over the last two decades, Marc Copland has jazz discipline under his fingers but he gets into the music on a philosophical level, drawing all kinds of aesthetic inferences from film and painting and poetry. His trio includes the bassist Drew Gress and the drummer Joachim Rueckert. Sets tonight and tomorrow are at 8, 10, and midnight; cover charge is $20 and there is a $10 minimum.
RATLIFF

* EDDIE HENDERSON QUARTET, Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, Manhattan, (212) 864-6662. If you're looking for that quintessential New York jazz experience -- tough as nails yet harmonically stimulating, physical and intellectual at the same time -- you should try this group, one of the city's best undersung working bands, including the pianist Dave Kikoski, the bassist Ed Howard and the drummer Victor Lewis. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9, 11 and 12:30; cover charge is $20.
RATLIFF

* PAUL MOTIAN'S ELECTRIC BEBOP BAND, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 255-4037. After 14 years, the group still seems totally fresh: two tenor saxophones, two guitarists, drums and electric bass, playing bebop repertory as well as Mr. Motian's own tunes. Known early on by his involvement in the early-60's Bill Evans trio, Mr. Motian, the drummer, now in his 70's, follows the path of surprise; constantly improvising, he phrases the rhythm differently in every single measure and leaves acres of open space in his sound. He's the real thing. Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30.
RATLIFF

ERIC REED HAPPINESS SEXTET, Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, 5th floor, Broadway at 60th Street; www.jalc.org. For this band, the pianist Eric Reed has written short, breezy suites; they suit his fluid, charmingly dexterous musical personality. He gets as much out of McCoy Tyner as any modern pianist, but he also reaches far and wide. Mr. Reed is drawn to fast tempos, and his music is always going somewhere, zeroing in on its target. The band includes the pianist Jeremy Pelt, the saxophonists Myron Walden and Seamus Blake, the bassist Dwayne Burno and the drummer Billy Drummond. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11 o'clock set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $30, with a $10 minimum at the tables, $5 at the bar.
RATLIFF

JOE SAMPLE TRIO, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592. A member of the Crusaders, the long-running jazz-funk band of yesteryear, the pianist Joe Sample has gotten more traditional on a recent album, ''Soul Shadows'' (Verve), which includes solo-piano versions of songs by Joplin, Waller and Ellington. Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10:30; cover charge at the tables is eis $40, with a $5 minimum, $30 at the bar with a one-drink minimum.
RATLIFF

JIMMY SMITH QUINTET, Iridium, 1650 Broadway at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121. The most iconic presence in organ-and-tenor saxophone soul-jazz of the 1950's and 60's, Mr. Smith plays with fast hands and persuasive funk. Sets through Sunday night are at 8 and 10, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $35 with a $10 minimum .
RATLIFF

VISION CLUB, Clemente Soto Velez Gallery, LES Gallery and Cafe,107 Suffolk at Rivington, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4080.

Sets are tomorrow night at 7:30 and 9 and admission is $20 for both sets.
RATLIFF

RANDY WESTON AFRICAN RHYTHMS QUINTET, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. The pianist Randy Weston has a dynamic style: it leads him toward the extreme ends of the piano with a ringing percussiveness that's pure Ellington. But his ambitions have been larger than that ever since his first trips to Africa in the early 1960's. This weekend he presents his jazz band with African leanings. Sets through Sunday night are at 7:30 and 9:30, with an 11:30 set tonight and tomorrow; tickets, $30 tonight and tomorrow, $25 on Sunday.

Classical Music

AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA At the beginning of this new year the conductor Leon Botstein looks back exactly a century to 1905, a tumultuous time in Russian history, for his concert on Sunday afternoon with the American Symphony Orchestra. The program offers three works written in the immediate aftermath of that year: Stravinsky's ''Fireworks,'' Glazunov's ''Song of Destiny,'' and Miaskovsky's ''Silence: Symphonic Poem after E. A. Poe.'' Then Mr. Botstein conducts a Shostakovich work composed in 1957, which is also a look back to that time, the Symphony No. 11, titled ''The Year 1905.'' Sunday at 3 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $25 to $53.
ANTHONY TOMMASINI

BARGEMUSIC Moored in the shadow of the Brooklyn Bridge, this intimate floating concert hall is a charming place to hear solo recitals and chamber music while rocking gently on the waves of the East River. This weekend, the Damocles Trio displays its specialty in Spanish repertory. Tonight, Adam Kent, the trio's pianist, performs solo works by Albeniz, Falla, Rodrigo, Gerhard and others. Tomorrow night and Sunday afternoon, Mr. Kent's colleagues join him for music by Turina, Valencia and Salvador Brotons. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30 and Sunday afternoon at 4, Fulton Ferry Landing, under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083. Tickets: $35, $25 students.
JEREMY EICHLER

BROOKLYN PHILHARMONIC ''Brooklyn Goes Hollywood'' begins the Brooklyn Philharmonic's season by celebrating the cultural meeting places, and sometimes clashes, between celebrated European musical immigrants, driven west by Hitler, and the salesmanship of the Hollywood movies studios. John Mauceri has made a specialty of the subject and offers Bernard Herrmann's music from two Hitchcock movies, Copland's suite from ''The Heiress,'' plus Gershwin's orchestral work for the film ''Shall We Dance'' and John Corigliano's music for ''Altered States.'' Tomorrow night at 8, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 488-5913. Tickets: $20 to $60.
BERNARD HOLLAND

CARNEGIE HALL FESTIVAL CHORUS Carnegie's annual weeklong choral workshop, founded in 1990 by Robert Shaw, has pretty much stuck to the mold since Shaw's death in 1999, with orchestral cnductors picking up where the Shaw acolyte Norman Mackenzie leaves off in preparing the concluding concert. But this year the seasoned choral specialist Helmuth Rilling has settled in, undoubtedly with strong ideas of his own about how a chorus (this one larded with choral professionals from around the country) should be prepared. In fact, it's specialists all around: the work at hand is Mozart's unfinished C-minor Mass, in the premiere of a new completion by the Mozart authority Robert Levin. Tomorrow night at 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $24 to $82.
JAMES R. OESTREICH

JULIA FISCHER Though the concerts by the Dresden Philharmonic this November at Avery Fisher Hall were wildly uneven, the 21-year-old German violinist Julia Fischer made a strong impression as the soloist in Brahms's Violin Concerto. Ms. Fischer is back for her New York recital debut at Zankel Hall tonight. If her program is very standard (Beethoven's ''Kreutzer'' Sonata, Schubert's Rondo in B minor, Bach's Solo Violin Sonata in C, and Prokofiev's Violin Sonata in D), it is certainly formidable. She will be joined by the Swiss-born pianist Oliver Schnyder. Tonight at 7:30, Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $20 to $32.
TOMMASINI

JUILLIARD CHAMBERFEST There are free chamber music performances year-round at the Juilliard School, but the numbers swell during the annual chamber festival that has been taking place this week. In two final concerts this weekend, students will show off what they've learned in over 10 days of coaching from Juilliard faculty. Tonight features Schnittke's Piano Quintet, Shostakovich's String Quartet No. 3 and Brahms's Piano Quintet. Tomorrow night's program will be Brahms's Piano Quartet in A, Mendelssohn's Piano Trio in C minor and Schumann's Piano Quintet. Tonight at 8 in Alice Tully Hall, tomorrow at 8 in the Juilliard Theater, 155 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 769-7406. Both are free, but tickets are required tonight.
EICHLER

NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC There are tours (a couple of weeks, say, in Europe or Asia), and there are tours. Tonight, before it resumes its current subscription series, the orchestra makes the quickest of jaunts, to New Jersey, with Lorin Maazel conducting Beethoven's Seventh Symphony and Dvorak's ''New World.'' It returns tomorrow and on Tuesday with the subscription program, jointly conducted by Mr. Maazel and the orchestra's assistant conductor, Xian Zhang, who was a winner of the Maazel/Vilar Conductors' Competition in 2002. Mr. Maazel presents Strauss's Horn Concerto No. 1, with Philip Myers as soloist, and Mozart's Symphony No. 29. Ms. Zhang conducts Mark-Anthony Turnage's ''Scherzoid,'' a Philharmonic commission in its world premiere performances, and Britten's ''Four Sea Interludes'' from ''Peter Grimes.'' Tonight at 8, New Jersey Center for the Performing Arts, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722; tickets, $18 to $84. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $25 to $90.
OESTREICH

* PAUL O'DETTE The lute is an instrument that speaks softly but, in the right hands, can yield both delicate nuance and virtuosic fire. Paul O'Dette is one of its most sensitive and eloquent champions: among his dozens of superb recordings are incomparable performances of the great English Renaissance repertory, including the complete lute works of Dowland. For his concert in the Music Before 1800 series, though, he is setting aside the Renaissance lute and taking up the Baroque model, a larger, more robust instrument with a more expansive range and a repertory that includes the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. Mr. O'Dette will Bach's ''Pieces pour la Luth a M. Schouster'' (BWV 995), the Partita in E (BWV 1006a) and the Sonata in G minor (BWV 1001), as well as a Suite in C minor by Bach's contemporary, Sylvius Leopold Weiss. Sunday at 4 p.m., Corpus Christi Church, 529 West 121st Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 666-9266. Tickets: $25 and $40; $20 and $35 for students and 62+.
ALLAN KOZINN

PARK AVENUE CHAMBER SYMPHONY If there's not a doctor in the house, there will be plenty of lawyers on the stage at this ensemble's winter concert, amateur in the best and oldest sense of the word, ''lovers'' of music. Investment bankers and government officials, executives and law clerks are the players in this five-year-old ensemble, which warms up for a benefit concert at Carnegie Hall next Wednesday with a concert that includes the Brahms Fourth as well as Gordon Jacob's Horn Concerto, written for the virtuoso Dennis Brain, performed here by a music therapist who happens to be an experienced soloist, Jennifer Miller. David Bernard, the group's founder, conducts. Tonight and tomorrow at 8, St. Jean Baptiste Church, Lexington Avenue at 76th Street, (212) 570-1200. Tickets: $15, $10 for 65+ and students.
ANNE MIDGETTE

CHRIS THILE AND EDGAR MEYER Highbrows frown on the ''crossover'' bent of the double-bass player Edgar Meyer, which is just plain silly: Mr. Meyer grew up in the bluegrass tradition, and any crossing over he's done has been mainly in the other direction, into classical music. Mr. Meyer has no problem acknowledging, or mingling, any of his musical roots: a respected artist member of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, he's also a star on the bluegrass circuit. Zankel Hall has, since its opening, deliberately sought to push the envelopes of musical definitions, and this weekend it plays host to Mr. Meyer with a frequent partner, the virtuoso mandolin player Chris Thile, in a program of original music. Some tongues will wag; many toes will tap. Tomorrow night at 7:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800. Tickets: $28 to $40.
MIDGETTE

TURTLE ISLAND AND YING STRING QUARTETS As the resident string quartet at Symphony Space the last few seasons, the Ying Quartet has presided an adventurous series called ''No Boundaries,'' in which newly commissioned works were offered alongside poetry, dance, video, folk music and other things, including a magic show and a demonstration of Chinese noodlemaking. Technically, the group's collaboration with the Turtle Island String Quartet isn't part of that series, but it is certainly in the same spirit. If the Yings specialize in the traditional and contemporary quartet repertory, the Turtle Island ensemble's performances range more freely, with distinct jazz and pop leanings. The two groups will perform together and on their own, in repertory that includes music by Mendelssohn and Milhaud (who both wrote exquisite string octets) and by members of the Turtle Island group. Tonight at 8, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400. Tickets: $23 to $28.

WALLY CARDONA QUARTET Mr. Cardona promises that his dancers will communicate anger, intimacy and loneliness in choreography that unfolds in a set made up of white cubes, strips of bright white floors, thin white panels and patches of synthetic grass. Tonight and tomorrow at 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077. Tickets: $25.
JENNIFER DUNNING

YANIRA CASTRO + COMPANY In Ms. Castro's new site-specific ''Beacon,'' an abandoned Brooklyn bathhouse serves as the setting for danced myth that doesn't quite measure up to its surroundings. Still, the interplay between live bodies and the images reflected on Roderick Murray's Plexiglass walls are magic enough. Tonight and tomorrow (and next Friday and Saturday) at 7 and 9 p.m.; Sunday (and next Sunday) at 6 p.m., Brooklyn Lyceum, 227 4th Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (212) 924-0077. Tickets: $20.
DUNNING

ISADORA DUNCAN DANCE FOUNDATION Lori Belilove and her dancers will present ''Dances of Inner Peace and Strength.'' The performers include child dancers known as the Beliloveables. 'Nuff said. Tonight at 8, New York Society for Ethical Culture, 2 West 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 691-5040. Tickets: $40; $200 for a pair of tickets and a mini-Isadora Duncan kit. The kit includes: an educational booklet, a contemporary book by Peter Kurth; Isadora Speaks (a book on writing and speeches); a video called ''Spirit Unbroken''; a Isadora Duncan hand dyed silk scarf; a poster of the company and set of four postcards.)
DUNNING

VALERIE GREEN/DANCE ENTROPY In a program called ''Naked/Desire,'' Ms. Green will perform a new piece, ''Naked Heart,'' choreographed for her by Mariko Tanabe, on a program of dances by Ms. Green that fuse music, text and movement and that grew in part out of teaching residences in Bosnia and Albania. Tonight at 9; tomorow and Sunday at 8 p.m., Merce Cunningham Studio, 55 Bethune Street, at Washington Street, West Village, (718) 436-0125. Tickets: $15.
DUNNING

* KARINNE KEITHLEY The highly imaginative and decidedly unsolemn Ms. Keithley is presenting ''Tenderenda,'' which she describes as ''a sideways adaption'' of ''Tenderenda der Phantast,'' a 1919 Dada novel by Hugo Ball. It will be performed by three lead dancers and a living forest made up of eight additional dancers. ''Wooded Place,'' a solo performed by Ms. Keithley, will serve as a prologue. Tonight through Sunday at 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, at Second Avenue, East Village, (212) 674-8194. Tickets: $15.
DUNNING

* NEW YORK CITY BALLET Tonight's program looks like a winner, beginning as it does with a bit of Balanchine (''La Source,'' danced by Miranda Weese, Benjamin Millepied and Ashley Bouder), the company director Peter Martins's celebration of guest dancer Julio Bocca in the new ''Todo Buenos Aires'' (repeated tomorrow night and Sunday afternoon) and Christopher Wheeldon's ''Carnival of the Animals,'' starring John Lithgow as narrator and featuring a delicious cameo performance by Kyra Nichols in a villain's role (repeated Sunday afternoon). Another highlight promises to be Mr. Wheeldon's absorbing ''Polyphonia'' on Saturday afternoon. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m., New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, Manhattan, (212) 870-5570 or www
.nycballet.com. Tickets: $30.- $83. For availability of student rush tickets at $12, check the Web site or call (212) 870-7766. (Related review, Page 2.)

SPINNIN' RONIN This intriguingly named troupe, which merges modern dance, ballet, theatrical movement, hip-hop and the martial arts, will present ''Born in the shadow, Die in the shadow (To be a flower . . . The tale of NINJA),'' a narrative suite of dances choreographed by Tsuyoshi Kaseda, Mayuna Shimizu and Kazuma G. Motomura. Yumi Kurosawa will provide a live performance of koto music. Tonight and tomorrow at 8 p.m.; Sunday at 4 and 6:30 p.m., Dance Forum, 20 East 17th Street, Manhattan, (646) 379-3610. Tickets: $15.

SUNDAYS AT THREE: IN HONOR OF MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY Ten dancers from the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company will perform their own work in a tribute to the civil rights martyr, part of an informal series that includes post-performance discussion with the artists. Sunday at 3 p.m., 92nd Street Y Harkness Dance Center, 1395 Lexington Avenue, at 92nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 415-5500. Tickets: $10.

CASSIE TERMAN AND SHINICHI MOMO KOGA Ms. Terman, who worked for 14 years with Ruth Zaporah, and Mr. Koga, a Butoh dancer, filmmaker and director, will enter the empty stage and build an evening-long work from their first gestures in 'The Smallest Country: Duet Improvisation.' Tomorrow and Sunday at 8 p.m., Center for Remembering and Sharing, 123 Fourth Avenue, Manhattan, (510) 915-3883. Tickets: $12.-15.

JULIE TOLENTINO Ms. Tolentino will perform ''For You,'' a free program of improvisations developed with Ori Flomin, but only for one audience member at a time. Appointments must be scheduled, for time slots through Jan. 23, with each caller specifying not only the time but music and viewing positions for this site-specific dance installation, which lasts 15 minutes. Those without appointments may watch a live video feed projected on another part of the performing space. Appointments may be made during gallery hours, Wednesday through Sunday, from noon to 7 p.m. Participant Inc., 95 Rivington Street between Ludlow and Orchard Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 254-4334.
DUNNING

ANTONIETTA VICARIO MAKES DANCES In ''hyperThermia,'' Ms. Vicario creates a movement installation performed in the round concerning five women's journey through Siberia. The work is presented in a bare space, and the dancers create their own accompaniment through whispers, breathing and hysterical noises. Tonight, tomorrow and Sunday at 8, Chez Bushwick, 304 Boerum Street, Bushwick, Brooklyn, (718) 383-6409. Tickets: $10.
JACK ANDERSON

* LULA WASHINGTON DANCE COMPANY New Yorkers don't get many chances to see the work and company of this quietly innovative Los Angeles-based modern dance choreographer, whose blend of African and modern dance, ballet and performance art often expresses political and social commentary in the form of a folk tale, with humor and passion. Go for it. Tomorrow at 7 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722. Tickets: $18; $9 for children 14 and younger.
DUNNING

A selective listing by critics of The Times: New or noteworthy art, design and photography shows at New York museums and galleries this weekend. At many museums, children under 12 and members are admitted free. Addresses, unless otherwise noted, are in Manhattan. Most galleries are closed on Sundays and Mondays, but hours vary and should be checked by telephone. Gallery admission is free unless noted. * denotes a highly recommended show.

Museums

* 'THE AZTEC EMPIRE,' Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, through Feb. 13. When a big survey of Aztec art opened in London in 2002, everybody flipped out. It was one of the hottest ancient-art events since Tutankhamen. Now an expanded version of the London show is at the Guggenheim, and it's a stunner. Objects from pre-Aztec Mexico set the stage, but it is material from the bloody-minded, deity-besotted Aztec culture that fills the museum's darkened ramps. Set on jutting platforms and dark recesses are a skull-headed earth goddess in a skirt of writhing snakes, a warrior metamorphizing into a bird and a god of spring and fertility shedding his skin. Funky clay images of domestic life alternate with ultrasophisticated gold jewelry. The show may be a little too heavy on theater and too light on information, but it's totally mesmerizing. Hours: Saturdays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; Fridays, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $18; $15, students and 65+.
HOLLAND COTTER

'BLUE,' American Folk Art Museum, 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, through March 6. This cool, offbeat little show is made up of all-blue or mostly blue objects from the permanent collection, including, ceramics, quilts, Shaker ''gift drawings'' and some attractive portraits. In one dated around 1768, a proud young Newport, R.I., belle wears pricey pale blue silk. An 1830 watercolor of a boy named Frederick Buxton was done on the cheap. But while his blue suit has faded with time, his big, candid eyes are as blue as the day they were painted. They make a perfect conclusion to this chromatic take on American social history. Hours: Tuesdays through Sundays, 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays, 10:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Admission: $9; students, 62+, $7.
COTTER

* 'CHINA: DAWN OF A GOLDEN AGE, 200-750 A.D.,' the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 23. Almost all of the 350 objects in this splendid and rigorous exhibition are straight from China. But the show is far less about trophy archaeology than about history or about how archaeology is shaped into history. Most of the objects, of gold, silver, bronze, lacquer and ceramic, are small but absolutely riveting. And the guiding theme -- that China, far from being a pure, monolithic source from which peripheral cultures drew, took from the larger world at least as much as it gave -- has everything to say to our own multicultural time. Hours: Sundays, Tuesdays through Thursdays, 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays until 9 p.m. Admission: $15; 65+, $10; students, $7.
COTTER

JAMES GILLRAY, New York Public Library, Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street, (212) 869-8089, through Jan. 29. One of the most popular cartoonists of his day, Gillray (1756-1815) produced lively, hand-colored etchings that lampooned major public figures like the king, the queen and Napoleon, and many minor ones, too. At his best, Gillray's draftsmanly skill and visionary imagination puts him in a league with artists like William Blake, James Ensor and R. Crumb. Hours: Tuesdays and Wednesdays, 11 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.; Thursdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission: Free.
KEN JOHNSON

'I WANNA BE LOVED BY YOU: PHOTOGRAPHS OF MARILYN MONROE,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, through March 20. Monroe was of the great movie stars of the 20th century, but does that make her a good subject for a museum show? Fans might enjoy the almost 200 photographs from a private collection presented in this exhibition, but though many are by famous photographers, including Richard Avedon, Cecil Beaton and Henri Cartier-Bresson, the show as a whole is like a walk-in special issue of People magazine: diverting but superficial and enervating. Hours: Wednesdays to Fridays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 11 p.m. on the first Saturday of every month). Admission: $8; students and 65+, $4.
JOHNSON

* 'RETRATOS: 2,000 YEARS OF LATIN AMERICAN PORTRAITS,' El Museo del Barrio, 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, through March 20. Two millenniums is a lot of terrain for even a survey cover, and this one moves from pre-Columbian sculpture to contemporary painting. It starts with a 16th-century portrait of three dark-skinned men, descendants of Indians and African slaves, wearing European ruffed collars, silks and distinctly un-European gold lip-rings and nose plugs and continues with images of bewigged colonial officials, flower-crowned nuns, and everyday people. Together they distill the essence of a multicultural continent, and of a society built on minutely calibrated hierarchies of race and class. Hours: Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Thursdays, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission: $8; $5, students and 65+; free for members; Thursdays free from 4 to 8 p.m.; 65+ free all day Thursdays.
COTTER

* 'WILD: FASHION UNTAMED,' the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through March 13. This sumptuous assemblage of fur, feathers, leather and such used to keep humans warm, make them look good and ratchet up their social status displays more than 100 costumes and accessories by big-name designers, from the House of Worth to Karl Lagerfeld. The symbols of wealth, status and sexuality run from the maximal white swan's-down coat, plucked from male swan breasts and owned by Marlene Dietrich, to the minimal bikini recently wrought of badger fur by Jordan Betten, a reprise of the next-to-nothing get-up that revealed most of Raquel Welch in the 1966 film ''One Million Years B.C.'' The show, certainly one of the most politically incorrect exhibitions the Met has ever mounted, confidently assures us in its catalog that animal-rights protests peaked in the 1980's and that since the mid-90's we have seen a revival of wearer interest in fur in its natural state. Hmmm. Hours and admission: see above.
GRACE GLUECK

Galleries: Uptown

ROSWELL ANGIER, Gitterman, 170 East 75th Street, (212) 734-0868, through Jan. 29. In the early 1970's, this photographer explored a Boston netherworld called the Combat Zone where strip joints and other sex-related businesses flourished. His documentary pictures of strippers and pimps are not sensational but matter-of-fact, tender and sad. A more recent series studying street and bar life in Native American border towns in the Southwest is similarly humane and visually poetic.
JOHNSON

MILTON AVERY: 'ONRUSHING WAVES,' Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, through Jan. 29. The sea was always a painterly challenge for Avery (1885-1965) who saw it as a landscape of forms in endless free motion. This show of his seascapes from the 1920's through the 50's includes paintings, watercolors and a selection of his sketchbooks recording trips to seaworthy places. The best of the canvases here are the later ones, larger and much closer to abstraction, done in Provincetown summers. ''Onrushing Wave,'' which gives the show its title, is a white field stroked with horizontal dashes of off-blue; in the foreground is a mountainous white crest that confronts the viewer head on, vertically striated with the same blue. At the painting's bottom, rows of tiny blue ripples giver whispering echo to the upheaval above them. These works stay fresh no matter how often you've seen them.

'PAESAGGIO: ITALIAN LANDSCAPE PHOTOGRAPHY,' Keith De Lellis Gallery, 47 East 68th Street, (212) 327-1482, through Feb. 12. After World War II, as Italian filmmakers were making the neo-Realist masterpieces that became classic Italian cinema, still photographers hungrily trained their lenses on the landscape, recording countryside and cities as they recovered from the devastation of Facism and war. The 48 images in this show, mostly from the 1950's and 60's, are the work of 16 photographers, in modes from traditional to far out. Mario Giacommelli shoots abstract patterns made by farmed and tilled earth; much more in the romantic tradition is Antonio Amaduzzi's lyrical landscape involving a lone tree, a puffy white cloud and a line of grassy earth, invaded by the tiny figures of an embracing couple leaning against the trunk.

Galleries: 57th Street

JIM GOLDBERG: 'TWO STORIES,' Pace/MacGill, 32 East 57th Street, (212) 759-7999, through Jan. 29. For a series of photographic portraits called ''Rich and Poor'' that he made in the late 70's and early 80's, Mr. Goldberg had his visibly rich or poor subjects write their thoughts on the prints. The vivid sense of real persons that emerges is as compelling as anything you might learn about wealth or poverty. Another project, a kind of wrap-around bulletin board, is obscurely autobiographical.

Galleries: SoHo

SU-MEI TSE, Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441, through Jan. 22. This exhibition features the work that won the prize for best national pavilion -- Luxembourg's -- at the 2003 Venice Bienale. It consists of a white neon sign that reads ''[E:r] conditionne,'' and two dreamlike video projections. In one, the artist plays the cello on a grassy, alpine prominence; in the other, men in green janitorial uniforms in a desert use green-bristled brooms to sweep sand into small piles.

* 'RICHARD TUTTLE: IT'S A ROOM FOR 3 PEOPLE,' the Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, through Feb. 26. ''Villages'' is what Mr. Tuttle calls the five separate installations in this knotty but sparkling show of recent work. Each consists of a sculpture and two series of small drawings or paintings; no distinction is made. Each series is internally linked by a visual motif or color. The results are enchanting. They disarm aesthetic pretensions like Genius, Beauty and Greatness. They offer an adult way of seeing art and the world with a child's fresh eye. And the world according to Tuttle is a singularly rich one, minutely detailed, culturally broad, exotic and familiar, cosmopolitan and home-grown.

Galleries: Chelsea

ROZ CHAST: 'SEASON'S GREETINGS,' Julie Saul, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-2410. through Jan. 29. For her first New York gallery exhibition, this brilliant cartoonist presents recent cartoons, many of which have appeared in The New Yorker, and a set of eggs brightly painted according to a traditional Ukrainian craft. The eggs bearing images of funny-looking people are amusing, but they don't compete with the cartoons' hilarious and uncannily acute take on the conflicted psychic life of ordinary, white, liberal Americans.
JOHNSON

'CONSTRUCTED IMAGE,' Kent, 541 West 25th Street, (212) 627-3680, through Jan. 29. Though not quite convincing as a theme show, this 15-artist exhibition presents some compelling works, including a small, extraordinarily life-like bronze head with glass eyes by Elizabeth King; a haunting Pop-surrealist painting of an old boxer by Llyn Foulkes; a large collage portrait of a woman made of neatly inlaid pieces of road maps by Matthew Cusick and a bizarrely erudite, diagrammatic painting about the Grand Guignol Theater by Paul Laffoley.
JOHNSON

'THE FURNITURE OF POUL KJAERHOLM AND SELECTED ART WORK,' Sean Kelly, 528 West 29th Street, (212) 239-1181; R 20th Century, 82 Franklin Street, (212) 343-7979, through Jan. 29. The market-accelerated convergence of art and design proceeds apace with this two-gallery exhibition of severely elegant, Modernist furniture by the Danish designer Poul Kjaerholm (1929-1980) with works by 19 contemporary artists from John Baldessari to Richard Tuttle providing background aesthetic resonance. Many of Kjaerholm's works look like anonymous airport furnishings, but the best have a finely detailed grace.
JOHNSON

KEITH HARING, Alona Kagan, 540 West 29th Street, (212) 560-0670, through Jan. 29. If you liked the New Museum's lively survey of the East Village scene of the 1980's, you will appreciate this selection of paintings and sculptures by one of the best artists to emerge from that cauldron of antic creativity. It includes subway drawings in chalk on black paper; large, dizzyingly patterned canvases and brightly enameled, cut-metal characters. Barking dogs, radiant babies, flying saucers, mythic monsters and all kinds of hyperactive humans animate Haring's delirious cosmic comedy.
JOHNSON

'ED RUSCHA, ROBERT FRANK, WALKER EVANS,' Yancey Richardson, 535 West 22nd Street, (646) 230-9610, through Jan. 29. A fine synergy is generated by this selection of pictures by photographers from three distinct generations. All share an understated, sometimes ironic, sometimes mordantly romantic love for vernacular American culture of the street and the open road. The show includes late Polaroid shots of commercial and traffic signs by Evans; examples from Mr. Frank's beatnik-era masterpiece ''The Americans'' and aerial views of parking lots by Mr. Ruscha.
JOHNSON

FRATELLI TOSO, Edward Thorp, 210 11th Avenue, (212) 691-6565, through Jan. 22. Fratelli Toso was a Murano glass-making factory in Venice that operated from 1823 to 1979. This beautiful show presents bottles, vases and bowls made in the murrine technique in which round slices of multi-colored glass canes are melded together before the final shape is blown. The woozy, richly colorful and intensely detailed floral and starburst patterns are riveting to look at and each object is a marvel of luxurious sensuousness. Visual hedonists take note.
JOHNSON

THOMAS ALLEN: 'UNCOVERED,' Foley, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 244-9081, through Feb. 5. Mr. Allen creates ''pop-up'' scenarios by cutting and folding selected figures from the covers of old paperbacks and other books; he then makes surprisingly dimensional color photographs of them. The screaming man at the top of a leaning stack of books looks like he is about to fall off a cliff. In ''Thirst,'' a sultry woman reaches from the cover of one book for the liquor bottle held by the man on a nearby volume.

Other Galleries

FRANZ ACKERMANN, 'NONSTOP WITH HHC,' Gavin Brown's Enterprise, 620 Greenwich Street, West Village, (212) 627-5258, through Jan. 22. This Berlin-based painter who was shortlisted for the 2004 Hugo Boss Prize, has produced a characteristically enveloping, high-energy environment of mural painting and variously sized canvases and works on paper centered around a giant, free-standing, Pop-Cubist style painting apparently representing a crashed airplane. Altogether it makes for a lively but grandiose commentary on the thrills and terrors of globalized modernity.
JOHNSON

* A. BALASUBRAMANIAM, Talwar Gallery, 108 East 16th Street, (212) 673-3096, through Jan 22. The work of this exceptional young artist, based in India, is about the play of material solidity and illusion. His first show at Talwar two years ago included a full-size human form that seemed to pass through a gallery wall; for the current show he has cast his own head in an opaque, waxy substance of a kind used to produce air fresheners, so that the self-portrait will dissolve through slow evaporation. Time and change are also the subjects of other work here. And the whole, spare, resonant show comes together in a sculpture of a single slender branch bristling with sharp thorns and cast in solid gold; the more alluring illusion is, the more be painful it can be.

'FIGHT OR FLIGHT,' Whitney Museum of American Art at Altria, 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, through Feb. 18. Six artists were asked to make works about fear and anxiety. Excepting Rico Gatson's kaleidoscopic video punctuated by exploding bombs, none directly address war or terrorism. Amy Gartrell's psychedelic felt banners spoof self-affirmation mantras, Kristin Baker's semiabstract paintings evoke car crashes and Marc Swanson's ship mast with a square sail of stitched-together T-shirts encourages a spirit of adventure. Little carnivorous horses graze on the flesh of a fallen dragon in Ivan Witenstein's large fantasy sculpture and an installation by Wangechi Mutu stages a surrealistic shootout.
JOHNSON

'NYC,' DFN Gallery, 176 Franklin Street, TriBeCa, (212) 334-3400, through Jan. 29. This selection of New York City-scapes by more than 40 painters is uneven but has many good things, including: a picture of the Columbia University green from 1975 by Rackstraw Downes; a small, Whistleresque study of office building windows by Alex Katz; a dreamy vision of a Cony Island roller coaster by David Levine; and a finely detailed, overhead picture of an intersection painted in egg tempera by Douglas Safranek with the tender exactitude of an early Renaissance master.

Last Chance

'ART IN A MIRROR: COUNTERPROOFS OF MARY CASSATT,' Adelson Galleries, 25 East 77th Street, (212) 439-6800, closing today. These recently discovered counterproofs would seem to be of more interest to Cassatt scholars than to the general public. Like some of her Impressionist colleagues, notably Degas, Cassatt (1844-1926) made them by the simple method of pressing a damp sheet of paper on the face of existing work -- here, pastels -- transferring a mirror image of the original, but faded and softened. The 48 shown, sweet portraits of mothers with infants, children alone or posing with pets, and an occasional less treacly one, pale by comparison with the sharp chromatics of Cassatt's wonderful prints.

RICHARD JACKSON: 'DICK'S PICTURES,' Haswellediger, 465 West 23rd Street, (212) 206-8955, through tomorrow. 'THE THREE BEARS,' Foundation 20 21, 15 Gamercy Park, (212) 473-4447, through Jan. 22. A California-based neo-Dadaist, Mr. Jackson constructs absurd painting machines. A paint-spattered room at Haswellediger is the result of a performance in which the artist poured paint in through a window while the motor-driven floor of the room revolved. Also on view is a grotesquely altered deer decoy for hunters into which Mr. Jackson pumped differently colored paints. A third sculpture at Foundation 20 21 consists of three similarly abused bear decoys.
JOHNSON

ROGER BROWN, Adam Baumgold, 74 East 79th Street, (212) 861-7338, closing tomorrow. Roger Brown (1941-1997) was one of the most original artists to emerge from Chicago after World War II. He blended influences from Indian miniature painting, Giorgio DiChirico, Grant Wood, outsider art and old comics to create mysteriously enchanting landscapes and cityscapes populated by tiny, silhouetted people. The nine canvases dating from 1968 to 1982 on view here are the first Brown exhibition to be presented in New York in 10 years.
JOHNSON

AMY ELLINGSON: 'SEMPER AUGUSTUS,' Charles Cowles, 537 West 24th Street, (212) 741-8999, closing tomorrow. This California-based artist's first New York solo show presents paintings that are optically enthralling and sensuously tactile. Ms. Ellingson generates complex, layered patterns of gridded ovals on a computer, and converts them into satiny, subtly color-coordinated oil-painted fields, on top of which she applies grids of thick, white or black ovals made in encaustic.
JOHNSON

'GREAT EXPECTATIONS: JOHN SINGER SARGENT PAINTING CHILDREN,' Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, closing on Sunday. Primarily known for his dashing portraits of high-born ladies sumptuously decked out, Sargent painted other subjects, too, not least among them children. This show, presenting about 40 works, has large ambitions. A major one is exploring how Sargent's likenesses tied in with the changing notions of childhood at the end of the 19th century, when children began to be regarded as distinctive personalities in their own right. One chillingly stylized canvas, ''Lady Warwick and Her Son'' (1905), is almost a parody of the Grand Manner style perfected by Sir Joshua Reynolds and company. It shows the regal, elegantly gowned aristocrat in a fakey forest setting with her too-pretty, overdressed small son seated on the base of a marble column. Hours and admission: see above.
GLUECK

'MATERIAL AS METAPHOR,' Tanya Bonakdar, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 414-4144, closing tomorrow. An exhibition of works that are emphatically physical yet poetic includes comically anthropomorphic sculptures by Miroslaw Balka; a darkly surrealistic sculptural landscape by Mark Manders; an arrangement of mostly yellow found and hand-made objects by Ian Kiaer; roses wrapped in spirals of puffy white cotton by Valeska Soares; elegantly spare fabric works by Helen Mirra; and lumps of fat in a cardboard box by Joseph Beuys.
JOHNSON

'ISAMU NOGUCHI: MASTER SCULPTOR,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, closing on Sunday. In this well-planned chronicle of Noguchi's lifelong engagement with three-dimensional form, the highlight is a stunning gallery devoted to his anthropomorphic sculptures from the 1940's -- bony-looking vertical articulations that are surreal abstractions of body traits and attitudes. Cut mostly from thin slabs of marble or wood, the cleverly joined parts are notched to fit into each other without benefit of glue, nails or other fixatives. They form a quintessentially Noguchi synthesis of the human and totemic. A small gallery displays the quirky abstract sculptures he called ''Lunars'' that, rigged out with light bulbs in odd places, made lamps of a fine, goofy sci-fi quality that must have seemed off the wall in 1943. The show does not neglect his monumental pieces, solar discs in stone; low-lying carved stone landscapes, and the sleek ''Bow'' of 1970, an elegantly bent tube composed of alternate bands of black granite and yellow marble Hours: Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Fridays, 1 to 9 p.m. Admission: $12; $9.50, students and 62+.

JENNIFER PASTOR: 'THE PERFECT RIDE,' Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, closing on Sunday. ''The Perfect Ride'' is a trio of works displayed in the Whitney's small first-floor gallery: a three-minute, slow-motion animated cartoon of a cowboy riding a bucking bull; a model of the human ear; and a large, semiabstract sculpture of aluminum and clear plastic that represents Hoover Dam. All three involved the flow and circulation of energy, but beyond that it is hard to say what Ms. Pastor has in mind with this exceedingly cool and cerebral exhibition. Hours and admission: see above.
JOHNSON

'GILBERT STUART,' Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, closing on Sunday. Known today mostly for his multiple images of George Washington, 14 of which are shown here, Stuart (1755-1828) painted many other faces, famous and not, as seen in this full-blown retrospective. Among them were Thomas Jefferson; John and Abigail Adams; the fur magnate John Jacob Astor; John Jay, first chief justice of the United States; the painters Joshua Reynolds, Benjamin West and John Singleton Copley; and doctors, lawyers, clergymen and countless British and American blueboods, their wives, children and dogs. The last Stuart retrospective was held nearly 40 years ago; this one reveals for a new generation that he was and remains one of our greatest American painters. Hours and admission: see above.

HEADLINE: Foreign-Profit Tax Break Is Outlined

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
The Bush administration outlined rules on Thursday for a huge one-time tax break for companies that reinvest their overseas profits back into the United States.
 The tax break, which was part of last year's corporate tax bill, would allow companies to pay a fraction of the normal tax rate on hundreds of billions of dollars in foreign profits if they pledge to invest the funds in activities that may create jobs at home.
 In a setback for many of the biggest potential beneficiaries, the Treasury Department said companies could not use their windfalls for repurchases of stock or increases in shareholder dividends.
 Investors reacted with disappointment to the new rules. Stocks of companies that pushed hard for the tax break -- Eli Lilly, Hewlett-Packard, Merck, Oracle and Pfizer -- all declined slightly after the rules were announced. 
 The rules would help companies finance some activities that do little to directly increase employment, and a few -- like corporate acquisitions -- that might lead to job cuts.
 The Treasury Department said that the tax break could be used to finance advertising and marketing, even if a company did not plan to increase its advertising. 
 The administration said companies could also use their foreign profits to pay for corporate acquisitions, redeem old debt and spend on the general purpose of ''financial stabilization.''
 As adopted by Congress last year, the new law would give companies a one-time opportunity this year to bring a total of as much as $500 billion in foreign profits into the United States and pay a tax rate of 5.25 percent, instead of the standard corporate tax rate of 35 percent.
 Globe-spanning companies like Hewlett-Packard and Eli Lilly have for years deferred their United States taxes on foreign earnings. 
 Under traditional tax law, the companies would be required to pay the full tax rate as soon as they brought the money back into the country.
 The one-time tax break would let companies take advantage of the lower rate if they put forward a plan to reinvest their profits in ways that enhance employment in the United States.
 The law itself was quite broad, explicitly allowing companies to allocate their money for ''financial stabilization,'' corporate acquisitions and research and development.
 The Treasury Department, which opposed the provision during the debate in Congress, gave companies even more latitude.
 Under the ''guidance'' published by the Internal Revenue Service on Thursday, companies do not face a specific deadline for actually reinvesting the money and merely have to do so within ''a reasonable time.'' 
 Nor do companies have to invest more money on hiring or new equipment, or even advertising, than they did the year before. Companies would be able to apply the tax break to investments that they had already planned before their new ''domestic reinvestment plan,'' and even to investments that they had already budgeted and planned to finance with other sources of money.
 ''The Treasury Department and the I.R.S. do not intend to provide a template for a domestic reinvestment plan,'' the administration said in its set of guidelines, which totals 39 pages.
 Despite the unenthusiastic response from investors to the new rules, the tax break could provide a huge windfall to many technology and pharmaceutical companies that have earned billions of dollars in low-tax countries like Ireland.
 Oracle, the business-software company, has estimated that its tax break on foreign profits could be as much as $650 million.
 Oracle is hoping to use much of that money to shore up its balance sheet after buying PeopleSoft last year for $10.4 billion.
 Many American multinational corporations have deferred taxes on foreign profits. Hewlett-Packard, which wants to strengthen its balance sheet after buying Compaq, has more than $14 billion in untaxed foreign profits. Merck, the pharmaceutical giant, had $15 billion as of 2003. Johnson & Johnson had $12.3 billion.
 Wall Street analysts are divided about whether the tax break will actually achieve its intended purpose of attracting a rush of new investment in the United States. 
 Anne Swope, a tax and foreign exchange analyst at J.P. Morgan, estimated that American companies had stockpiled more than $500 billion in overseas profits. 
 ''We feel confident that $300 billion of that will be repatriated,'' Ms. Swope said. ''The changes in tax law in 1986 made it extremely difficult for companies to repatriate earnings. This is an opportunity to provide temporary relief.''
 But Jan Hatzius, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs, predicted that the economic impact would be modest because companies have many ways to use their foreign profits without technically bringing them back into the country. 
 ''If companies want to access their foreign assets, it's easy to do,'' said Mr. Hatzius. ''All they have to do is borrow against them.''

HEADLINE: Klara Liden

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:

Reena Spaulings
371 Grand Street, Lower East Side
Through Feb. 7
 In her excellent solo debut, the young Swedish artist Klara Liden sings while playing the piano and performs a ballet in a Stockholm subway (both on video). In real space, she builds, from scavenged cardboard and thin iron pipes, a small elevated room that is comfortingly solid (once you get up the ladder), yet wonderfully translucent in the way it filters light.
 It doesn't sound like much, but it is. Ms. Liden is the real deal, possessed of a fierce, concentrated energy that infuses everything she does. She is as engaged with her time as she is with form and materials, and approaches both with a very real but elegant sense of economy.
 Announcements for this show were printed on squares of old newspaper. Her previous efforts include a bunker-like structure, available for anyone's use, that she surreptitiously built (from materials she found or recycled) on the Spree River in Berlin and an alternate postal service that she created and operated briefly in Stockholm.
 On ''550 Jamaica Avenue,'' one of the videos at Spaulings, the singing and piano playing, inept but heartfelt and not unpleasant, are heard as the camera roams through an astounding abandoned apartment that the artist found upstairs from her own in the Bed-Stuy section of Brooklyn. The place is a walk-in collage, full of stuff, rife with intimations of neglect and loss, yet charged with a sense of a full, eccentric, implicitly creative life. Who lived here? A man? A woman? It makes sense that when we briefly see the artist, or at least her bare back, bent over the keyboard, and again as she rides an exercise bike, her sex is unclear. The outpouring music pays tribute.
 A similar intensity pervades ''Paralyzed,'' the subway ballet, in which the artist, who took dancing lessons in this case, flings herself about the train car, shedding her outerwear, providing evening entertainment while also protesting the buttoned-down nature of everyday life, which is amply exemplified by her fellow passengers. The final shot, taken from the platform of a station, shows Ms. Liden running through the train as through a field of daisies.
 Inside the cozy, carefully built cardboard room five small photographs of buildings and sculptures line the wall. That one structure is easily identified as Ms. Liden's architectural handiwork attests to her clear vision backed by an equally clear style. ROBERTA SMITH

HEADLINE: China Urged, Again, to Protect Copyrights and Patents

BYLINE: By CHRIS BUCKLEY

DATELINE: BEIJING, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
Donald L. Evans ended his fourth and final visit to Beijing as the United States secretary of commerce on Thursday with the same demand he brought on three previous visits in the last three years: that China strengthen its protection of copyrights and patents.
 Mr. Evans's contention that China must do more to stamp out the unlicensed reproduction of software, industrial designs, drugs and other patented products has been a mantra of his visits to Beijing. This time, however, the courteous reception he has always received was mingled with signals of a more assertive China, impatient to have its own trade concerns addressed. 
 Those signals included a jocular but public swipe in front of television cameras on Wednesday by China's commerce minister, Bo Xilai, who awarded Mr. Evans 7 marks out of 10 for his tenure, a grudging approval in China. Mr. Bo stressed his disappointment that the United States had refused a formal recognition of China as a market economy. 
 Mr. Evans said in prepared remarks on Thursday that the issue of China's commercial practices was ''straining our trading relationship.'' He added, ''It's time for China's leaders to forcefully confront the problem'' posed by the theft of intellectual property rights.
 American trade officials, lawyers and companies generally agree that the message has not fallen on entirely deaf ears, and that China has developed an impressive arsenal of laws and rules to fight industrial piracy. But they also say those weapons are rarely used, and piracy remains as widespread in China as it was four years ago, if not more so. 
 ''The facts are that piracy and counterfeiting in China continues to increase,'' Mr. Evans said in an interview. He raised the example of the QQ, a minicar made by the Chinese company Chery that GM Daewoo, General Motors' South Korean operation, contends is a clone of its Chevrolet Spark design. Late last year, GM Daewoo announced it was suing Chery. The similarity between the two cars ''defies innocent explanation,'' Secretary Evans said at a news conference on Thursday.
 Estimates vary wildly of how much of China's industrial production involves unlawful copies of patents, trademarks and copyright. The Development Research Center, a Chinese government policy research institute, estimated in 2003 that the value of pirated goods made in China was $19 billion to $24 billion a year.
 Chinese officials said they were fighting commercial piracy more vigorously. They also said that the United States must accept that China is a huge, developing country where any change takes time.
 ''China's intellectual property protection doesn't have as long a history as the United States','' Jin Xu, the deputy head of the American affairs division of China's ministry of commerce, said in an interview, ''but we've been making the fastest progress in the world.'' He said China's current crackdown on counterfeit goods was ''unprecedentedly severe,'' citing a set of rules recently issued by China's highest court that he said made it easier to prosecute people making and selling pirated goods.
 American trade officials and lawyers, however, complained that the new judicial rules were vague and difficult to carry out. ''Everyone is disappointed, because we were expecting something stronger,'' James M. Zimmerman, a trade lawyer with Squire, Sanders & Dempsey in Beijing, said in an interview. 
 As in his previous visits, Mr. Evans and his staff stopped short of explicitly threatening to lodge a complaint against China's commercial piracy with the World Trade Organization, but held open that possibility.
 ''Without trying to raise speculation, there comes a point where we have to exercise our rights,'' Grant D. Aldonas, the under secretary of commerce in charge of international trade, said in an interview in Beijing.
 While tactfully acknowledging these complaints and threats, Chinese trade officials were also eager to stress their belief that the United States must pay more heed to China's trade concerns. ''The U.S. must understand China's importance to the United States' own economic development,'' Mr. Jin, the trade official, said. ''It shouldn't neglect us. We need more dialogue between us as equals.''

HEADLINE: Shares Fall as Oil Rises and G.M. Warns of Lower Profit

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks tumbled to fresh 2005 lows yesterday as oil prices climbed, stoking concerns of higher energy costs squeezing corporate profits, while General Motors provided a weaker profit outlook.
 General Motors, the world's largest car company and a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, fell 2.8 percent after it said that it expected earnings this year to fall, in part because of weaker profit from its financial services unit. G.M. also pushed back a longer-term profit target.
 Verizon Communications, the largest telecommunications company, also weighed on the Dow. Its shares dropped nearly 3 percent after several analysts lowered earnings estimates. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 111.95 points, or 1.05 percent, to 10,505.83. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 10.25 points, or 0.86 percent, to 1,177.45. The Nasdaq composite index was down 21.97 points, or 1.05 percent, at 2,070.56.
 The Dow and S.&P. closed at their lowest level in five weeks, while the Nasdaq was at its lowest in two months. It was the biggest one-day point drop for the Dow since a loss of 115.64 points, or 1.09 percent, on Nov. 19. For the S.&P. 500 and Nasdaq, it was the biggest decline since Jan. 4.
 ''I think the market's attention is focused on some of the headline macro issues,'' said Christine Callies, managing director and chief market strategist at Bessemer Trust. ''We've had some rebound in the energy market, which is probably stirring fears of a return to $55-a-barrel oil.'' 
 Economic data showing a large widening in the United States trade deficit in November, released Wednesday, were also ''off-putting,'' Ms. Callies said.
 Statistics released yesterday showed that the number of Americans filing initial claims for jobless pay grew unexpectedly last week, to 367,000.
 A bigger-than-expected rise in retail sales in December failed to give a lift to retail stocks. The government said retail sales rose 1.2 percent as car dealers, furniture stores and online retailers reported strong sales. The S.&P. retailing index fell 1.1 percent.
 Oil prices rose for a third consecutive day. Crude for February delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange shot up $1.67, to settle at $48.04 a barrel, a six-week high, amid forecasts for colder weather in the Northeast. 
 High oil prices damped equities in general, and particularly hurt industrial stocks. United Technologies, the diversified manufacturer, fell $1.34, to $100.60.
 Verizon dropped $1.13, or 2.7 percent, to $37.10. It said yesterday that pension and postretirement costs would rise by 10 cents to 14 cents a share in 2005 because of a change in interest rates.
 General Motors fell $1.07, to $37.32.
 A surge in shares of Apple Computer, a day after beating Wall Street estimates, failed to lift the Nasdaq.
 Apple jumped 6.6 percent, or $4.34, to $69.80, a day after reporting a quarterly profit that more than quadrupled on sharply higher sales of its iPod digital music players and strong demand for its PowerBook notebook PC's.
 Earlier, Apple's shares rose above $74, just short of a record reached in March 2000 at the height of the technology bubble. But its gain was not enough to fuel the Nasdaq.
 After the closing bell, Sun Microsystems fell nearly 7 percent, to $4.30, on the Inet electronic brokerage system, after reporting a small quarterly net profit, reversing a year-earlier loss, as costs narrowed even as revenue declined slightly. In regular trading, Sun closed at $4.58, down 3 cents.
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note rose 18/32, to a price of 100 22/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.16 percent from 4.23 percent on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: A Chinese Revaluation May Not Help U.S.

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: GUANGZHOU, China 

 BODY:
Nearly the size of an old station wagon, a bright orange machine here mashes plastic pellets into rows of six-inch-long blue clips for hospitals across the United States. Pan Guotao, a 29-year-old worker from a village in northern China, sits on a plastic stool next to the machine and wields a straight razor to slice apart the clips, which are used to hold ice packs in plastic sleeves.
 It looks like a simple operation, but it lies at the heart of the American trade deficit with China.
 The Bush administration and many private economists have urged that the authorities in Beijing allow China's currency, the yuan, to rise in value against the dollar. They want the Chinese to stop buying up dollars in large amounts and issuing more and more yuan to hold down the value of the currency. 
 But many Chinese and foreign executives in China say that a revaluation of the yuan, whose exchange value is linked to the dollar, is unlikely to be a silver bullet for dealing with the American deficit. Costs here are so low, they say, that a revaluation is unlikely to narrow the deficit appreciably, and might even increase it.
 China's edge in exports these days goes far beyond the low wages of Ms. Pan, who earns $1 an hour, with free room and board. Her employer, Charles M. Hubbs, who owns the plastics factory, calculates that the rent for his operation here, built by workers earning even less than Ms. Pan, is a quarter of what it would be in a city like Houston. Perhaps more important, China has learned to build factories and many kinds of equipment at a fraction of the cost in Western countries.
 The big orange plastic injection molding machine costs $18,000 here, compared with as much as $60,000 for American models; the Chinese-made machine breaks down a little more often, but can be quickly fixed because the assembly plant is less than two miles away. The costliest part, a specially hardened and shaped mold used to form the clips, runs less than $8,000, against $70,000 in the United States.
 Such savings leave Mr. Hubbs feeling insulated from even a big shift in the value of the yuan, which trades around 8.28 to the dollar. ''With the currency where it is today,'' he said, ''we can save 30 percent over our competition in the Caribbean easily.'' 
 Making the yuan more expensive against the dollar would mean that American exporters to China, like Boeing, could sell more goods. Importers like Wal-Mart would have to pay more for the toys, clothes and other goods they buy. That would give Wal-Mart and others an incentive to import from other nations, or even use American suppliers.
 Yet executives in many industries say that China's competitive advantages are so great that even the largest increase in the yuan that Beijing might approve this year, perhaps 10 percent, would not significantly cut into the American trade deficit with China. Indeed, revaluation is likely to increase the deficit for months and perhaps years, by immediately driving up the already considerable cost of what the United States imports from China.
 A stronger yuan would give a boost to American companies exporting to China because their goods would become cheaper here. But the United States now buys nearly five times as much from China as China does from the United States. So the gains from a rise in the smaller amount of exports are likely to be overwhelmed by the much higher cost of the larger amount of imports. 
 Alan G. Hassenfeld, the chairman of Hasbro, said that a revaluation of 3 percent to 5 percent this spring seems most likely. But that degree of change would not prompt toymakers to look seriously at moving production to lower-wage countries like Vietnam or India. Chinese toy factories, he said, had a big advantage over factories elsewhere in the quality and dedication of their workers and managers.
 Even a 25 percent increase in the value of the yuan, which few say they expect, would still allow many toymakers to export a wide range of products from China successfully. An increase that big would probably prompt manufacturers to move some of their bulkiest products, like car-racing sets, to countries closer to the United States to save on shipping costs, Mr. Hassenfeld said.
 ''You wouldn't run,'' he said, ''but you would take some items and move them back to a Mexico'' or some other nearby country.
 Companies, like toymakers, that use a lot of Chinese labor are the most likely to be affected by a stronger yuan. That is because the workers are paid in yuan, and wages are already rising in China -- even without an appreciating yuan.
 Daniel Chou, export manager at the Ningbo Keerdeng Toys Company near Shanghai, said its average assembly-line wages had nearly doubled in the last five years, to $181 a month from $97. His factory, unlike Mr. Hubbs's, does not provide free room and board. Space in a shared apartment nearby costs $12 a month and food, $30. Improving conditions in rural areas have left workers more reluctant to move to the cities unless they are paid more. 
 Ningbo Keerdeng has dealt with rising wages the same way as factories in advanced nations -- by automating and investing more in design. The company makes Santa dolls that push themselves across the floor on skis, and machines sew zippers and hems for the dolls' garments.
 It would take a much larger revaluation of the yuan to create a serious problem for the business, and few people expect that, Mr. Chou said. If the currency ''increases 15 percent, that would be very high, and 20 percent would be a disaster,'' he said.
 The Dandelion Greeting Card Company, in Yiwu, a city in southeastern China, has taken the same approach. The company's cards have delicate, intricate flowers glued to vases on the front and are promoted as handmade. But Zhu Songwei, the general manager, said that computer-controlled machines are now used to design, print and cut the material for the cards, improving quality, and that workers only glue on the flowers in a final step machines cannot affordably do.
 Mr. Zhu added that a revaluation of the yuan would ''not have much effect because we have better quality and design'' than other countries that also had low-wage workers gluing greeting cards. 
 The notable exception to corporate China's ability to withstand an increase in the yuan may be the industry that requires the most labor of all: apparel, especially low-end garments that involve a lot of very basic sewing that can be done by unskilled and even illiterate workers.
 Peter Peng, a manager at the Xiamen Point Light Industrial Company in southeastern China, which makes inexpensive knapsacks for children, said it would be ''a disaster'' if Beijing allowed the yuan to increase by 10 percent. A few competitors from Taiwan have already begun setting up operations in Vietnam to take advantage of the lower wages, he said.
 A rising yuan would also offer some consolation to a sizable number of Chinese exporters. Factories that are less labor-intensive, like auto parts and computers, tend to rely heavily on imported material, from oil to computer chips, and those imports are priced mostly in dollars. So a rise in the yuan would reduce the cost of their material. 
 Mr. Hubbs's business, Fortunique Ltd., buys various plastic resins from Saudi Arabia, Thailand and the United States, supplied by Exxon Mobil and Dow Chemical. He calculates that nearly a third of his total costs are incurred in dollars.
 Thus, in some ways, a stronger yuan might not only allow the Chinese to continue selling exports to Americans, but have a muted effect on the United States' relatively modest exports to this country. These totaled $25.06 billion in the first 11 months of 2004, compared with $114.19 billion in imports from China.
 The United States is strongest in exports of food, notably soybeans, and infrastructure equipment, like the big turbines that General Electric ships and the powerful digging equipment Caterpillar sells.
 American equipment makers do not compete directly with Chinese manufacturers in many products. The Chinese companies either do not produce the equipment at all or they produce equipment that is much inferior in quality. That limits the potential for the Americans to take advantage of a higher yuan to sell more products and take market share from the Chinese companies. 
 At the same time, China's demand for food is growing more slowly than for many other kinds of products. Although the Chinese are eating more meat, which requires more tons of animal feed than importing food for direct consumption, overall increases remain modest.
 Merle A. Hinrichs, chief executive of Global Sources, an online intermediary and catalog company for 140,000 overseas suppliers to the American market, the majority in China, said the company's surveys of consumer-goods industries had found no sign that anything short of a very large revaluation would make much difference. ''It has more of a perception impact than an actual impact,'' he said. ''It's not going to impact the actual trade a lot.''

HEADLINE: Overhauling Retirement Is Worth Risk, Cheney Says

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
Vice President Dick Cheney struck back on Thursday at critics of the administration's plan to overhaul Social Security, saying the cost of doing nothing was greater than the price of transforming the 70-year-old centerpiece of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal.
 In a speech at Catholic University, Mr. Cheney said critics of the plan to allow workers to divert part of their Social Security payroll taxes into personal investment accounts were wrong when they called it too risky.
 ''It's been suggested that many people would spend their retirement in poverty, because the investments they choose will be along the lines of lottery tickets, dice games and the racetracks,'' Mr. Cheney said. ''The answer to this concern, of course, is simply to set guidelines, basic standards of safety and soundness when it comes to investment choices.'' 
 Mr. Cheney also said that critics who make a broader argument that any kind of investment in the stock market is unwise for personal retirement should look at what he called ''real world'' experience. He said that a 25-year-old who invested $1,000 a year over 40 years at Social Security's 2 percent rate of return would end up with a little more than $61,000. He said the same investment over the same period in the stock market at its lowest historical rate of return would amount to $160,000.
 ''Over time, the securities markets are the best, safest way to build substantial savings through personal savings,'' Mr. Cheney said.
 The vice president did not address what is emerging as the central political issue of the Social Security debate: whether the creation of investment accounts would be accompanied by a substantial reduction in the guaranteed benefits paid by the government to future retirees. In recent weeks, the White House has signaled its support for changing the way the system would set the initial level of benefits for future retirees, a shift that would reduce initial benefits to levels well below what is promised by current law.
 Mr. Cheney's position is not known, but the vice president, who has been central in the formulation of the administration's Social Security proposal, is said by administration officials to be in favor of larger rather than smaller investment accounts.
 Republicans at this point are divided over whether to hold contributions to the proposed accounts to 2 percent of taxable income or to allow them to be as large as 6 percent. The White House is expected to offer specifics of its plan next month.
 Like President Bush, who held a ''Conversation on Social Security'' in Washington on Tuesday, Mr. Cheney painted a dire picture of the program's future if something was not done. He said that by 2042 the program would reach ''fiscal collapse,'' at which point the government would have no option ''other than to suddenly and dramatically reduce benefit payments by over 25 percent, or to impose a massive, economically ruinous tax increase on all American workers.''
 Many Democrats and economists say that the administration is fear mongering and that Social Security could be fixed with modest tax increases and a cut in benefits. 
 But Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney have made an overhaul of Social Security the central proposal of their ''ownership society,'' a slogan that sums up a Republican philosophy that promises to give individuals more control over their financial lives, particularly retirement and health care. Critics say the philosophy would mean assuming far more economic risk.
 Mr. Cheney also asserted in his speech that the projected shortfall in Social Security ''exceeds $10 trillion,'' which is the amount of promised benefits that will exceed revenues. But that figure refers to a calculation of the shortfall over what economists call ''an infinite time horizon,'' a concept that is the subject of intense debate. The standard figure for the shortfall, used by the Social Security trustees, is $3.7 trillion over 75 years.

HEADLINE: In Europe, a Shift: Euro Crisis? What Euro Crisis?

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Jan. 13 

 BODY:
Europeans, many of whom worked themselves up about the swooning dollar and the stampeding euro last year, suddenly seem to have mellowed, as the dollar has rebounded in recent weeks.
 Public and private comments by central bankers and other officials here have been noticeably more relaxed since the beginning of January, when the dollar reversed its relentless decline against the euro -- even though economists caution that underlying trends have not changed.
 The European Central Bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2 percent on Thursday, and its president, Jean-Claude Trichet, delivered a more sanguine message about growth prospects and inflation.
 ''The environment has changed a little,'' Mr. Trichet said at a news conference in Frankfurt. He noted that the recent decline in oil prices had eased inflationary pressure and removed another hurdle to growth. 
 ''While short-term inflationary pressures persist, they have recently diminished somewhat,'' Mr. Trichet declared, adding, ''the conditions remain in place for economic growth to proceed.''
 The European Central Bank has tried to avoid being buffeted by the daily swings in the currency markets, resisting pressure last month to reduce interest rates, as the euro set daily records against the dollar. European exporters complain that this has depressed their sales in the United States.
 On Thursday, Mr. Trichet reiterated that sharp currency moves were unwelcome and undesirable for growth. But his otherwise relaxed tone suggested that for now, the euro was a manageable problem.
 ''What central bankers really hate is a very quick appreciation in their currency,'' said Jorg Kramer, a senior economist at the HVB Group in Munich. ''The speed of the euro's appreciation has come down somewhat, so they are a bit more relaxed.''
 Mr. Kramer and other economists warn that the dollar's rebound is probably a technical correction rather than a lasting shift. Most expect the euro to resume its upward course against the dollar, especially since the United States reported a record trade deficit and Asian countries, notably China, show few signs of letting their currencies appreciate against the dollar.
 But even at an exchange rate of $1.36, which the euro reached on Dec. 30, most economists say the pressure on European exporters is bearable (on Thursday, the euro declined slightly, to $1.3203).
 Germany reported on Thursday that its exports grew 8.2 percent last year, which drove the economy to a growth rate of 1.1 percent in 2004. While the strong euro cut into exports to the United States, Germany was able to offset that with robust shipments to other European countries and Asia.
 ''I'm not sure anymore whether the euro-dollar rate is such an enormous hurdle, especially for German industry,'' said Thomas Mayer, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank in London.
 The recent wage agreements negotiated by German companies like Siemens and Volkswagen made German industry more competitive, Mr. Mayer said. Italy and Spain, which have not undergone such a process, are feeling the effects of the currency on their exports more acutely.
 For the first time in years, economists are starting to speak of Germany as a potential engine of growth for Europe, rather than a dragging anchor. Retail sales picked up here over the Christmas holiday season, and surveys of German business confidence turned up sharply in December.
 The recovery of the dollar has also shifted many Europeans' gaze from the United States to Asia. While European leaders were calling on the United States to tackle its trade and budget deficits last month, they are now calling on the Asians to allow their currencies to rise.
 ''There is a need for emerging Asia to go progressively in the direction of perhaps progressive and orderly appreciation,'' Mr. Trichet said, echoing comments made by the central bank's chief economist, Otmar Issing.
 The change in tone, economists say, is also a response to recent comments by the American Treasury secretary, John W. Snow, about the need to reduce the budget deficit in the United States. Mr. Trichet, among other officials, said he took Mr. Snow's remarks very seriously.
 There is still plenty of skepticism here about the readiness of the United States to confront the deficit or stanch the fall of the dollar, especially since a weak dollar benefits American exporters. But after months of frustration, some here are choosing to look on the bright side.
 ''Europe has worried so much about the fiscal situation in the United States, much more than anyone in the U.S. worries about it,'' said Holger Schmieding, a European economist at Bank of America in London. ''This is one area where sentiment is changing a bit.''

HEADLINE: Resetting His Sights, Rival Aims At Miller

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD; Winnie Hu contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Representative Anthony D. Weiner, a congressman building a campaign for mayor, criticized a Democratic rival, City Council Speaker Gifford Miller, yesterday for negative campaigning and siding with the mayor on tax increases.
 It was something of a turnabout for Mr. Weiner, who until now has almost exclusively saved his criticism for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. His remarks fed the first dust-up among the several Democrats jockeying for the party's nomination in a battle that is suddenly becoming more spirited. 
 Asked to respond to an internal memo distributed within the Miller camp that suggested lines of attacks on the other Democratic candidates, including criticizing Mr. Weiner as an ineffectual congressman, Mr. Weiner fired back with barbs, explicit and thinly veiled.
 ''Perhaps when I talk about out-of-touch Upper East Side rich guys, you can think I am talking about him,'' Mr. Weiner said with a grin when he was asked about the memo after a speech on his economic goals. Mr. Miller represents the Upper East Side in the City Council.
 The congressman then suggested there was division in Mr. Miller's camp about whether to attack other candidates, saying, ''Some reporter should ask him which side of the debate within his campaign he is on.''
 But he then sought to rise above the fray. ''I think one of the things we need to be sensitive to is I think we need the next mayor to have a positive, forward looking, five-borough strategy that focuses on what the people of the five boroughs and working people of New York need,'' he said. ''If he believes it's going to be advanced by attacking one candidate or another, I don't believe the debate does get advanced that way.''
 Mr. Miller sought to distance himself from the memo, whose existence was first reported yesterday in The New York Times, saying it represented ''unsolicited proposals and advice.'' The memo, circulated among top aides to Mr. Miller and given to The Times by one of his supporters, also suggested that the Council speaker attack the former Bronx borough president Fernando Ferrer. 
 ''Look, I'm a positive person,'' Mr. Miller told reporters outside City Hall. ''I have a positive vision for what I want to accomplish to make this a stronger city, and it's the work that I've been doing the last three years. Were I to decide to make a run for mayor, I would run a positive campaign.''
 Mr. Miller declined to elaborate on the memo and its origins, saying: ''Everybody that's around campaigns knows that you get a lot of unsolicited advice. I think that the right thing to do is to stand up for people and people's priorities, and that's what I intend to do.''
 Mr. Weiner's speech, at the New School for Social Research and attended by dozens of journalists and professors, reiterated his position that a new football stadium for the New York Jets should be built in Queens instead of on the West Side as Mr. Bloomberg has proposed.
 Matthew Higgins, a Jets vice president, said the notion of moving to Queens was akin to ''beating a dead horse.''
 ''Although 60 elected officials recognize the sports and convention center will generate millions in new tax revenue,'' he said, ''it's somehow lost on Congressman Weiner, who would rather play politics with thousands of jobs for New Yorkers in all five boroughs.''
 Mr. Weiner said that Mr. Bloomberg had shortchanged the boroughs outside Manhattan, and he promised a renewed focus there.
 He also called the $400 property tax rebate last year political ''gimmickry'' that did not help a majority of taxpayers and suggested that the mayor and Council were not being straight with voters about the city's budget problems.
 Mr. Weiner said the packaging of the checks resembled campaign material and would lead a lot of homeowners to ''say I'm going to throw it away like a lot of my constituents do because they think it's a campaign advertisement.''
 ''And they will say something else: They will say, does the mayor and does the City Council really think I'm stupid?'' Mr. Weiner said, suggesting that the tax increase of the previous year was not necessary.
 Edward Skyler, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, said that the mayor had highlighted several economic development projects outside Manhattan in his State of the City speech this week and that the tax rebate was a product of smart budgeting.
 ''The mayor made the tough decisions necessary to lead the city out of the fiscal crisis, and now that the economy is growing, we can reward those who sacrificed when we needed them,'' Mr. Skyler said.

HEADLINE: Reform Effort At Businesses Feels Pressure

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
Martha Stewart is in prison. Richard M. Scrushy, former chief executive of HealthSouth, is sitting through jury selection at his fraud trial. Next week, Bernard J. Ebbers, the former head of WorldCom, will do the same in a court in Manhattan, as will L. Dennis Kozlowski, the former Tyco chief being retried on grand larceny charges. And if all goes according to plan, later this year Enron's top managers, including Kenneth L. Lay, its former chairman, will be on trial in Houston, charged with a raft of crimes related to that company's demise. 
 It must seem, at least to courthouse watchers, that the sweeping effort to clean up corporate America begun over three years ago in the aftermath of the Enron collapse is still going strong, perhaps even picking up steam. But in the boardroom and executive suites, away from the gavels and juries, a different tale has begun to emerge. 
 The white-hot movement to overhaul corporate governance has cooled in recent months in Washington and beyond, according to lawyers, institutional shareholders, executives, directors and other experts. On that there is much agreement. But the interpretations of this sudden, little-discussed shift vary widely. 
 Some experts complain that reform is slowing just as it is reaching what they say is a critical stage, while others argue that the change is the natural consequence of an effort that went too far in the first place.
 ''The pendulum has begun to swing back,'' said John C. Coffee Jr., a securities law professor at Columbia University Law School. ''We are now seeing the counterreaction to the reform movement of the last few years.''
 What has emerged, experts from many sides of the issue said, is an intensifying battle over future efforts to revamp corporate governance further. It is one that pits influential members of the business community, including giant organizations like the United States Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, against institutional investors pushing for greater power over the direction of troubled companies. And it is an effort to handcuff regulators who, from the time of Enron until just the last few months, have been able to issue new directives with little fear of confrontation.
 The result, these experts said, is that 2005 could prove to be critical in determining which rules truly become embedded as part of the legal framework governing the future of how American business does its job.
 ''With the level of the pushback and the momentum that the business community has,'' said Ann Yerger, executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors, ''this is a very important year in terms of holding on to what we have and protecting what we have achieved in corporate reforms.'' 
 Executives and other representatives of the business world agree that a change of attitude has taken hold, although they say that the shift is merely curbing the excesses of regulation. They bemoan a combination of heightened action by agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission, aggressive enforcement efforts by state attorneys general like Eliot Spitzer in New York, and intensified litigation by plaintiffs' lawyers, who recently have begun to see new success with settlements that held directors of WorldCom and Enron personally liable. 
 ''The pendulum has gone too far,'' said David Hirschmann, a senior vice president who serves as point man at the Chamber of Commerce in Washington on the top issues facing American businesses. ''There have been some unintended consequences that are having significant negative impacts on our economy, and we need to fix those aspects that weren't done right.'' 
 Mr. Hirschmann said that the unintended consequences have included unnecessary expenditures by companies to meet the bureaucratic demands of new rules, decisions by companies to postpone certain technology purchases to avoid running afoul of new compliance requirements, and a decline in the number of foreign companies willing to list on American stock exchanges. Indeed, the New York Stock Exchange has reported a drop-off in new foreign listings in recent years, including the loss of one giant initial public offering for Air China, whose executives were reported to chafe under the rigorous new demands in the American market.
 None of this means that corporate America will be returning to the complacency of the pre-Enron days. And indeed, the criminal and civil pursuit of corporate wrongdoers continues at a breakneck pace. 
 The Justice Department's Corporate Fraud Task Force, formed by executive order of the president in the immediate aftermath of the WorldCom debacle, has racked up an impressive series of victories. By June 2004, the latest period for which full statistics are available, the task force had obtained more than 500 corporate fraud convictions or guilty pleas, and charged more than 900 defendants, including more than 60 top corporate officers, with various types of fraud. During that period, the S.E.C. filed almost 600 separate civil enforcement actions involving financial fraud or reporting. 
 As the big fraud trials unfold over the coming months, public anger may build as the excesses of the bubble years -- some of which have reached almost mythic status -- are again trotted out. Juries will hear about the multibillion-dollar accounting scams at WorldCom and HealthSouth, with executives at both companies purportedly scrambling to disguise numbers revealing the failure of their business plans. 
 In the trial of Mr. Kozlowski, the $6,000 shower curtain will again be raised, along with other indulgences he obtained with money that prosecutors will contend was stolen from Tyco. And the Enron trials will examine that company's byzantine off-books partnerships, which were used to disguise its deteriorating business and enrich some executives. 
 No matter the public mood, however, certain aspects of the changes adopted in recent years are here to stay, experts said -- in particular the themes from the sweeping Sarbanes-Oxley Act, passed in the summer of 2002 in hopes of cleaning up corporate America. 
 That law rewrote the rules for corporate governance and financial reporting, requiring greater power for independent directors, fewer conflicts for outside auditors and greater transparency in reporting. Those concepts are now so ingrained in the corporate mind-set that they are unlikely to be reversed, and may well already be showing some benefits to the economy, particularly in the return of investor confidence and the recent growth of mergers and acquisitions activity, experts said.
 ''Part of the resurgence in the mergers and acquisition market is due to greater confidence among buyers that they can now trust public financials more than they were willing to right after the scandals,'' said R. Franklin Balotti, director in the corporate department at Richards, Layton & Finger, a law firm in Wilmington, Del. ''If part of the result of Sarbanes-Oxley and the rest of the rules is to give the market more confidence in the public statements about the value of companies, then perhaps it has all been worthwhile.''
 Signs of the growing battle over corporate reform and its ultimate politicization are everywhere, although many are hidden from public view. Soon after the presidential election, a group of senior financial executives from an array of firms and companies visited the White House for a private meeting with President Bush. According to people briefed on the meeting, the executives voiced their frustration with the intensity of the regulatory and legal efforts that their companies had faced since the corporate scandals broke three years ago. 
 The regulatory battle has turned to the courts. The Chamber of Commerce has sued the S.E.C. over rules it adopted related to governance of mutual funds. The group also threatened to sue if the agency approved rules to give corporate shareholders the ability to nominate board members directly; the proposal is now widely viewed as dead.
 At the same time, corporate lawyers expressed dismay that the S.E.C. commissioners had recently elected to reject the recommendation of the enforcement staff to levy a fine against Gary Winnick, the founder and former chairman of Global Crossing, the onetime fiber optic giant that collapsed into bankruptcy. 
 ''It was absolutely amazing, because the commission rarely turns away from a staff recommendation like that,'' said one corporate lawyer involved in the case, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
 There is even growing criticism about the costs and demands of Sarbanes-Oxley, particularly in relation to the demands of Section 404 of the act, which imposes numerous requirements and disclosure demands to ensure that internal controls against fraud are effective. Already, while there is widespread support for the principles of Sarbanes-Oxley, corporate directors and other experts said that there was a quiet effort under way to trim back the demands of the law. 
 ''It's clear to me that we are heading into some very uncertain waters, and that the Bush administration is willing to cut big business a lot of slack when it comes to corporate governance, which I think is a big mistake,'' said James W. Harris, president and chief executive of Seneca Financial, a merchant banking firm. Mr. Harris also serves on two other corporate boards. 
 In recent months, Mr. Harris said, he has heard numerous directors complaining about the demands they now face for serving on boards, an attitude he says he has little patience with.
 ''I was at a meeting of a group of directors back in the fall, and there was a lot of grumbling and groaning about all the extra work required now,'' he said. ''My response was, 'Why don't you give back the check and get off the board?' Of course, none of them wanted to do that.''
 The signs of a changing attitude in Washington and beyond are being read with some level of dismay by experts in corporate governance. They believe that establishing rules for board independence was just an important first step but one that will have little serious impact unless shareholders are given greater power to remove ineffective directors.
 ''Board independence, while beneficial, is insufficient to provide directors with affirmative incentives to focus on the interest of shareholders,'' said Lucian Bebchuk, director of the Program on Corporate Governance at Harvard Law School and an author of ''Pay Without Performance.'' 
 The problem, according to Professor Bebchuk and others, is that shareholders -- the true owners of a corporation -- are virtually powerless to effect change in a board unless they begin expensive and hard-to-win proxy battles. Shareholders are not given the right to vote for an alternative candidate for director, or to vote against one advanced by the company. They can either vote yes, or not vote at all.
 Responding to such concerns, the S.E.C. proposed rules essentially allowing shareholders to propose their own candidates for director in companies with proven weaknesses in their procedures for electing directors. At the time it was introduced, William H. Donaldson, the S.E.C. chairman, heralded the proposal as a ''significant step.''
 Quickly, the proposal brought widespread opposition from the business community, which argued that the effort was intended to allow unions with huge stakes in corporations through their pension funds to force social policy issues to the forefront on corporate boards.
 ''We think introducing a special-interest agenda into the boardroom isn't good governance or good for shareholders,'' said Mr. Hirschmann of the Chamber of Commerce.
 But some managers of public pension funds say their desire for a greater voice is simply about giving the real owners of a company a say. Now, about the only option available is to sue the company and its directors.
 ''We should have some alternative to just being forced to sue ourselves,'' said Gary Findlay, executive director of the Missouri State Employees Retirement System, a pension fund. ''If we are simply taking proceeds from the corporation that we already own to pay ourselves, that doesn't effect meaningful change.''

 CORRECTION:
A chart in Business Day yesterday with an article about the pace of reform in corporate America referred incorrectly in some copies to a charge against the former Tyco executives L. Dennis Kozlowski and Mark H. Swartz. They have been charged with looting the company; neither has been charged with insider trading. The chart also misstated the number of people who have pleaded guilty to wrongdoing at Enron. It is 14, not 13.

HEADLINE: Union Calls for Urgent Meeting on Airlines

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
A major airline union called on the Transportation Department yesterday to convene a summit meeting of management, labor and consumer groups to find ways to help the struggling industry.
 The request came in a letter to the transportation secretary, Norman Y. Mineta, from Robert Roach Jr., vice president for transportation at the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents more than 100,000 mechanics, baggage handlers and ramp workers at the major airlines.
 Mr. Roach noted that the department had brought officials together after the terrorist attacks in September 2001 to discuss challenges facing the industry. He called that session helpful but said that the industry had been caught in an unending slump and needed to find solutions. 
 So far this decade, the major airlines have collectively lost $30 billion, five companies have filed for bankruptcy protection, more than 110,000 jobs have been eliminated, and workers' pay and benefits have been cut or eliminated. 
 ''If we are to have a safe, efficient transportation industry,'' Mr. Roach said in the letter, ''it is more important than ever that everyone in management, labor and government work toward the common goal of rebuilding the transportation industry for our mutual benefit.'' 
 In an interview, Mr. Roach said he was not asking for specific moves by the government, but he said the industry's crisis could not continue.
 ''We believe very strongly,'' Mr. Roach said, ''that the only way to get this problem resolved is to put everyone in the industry together and think about what comes next.'' 
 A spokesman for the union, Joseph Tiberi, said it had not received an answer from Mr. Mineta.
 In a statement, the Transportation Department said Mr. Mineta was reviewing the request. Mr. Mineta is ''always accessible to friends in organized labor and throughout the transportation community,'' the statement said, ''and looks forward to meeting with the group to hear their concerns.''
 Mr. Roach's letter came two weeks after the department and the United States Postal Service began investigations into the conditions at the nation's airports during the Christmas travel season. 
 More than 100,000 travelers had their flights canceled on Comair, a regional carrier for Delta Air Lines, after its computer system failed. Northwest Airlines also had computer problems during the holidays.
 Thousands of holiday-period passengers on US Airways were separated from their luggage when the airline's baggage system in Philadelphia became overloaded. 
 Yesterday, the department said Mr. Mineta and others ''have spent a great deal of time reviewing the issues and challenges that are of concern to airline management and workers, and frankly all Americans, and welcome this opportunity to discuss those important economic issues.''

US Air and G.E. in Deal
By Reuters
 US Airways, which is in bankruptcy protection, has satisfied terms of a new aircraft financing deal with its biggest creditor, the General Electric Company, G.E. said yesterday.
 The agreement is a cornerstone of the airline's effort to restructure and operate more like a low-cost airline. The deal requires US Airways to step out of court protection by June 30. 
 A G.E. spokesman confirmed that US Airways had found $100 million in savings to satisfy terms of the deal. Details were being completed. 
 G.E. has agreed to defer potentially crippling aircraft lease and debt payments to help save US Airways $140 million during its stay in Chapter 11. In exchange, US Airways will return 25 aircraft over the same three-year period, including Airbus and Boeing jets through 2007.

HEADLINE: Relocating The Barnes Raises Hard Challenges

BYLINE: By JULIA M. KLEIN

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 14 

 BODY:
For officials at the deficit-ridden Barnes Foundation, a judge's ruling last month that it could finally move its extraordinary art collection from suburban Merion to downtown Philadelphia seemed an unalloyed victory in its struggle for survival. 
 And while Merion residents and many art lovers lamented the impending loss of a charmingly intimate place to savor masterworks, officials here exulted in the prospect of a windfall for tourism and economic development. ''I keep calling it the Museum Mile,'' said Stephanie Naidoff, the city's commerce director, who envisions the Barnes taking its place alongside the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Rodin Museum, a possible Calder Museum and other institutions on a revitalized Benjamin Franklin Parkway. ''The potential for our tourism marketing effort having a real shot in the arm is just great.'' 
 Yet even with the enthusiastic support of local politicians and power brokers, formidable challenges lie ahead for the foundation, founded as a school by Albert C. Barnes, a wealthy medicine manufacturer, and filled with idiosyncratic arrangements of 19th- and 20th-century French paintings, African sculpture, Pennsylvania German furniture and other objects. The total collection -- including 181 works by Renoir, 69 by Cezanne and 46 by Picasso -- is worth more than $25 billion, officials at the Barnes said. 
 In the months to come, the Barnes must expand its board, collect $100 million in capital pledges, raise at least $50 million more for an endowment and figure out how to cover its interim operating costs. And while stepping up its fund-raising, the foundation must select an architect and decide how to continue its educational mission. 
 On Tuesday, a possible obstacle was thrown in its path when a Barnes student, Jay Raymond, filed an appeal of the decision by Judge Stanley R. Ott of Montgomery County Orphans' Court to allow the move. Mr. Raymond, 50, who also works as a handyman and has taught at the Barnes, said his aim was ''to save a cultural jewel from cultural homogenization.'' The lawyer for the Barnes, Ralph G. Wellington, said he was confident that the judge's ruling, which amended Barnes's written instructions that nothing in the collection be moved after his death, would stand. 
 If it does, the Barnes -- which has battled to keep its Merion operation afloat through more than a decade of ruinous litigation, questionable management and squabbling -- will face the task of operating at three different sites. 
 In addition to building a 120,000- to 150,000-square-foot museum here, the Barnes intends to maintain its arboretum in Merion. It also plans to open a research center there, and convert Ker-Feal, Barnes's crumbling Chester County estate, into a living-history museum. Crucial to the plan is increasing donations from about $16,000 this past year to $4.25 million, a goal that even the institution's own fund-raising expert, James L. Callahan Jr., called ''ambitious.'' 
 Adrian Ellis, a New York-based strategic consultant for arts organizations who has followed the Barnes battle, said: ''There's a sort of systemic optimism in the way that people plan these things. A truth drug is an important thing at this stage to administer to all parties.'' 
 To make way for the Barnes, the city of Philadelphia has promised, by year's end, to raze a juvenile detention center between the Rodin Museum and a planned Moshe Safdie expansion of the Central Library of the Free Library of Philadelphia. Bernard C. Watson, chairman of the Barnes, said a reconstituted gallery could open by late 2007 or early 2008. ''That's what my aim would be,'' he said.
 Asked about Mr. Watson's timetable, Kimberly Camp, the foundation's executive director and chief executive, said, ''I wouldn't pay attention to that if I were you.'' She added, ''It's more important that we do it right than that we do it fast.'' 
 The Pew Charitable Trusts and the Lenfest and Annenberg Foundations are leading a fund-raising drive that has raised $100 million for the new building and the move. Still needed is a minimum of $50 million for an endowment. The foundations suspended fund-raising while awaiting Judge Ott's ruling, said Rebecca Rimel, president and chief executive of the Pew Charitable Trusts, because the gifts were granted on the condition that public access to the Barnes be improved. Now the fund-raisers are ''eager to get on with things,'' she said. 
 ''We've got to get the best minds, the best talent,'' she continued. ''It has got to be spectacular.'' 
 The most immediate challenge the Barnes faces is to find new board members willing to shoulder some of the other challenges. A year ago the foundation secured the court's permission to expand its five-member board (reduced to four by a recent death) to 15 members. Mr. Watson said additional trustees would be selected at a board meeting on Thursday and that the rest would be chosen by the end of March. The Barnes has an annual operating deficit of about $1.2 million. Since the judge's decision, requests for visits have more than doubled, the foundation says. But that will not help finances, since the Barnes already sells out its 1,200 weekly slots for visits, available by reservation only. (The current cost is $5 a ticket; admission is likely to double with the planned move.)
 And despite the talk of millions of dollars raised, ''I haven't seen a check,'' Ms. Camp said. She added: ''My biggest concern right now is operating money for 2005. People forget this is a working, breathing organization. We need money now. Our finances are already severely strained.'' While most organizations stabilize their finances before opening a capital campaign, ''we have not had that luxury,'' Ms. Camp said. 
 Nancy Burd, a senior vice president of the Nonprofit Finance Fund in New York, which advises nonprofit organizations on capital projects, predicted that the Barnes would need to raise substantially more money than it has projected so far. ''I don't believe $150 million is the number if the number includes a break-even budget,'' she said. ''Where is the annual giving coming from in the early years? That's not to say there is no capacity in this community. I don't think they're giving it enough time.'' 
 Anne Hawley, director of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, which is planning a new building by the architect Renzo Piano, suggested that a curator and an architect needed to work together to preserve Barnes's vision. ''It's one of the toughest projects I can imagine,'' she said. ''To spend all this money and not get it right would be just a tragedy for the Barnes and the collection.'' 
 ''This has to be so carefully done,'' she said. ''You can't just copy something, because that's fake and phony.''
 Mr. Wellington, the Barnes's lawyer, said the foundation was legally bound to replicate Barnes's distinctive arrangements of artworks, which he considered important to his educational method. And the Barnes has promised to continue offering classes, as it seeks to more than triple its yearly visitors to about 200,000, about 180,000 of them at the new site here. 
 Walter Herman, a Merion resident who tangled with the foundation on traffic issues, but also led a lawn-sign campaign declaring, ''The Barnes belongs in Merion,'' said he hoped for a change of heart instead of location.
 ''Maybe the foundations will begin to realize that this is one of the stupidest ideas that they can waste their money on,'' he said. ''Can you imagine building a simulacrum and exact replica of the Barnes gallery in Philadelphia and surrounding it with a restaurant and an auditorium and other gallery space, when the real thing is five and a half miles away?''

HEADLINE: China Promotes Another Boom: Nuclear Power

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: DAYA BAY, China 

 BODY:
The view from this remote point by the sea, with lines of misty mountains stretching into the distance, is worthy of a classical Chinese painting. In the foreground, though, sits a less obvious attraction: one of China's first nuclear power reactors, and just behind it, another being rushed toward completion.
 There are countless ways to show how China is climbing the world's economic ladder, hurdling developed countries in its path, but few are more pronounced than the country's rush into nuclear energy -- a technology that for environmental, safety and economic reasons most of the world has put on hold. 
 In its anxiety to satisfy its seemingly bottomless demand for electricity, China plans to build reactors on a scale and pace comparable to the most ambitious nuclear energy programs the world has ever seen. 
 Current plans -- conservative ones, in the estimation of some people involved in China's nuclear energy program -- call for new reactors to be commissioned at a rate of nearly two a year between now and 2020, a pace that experts say is comparable to the peak of the United States' nuclear energy push in the 1970's.
 ''We will certainly build more than one reactor per year,'' said Zhou Dadi, director of the central government's Energy Research Institute, which has strongly supported the country's nuclear program. ''The challenge is not the technology. The barriers for China are mostly institutional arrangements, because reactors are big projects. What we need most is better operation, financing and management.''
 By 2010, planners predict a quadrupling of nuclear output to 16 billion kilowatt-hours and a doubling of that figure by 2015. And with commercial nuclear energy programs dead or stagnant in the United States and most of Europe, Western and other developers of nuclear plant technology are lining up to sell reactors and other equipment to the Chinese, whose purchasing decisions alone will determine in many instances who survives in the business. 
 France, which derives about a third of its energy from nuclear power, is the only Western country committed to a large-scale nuclear energy program. It is in a building lull now, but will need to begin replacing aging reactors within a decade or so. 
 Japan derives about 10 percent of its energy from nuclear sources and was once among the most favorably disposed toward nuclear energy. But a string of scandals involving comically shoddy practices, like mixing radioactive materials in a bucket, and near accidents have turned public opinion in many areas strongly antinuclear. 
 That leaves China as the only potential growth area for nuclear energy. And for China, which still derives as much as 80 percent of its electricity from burning coal, the lure of nuclear energy is as obvious as the thick, acrid, choking haze that hangs over virtually all the country's cities. 
 The problem with nuclear power, some experts say, is that China's energy needs are so immense -- each year, by some estimates, the country plans to add generating capacity from all sources equivalent to the entire current energy consumption of Britain -- that even the enormous expansion program will do little to offset the skyrocketing power demand.
 China's eight nuclear reactors in operation today supply less than 2 percent of current demand. By 2020, assuming the national plan is fulfilled, nuclear energy would still constitute under 4 percent of demand. 
 There has been almost no public discussion of the merits and risks of nuclear energy here, as the government strictly censors news coverage of such issues. But critics question whether such a small payoff warrants exposure to the risk of catastrophic failures, nuclear proliferation, terrorism and the still unresolved problems of radioactive waste disposal.
 ''We don't have a very good plan for dealing with spent fuel, and we don't have very good emergency plans for dealing with catastrophe,'' said Wang Yi, a nuclear energy expert at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. ''The nuclear interest group wants to push this technology, but they don't understand the risks for the future. They want to make money. But we scientists, we want to take a very comprehensive approach, including safety, environment, dealing with waste and other factors, and not rush into anything.''
 Chinese nuclear operators, like the people who run the Daya Bay plants here, scoff at such concerns. 
 ''In China we have state-owned power companies, whereas abroad they have private companies,'' said Yu Jiechun, a senior engineer at the China Guangdong Nuclear Power Holding Company. ''It's not a matter of someone's profit here, whether we do something one way or another. The government decides, and they have spent huge amounts of money on safety.'' 
 The government is also looking into a new generation of ''pebble bed'' reactors that some scientists say are far safer than traditional designs, though these are not a part of its immediate plans.
 One sure sign of the Chinese industry's self-assuredness is the promotion of the Daya Bay plants as a tourist attraction. For now -- in a country where surging power demand has led major cities like Shanghai to force companies to stagger working hours, shut down during the week and operate on weekends -- the public is likely to support anything that promises more electricity.
 American experts, mindful of the destructive consequences of the near catastrophic accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in 1979, warn against overconfidence.
 ''In 1970 we had a net capability of 7 million kilowatt hours, and by 1981 we had reached 56 million kilowatt hours,'' said John Moens, a nuclear analyst at the United States Department of Energy. ''So the rate of growth they propose is not only conceivable, it has been done before. The problem is, can you regulate it? Can you deal with the environmental problems? Can you deal with the hundred different things that creep up, as the Japanese found when they expanded their industry, just as we found when we expanded ours?''
 Reinforcing this point, David Lochbaum, a nuclear energy expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a private, nonprofit group based in Cambridge, Mass., said that of the 103 reactors in operation in the United States, 27 have been shut down for at least a year since September 1984.
 Daya Bay's location less than 50 miles from Hong Kong, where the proximity has become a political issue, only reinforces the environmental and safety concerns. That may sound like ample space, but it is not much different from the distance from New York City to the Indian Point nuclear plant in Buchanan, N.Y., which has become an issue since the Sept. 11 attacks.
 ''Of the technologies that exist today, you have to look at what can happen on the worst day,'' Mr. Lochbaum said. ''With wind power, you can go bankrupt. With a dam burst, lives can and have been lost, but it's fairly localized. The cost of cleaning up after Chernobyl, though, is greater than all of the benefits of the entire Soviet nuclear power industry combined, and it could have been worse.''

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article last Saturday about China's large-scale nuclear energy plans to satisfy its demand for electricity referred imprecisely to the importance of nuclear power in France, the only Western country committed to a large nuclear energy program. While nuclear plants provide a third of France's energy needs, as the article said, those plants provide about 80 percent of the country's electricity.

HEADLINE: After 100 Years, Japanese Will Go Abroad to Sell Bonds

BYLINE: By TODD ZAUN

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 14 

 BODY:
For the first time in a century, Japanese finance officials will travel abroad next week to drum up sales for the nation's bonds among foreign investors, with stops planned in New York and London. 
 It will be the first overseas excursion to sell bonds since one that began in 1904 to finance the Russo-Japanese war, which Japan won a year later. This time, the only enemy is the rapidly advancing government debt, and Japan is likely to face a much longer battle before that is brought under control.
 Japan, which has the world's second-largest economy, has the worst fiscal health of any developed nation, with outstanding national debt that is expected to grow next year to 774 trillion yen ($7.4 trillion), or 150 percent of the size of the country's output. That is by far the largest ratio among the Group of 7 industrial nations. And with the government running a deficit this year of 34.4 trillion yen ($330 billion), its 15th consecutive, the number is not expected to improve anytime soon. 
 The debt, which Japan's central bank chief, Toshihiko Fukui, once called a ''buried land mine,'' is making Japanese officials nervous about finding buyers. Next week's road show for bankers, fund managers and executives at other institutions aims to expand the pool of investors beyond the relatively small group of Japanese banks and insurers that own most of the debt now. ''The fiscal problem is not going to go away and it cannot be solved quickly; it can only be solved over time,'' said Jesper Koll, chief economist for Merrill Lynch in Tokyo. ''And when you need to solve something over time, the top thing you have to focus on is to get investors to buy into your plan.''
 The low ratings on Japanese debt will make this a challenge. Both Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's rate Japanese government bonds the lowest among the Group of 7 nations. Moody's rating of A2 puts Japanese debt below Botswana's.
 About 60 percent of Japanese bonds are held by the nation's banks and insurers -- including the government-run postal savings and insurance system -- and only about 4 percent by foreign investors, half the share they held five years ago and much less than in other big economies. Forty percent of United States Treasury securities, for instance, are in the hands of foreigners, and the proportion is roughly the same for German government debt. 
 That so much of Japan's debt is held by a relatively small group of Japanese financial institutions is a risk, given the possibility, however remote, that the group could become sellers all at once. Any decline in bond prices would push yields up, which would ripple through rates on mortgages to credit cards and car loans, seriously damping Japan's still fluttering economic recovery. 
 Moreover, analysts say banks' appetite for government bonds is waning. Amid a long decline in demand for loans, banks have had little else to do with their money. But with Japan in the second year of a recovery, loan demand may pick up. 
 And to foster that recovery, finance officials are more eager than ever to line up new buyers for Japanese bonds -- any slackening in demand could move interest rates up. 
 ''The No.1, No.2 and No.3 policy priorities right now are to prevent an increase in interest rates,'' Mr. Koll of Merrill said. ''They're basically trying to ensure that investors don't abandon them.'' 
 Japan's bond salesmen will travel to London on Tuesday and to New York on Thursday, where they expect groups of more than 100 large investors to turn up for their pitch. 
 To be sure, it will be a tough sell. After a rally that has lasted more than a decade, few people expect Japanese bonds to rise further. Yields are low; after peaking at more than 8 percent in 1990, the yield on the 10-year government bond slid to an all-time low of 0.4 percent two years ago. The 10-year yield has since recovered to 1.4 percent, the lowest for any of the leading economies. The 10-year United States Treasury note, in contrast, was at 4.22 percent on Friday.
 Naoyuki Okamoto, director for government debt management policy at the Ministry of Finance, said ministry officials would emphasize recent positive developments, like the progress that Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's government has made in reducing spending, which they hope will alleviate concern that record bond issuance will continue indefinitely. 
 The government is also removing some of the hurdles that foreign bond investors face. Japan has simplified filing requirements for bond purchases, and in April it will remove restrictions that prevent foreign investors from buying a new kind of government bond with a floating rate tied to inflation. Ministry officials hope this bond may appeal to foreigners now that prices may be picking up after years of deflation.
 More fundamentally, Mr. Okamoto said, a goal of the marketing effort is simply to contact big investors who might have lost interest in Japanese bonds because of the low rates. 
 ''We should have been doing this kind of marketing activity from long ago,'' he said. ''We have to imprint in investors' minds that they can't forget about Japanese bonds.''

HEADLINE: W.T.O. to Consider Lumber Tariff Case

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: GENEVA, Jan. 14 

 BODY:
The World Trade Organization agreed Friday to investigate whether United States antidumping duties on Canada's multibillion-dollar lumber exports had been brought into line with trade rules, officials said.
 The United States said it changed its policy after the W.T.O. ruled last year that duties had not been properly calculated. 
Canada disputes this and has threatened to seek up to $167 million in retaliatory sanctions.
 A panel of trade judges will have up to three months to decide whether Washington did enough when it announced in December that it was slightly reducing the level of the antidumping duty, the officials said.
 Canada ships about $6 billion worth softwood to the United States each year, supplying about a third of the lumber used for home building and remodeling in the United States.
 The sales are subject to import taxes of 21 percent, including antidumping and countervailing duties. 
 Washington says the duties are needed to offset artificially low prices set in the United States by Canadian lumber exporters. Canadian companies deny there is any dumping -- selling goods abroad for less than it costs to produce them.

HEADLINE: Tea Leaves and Dollars: Read 'em and Weep

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The dollar jumped in value against the euro yesterday, reflecting both a possibly misinterpreted signal of higher interest rates and the strong desire of many investors, right now, to own dollars.
 The confusion also helped push Treasury prices lower even though an important inflation measure, the Producer Price Index for finished goods, fell an unexpected 0.7 percent in December. 
 Expectations that the Federal Reserve might move more aggressively on interest rates were heightened after William Poole, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, told Reuters on Thursday night that ''at some point'' Fed policy makers would drop a sentence included in their recent policy statements that said future interest rate increases would come at a measured pace. 
 The dollar began to rally after the Reuters report because the remark, some traders said, was taken as a signal that the Fed might be raising its benchmark, short-term interest rate faster than had been expected. A faster rise in interest rates here could help the dollar because higher interest rates than those in Europe would make owning dollars more attractive.
 Later Thursday night, Mr. Poole repeated many of his comments to reporters after a speech in St. Louis. In those comments, however, Mr. Poole made clear, according to Bloomberg News, that he ''didn't predict'' that the measured pace language would be dropped ''at the next meeting'' of Fed officials, which is on Feb. 1 and 2.
 Mr. Poole's comments may have been paid more attention than they were due because of the Fed's new policy of releasing the minutes of Fed policy-making meetings just three weeks after the session. In the past, the minutes were not released until after the succeeding meeting, meaning they provided much less insight into current Fed thinking. 
 Because the minutes of the Dec. 14 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which were released Jan. 4, said that a ''few members'' suggested removing the measured pace language, traders are now attuned to figuring if and when such a change will occur and deciding if it will mean a faster pace of rate increases. They are also left to decide whether the ''few'' is a potent minority or not.
 The measured pace comments, along with ''a number'' of policy makers worrying about inflationary pressures, sent the dollar and interest rates higher on Jan. 4. 
 Fed officials at the Dec. 14 policy session, which approved the first early release of meeting minutes, ''debated the possibility that the markets would misinterpret the minutes,'' according to the minutes.
 Misinterpretations seem possible when the minutes say ''a few members'' want to drop the measured pace language but that ''more of the members believed that this language was useful.'' On inflation, the worries were from a ''number of participants.'' But the minutes went on to say that ''despite these concerns, participants generally expected that inflation would remain low in the foreseeable future.'' 
 Louis Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson Associates, said that it was going to take time for both the markets and the Fed to learn how to handle the new process without undue market disturbances. 
 ''There will be a period of confusion,'' he said, ''while the market learns how to read the minutes and while the Fed learns how to write the minutes when they are going to be read this way.'' 
 Most of the dollar's rise yesterday -- it climbed 0.7 percent against the euro -- was over by the morning trading in New York.
 Steven Englander, chief foreign exchange strategist for the Americas at Barclays Capital, said that Mr. Poole's comment was not really new because of the Dec. 14 minutes. And he argued that much of the dollar rally was just a desire by many investors to buy dollars and sell euros now to take advantage of a dollar rally that many analysts expected after the American currency dropped sharply at the end of last year.
 An indication of this desire can be seen, he said, in the swift rebound of the dollar since Wednesday, when it fell 1.1 percent against the euro after the government reported that the trade deficit surged to a monthly record of $60.3 billion in November. In late trading yesterday, the euro was valued at $1.3106, almost the same value as on Tuesday, the day before the trade deficit report.
 Another indication that the dollar's move was more related to owning dollars instead of euros, is that the dollar fell against the Japanese yen yesterday to a new five-year low while the dollar rose against the euro. In late trading, the dollar was at 101.91 yen, down 0.5 percent from 102.45 Thursday.
 When the Dec. 14 Fed minutes were released Jan. 4, the dollar jumped against both the yen and the euro.
 Mr. Englander also said that supportive comments from President Bush in an interview with USA Today helped the dollar. 
 In the bond market, the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note rose to 4.22 percent, from 4.16 percent Thursday, while the price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 16/32, to 100 6/32.
 William Prophet, interest rate strategist at UBS, said that the 0.8 percent jump in industrial production in December, which was larger than expected, played a role in the sell-off. While producer prices fell in December, for the year they rose 4.1 percent, the biggest annual gain in 14 years. And even if the Consumer Price Index is unchanged for December, which is the current consensus of economists surveyed by Bloomberg, it will still have climbed 3.6 percent last year, also the biggest increase in 14 years.
 But Mr. Prophet said that Mr. Poole still had his impact. ''The fact that Poole made these comments and what the Fed said in the minutes about inflation exaggerated the reaction to the data,'' Mr. Prophet said.

HEADLINE: Brooklyn Rezoning Plan Assailed

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
Marty Markowitz, the Brooklyn borough president, said yesterday that he opposed an enormous rezoning proposal for Greenpoint and Williamsburg because it did not guarantee enough inexpensive housing, open space or economic stability for people already living in the area.
 Although the City Planning Commission and the City Council have the ultimate say in the plan moving forward, Mr. 
Markowitz's concerns are likely to influence the final rezoning, which is aimed at creating a new neighborhood on the crumbling North Brooklyn waterfront.
 ''Many members of the community feel that the administration has developed a proposal for this asset-in-waiting that best serves the constituency of Manhattan,'' Mr. Markowitz said in a statement announcing his recommendations, part of the city's public review process. ''This project must serve all Brooklynites, especially the current residents of Williamsburg and Greenpoint.''
 Officials in Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's administration have proposed a voluntary incentive program that they say would encourage developers to set aside 15 to 25 percent of the housing built as a result of the rezoning for low- and moderate-income New Yorkers. 
 But Mr. Markowitz called for a different combination of subsidies and incentives to guarantee that 30 percent of the new dwellings would be affordable to residents of limited incomes. 
 Amanda M. Burden, chairwoman of the City Planning Commission, suggested that the Bloomberg administration was open to fine-tuning the details of the plan, which she said would generate thousands of apartments and jobs while opening the waterfront to the public and adding 50 acres of open space to the area.
 She said city officials were ''confident that in the coming months we will address any outstanding concerns, including those of the borough president.''

HEADLINE: Putting Their Son, Who Is Autistic, First

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
There is a bruise, about the size of a quarter and the color of a cranberry, on C.J. Palmer's forehead. It is a mark of frustration. 
 Named for his father, Carlton Palmer, a former police officer in the United States Air Force, 5-year-old C.J. is autistic. 
 Unable to speak, he communicates nonverbally, with hand gestures, or sometimes, with tears. When he feels overwhelmed, he bangs his forehead against a table or a wall. This is an improvement, his parents say, considering that he used to tear at his skin and bite his arms. 
 It is a Herculean task, trying to channel C.J.'s irrepressible energy, though Mr. Palmer, 46, and his wife, Regina, 34, say that C.J. tends to calm down when he rips paper or listens to music, especially jazz. 
 Each night, classical music echoes through the basement in the Bronx where C.J., his parents and his sisters live. But there, below ground, everything is menacing. Mr. and Mrs. Palmer worry that C.J. will bang his head on the concrete floor, and the boiler is a dangerously tempting hiding place for the children. There is no privacy, and when one child cries through the night, no one sleeps. 
 Mr. and Mrs. Palmer were raising C.J. and his sisters, Chelsea, now 6, and Chastity, 5 months, in Norfolk, Va., until they moved to New York in June. 
 ''There weren't a lot of services in the Norfolk area,'' Mr. Palmer said, referring to services for autistic children and their families. ''So I did some research and I found out there were a lot more services here, like counseling and support groups.'' 
 The Palmers wasted no time. They readied themselves for New York, selling the computer that they used for their autism research to help pay for the move. 
 ''It was all a matter of putting him first,'' Mr. Palmer said.
 In September the Palmers enrolled C.J. in Public School 176X in the Bronx, which serves students who have autism. And Mr. Palmer is a member of the School Leadership Team, a group of parents who meet regularly to discuss school-related issues, including the curriculum. 
 Mr. and Mrs. Palmer receive counseling at New Alternatives for Children, a member of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of seven charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. 
 New Alternatives, which provides social services for disabled children and their families, has not only helped the Palmers emotionally, but financially. The support has meant a lot to the Palmers, who have been out of work since they moved to the city. 
 ''We're the type of people used to going to work,'' Mrs. Palmer said. ''This is the longest I've been out of work. I'm anxious to get back.''
 Mrs. Palmer was a 911 dispatcher in Virginia but she had to stop working because C.J. needed round-the-clock care.
 The family receives about $600 a month in public assistance and $378 a month in food stamps. They are squeaking by, without money to pay for any number of things that C.J. needs, like soft mats so that he will not hurt his head on the floor, or a therapeutic swing that would help him relax. They also want to be able to buy a computer with assisted technology, to help him communicate. 
 Mr. Palmer says that these things would make his son's life happier and safer, and that they make it especially frustrating to be unemployed. With his background in law enforcement, Mr. Palmer wanted to become an emergency medical worker here in New York, but he could not afford the six-month training course.
 New Alternatives helped, using $775 from the Neediest Cases to pay for his training. 
 ''It was something that I prayed for and dreamed about,'' Mr. Palmer said, ''Being able to support my family.''

HEADLINE: In Real Estate, What Goes Up Keeps Rising

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER and JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:
The market value of New York City real estate rose 14 percent last year, an increase that follows three successive years of sharp gains as property values continued a heady run, according to a report released yesterday by the city's Department of Finance.
 The report found the increases were broadly based throughout the city, as property values rose in every borough, with Staten Island rising almost as much in percentage terms as Manhattan, according to the figures, which put the total value of property in the city at $616 billion. In one stark indication of the strength of real estate in the city, the Time Warner building in Columbus Circle rose in value over the last year by more than $200 million to $1.2 billion.
 These increases, even in the face of sluggish job growth on Wall Street and an overall economy that lags the nation's, indicate that ''the rules of real estate have changed'' as several factors have combined to keep pushing prices upward, said Jonathan J. Miller, president of Miller Samuel Inc., a real estate appraisal and consulting firm. Several years of historically low mortgage rates, coupled with the continued migration of new residents to the city, have kept demand high, and the market hot. 
 The numbers further seal the real estate market's role as a singular force helping to drive the city's economy, with, as Mr. Miller put it, real estate replacing the stock market as the financial topic of choice to discuss at dinner parties.
 The strength of New York City's real estate market reflects a housing boom that has swept across the country. During the third quarter of 2004, home prices throughout the nation rose 13 percent from a year earlier, according to the federal government. A record 69 percent of households now own their homes; housing values on the West and East Coasts are highest.
 The increase in property values in the city means that homeowners can potentially enjoy better resale values, but it also presages higher tax bills for most property owners. For example, the 100,513 homeowners on Staten Island whose homes are now worth more than they were a year ago can expect their tax bill to go up an average of $136 next year if the tax rate remains at this year's level, according to the city, while the figure citywide for owners of single-family homes would be $141, according to officials.
 One of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's chief Democratic rivals, City Council Speaker Gifford Miller, cited the new data in arguing that the tax bills to be issued based on the new assessments would effectively wipe out a substantial portion of the $400 real estate tax rebate the city is offering again this year.
 ''The city shouldn't give with one hand in tax rebates and then take away with the other through arbitrarily higher tax burdens,'' Mr. Miller said in a statement.
 But city officials said yesterday that they were taking new steps to address what they acknowledged to be longstanding inequities in the tax assessment system. For only the third time in the last 20 years, they said, the Department of Finance will reduce the taxable assessment value of one-, two- and three-family homes next fiscal year, to 6 percent of their market value from 8 percent. The change addresses perennial complaints from consumer advocates that the system effectively punishes people who live in neighborhoods where real estate values are not rising as quickly as those in hot neighborhoods. 
 A large reason for the inequities in the tax system is a 6 percent cap on the increase in a property's taxable real estate values. That has had a perverse effect on tax burdens, as people with properties whose real estate values have shot up quickly are paying much lower taxes, proportionally, than those whose properties have not. Martha E. Stark, the city finance commissioner, said that people who buy newly built homes are similarly socked with disproportionately high assessments and that the change was meant to help them too. 
 ''In order to make it uniform and therefore equitable, we've got to lower the ratio, and we did,'' she said.
 Ms. Stark said the change would result in reductions of up to 25 percent in the assessments for 30,000 homeowners, and in a stable assessment for 60,000 people who otherwise would have had an increase. Most of those people are in Brooklyn, Staten Island and Queens, officials said.
 Ms. Stark said the city had also changed the assessment system to more fairly address the differences between rental buildings that charge market rates and those that remain in the rent regulation system and cannot. 
 Manhattan experienced the biggest rise in overall property values, 15 percent. Staten Island was next at 14.5 percent.
 Suggesting that real estate developers might expect more gains in the future, the value of vacant land rose about 40 percent in Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island and the Bronx and 27 percent in Manhattan.
 Yet economists and housing experts warn that the giddy real estate market may be dampened by even moderately rising interest rates or other bumps in the region's economy. In a recent article in The Regional Financial Review, published by Economy.com, a research and consulting firm, the company's chief economist, Mark M. Zandi, wrote that even a modest increase in mortgage interest rates ''is expected to have a substantial impact'' on the housing outlook.
 Looking at the national picture, Mr. Zandi added: ''Housing is at a turning point. After a decade of steadily improving conditions, and current record levels of activity, the market is poised to weaken.'' He cited New York as one of numerous cities around the country in which many residents with average household incomes could not afford typical new homes with a 20 percent down payment and a 30-year fixed mortgage rate of 6 percent. 
 And the 14 percent rise in real estate values is smaller than the rise last year of 17 percent. But, acknowledging that, Ms. Stark said, ''The real estate market is stabilizing a little bit, not softening.''
 He added, ''Real estate continues to be a great investment.''

HEADLINE: Refugee Policy Favors Serviceman While Relatives Lose Benefits

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
Vladislav Kolesnikov was 12 when he came to America, and only 17 in 2003, when he enlisted in the United States Navy just in time to serve in the start of the Iraq war. He was eager to protect the country that had given his family refuge from persecution in Russia, he said, and grateful for government aid to his mother, who is paralyzed by multiple sclerosis.
 The Navy was happy to accept his service, which made him eligible for a fast track to citizenship and all its benefits. But after his ship returned to its base in Norfolk, Va., the sailor, now 19, learned that the government was far less eager to help refugees it was not trying to recruit. Back home in Brooklyn, his mother and grandmother had been cut from their disability payments, solely because they -- like him -- are not yet citizens.
 ''All I want to do is help them out,'' Seaman Kolesnikov said in a recent call from his ship, the Nashville, after visiting his sick mother and 65-year-old grandmother, who have had to go on public assistance and are unable to cover food and rent without loans. ''I'm doing everything for this country, but this country doesn't want to help me.'' 
 The Bush administration has established a fast track to naturalization as a way to enlist and reward people like Seaman Kolesnikov, one of 32,000 noncitizens now serving in the wartime military. But other refugees get no such favors. Congress gave refugees arriving after Aug. 22, 1996, seven years to become naturalized or lose their disability benefits, and many are missing the deadline, caught up in a nationwide backlog of immigration paperwork. 
 The difference in treatment between immigrants who serve the government's needs and those who need its help reflects a longstanding and growing tension at the heart of United States immigration policy, authorities on immigration say. For decades after World War II, immigration laws gave priority to family ties, regardless of age or disability, and lawmakers showcased programs for refugees, especially from Communist countries. Increasingly since the early 1990's, the focus has shifted to making immigration fill the nation's occupational needs. 
 Now public debate swirls around the economic costs and benefits of importing guest workers, nurses or more foreign graduate students. But refugees do not fit that kind of balance sheet, said Leonard S. Glickman, president of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, or HIAS, one of the nation's oldest migrant aid organizations. 
 ''This country does not admit refugees for their resumes,'' said Mr. Glickman, whose agency, founded in 19th-century New York to help Jews fleeing the pogroms of czarist Russia, is one of several trying to help families like the sailor's. ''A refugee is here just because of humanitarian needs and the protection of the United States.'' 
 In a windswept low-income housing project in Brighton Beach, the sailor's grandmother, Mina Gorenshteyn, remains unshakably grateful for that protection, despite her financial straits. 
 ''God bless America,'' she said in heavily accented English, putting a hand on her heart. She gestured at the special equipment, adult diapers and hospital-style bed provided by Medicaid for the care of her daughter, Viktoriya Khudaya, 42, who can no longer speak.
 Vladislav Kolesnikov was only 5 and his sister, Elizabeth 7 when their mother became ill and their father left them in North Ossetia, a region now known for the schoolhouse hostage siege in which hundreds died. It was their grandmother, working three jobs as a bookkeeper, who supported the family, they said, and who eventually determined that they should flee the province's resurgent anti-Semitism.
 Refugees are eligible to apply for green cards a year after their arrival, and for citizenship five years after they obtain lawful permanent residence. But even though the four all applied for green cards in 1998, as soon as the law allowed, so far only Elizabeth, now a 22-year-old nursing student, has managed to become a citizen. 
 ''I got lucky,'' she said.
 In Ms. Khudaya's case, a green card interview was delayed for years because her illness kept her from going to 26 Federal Plaza in downtown Manhattan for fingerprinting. Though the rules allow for a home visit by an immigration officer in such circumstances, the visit was not scheduled until last February, even after her congressman, Representative Jerrold L. Nadler, intervened on her behalf in October 2002. 
 She was finally approved for a green card last summer, but it never arrived. Aides to Mr. Nadler said they eventually determined that the card had been mailed to the wrong address. In October, when her seven-year limit ran out, Ms. Khudaya's disability benefits stopped. So did old-age benefits for Ms. Gorenshteyn, who has received her green card, but is still waiting for naturalization as she struggles to learn English and to care for her daughter with the help of a home attendant. 
 ''It's crazy,'' Mr. Nadler said. ''We certainly should not have a seven-year automatic cutoff, no matter what. The bigger picture is that there's a shortage of funding to do the job right, and the people who get hurt are the people who end up waiting, not the bureaucrats.''
 Mr. Glickman, formerly a top career officer in charge of government refugee programs at the Department of Health and Human Services, said the problem could be traced to decisions made during the 1996 welfare overhaul, which for the first time in the nation's history restricted many benefits to citizens alone. 
 At the time, he said, he opposed any Congressional time limits on Supplemental Security Income, or S.S.I., for elderly and disabled refugees. But to cut costs, Congress proposed a five-year limit, and the Clinton administration compromised on seven, considered long enough for refugees to naturalize. The new restrictions led to a surge in citizenship applications, and to backlogs compounded by security measures adopted after Sept. 11, 2001. 
 To historians of immigration, the problem of unintended consequences is familiar. ''It's not just this case or that case, because nobody ever sat down and figured this thing out,'' said Roger Daniels, an emeritus professor of history at the University of Cincinnati. ''It's add on here, take off there.''
 The battle between economic and humanitarian approaches to immigration also has a long history, said David Reimers, an emeritus historian of immigration at New York University, but there is more overlap than politicians like to acknowledge. Even if they are admitted as refugees or temporary workers, newcomers tend to start chains of family immigration, he said, and -- as Ms. Gorenshteyn's grandchildren demonstrate -- refugee families may produce the workers society demands. 
 A fast track for those deemed more desirable or deserving only compounds the problem for everybody else, contends Inna Stavitsky, a caseworker with the Jewish Association for Services for the Aged, which is trying to help the seaman's grandmother become a citizen.
 ''They did not add resources to handle applications, so it's giving advantages to one group at the expense of the others,'' Ms. Stavitsky said. 
 For years, Seaman Kolesnikov himself has been caught in the backlog. Even as he served on a ship carrying marines to a war zone, immigration officials were waiting for security clearance of his fingerprints before scheduling a green card interview, counselors at HIAS said. Last month, Christopher Bentley, a spokesman for Citizenship and Immigration Services in Washington, recommended that the sailor drop his stalled application and apply directly for expedited citizenship based on his wartime service. 
 But when aides to Mr. Nadler tried to pursue the suggestion, they said, officials at the Nebraska Service Center who process the military applications insisted that Mr. Bentley was wrong: Even those in the service need a green card before they can enter the fast track to naturalization, unless they are killed in combat and awarded citizenship posthumously. 
 All the inquiries suddenly bore fruit after authorities realized that the case would be the subject of an article in The New York Times. Seaman Kolesnikov was summoned for a green card interview at 26 Federal Plaza on Monday and approved on the spot. But the change in the sailor's status does not help the two women he refers to as his parents.
 ''Even if I get my green card, my parents are still going to be cut off of everything,'' he said. ''My mother right now, she's very sick, even worse than when I left. And now they get all their stuff cut off just because they're not citizens. I don't think that's fair.''

HEADLINE: Rich Nations Are Urged to Ease Trade With Affected Countries

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 14 

 BODY:
The head of the World Trade Organization issued a plea to all member nations on Friday to lower trade barriers as a way of helping nations ravaged by the tsunami.
 Supachai Panitchpakdi, the director general and a native of Thailand, asked countries to open up their markets to encourage a strong revival of the hard-hit economies. He also asked that members refrain from reprisals against the worst-hit economies for unfair trade practices. 
 ''As someone from the affected region, I naturally feel a particular sense of tragedy,'' Mr. Supachai wrote in a letter to the members.
 Although the W.T.O. is not involved in disaster relief, Mr. Supachai said the organization shared ''part of the responsibility to assist recovery from the tsunami.''
 Calls for trade relief reflect the understanding that a country's ability to restore livelihoods may depend on selling products overseas. But as in previous tragedies, the appeals for trade concessions are being resisted by industries that could suffer from the resulting competition.
 The United States and the European Union have already said they would consider suspending some of the duties imposed on products from the countries hardest hit. The European Union is also considering speeding up trade preferences that were scheduled for July.
 Moreover, the European Union is sending experts to help repair damage to processing facilities and ensure that food prepared for export meets health standards.
 ''Food is a big export for these countries, so we're sending help to get them back up and running so they will be able to export again,'' said Anthony Gooch, a spokesman for the European Union in Washington. The United States is pushing to complete talks on trade and investment agreements with Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Sri Lanka, said Richard Mills, spokesman for Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative.
 Some countries have already come up with their own ideas: Thailand, which has said it will rebuild on its own, is asking to be spared from new United States tariffs on shrimp. Sri Lanka wants special consideration for its textile exports.
 With the end of the global multifiber agreement at the beginning of this year, the poorer countries of the region had already asked the United States for special consideration, especially in the face of the new competition they face with China.
 Deborah Long, spokeswoman for the Southern Shrimp Alliance, said there were other ways to help than to suspend duties imposed last week on Asian and Latin American countries for selling shrimp at below market prices. A more equitable solution, she argued, was for American retailers to pay shrimpers higher prices.
 Lloyd Woods, a spokesman for the American Manufacturing Trade Action Coalition, which represents most American textile companies, said the best way to help Sri Lanka, Thailand and India was to go ahead with proposed limits on Chinese imports, indirectly bolstering the competitiveness of the other nations. 
 Oxfam America wrote to Mr. Zoellick on Friday seeking preferences to Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Indonesia for textiles and clothing. Currently the United States gives such preferences to many nations in Central America, South America and sub-Saharan Africa.

HEADLINE: Pataki Budget Is Said to Seek Medicaid Cuts

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ and AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 14 

 BODY:
Seeking to close the state budget gap, Gov. George E. Pataki will propose at least $1 billion in spending cuts to Medicaid, the health care program for the poor, according to people who have been briefed on the governor's budget plan for the coming fiscal year.
 In the budget address he will deliver on Tuesday, Mr. Pataki will also call for at least $500 million in additional taxes and surcharges on hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers, to help the state wrestle with a projected budget shortfall of $4 billion, those briefed on the plan said. 
 Medicaid costs have exploded in recent years, placing a burden on local and state finances. Medicaid consumes about 44 percent of the state's $100 billion budget, but officials have been unable to curb the program, which has political clout in Albany.
 The cuts, if they go through, will cause a ripple effect. Since the state's contribution to Medicaid generates matching contributions from the federal government and New York localities, a $1 billion cut in state financing could mean a decrease of at least $3 billion in overall Medicaid spending across the state, according to health care analysts. Hospital trade groups predicted that cuts on that scale would stun the health care industry, a major sector in the state's economy, and perhaps lead to cuts in service or even hospital closings.
 At the same time, the governor is planning to do something to address what local governments have long complained is a strain on their budgets and a force driving up local property taxes: He wants to place a cap on local Medicaid costs and have the state pick up a larger share of them over time.
 And to make proposed Medicaid cuts easier to sell to lawmakers, health care representatives and union leaders, his advisers are floating proposals that would, among other things, finance hospital construction and renew a program to provide coverage for the uninsured.
 Kevin C. Quinn, a spokesman for Mr. Pataki, declined to comment last night on the governor's Medicaid package, other than to say: ''We will give details of the budget on Tuesday. But the governor has made clear that this is the year we must reform New York's Medicaid system, protect property taxpayers and ensure our health care system remains the best in the world.''
 Mr. Pataki's proposed Medicaid cuts will set the stage for a bitter and possibly protracted fight with lawmakers in both parties, who have resisted making deep cuts to New York's struggling health care industry. While Medicaid is considered a program for the poor, it has an impact on communities throughout the state because hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers count on Medicaid dollars to cover their operating expenses.
 The cuts the governor is seeking will almost certainly make health care one of the most contentious issues confronting lawmakers, who must comply with a court-appointed panel's ruling that an additional $5.6 billion a year must be spent to improve New York City schools. They also face demands that the state provide more aid to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
 The proposal to cut Medicaid defines a stark turnabout for the governor, both substantively and politically. Mr. Pataki, a Republican, has presided over sizable spending increases in the program over the years, most recently when he ran for re-election in 2002 seeking the support of the politically potent hospital workers' union.
 The program now costs $44.5 billion, up from $24 billion in 1995, when Mr. Pataki first took office. It is, in fact, the fastest-growing part of the state's $100 billion budget. Mr. Pataki led the charge for major cuts in Medicaid in 1995, but he abandoned that goal after meeting with fierce political opposition in and out of the State Legislature.
 Mr. Pataki's advisers are apparently giving consideration to several proposals that may make his proposed Medicaid cuts more palatable to legislators, hospital administrators and, perhaps most important, the leaders of 1199/S.E.I.U., the hospital workers' union, according to officials in the Legislature.
 One proposal said to be under discussion would include the reauthorization of the Health Care Reform Act, a $5.5 billion program that finances several expensive but politically popular items, like hospital subsidies and health insurance for low-income individuals.
 The law authorizing the Health Care Reform Act is set to expire in June, giving Mr. Pataki leverage in budget negotiations, since the program would cease to exist without his support. The program is not financed with Medicaid dollars but rather with revenues collected through, among other things, taxes on insurance policies, hospital bills and cigarette sales. Hospital trade groups, along with union leaders, said that getting the program reauthorized is one of their top priorities in the coming legislative session.
 The other proposal that the Pataki administration may offer to offset the pain of the Medicaid cuts is along the lines of a plan that representatives of 1199 and the Greater New York Hospital Association, a trade group, have been seeking for several years: an infusion of cash for an assortment of construction projects.
 People monitoring the issue in Albany said the Pataki administration had floated the idea of proposing a $1 billion capital plan that would allow hospitals to finish existing construction projects or begin new ones. Mr. Pataki mentioned such a proposal in his State of the State address last week, but did not offer any details.
 The program that union leaders and hospital executives proposed was called HEAL New York. It had two main components: one to provide money for new information technology systems for hospitals, and the other to make cost-saving consolidations of hospital programs, if the hospitals agreed to them. The Legislature last year approved $250 million for a similar program, but the governor vetoed it.
 Hospital trade groups said the scope of the Medicaid cuts that Mr. Pataki is contemplating would devastate New York's struggling health care industry.
 ''We are bracing ourselves,'' said Kenneth E. Raske, the president of the Greater New York Hospital Association. ''Right now, I am dealing with one basket case of a hospital after another. It's a looming disaster.''
 People familiar with the governor's plan said it would provide financial assistance to local governments whose finances are strained by the mounting costs of Medicaid.
 It would place a cap on local costs by requiring the state to pay for any yearly increase in local Medicaid costs roughly above the rate of inflation. Currently, local governments must pay for the entire increase in costs from one year to the next.

HEADLINE: Empty Nests, And Hearts

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS. 
E-mail: dabrooks@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Over the past 30 years, the fraction of women over 40 who have no children has nearly doubled, to about a fifth. According to the Gallup Organization, 70 percent of these women regret that they have no kids.
 It's possible that some of these women regret not having children in the way they regret not taking more time off after college. But for others, this longing for the kids they did not have is a profound, soul-encompassing sadness. 
 And it is part of a large pattern. Most American still tell pollsters that the ideal family has two or three children. But fewer and fewer Americans get to live in that kind of family. 
 Why? 
 For some, it's a question of never finding the right person to have kids with. Others thought they'd found the right mates, but the relationships didn't work out. Others became occupied with careers, and the child-rearing part of their lives never got put together.
 But there is also one big problem that stretches across these possibilities: Women now have more choices over what kind of lives they want to lead, but they do not have more choices over how they want to sequence their lives. 
 For example, consider a common life sequence for an educated woman. She grows up and goes to college. Perhaps she goes to graduate school. Then, during her most fertile years, when she has the most energy for child-rearing, she gets a job. Then, sometime after age 30, she marries. Then, in her mid-30's, when she has acquired the maturity and character to make intelligent career choices, she takes time off to raise her kids. 
 Several years hence, she seeks to re-enter the labor force. She may or may not be still interested in the field she was trained for (two decades earlier). Nonetheless, she finds a job, works for 15 years or so, then spends her final 20 years in retirement.
 This is not necessarily the sequence she would choose if she were starting from scratch. For example, it might make more sense to go to college, make a greater effort to marry early and have children. Then, if she, rather than her spouse, wants to stay home, she could raise children from age 25 to 35. Then at 35 (now that she knows herself better) she could select a flexible graduate program specifically designed for parents. Then she could work in one uninterrupted stint from, say, 40 to 70.
 This option would allow her to raise kids during her most fertile years and work during her mature ones, and the trade-off between family and career might be less onerous. 
 But the fact is that right now, there are few social institutions that are friendly to this way of living. Social custom flows in the opposite direction. 
 Neil Gilbert observes in the current issue of The Public Interest that as women have entered the work force, they have adopted the male model, jumping directly into careers. Instead, he suggests, it would be better to make decisions based on what he calls the ''life-course perspective.'' It's possible that women should sequence their lives differently from men, and that women may need a broader diversity of sequence options.
 Gilbert, who is a professor of social welfare at Berkeley, points out that right now our social policies are friendly toward this straight-to-work sequence and discourage other options. Programs like day care and flexible leave help parents work and raise kids simultaneously. That's fine for some, but others may prefer policies that help them do these things sequentially.
 It might make sense, for example, to give means-tested tax credits or tuition credits to stay-at-home parents. That would subsidize child-rearing, but in a way that leaves it up to families to figure out how to use it. The government spends trillions on retirees, but very little on young families.
 I suspect that if more people had the chance to focus exclusively on child-rearing before training for and launching a career, fertility rates would rise. That would be good for the country, for as Phillip Longman, author of ''The Empty Cradle,'' has argued, we are consuming more human capital than we are producing -- or to put it another way, we don't have enough young people to support our old people. (That's what the current Social Security debate and the coming Medicare debate are all about.)
 It would also be good for those many millions of Americans who hit their mid-40's and regret not having kids, or not having as many as they would like. As it says somewhere, to everything, there is a season.

HEADLINE: Bush's Budget Will Seek Modest Rise In Pell Grants

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Jan. 14 

 BODY:
Two weeks before the release of what the administration says will be one of the tightest budgets in recent times, President Bush told college students Friday that he would propose a modest increase in Pell Grants, the nation's primary scholarship program.
 Speaking at Florida Community College here with his brother Jeb, the state's governor, at his side, Mr. Bush said the 2006 fiscal year budget, scheduled for release the first week in February, would increase the maximum Pell Grant award by $100 each year for the next five years, to $4,550. 
 Mr. Bush announced the decision with some fanfare, before students and education officials in a large gymnasium. But his appearance seemed to underscore just how much the administration plans to cut back in an effort to meet its goal of halving the federal deficit in five years. The increase he announced would barely keep pace with the projected rise in inflation. 
 Further, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat who joined with the president to pass the No Child Left Behind Act, warned on Friday that Mr. Bush's Pell Grant initiative should not be taken at face value. Mr. Kennedy noted that Mr. Bush proposed during the 2000 campaign to raise the maximum grant to $5,100, or $550 higher than the level the president urged Friday afternoon.
 ''I welcome the president's new proposal,'' Mr. Kennedy said, ''but urge American families with kids applying to college not to count their chickens before they hatch. We've been down this road before.''
 Administration officials said they were not planning to put new money into the Pell program, which is aimed at benefiting low-income students. Instead, Mr. Bush said he planned to ''reform'' student loan programs, and a White House spokesman, Trent Duffy, said this meant reducing government subsidies to private lenders who provide student loans. The money saved, the president said, ''will be plowed into the Pell Grant program.''
 White House officials said the reductions in the subsidies would not affect students or the amount of money they can borrow for higher education. Instead, those officials said, the cuts will reduce the profits of banks and other lenders in the student loan program.
 For many years, the government has subsidized those loans, to encourage lenders to offer them at attractive rates. But Mr. Duffy said that in an era of extraordinarily low interest rates, the risk of loan default by students was now reduced and that the administration had determined that the subsidies were too generous.
 ''We are confident the lenders will stay in the program, because it is still highly profitable,'' Mr. Duffy said.
 Mr. Bush also proposed Friday to make permanent a loan forgiveness program, passed last year, for students who become teachers of math, science and special education programs.
 In keeping with his effort to expand education programs without committing new government money, he also said he would double the number of workers receiving job training. He argued that by reducing government mandates, ''we can double the number of people trained under the Workforce Investment Act for the same amount of money.''
 ''Government tends to change incrementally,''' he warned, ''and as it does, there's another set of rules and another set of regulations. And then, sure enough, after a while, you wake up and the money has got a lot of strings to it.''
 As for the Pell Grants, the Bush administration's Education Department rewrote eligibility requirements last year in an effort to cut the program's cost, which could easily surpass $12 billion in the fiscal year that began Oct.1.
 Because of those changes, which take effect next fall and are expected to save the government $300 million in the 2005-6 academic year, at least 1.3 million students will receive smaller Pell Grants, according to two analyses of the new rules. Mr. Bush noted Friday, however, that a million more students were receiving grants now than received them when he took office.

HEADLINE: Investors Flock To Loans Made To Companies Deep in Debt

BYLINE: By RIVA D. ATLAS

 BODY:
Charter Communications, the cable company controlled by Microsoft's co-founder Paul G. Allen, is struggling to hang on to subscribers even as it is weighed down by a hefty $19 billion in debt. Charter continues to lose tens of millions of dollars, and its stock trades at a mere $2 a share.
 But the company has regained the confidence of once-skeptical lenders. Indeed, lenders are so confident, they have bid Charter's $6.5 billion in loans at 100.25 percent of face value, even though there is no chance lenders will get more than 100 cents back. That is up from a price of just 83 cents on the dollar less than three years ago.
 The sudden popularity of Charter's debt is an example of a new exuberance in the market for corporate loans, an obscure investment once dominated by large commercial banks. 
 Over the last decade, banks have ceded much of the business of lending to riskier companies -- those rated BB or lower-- to an expanding group of investors including insurance companies, pension funds and individuals looking for higher- yielding alternatives to money market funds. 
 Lending to a broad range of companies is on the rise, with $1.3 trillion in financings completed last year, according to the Loan Pricing Corporation, a research firm. That is a 40 percent increase from the previous year.
 The biggest boom is in loans to highly indebted companies. These deals, known as leveraged loans, rose some 60 percent over the last year, to $480 billion. 
 ''There's been a party going on for the last year,'' said Mark Gold, who manages $4 billion in loan portfolios in New York for Trust Company of the West. The market has been so robust, he said, that there will eventually ''be some blowups, probably within the next year or two.'' 
 The number of new leveraged loans in 2004-- excluding refinancings of existing borrowings -- made it the industry's busiest year over the last seven years, according to Standard & Poor's LCD, which tracks the industry.
 Money from the recent flurry of deals has largely gone to finance buyouts and to replace old loans at companies with new ones carrying lower interest rates. Other companies, like Charter, are seeking to delay the dates when their loans come due. 
 Last year, Charter easily persuaded banks and other institutions to extend for as long as three years the due dates on money it owed them.
 Its lenders are betting that even if Charter's business does not improve, the sudden attractiveness of cable companies to acquirers means that in the worst case Charter's assets will be worth more than the value of its outstanding loans. 
 ''It is considered a safe investment,'' said Michael Lewitt, president of Harch Capital Management, which manages $600 million in bank loans and junk bonds and has a short position in Charter's bonds. ''But this company has a lot of hair on it. Lenders are relying on the markets for cable companies continuing to be as forgiving as they have been.''
 In fact, Charter's loans dropped slightly in price this week on reports that the sale of assets by another cable company, Adelphia Communications, was taking longer than anticipated.
 Other heavily indebted companies with loans trading at high prices include Revlon and American Airlines.
 Buyers of bank loans issued by companies like these are basing their optimism, at least in part, on an improving economy that could enhance the prospects of even the weakest businesses. Defaults on corporate loans have fallen to 1.01 percent of loans outstanding at the end of December, down from 2.25 percent a year earlier, according to S.&P. That is the lowest default rate since the firm began tracking this data in 1998.
 A growing number of investors are also attracted by the floating rates paid to lenders, at a time when interest rates are on the rise. Loan rates fluctuate based on the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a benchmark that borrowers use to reset the rate on their loans, often within three months. As of yesterday, the 30-day Libor rate was 2.66 percent. 
 One indication of the popularity of these loans is that assets in mutual funds specializing in corporate loans, known as prime rate funds, rose nearly 58 percent, to $25 billion, according to S.&P. Still, investors and analysts worry that lenders are taking imprudent risks that will haunt them when the economy eventually slows.
 ''The credit markets are incredibly complacent,'' Mr. Lewitt said. ''We're in a huge bubble but nobody knows when it will burst.'' 
 Analysts say the high prices at which loans are trading, the low returns that investors are willing to accept, and the weak credit ratings attached to recent offerings are all signs of an overheated market.
 A rising percentage of companies raising money in the loan market carry low credit ratings, according to S.&P. Loans rated B+ or lower accounted for 35 percent of leveraged loans raised last year, up from just 8 percent two years earlier. 
 Demand is so intense to invest in loans that even companies with uncertain prospects have been able to raise money at rates that got progressively cheaper over the course of the year. By the end of 2004, companies with debt rated BB could borrow at 1.96 percentage points above the benchmark Libor rate, down from 2.45 percentage points above Libor a year earlier. 
 As rates declined, borrowers took advantage, with costs lowered for some 38 percent of all leveraged loans. Many of these refinancings were done within just a few months of the original deals. 
 In November, for example, R.H. Donnelley, the publisher of yellow page directories, replaced most of a $2.5 billion loan it raised less than three months earlier with a new offering priced 0.50 percentage point cheaper, at 1.75 percentage points above Libor, according to the Loan Pricing Corporation.
 The rapid pace of these refinancings is good business for the banks, which earn a fee each time they arrange one of these deals. 
 ''This was one of the busiest years ever'' for such deals, said Andrew O'Brien, managing director and head of loan syndication at J.P. Morgan, the largest arranger of corporate loans. ''Companies are eager to obtain as attractive a rate as possible.''
 Investors who hold these loans often feel they have little choice but to agree to these refinancings, even though their returns on the loans are sharply reduced. That is because cash is pouring in to bank loan funds at such a fast clip, these fund managers are desperate for a place to invest the cash.
 ''The banks will tell you that if you don't do this there are plenty of people who will,'' said a manager of a loan portfolio at a large investment firm. He says he selectively agrees to such refinancings, as long as he is comfortable with the company's underlying prospects. ''Otherwise, it's a question of where do you reinvest the money?''
 Another sign that demand for loans outstrips supply is the lofty prices at which leveraged loans trade. Nearly 30 percent of leveraged loans trades above 100 percent of face value, according to Markit Group, which tracks loan prices, even though a company redeeming the loan will not pay more than 100 cents. 
 One investor who declined to speak for attribution admitted to owning Charter's debt because it was a good place to park cash. ''Everyone owns Charter,'' he said. ''It's so big and liquid.''
 Investors who buy such loans are gambling that the issuers of the debt will not look to replace the loans with new ones anytime soon, so that the interest they are paid in the interim compensates for the high price.
 Still, that can be a risky assumption, traders say, because most bank loans, unlike bonds, can be called, or repurchased, at any time. And with more than a third of all leveraged loans refinanced over the last year, there is a chance that the loan could quickly be replaced.
 Investors are increasingly willing to overpay for loans, said another investor, because cash is flooding in to their funds so quickly and they need a place to put it. 
 One investor said he was finding so few loans trading at reasonable prices that he was sitting on a large cash position. ''For now, we're being very selective,'' said Frederick Haddad, a senior portfolio manager with GoldenTree Asset Management, which manages $6.5 billion in loan and junk bond investments. ''Sooner or later, the market environment will change.''

HEADLINE: The Sophomore Slump

BYLINE: By Ronald C. White Jr.. 
Ronald C. White Jr. is the author of ''The Eloquent President: A Portrait of Lincoln Through His Words.''

DATELINE: La Canada, Calif. 

 BODY:
AS President Bush prepares to deliver his second inaugural address on Thursday, he has choices to make. Will he speak about security in Iraq or Social Security at home? With Mr. Bush experiencing the lowest approval ratings for a re-elected president since World War II, the stakes for his second inaugural address are high. Yet the expectations are low: of the 15 second-term inaugural addresses this country has heard, only Abraham Lincoln's has stood the test of time. 
 There is a better record for first inaugural addresses: Thomas Jefferson, Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy are at the front rank of presidents who have offered memorable ones. So what goes wrong the second time around? Three problems stand out. 
 First, a strong sense of personal triumph has dominated the opening paragraphs of second inaugural addresses. Most have begun with a steady staccato of ''I,'' ''I,'' ''I.'' First-term presidents have worked hard to be inclusive in their speeches. Jefferson set the pattern in 1801 when he declared, ''We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists.'' 
 Second, speeches at second inaugurations have generally concentrated on the problems of government. Although both of Ronald Reagan's inaugural addresses focused on the economy, the first was optimistic and idealistic, referring to the ''right to dream heroic dreams.'' The second got bogged down in a discussion of budget and tax code. 
 Third, the second time around, addresses have generally been longer and, often, long-winded. The most recent second inaugural speech, by Bill Clinton in 1997, was more than one third longer than his speech at the first inauguration. But he was following a pattern that began with Jefferson, who also went long in his second speech, spending considerable time talking about expenses and revenues.
 Abraham Lincoln began his second term with a speech that was exceptional on all three counts. While Lincoln's first inaugural address was more than 3,600 words, the second was only 701 words, the shortest second inaugural speech after George Washington's. 
 Second, Lincoln used personal pronouns only twice in his speech -- in the first paragraph and then never again. He directed all of his words away from himself. The Civil War was just ending, and speaking to a nation riven by it, he steadfastly used inclusive language. 
 Instead of ''I,'' Lincoln spoke of ''all'' and ''both.'' In recounting the events of the past four years he had an opportunity to demonize the South, but he did not take it. Rather, he credited the best intentions of the people of the South. As Lincoln recalled the coming of the Civil War, he was inclusive in assigning responsibility for it, saying, ''All dreaded it -- all sought to avert it.'' When Lincoln shifted from political to theological language, he continued the pattern of inclusiveness: ''Both read the same Bible, and pray to the same God.''
 President Bush will join James Madison and Lincoln as the only presidents to deliver second inaugural addresses in the midst of war. When Mr. Bush spoke of ''the enemies of liberty and of our country'' in his first address, no one imagined those enemies as terrorists who would unleash a deadly attack on the United States just eight months later. Now, a nation engulfed in a new kind of war is the formidable context for President Bush's second inaugural address. 
 An ancient Chinese proverb says, ''First time strangers; second time friends.'' Almost every president, no matter his previous positions, begins his term of office somewhat as a stranger. The second time around, Lincoln spoke more as a ''friend,'' asking his fellow citizens, in deeply emotive words, to act ''with malice toward none, with charity for all.''
 President Bush has choices to make in his second address. Will he be a ''friend'' who understands us better today than he did four years ago? 
 A second inaugural address provides a special opportunity for a president. Speaking to a nation that is deeply divided, the greatest choice President Bush confronts is how to bring a genuine sense of inclusiveness, an ''all'' and a ''both.''

HEADLINE: Do Manufacturers Need Federal Help?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN. 
William J. Holstein is editor in chief of Chief Executive magazine.

 BODY:
BIG business needs help from the government if American manufacturing is to remain competitive, says J.T. Battenberg III, chairman and chief executive of Delphi, the auto parts and mobile electronics company. Here are excerpts from a recent conversation:

Q. What's the biggest problem for manufacturers in the United States?

A. The cost structure. Many of the U.S. labor contracts signed over the past two decades had lifetime provisions, meaning lifetime guarantees for health care, pensions, retirement and very high wages. Health care, for example, is being paid by many U.S. manufacturing companies while competitors from other countries have their health care subsidized by their respective governments.

Q. What will happen to manufacturing in the United States?

A. It's going to go through a major transformation. What will not survive is the model of the 70's, 80's and 90's, when unions in industries such as autos were able to extract lifetime employment contracts, huge pension obligations and lifetime health care. Workers who are in their 40's and 50's in the auto industry are making $130,000 a year -- including wages, benefits, health care and pensions -- whether they work or not. That model doesn't work any more.

Q. What is the two-tier wage system that you've introduced at Delphi?

A. We recently signed a contract with the United Auto Workers to go from $65 an hour for current employees to $23 an hour for new hires. That's part of the transformation if we are to be competitive in the long term, and it is significant. The unions understand that you can't pay $130,000 any more if you are going to grow. You're going to have to take 65 percent less than that. Is that low enough? Probably not, to be competitive on a global basis, but it's a big move and will allow a significant number of jobs to stay in the U.S.

Q. Chief executives traditionally want the government to stay out of their business. Do manufacturers really want more government involvement?

A. Yes, the Business Roundtable has sent a letter to President Bush. We said that unless action is taken now, future growth in spending -- especially in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- will overwhelm the federal budget and the economy. Health care costs are of major concern and are threatening U.S. manufacturing companies. We also need tax reform to support growth-oriented policies that increase the competitiveness of U.S. companies so they can operate on a level playing field with their foreign competitors. Our letter is in the president's hands and we'll see where he goes with that.

Q. Are pensions a big problem for you?

A. Yes, many U.S. manufacturing companies have large pension liabilities. Federal law requires companies to pay enough money into their pension funds to keep them solvent. But the government's formula at times has artificially increased companies' pension payments. In early 2004, Congress provided a two-year temporary fix. We are now halfway through that and urgently need to get a permanent resolution.

Q. Even if many assembly jobs go offshore, will the United States retain high-end research and engineering jobs?

A. In Delphi, we have 17,000 engineers and about 40 percent of them are offshore now. We've just added 1,500 more in Shanghai and we have electronics engineers and software engineers in India, Mexico and Poland, for example. The R.&D. work is moving rapidly, in my opinion, offshore. Congress needs to make the U.S. government's R.&D. tax credit permanent. It's amazing, to me, that they haven't.

Q. Why does the private sector need help from the government on R.&D.?

A. Continued uncertainty and periodic revision of tax credits prevent a lot of C.E.O.'s from making long-term critical investment plans because we just aren't sure how much of the U.S. R.&D. investments will be offset by tax credits. Stability and predictability are very important aspects of what the government can do to help preserve manufacturing and R.&D. in this country.

Q. What will happen to the workers in the United States who lose their jobs?

A. Many workers will be retrained to fill new positions. However, looking forward, there's a very different concern because of the retirement of the baby boomers. Baby boomers now make up 60 percent of the workers between the ages of 25 and 64. The oldest members of that 60 percent are beginning to retire, and the number of baby boomers leaving the work force will accelerate rapidly during the next decade.
 Simply stated, the generation replacing retired baby boomers is too small to fill the gap. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says we will be 10 million skilled workers short in America in five years.

Q. Do you feel a personal moral or ethical commitment to keep any jobs here?

A. As an American, I want a strong American manufacturing base. I want strong American R.&D. But realistically, based on demographics and based on reality, you've got to think globally. It gets back to world-class quality and product technology and low-cost labor. At the end of the day, it's a total cost situation.
 I think that in the long run we can probably maintain a manufacturing base in the U.S., but I'm very, very worried about it. I'm not sure that we can implement the things that I've mentioned fast enough to retain a significant base.

HEADLINE: Social Security Enlisted to Push Its Own Revision

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 15 

 BODY:
Over the objections of many of its own employees, the Social Security Administration is gearing up for a major effort to publicize the financial problems of Social Security and to convince the public that private accounts are needed as part of any solution.
 The agency's plans are set forth in internal documents, including a ''tactical plan'' for communications and marketing of the idea that Social Security faces dire financial problems requiring immediate action.
 Social Security officials say the agency is carrying out its mission to educate the public, including more than 47 million beneficiaries, and to support President Bush's agenda.
 ''The system is broken, and promises are being made that Social Security cannot keep,'' Mr. Bush said in his Saturday radio address. He is expected to address the issue in his Inaugural Address. [Article, Page 20.] 
 But agency employees have complained to Social Security officials that they are being conscripted into a political battle over the future of the program. They question the accuracy of recent statements by the agency, and they say that money from the Social Security trust fund should not be used for such advocacy.
 ''Trust fund dollars should not be used to promote a political agenda,'' said Dana C. Duggins, a vice president of the Social Security Council of the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents more than 50,000 of the agency's 64,000 workers and has opposed private accounts.
 Deborah C. Fredericksen of Minneapolis, who has worked for the Social Security Administration for 31 years, said, ''Many employees believe that the president and this agency are using scare tactics to promote private accounts.''
 Social Security trustees say the program's financial problems will grow as baby boomers retire. The program will pay out more in benefits than it collects in revenue in 2018, they say. By 2042, they say, the trust fund will be exhausted, and tax income will be sufficient to pay only 73 percent of scheduled benefits. 
 In campaign-style speeches, Mr. Bush and other officials have said that Social Security is headed for bankruptcy, and that workers should be allowed to divert some of their payroll taxes into private accounts, as a way to build wealth for themselves and their heirs. 
 Such comments have prompted inquiries from the public to Social Security offices. Agency managers said they expected a torrent of calls after Mr. Bush's Inaugural Address on Thursday and his State of the Union speech two weeks later.
 Mark R. Lassiter, a spokesman for the Social Security Administration, said he could not discuss the agency's communications plans because they were ''internal documents.'' The agency, he said, has a duty ''to educate the public about the financial challenges facing Social Security,'' but has not prepared a script for employees to use in answering questions from the public.
 The Bush administration ran afoul of a ban on ''covert propaganda'' when it used tax money to promote the new Medicare drug benefit and to publicize the dangers of drug abuse by young people. The administration acknowledged paying a conservative commentator, Armstrong Williams, to promote its No Child Left Behind education policy. But on Social Security, unlike those issues, the government has not concealed its role.
 The agency's strategic communications plan says the following message is to be disseminated to ''all audiences'' through speeches, seminars, public events, radio, television and newspapers: ''Social Security's long-term financing problems are serious and need to be addressed soon,'' or else the program may not ''be there for future generations.''
 The plan says that Social Security managers should ''discuss solvency issues at staff meetings,'' ''insert solvency messages in all Social Security publications'' and spread the word at nontraditional sites like farmers' markets and ''big box retail stores.'' 
 Also, the document says, agency managers should observe and measure how much their employees know about the solvency of the program. 
 Mr. Bush has created a sense of urgency by declaring that ''the crisis is now.''
 A slide show, presented to various audiences by James B. Lockhart III, deputy commissioner of Social Security, says that ''benefit cuts would be drastic'' after 2042 if the Social Security law and payroll tax rates continue unchanged.
 A policy brief prepared by the agency says those benefit cuts ''would double the poverty rate of Social Security beneficiaries aged 64 to 78,'' increasing the number of indigent people in that age bracket to 1.8 million, from 875,000.
 Witold R. Skwierczynski, president of the Social Security Council of the federation of government employees, said: ''Some of the information being imparted by agency officials is not factual, not accurate. There is no immediate crisis.''
 In interviews, other Social Security employees expressed similar views. But council members were more willing to allow use of their names because a federal law generally protects them against ''penalty or reprisal'' when they speak publicly or testify before Congress.
 Social Security employees denied that their concerns were motivated by a bureaucratic mentality, a fear of change or a desire to protect their jobs. 
 ''There's a lot more to it than that,'' said Colleen M. Kelley, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents lawyers and paralegals at the Social Security Administration. ''There's a genuine concern about how people will live when they retire, a real fear that Social Security benefits could be eroded by private accounts.''
 The official policy brief, analyzing the consequences of inaction, was written by Andrew G. Biggs, the associate commissioner of Social Security for retirement policy. Mr. Biggs, 37, joined President Bush in making the case for private accounts at a White House forum this week. 
 When he was an analyst at the Cato Institute, Mr. Biggs championed private accounts, saying they ''would pay substantially higher retirement benefits than the current Social Security program'' because some payroll taxes could be invested in stocks and corporate bonds rather than in government securities.
 In 2003, just before he became associate commissioner, Mr. Biggs said that AARP, the lobby for older Americans, was ''spreading disinformation'' about the risks of private accounts. Mr. Biggs, who has a doctorate from the London School of Economics, said critics were wrong to suggest that personal accounts meant large cuts in benefits. In fact, he said, Social Security cannot pay the benefits it has promised. 
 The combination of benefits from traditional Social Security and a private account would substantially exceed what the current program can actually pay, Mr. Biggs said.
 Other analysts, including the Congressional Budget Office, have reached a different conclusion. They say the combination of benefits from the trust fund and individual accounts is likely to be less than actual benefits under the current system.
 In a document sent each year to millions of workers, the government emphasizes the looming financial problems. The document shows a worker's earnings history and estimated future benefits. But it says the scheduled benefits could be cut because ''without changes, by 2042 the Social Security trust fund will be exhausted.''
 Agency employees raised their concerns with Reginald F. Wells, a deputy commissioner of Social Security, and two associate commissioners, David L. Feder and Roger McDonnell. Mr. McDonnell confirmed that employee representatives had shared their concerns with him, but he declined to say how he replied.
 Robert M. Ball, who worked at the Social Security Administration for three decades and was commissioner under Democratic and Republican presidents from 1962 to 1973, said: ''It's fine for the agency to answer factual questions, but it's unusual to use the Civil Service organization to push a political agenda, especially because what they're saying is not true. The program is not going bankrupt.''
 When asked about the outlook for Social Security, several agency officials pointed to a White House ''fact sheet'' that says, ''By 2042, when workers in their mid-20's begin to retire, the system will be bankrupt -- unless we act now to save it.''

HEADLINE: Lower-Paying Teams See New York and Just Shrug

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
THE contrast was not lost on Doug Melvin. He was asked about his reaction to the dueling news conferences in New York last Tuesday, and he said, ''I'm sitting here trying to save $100,000 on salary arbitration.''
 That succinctly, Melvin, the Milwaukee Brewers' general manager, separated his and other small-payroll clubs from the Yankees and the Mets, the teams that excited New York with their almost simultaneous introduction of Randy Johnson and Carlos Beltran to the city. 
 But neither Melvin nor any of the half-dozen other practitioners of low payrolls who were asked expressed any ill will toward the New York teams for their ability to take on players of the caliber and salary of Johnson and Beltran, not to mention Pedro Martinez.
 Jim Bowden, the interim Washington general manager, said he wished Beltran and Martinez had signed with American League teams because the Mets are in the Nationals' division. But, he added, ''I always think it's good for baseball when stars go to New York; New York is such a great market.'' 
 To some general managers, the migration of those players to New York is more of the same.
 ''I don't think it's any different from years past,'' Terry Ryan of Minnesota said. ''The names and faces change. A couple years ago, it was Giambi and A-Rod. A couple years before that, it was Mo Vaughn. It's something that as clubs outside New York you come to expect. The Yankees are going to make some moves; the Mets are going to make some moves.''
 Ryan acknowledged that he watched both news conferences as an interested observer.
 ''I watch any of those,'' he said. ''I watched Shawn Green, too. I like to keep an eye on what's going on in those press conferences.''
 The Indians' general manager, Mark Shapiro, on the other hand, said that ''detached'' would be the word to describe his view of the New York festival.
 ''I don't spend a lot of energy contemplating what it would be like competing with those guys or chasing those signings or those teams,'' he said. ''I'm focusing on how we can win and get into the playoffs with our revenue.''
 ''Had they been in our division,'' Shapiro added, ''I would have paid a lot more attention.''
 From his vantage point, Dan O'Brien of Cincinnati said, ''You have to tip your cap to them for what they've been able to do to improve their clubs, but given our market, we understand the differential, and it's our job to put the best team we can on the field.''
 ''There are no illusions,'' O'Brien added. ''We know those caliber of players are going to have to be developed within our system, so we know what our path is.''
 Unlike the path the Yankees and sometimes the Mets take, the Reds' path is not paved with dollar bills.
 Neither is the one the Royals follow. 
 But the absence of dollars does not change the way Allard Baird does his job. ''It's pretty black and white,'' he said. ''They can afford to do it; we can't. If I have an ounce of being discouraged or disappointed, I shouldn't be the G.M. of the Kansas City Royals.''
 Melvin, who said his payroll would begin with a 4 this year as opposed to a 2 last year, said he didn't know what to think anymore.
 ''I was talking to a general manager in a similar market the other day,'' he said. ''We said there's no sense worrying about it. There's nothing we can do. We're different. We have to build through our farm system. When you do that, you have a small window with arbitration and free agency.''
 The economic gulf between teams like the Brewers and the Yankees, Melvin added, has changed the way he assigns scouts to report on other teams in case a trade should develop.
 ''We don't scout the Yankees and the Red Sox very much,'' he said. ''There's no sense spending time scouting them because their players with their salaries wouldn't fit here. It's like shopping at Tiffany's without any money.''
 Yet Melvin said: ''We play the Yankees three times this year. I'm excited about that. We'll probably sell out.''
 Dave Littlefield of Pittsburgh accepts the reality of the situation.
 ''Everybody's wired a little different,'' he said. ''We know what the system is. We know the resources we have. We're just working hard to make the best of it and trying to improve. There are examples out there. The Marlins two years ago is a great one. Oakland and Minnesota are good examples. My job is to keep improving and get to the goal of winning a world championship. I don't get down or discouraged. I just look at it as a challenge.''
 The Yankees' acquisition of Johnson surprised no one. The Mets' signing of Beltran surprised many, who expected him to sign with the Yankees. The real surprise was the Yankees' not going for Beltran because, they said, they had reached their payroll limit. ''I think everybody's got a choking point,'' Melvin said. ''It's just at different levels.'' 
 But O'Brien said, ''I suspect many of us in the game didn't know there was a limit to what they could do.''

Awaiting a Healthy Cut
 Scott Boras, a noted player agent, had an unusually large number of clients in the free-agent market this off-season. Seven of his 16 clients have signed new contracts. They include some of the highest-paid players on the market: Carlos Beltran, Adrian Beltre, J.D. Drew, Jason Varitek and Derek Lowe.
 With those five players signing for an aggregate of $314 million, Boras's seven signed clients have signed for $322.8 million. At 5 percent, that puts Boras's fees at $16.14 million. He will not get all of the money at once. Players pay their agents' fees as they are paid.

Did He or Didn't He?
 Early in this off-season, the Mets tried to get Shawn Green from Los Angeles, preferring to trade Mike Piazza to the Dodgers, with whom he began his career, and get Green for first base or right field. The Dodgers, though, told the Mets that Green didn't want to play in New York and therefore would block the trade, which he had the right to do.
 But Green's agent, Greg Genske, said Green never said he would refuse to waive a trade to the Mets.
 ''Shawn was never presented with any prospective trade to a New York team,'' Genske said. ''So he never refused to waive his no-trade clause to go to New York.''
 The matter has become moot. The Dodgers, proving again that the third time is a charm, traded Green to Arizona on their third try.

Enough, Already
 The steroids crusaders, Dr. Gary Wadler and Dick Pound most prominently among them, obviously understand the difference between legislating against steroids use by Olympic athletes and by athletes in professional sports. But they ignore that critical distinction and sound ignorant when they talk about steroids in baseball.
 They say that the union should cave in to their beliefs and that the penalties agreed upon in the new steroids-testing program are still not sufficient. But like any union, this one has the right to negotiate a plan it believes is right for its members.
 If the members -- the players -- wanted something more severe, they would let their labor leaders know. The players could have done that in 2002, when the two sides negotiated the first steroids-testing program, and they could have done it the past year as the two sides conducted talks for a revised agreement.
 Contrary to what some uninformed critics think, union leaders, even Marvin Miller, the patron saint of sports union leaders, listens when players talk. Otherwise, they don't hold their jobs. Ken Moffett learned that as Miller's successor in the early 1980's when he talked and the players listened, then dismissed him.
 To hear Wadler, Pound and others talk, baseball somehow should run roughshod over the union. They might be able to do that with Olympic athletes, but they wouldn't get away with it with a union of players.
 Even Commissioner Bud Selig, who wanted the strictest testing program, defends the union.
 ''I think it's an unfair criticism of them,'' Selig said. ''We've done it now; they've done it. No matter what these two parties do, it'll never be enough for some people.''

HEADLINE: China -- It's Just Business, Nothing Geopolitical

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
Shut up and keep buying. 
 Few countries are benefiting as much as China these days from the international status quo -- and Beijing knows it. So, as American criticisms of China have shifted from human rights to the value of its currency and the aggressiveness of its trade practices, Chinese leaders have tried hard to keep the peace while exporting ever more. 
 China's economy is doubling in size every 10 years, and personal incomes have been climbing steeply, especially in the cities. Trade with the United States plays a huge role in that growth, as investors around the world pour money into Chinese factories that make goods destined mainly for the American market.
 China's trade surplus with the United States now equals slightly more than a 10th of its entire economic output -- an extraordinary figure, considering how much of the country's economic output is inherently unexportable, from haircuts and construction to the Big Macs and grande mochas at the proliferating McDonald's and Starbucks stores. China is both a huge beneficiary of American consumer appetites, and profoundly dependent on them. 
 That dependence makes China nervous, especially when the Bush administration imposes restrictions on Chinese shipments to the United States -- everything from steel to bedroom furniture to brassieres.
 ''The Bush administration should have a vision and play a leading role in globalization and international trade, rather than sending a message to the world that 'We care more about our own businesses than anybody else's,''' said Xu Xiaonian, a prominent Shanghai economist, voicing a common sentiment.
 China needs a prosperous America, with economic policies that not only steer clear of protectionism but also encourage consumption and keep the dollar fairly stable. Low interest rates and big budget deficits have helped in the short term, by fueling a consumption binge in the United States. 
 While China has stayed focused on providing jobs for the millions of workers coming off its farms or losing jobs at inefficient state-owned enterprises, geopolitical issues like the war in Iraq have been only a secondary concern. China needs secure sea lanes for its ever-rising oil imports, and like the rest of Asia, it implicitly relies on the American Navy to keep the tankers safe. 
 From Beijing's point of view, although not Washington's, the thorniest issue is also the oldest: America's continued support for Taiwan, which China regards as a renegade province. China has warned again in recent weeks that the United States should stop providing military support for the island.
 But with the planned purchase of I.B.M.'s personal computer division by Beijing-based Lenovo, China's main message is, ''Want a desktop computer to go with that microwave oven?'' KEITH BRADSHER

HEADLINE: Exploring Utopian Dreams of Chinese History

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO

 BODY:
YALE UNIVERSITY ART GALLERY'S latest artist in residence, the painter Yun-Fei Ji, is a cheerful traveler of Chinese history, determined to figure out his life story as the child of disastrous Communist Party experiments in central planning and collective living. Separated from his parents when he was 2, Mr. Ji was brought up by his grandmother on a collective farm outside Hangzhou, a city near Shanghai.
 ''We thought we were building a better society,'' said Mr. Ji, 41, in his home-studio in Brooklyn, surrounded by sketches of collectivized pig farms, group latrines and communal eating halls. 
 ''I grew up during the Cultural Revolution, a time of immense chaos and confusion throughout the country,'' continued the artist, short and thin, with cropped black hair, a round face and perpetual smile. ''My father was a military doctor, while my mother was sent to a re-education camp in the countryside. My father took care of one of my brothers, and my mother cared for another, but I was sent to live with my grandmother. I saw my parents only now and then for almost 10 years.''
 Mr. Ji's signature painting style is based on traditional Chinese landscape painting, yet with modern, socially oriented subject matter.
 ''I use landscape painting to explore the utopian dreams of Chinese history, from past collectivization to new consumerism,'' he said. 
 Mr. Ji is participating in the second year of Yale's residency program, established at the gallery with a grant from Happy and Robert Doran, New England philanthropists. The first year there were two fellows, Janine Antoni and William Wiley. The program is designed to give one or more artists of any age access to the university's marvelous collections and brainpower. 
 ''Artists invited to conduct research at Yale will henceforth receive the same kind of strong support offered to other esteemed scholars in the sciences and humanities at our university,'' said Jock Reynolds, the gallery director. ''The residency program is being fully endowed and will grow in time, thus providing this invaluable service to visual artists in perpetuity.''
 The residents spend four weeks or longer over the academic year in New Haven, using the art collection and research libraries of the university, as well as talking to professionals in other disciplines. The artist does not have to spend the time in one block, but can visit periodically, as Mr. Ji does.
 ''The basic idea is to mainstream them with some of the foremost thinkers in areas around which they are making work,'' said Jennifer Gross, the modern and contemporary art curator at the gallery and overseer of the residency program. She and Mr. Reynolds choose the artists; there is no application process.
 Mr. Ji credits an early love of comic books with his interest in art. A lonely child, he used to read old comic books he found in the attic of his grandmother's home.
 ''I was fascinated by the pictures and the stories, and gradually began to draw,'' he said. ''When I returned to Beijing with my parents, I got an art tutor. I remember that he was an army artist employed to draw hand-to-hand combat illustrations and weapons for military manuals.''
 Mr. Ji moved to the United States to study in 1986. He was given permanent residency in 1989, after the Tiananmen Square protests, and moved to New York. He came to prominence in the Whitney Biennial in 2002, and since then has shown extensively throughout the United States and Europe. 
 Mr. Ji has just been taken on by the art dealer James Cohan Gallery, in Chelsea, where he is to have a solo show next year. An exhibition of his recent works is touring nationally, and is now being installed at the Richard E. Peeler Art Center at DePauw University in Greencastle, Ind.
 The painter, understandably, is interested in Yale's fine collections of Asian art and literature. Once or twice a month, in the company of David Sensabaugh, the gallery's curator of Asian art, he visits the off-site gallery storage space in suburban New Haven to pore over some of Yale's Chinese scroll paintings in a private viewing room.
 ''I really enjoy seeing these different paintings and talking with David about them,'' Mr. Ji said. ''They have some wonderful pieces by the 17th-century landscape painter Lan Ying. I'm particularly interested in the way they are painted, but also the history and stories they convey.''
 Mr. Ji has also been meeting with some of Yale's venerable academic staff. He has had lunches with Jonathan Spence, a professor of history and author of numerous books on China, and with Michael Ma, a Yale World Fellow and Chinese environmentalist and political activist. 
 Mr. Ji and Mr. Ma have a shared interest in the Three Gorges Dam, a project to dam the Yangtze River to stop annual floods and generate hydroelectric power for China's booming economy. Mr. Ji is completing a series of paintings on the subject.
 But it is not all gallery hopping and lunches. The artists are supposed to ''engage students in their research and creative process,'' Mr. Reynolds said, whether through informal discussions or gallery talks. The artists are not required to produce any sort of art work or exhibition for the residency, he added, although they could if they wished.
 Mr. Ji has no fixed plans for his residency, preferring to spend his time in the libraries or museums, dropping in on lectures or talking to academics.
 ''As an artist interested in history, there is so much here that I want to take advantage of,'' he said. ''By talking to anthropologists, historians and others, I can broaden my understanding of the events through which I lived.''

HEADLINE: A Solid Finish Can't Rescue the Market's Week

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
Despite a surge on Friday, the stock market declined again last week, and most stocks remained in negative territory for 2005.
 Upbeat economic reports set off a rally on Friday, but it was not strong enough to offset losses earlier in the week. 
The Federal Reserve in Washington said that factory output increased by 0.8 percent in December, a bigger jump than many economists had expected. In addition, the Labor Department reported that producer prices dropped 0.7 percent in December, the biggest decline since April 2003. These reports, suggesting that the economy was roaring ahead with inflation remaining under control, buoyed the market.
 Still, for the week, the three main market indexes were down slightly.
 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped by 45.96 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 10,558. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.67 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 1,184.52. The Nasdaq composite index barely budged by the end of the week, declining by just 0.7 point, to close at 2,087.91.
 In the bond market, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.22 percent from 4.27 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: Aspen on $250 a Day? It's Doable.

BYLINE: By ALISON BERKLEY

 BODY:
AT Zele Cafe in downtown Aspen, a woman strolled through the front door with her Pomeranian in tow and ordered a latte. The dog -- resembling a Chihuahua with long hair -- its ponytail pulled high, wore a pink fur-lined coat. With wide-set beady eyes and a tiny, slightly upturned snout, the dog's look was one of self-possessed entitlement, as if it spent all its time in bistro-style cafes lapping espresso drinks and nibbling on gourmet sandwiches made with grilled focaccia bread.
 ''Lilly gets cold easily,'' the owner said, scooping the dog into her arms. 
 It was immediately apparent why the words Aspen and budget are rarely used in the same sentence. No doubt Aspen has more than its fair share of wealthy tourists, top-notch accommodations, and dogs in fancy clothes, but it also has a more casual side most people never see, like a supermodel without makeup. I enlisted my old friend Listle Baird to drive up from Denver for the weekend to prove that Aspen is not out of reach, even for the budget traveler who doesn't want to spend more than $250 a day. (And that's per person. I told Listle I'd cover the cost of the hotel; otherwise she was on her own.) 
 Economy lodging exists, and the Web sites for Aspen's two largest reservations companies, Ski.com and Stay Aspen Snowmass (www.ski.com and www.stayaspensnowmass.com), make it easy to search for inexpensive rooms online. Both pointed to Aspen's only youth hostel, the St. Moritz Lodge, 334 West Hyman, (970) 925-3220, where bunk-style rooms with shared bathrooms go for as little as $30 a night during the early season (rates jump during Christmas week and then drop slightly). A private room seemed worth the extra money ($173 for two nights with tax). 
 Only five blocks from downtown beneath the steep, rocky slopes of Shadow Mountain, the hostel, a two-story European-style lodge, oozed with snow-covered gingerbread-house charm. Inside the lobby were all the standard Alpine touches: stone fireplace, wood-paneled walls and a front desk finished in an earthy, speckled granite. When we walked in at 8 p.m. on Friday, a random assortment of international travelers (from Japan, Argentina and Australia) sat around the coffee table drinking bottled beer and eating steak they had cooked on the grill outside. 
 When I checked in and told the man in the office I didn't have a credit card because my wallet had been stolen the week before, he shrugged and said, ''Bummer,'' and gave me the keys to our room. I assumed it would be O.K. to pay in cash when we checked out (and it was) because he didn't ask me for a dime. 
 The room was much bigger and cleaner than I had expected, with a big bay window, two twin beds, a large desk, television, closet, full-size bathroom and views of the mountain. 
 At 9 p.m., we walked gingerly down the icy streets toward town, five minutes away, to Genre Bistro, 316 East Hopkins, (970) 925-1260, to check out the bar menu and the scene. Opened in December 2002 by Vince Lahey and Craig Hart, two longtime local waiters-turned-restaurateurs in their early 30's, Genre is a reflection of young Aspen: hip but not overtly trendy, upscale but casual and with the best-looking staff in town. 
 The bar menu offered a sampling of the chef's tastes for a portion of the price (under $20) with many of the same appetizers and smaller-portion entrees that are available on the dinner menu. We shared tuna tartare for $12 and I had the Atlantic grilled salmon, a Jenny Craig-sized portion with red pepper aioli, arugula and roasted red peppers. For the same price, Listle got a hearty cut of sirloin steak buried in a pile of fries. My share of dinner, plus three beers with tip: $40. We also had the C-List celebrity sighting -- Rebecca Gayheart from ''Beverly Hills 90210'' seated at the next table with three friends. 
 On Saturday, we figured we would save the $74 lift ticket; an afternoon half-day lift ticket valid at noon can be bought anytime in the morning for $56. (For more information, go to www.aspensnowmass.com.) A full six-hour day of skiing is not only costly in terms of cash (especially when you factor in lunch), but it's also physically taxing, especially at Aspen's high elevation. We didn't want to be hobbled by sore legs -- we would need our money and our energy for the happening bar scene.
 We woke up at 10 a.m., got dressed in our snowboard gear, ambled down to the Main Street Bakery and Cafe, 201 East Main, (970) 925-6446 -- a tiny brick house with a picket fence, courtyard and pink swinging front porch door -- propped our snowboards against the wall outside next to several pairs of skis and entered to find the place buzzing with locals in ski hats and fleece jackets (no fur-coat sightings there). A pint-sized latte and So Cal omelet (a gut bomb stuffed with bacon, avocado, pepper jack cheese) ran $15 with tip. I figured all those fat grams would keep me going all afternoon to spare the time and cost of eating on the mountain, where a fountain soda goes for $2.75 a pop.
 After breakfast, I ran across the street and down the block to Carl's Pharmacy, an Aspen mainstay since the early 1960's, for the two most important morning-after necessities: toothpaste and a 10-pack of Advil: $5.84. Be warned -- the lack of oxygen at 8,000 feet above sea level makes for a nasty hangover. Had my left temple not been throbbing with brain-piercing intensity, I might have taken some time to roam about the old two-story general store, which sells everything from liquor to diapers. 
 We bought our tickets and hopped right onto the gondola, surprised to find there was no line. Conditions were ideal for early season, after a Thanksgiving weekend storm dumped over two feet of snow the week before. The slopes were wide open and eerily devoid of crowds, and it felt like we had the place to ourselves, like an empty stadium. 
 After snowboarding, we dragged our sore, aching bodies two blocks to Mezzaluna, 624 East Cooper Avenue, (970) 925-5882, a popular spot for apres ski because of its proximity to the mountain, cheap pizza and beer. Skis and snowboards cluttered the racks and planters outside, while ruddy-faced skiers clomped around in ski boots inside around marble tables piled high with discarded goggles, mittens and hats. A little more upscale than your average American pizza-and-beer joint, Mezzaluna's thin-crust version was served gourmet style, with julienned zucchini, carrots, peppers and basil pesto for $7 (a happy hour special). My share of the bill was $20 with tip, and I figured the hefty afternoon snack would allow me to get away with a small dinner.
 As easy as it would be to spend the entire night partying in our snowboard clothes (a testament to Aspen's casual side), we went back to the hotel to change before heading out to Cache Cache, a bistro that opened in 1986, for affordable French country cuisine; 205 South Mill Street, (970) 925-3835. The name means ''hide and seek,'' somewhat ironical since it is situated in a courtyard complex that also houses Campo di Fiori and Jimmy's, the hub of Aspen's dining scene. The cream colors, low lights and shirt-and-tie clad waiters achieves that European flair, but the crowd is distinctly Aspen, filling this otherwise serene space with eclectic music and loud conversation.
 The fact that it was our second bar menu in two days is deceiving, since this menu was far from the chicken-wings-and-burger variety, offering items like escargot and smoked salmon for heavily slashed prices. I ordered sliced sirloin steak au jus with whipped potatoes for $12, had one glass of Bordeaux ($7) and shared a sinfully good chocolate mousse parfait dessert (forget South Beach!) for a total of $30 for my share of the bill. Our adorable freckle-faced waiter, Ted Mahon, with his stories about climbing Mount Everest and running the Leadville 100, was well worth the tip. 
 After dinner, we went to Eric's Bar, 315 East Hyman, (970) 920-6707, across from the Wheeler Opera House, where the confluence of four interconnected clubs spills out into a heated courtyard. Frequented by a young, well-dressed crowd, Eric's could easily be mistaken for a club in any major city. My drinks came to just $15. Beware of ''tall'' pint-sized drinks poured with double shots; they can be dangerous, especially at altitude. 
 With a little over $145 to whittle away on Sunday, our options were seemingly endless. We talked about cross-country skiing ($19.95 for equipment rental) or snowshoeing ($16.50 for rental), at the Aspen Cross Country Center, (970) 925-2145, or ice skating at the new Lewis Ice Arena at the Aspen Recreation Center, (970) 544-4117. But after two hours of hanging out at Zele's, 121 South Galena, (970) 925-5745, $4 with tip, we were too lazy and sore to do anything but shop. 
 As we walked past Fendi, Baccarat, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Christian Dior and Ralph Lauren, I did my best to understand the appeal of window shopping. Fortunately, Aspen's secondhand stores are like a gold mine of castoff designer gems and marked down overflow inventory from the local boutiques. At Susie's Limited Consignments, 623 East Hopkins, (970) 920-2376, I walked out with a perfectly faded pair of Seven for All Mankind jeans (a steal at $24), a pair of purple suede Chanel ballet flats ($18), and a faux-fur-lined hooded white down vest by Nine West for $26 (I wasn't about to let that dumb little dog be more fashionable than me). Total: $73.85 including tax.
 Clad in new designer duds, we walked over to the Little Nell, 675 East Durant, (970) 920-4600, Aspen's only five-star, ski-in/ski-out hotel that is also the No. 1 spot for celebrity sightings. Who needs to pay $625 to $4,600 (peak season) for a room when you can steal a few hours of luxury over lunch at Montagna Restaurant? I savored every bite of the seared ahi encrusted in poppy and sesame seeds, followed by a Caesar salad topped with delicately poached salmon and polenta croutons. My half of the bill came to a whopping $40. Throw in the entertainment provided by demanding hotel guests at the next table, and it was worth every penny, even if we didn't spot anyone famous.
 Just to prove you don't have to be rich to afford the way the other half lives, I took my last bit of cash over to CB Paws Dog and Cat Boutique, 420 East Hyman Avenue Mall, (877) 616-7297, and bought an Aspen leaf collar for my dog: $23.90.

Total: $496.59

HEADLINE: Remember When Ken Lay Was a Genius?

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
ARE you new to a high-level job and fearful of failure? Then you may want to consult ''You're in Charge -- Now What?,'' a new management guide by Thomas J. Neff and James M. Citrin, executives at Spencer Stuart, the headhunting firm.
 But if you're an investor who plans to follow the criminal trials of disgraced former chief executives like Kenneth L. Lay of Enron, L.Dennis Kozlowski of Tyco and Bernard J. Ebbers of WorldCom, an earlier book by the same authors is much more entertaining. ''Lessons From the Top: The Search for America's Best Business Leaders,'' features secrets-of-my-success tips from, yes, Mr. Lay, Mr. Kozlowski and Mr. Ebbers. 
 ''Lessons,'' published in 1999 by Currency, is a perfect pre-crash, celebrity-C.E.O. period piece that includes fawning interviews with 50 business bigs. Mr. Neff and Mr. Citrin wrote that they used a ''rigorous methodology aimed at identifying the very best business leaders in America,'' which included results of a Gallup poll of 575 chief executives and an analysis of companies' stock performance and cash-flow growth. 
 Since its publication, nine of those leaders -- almost one in five -- have watched their companies become the subject of criminal prosecution, regulatory rebukes, shareholder revolts or all three. 
 Of course, any list of top executives from the bubble era is bound to include some flameouts. As the authors said in an interview last week, many executives on their 1999 list remain successful and in their jobs. 
 Still, given that this will be the year of executives-on-trial, the book provides some much-needed comic relief. And because Mr. Ebbers, Mr. Kozlowski and Mr. Lay may decline to take the stand in their defense, it's good to have a record of their achievements told in their own words. 
 Let's hear first from Mr. Ebbers, whose trial on charges of conspiracy, securities fraud and filing false statements to securities regulators, is scheduled to begin Tuesday. In his defense, Mr. Ebbers, who was fired from WorldCom in 2002 just a few months before it made the world's largest bankruptcy filing, is expected to contend that he knew nothing about the $11 billion accounting fraud at the company. He left the arithmetic at WorldCom to Scott D. Sullivan, his chief financial officer, his lawyer says. 
 Back in 1999, however, explaining how he made it to the top, Mr. Ebbers evidenced a more than passing involvement in financial matters at WorldCom, a company he founded. At first he was a passive investor, he explained, but when the company hit some turbulence, he parachuted in. 
 ''It was only after the company was in desperate financial straits that I became involved,'' Mr. Ebbers said. ''It was strictly a matter of survival.'' 
 Later in the interview, Mr. Ebbers boiled down his business philosophy to one main view: ''It is not how much revenue growth you can have. The question is how much does it cost you for each dollar of increased revenue that you get? We focus on that because a dollar of revenue is not worth anything unless it's a profitable dollar.'' 
 Alas, at the end, profitable dollars at WorldCom were far outnumbered by unprofitable ones. 
 Mr. Kozlowski, whose trial on charges that he looted the company is set to begin later this month, also takes a star turn in ''Lessons.'' Much of the interview centers on the unusually generous reward system he instituted at Tyco. ''There's no upward limit on our incentive programs,'' Mr. Kozlowski said.
 Mr. Lay, facing criminal prosecution in Enron's failure, has also shrugged off responsibility for the debacle by claiming ignorance of the manipulations that brought it down. Yet, six years ago when the sun was shining on the company, Mr. Lay took responsibility for it all. 
 What was his recipe for executive greatness? ''I think one of the secrets to our success has been creating big pockets of entrepreneurship throughout the company,'' he said. ''We start off recruiting very smart, very results-oriented, very creative, high-performance people. And then we create an incentive system that rewards performance, one that lets them share in the company's success.'' 
 Andrew S. Fastow, the former chief financial officer who set up partnerships that enriched himself at the expense of Enron shareholders, certainly took that ball and ran with it. 
 Another ''Lessons'' hall-of-famer is Franklin D. Raines, former chief executive of Fannie Mae, the mortgage financing giant. Mr. Raines lost his job -- but not his copious benefits -- last month after it became clear that the company would have to restate its earnings downward by about $9 billion for the last three and a half years. 
 ''Organizations need to have someone at the top who can keep everybody on track, and who will determine whether a particular item being discussed is part of its focus or not,'' Mr. Raines said in his interview. ''People lose track of what the goal is after a while.''
 ''Does this fit, or doesn't it fit?'' he added. ''Are you doing things that advance your organization toward its goal, or are you doing things that are moving it toward something else?''
 Like, say, the edge of a cliff?
 Perhaps the most loquacious executive in ''Lessons'' is Charles Wang, the former chief executive of Computer Associates, which last year agreed to pay $225 million in restitution to shareholders who lost money as a result of the company's accounting improprieties. 
 Mr. Wang was never charged in the matter; five of the company's former executives have pleaded guilty in the case. Sanjay Kumar, Mr. Wang's former deputy and his successor, has pleaded not guilty to charges of securities fraud and obstruction of justice. He awaits his trial. 
 What was the signal value that Mr. Wang said he brought to the Computer Associates' boardroom? ''I think to be a successful person, and C.E.O.'s are often very successful, you have to have integrity,'' he said in his interview. ''Your word has to be worth everything you've got. You must have a moral compass.''
 As for how he ran his business, Mr. Wang averred: ''It's not that complicated. I make sure that what comes in exceeds what goes out.''
 Mr. Wang also told his interviewers that it was crucial to give something back.
 ''I always tell everybody, give back, give back,'' he said. ''Because if you don't give back, this world is not going to get better. And if you're fortunate to do really well, give more.'' 
 Something may have changed Mr. Wang's mind after the interview on this topic. According to Computer Associates, Mr. Wang has not yet offered to give back any of the $14.4 million in bonuses that he earned during years in which the company's results were inflated by improper accounting. 
 What even a cursory reading of ''Lessons From the Top'' proves, of course, is that the prosecutors and regulators assaulting these corporate commanders are going after the wrong guys. Don't they know that chief executives are gods among men and worthy of worship? That's why their compensation goes up every year whether or not their workers lose their jobs or their stockholders' returns rise. 
 Companies are not really the property of their shareholders after all. They belong to the giants who run them. And the sooner everyone understands that, the faster we can put this unfortunate and undeserved attack on corporate leaders behind us.

PERSON: Elizabeth Janeway

HEADLINE: Elizabeth Janeway, 91, Critic, Novelist and an Early Feminist

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT

 BODY:
Elizabeth Janeway, who began her career as a best-selling novelist in the 1940's and later distinguished herself as a critic, a lecturer and an early advocate of the women's movement, died yesterday at a retirement home in Rye, N.Y. She was 91.
 Her death was reported by her son Michael Janeway, a writer and editor who is a professor at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism.
 Most of Ms. Janeway's earlier books were novels that focused on family situations and occasionally the pressures on women of modern society and were cited for their psychological acuteness and good sense. All the while, she reviewed books for The New York Times and other newspapers, and was credited for helping to introduce English writers like Anthony Powell to an American audience and for defending the artistic merits of ''Lolita,'' by Nabokov. 
 In the 1970's, she began to write nonfiction books about feminist issues: ''Man's World, Woman's Place: A Study of Social Mythology'' (Morrow, 1971), ''Between Myth and Morning: Women Awakening'' (Morrow, 1974), ''Powers of the Weak'' (Knopf, 1980) and ''Improper Behavior'' (Morrow, 1987), among others.
 Despite her conventional-seeming role as a wife and mother, she was always staunch in her support of feminism, remaining friends with women like Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem and Kate Millett, her son said. Reviewing ''Between Myth and Morning'' in The Christian Science Monitor, June Goodwin wrote: ''Of all the writers on the subject of feminism,'' Ms. Janeway ''has the most acceptability in the eyes of men. She has credentials, she is married to a successful man'' -- the economist and writer Eliot Janeway -- ''has children; as recently as 1969 she termed the women's movement 'frivolous and gestural.'''
 Ms. Goodwin concluded that women ''need to read books'' like this ''to have their thoughts and experience confirmed and thus to be reinforced for action.''
 Elizabeth Hall Janeway was born Oct. 7, 1913, in Brooklyn, the granddaughter of an Episcopal minister and the younger daughter of Charles H. Hall, a naval architect, and Jeanette F. Searle Hall.
 After graduating from the Shore Road Academy in Brooklyn, she spent a year, 1930-31, at Swarthmore College. Her son said that because the Depression wiped out her family's savings, she broke off her education to spend a year writing advertising copy for a department store, Abraham & Straus, and handling orders for the Book of the Month Club.
 She then went to Barnard College, taking her B.A. degree in 1935.
 In 1938, she married Mr. Janeway, who died in 1993. Their second son, William Hall Janeway, a financial executive, also survives her. 
 In 1943, she published her first novel, ''The Walsh Girls'' (Doubleday), about two New England sisters, one of whom rejoins the other after her German husband's death in a concentration camp. The book was praised by John Dos Passos, and it became a best seller. Six more novels followed, among them ''Daisy Kenyon'' (Doubleday, 1945), which was made into a movie starring Joan Crawford; ''Leaving Home'' (Doubleday, 1953; reissued by CUNY, 1987); and ''Accident'' (Harper & Row, 1964), as well as several books for young people and collections on writing that she edited.
 Ms. Janeway was also active on behalf of writers, serving as president of the Authors Guild from 1965 to 1969, a longtime member of the executive board of the American Center of Poets, Essayists and Novelists, a member of the board of directors of the McDowell Colony, and a judge for both the National Book Awards and the Pulitzer Prizes.
 She was a trustee of Barnard, a fellow of Berkeley College at Yale University and a director of the Legal and Education Fund for the National Organization for Women. 
 Through her husband's involvement with the Roosevelt and Johnson administrations, she came to know many prominent Washington figures, including Eleanor Roosevelt, about whom she wrote profiles. At the request of Walter Reuther, the labor organizer, Ms. Janeway served as secretary of the National Committee to Aid Families of G.M. Strikers during an auto workers strike against General Motors soon after World War II.

HEADLINE: U.S. Jobs Becoming Scarcer For Students From Abroad

BYLINE: By DAVID KOEPPEL

 BODY:
SUSANNA HUANG appeared to have credentials that almost any company would find strongly desirable in a job candidate. Ms. Huang, a second-year M.B.A. student at the Fisher College of Business at Ohio State University, has maintained a 3.9 average, has five years of experience at a management consulting firm and speaks both English and Mandarin. 
 But after six interviews and a prestigious internship at a Fortune 500 electronics company, she has yet to receive a job offer. As Ms. Huang is discovering, this is an especially difficult time to find employment as an international student.
 ''There are less companies hiring international students,'' said Trudy Steinfeld, executive director of career services at New York University. ''It's a huge hurdle. Many come here so enthusiastic, wanting a job in the American workplace. But they're having a difficult time. It can be heartbreaking.'' 
 Along with the emotional turmoil, red tape makes life for foreign students more difficult, school officials say. The biggest problem is that for fiscal year 2004, Congress cut the number of work visas by two-thirds, to 65,000 from 195,000, heightening already intense competition. Foreign students are dependent on employers to sponsor and help them get these visas, which allow them to continue working for three years after their student visa and ''optional practical training'' visa expire.
 That last visa allows students 12 months of internship or work experience that can be used before or after graduation. 
 Ms. Steinfeld and other career professionals said some companies had cut back sharply on hiring international students. Many foreign students said they were finding the job market less hospitable, especially when contrasted to the heady 1990's. Ms. Steinfeld said that while most American students can allot 2 to 6 months for a search, international students should give themselves at least 10 months. 
 Years of a downsizing economy have also hurt job prospects, as companies find it more difficult to justify hiring foreign-born students. Some counselors have started advising foreign students to consider returning home to work. 
 In the 2003-4 academic year, the foreign student population dropped 2.4 percent, to 572,509, according to the Open Doors Report from the Institute of International Education in New York. 
 Michaela Jacova, a Slovakian native who is a Princeton University senior majoring in political science at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, arrived a week before Sept. 11, 2001. She has been a strong student, held summer internships around the world and speaks four languages. But she was disheartened by the results of on-campus recruiting interviews in the fall and the harsher realization that many companies refused even to meet with her. 
 ''I never thought it would be different for me, but I'm slowly realizing that to a certain extent we're at a disadvantage,'' Ms. Jacova said about international students. ''Many companies don't want to hire us because of sponsorship issues. They consider it inconvenient, too much paperwork.'' 
 Ms. Jacova said that some of her recent interviews were uncomfortable. There was the recruiter who told her he was surprised that she had no detectable accent.
 And her unfamiliarity with American private schools, she said, put her at a cultural disadvantage in a second interview. The recruiter asked her to solve a hypothetical problem regarding an American private school. Because she grew up in Slovakia, her frame of reference was government-administered education, and she said she felt she did not come up with the answer the recruiter wanted. 
 Cultural differences are hardly new, but career development professionals say they always create an important gap for foreign students to overcome. Both Ms. Jacova and Ms. Huang say they are less adept than their American counterparts at selling themselves aggressively. 
 Danielle Hopkins, assistant director of international graduate career development at the Fisher College of Business, said foreign students must work harder to achieve the same goals as domestic students. 
 While internships are always important, she said, they are especially crucial for international graduates. An internship that allows an employer to appreciate a student's talent increases the chance that the organization will sponsor that student for a temporary work visa. She advises students to be flexible about returning home if finding work in the United States is not possible. 
 Globalization is making that a more palatable option, said Allan E. Goodman, president and chief executive of the Institute of International Education. Mr. Goodman said that Chinese and Indian students were finding it easier and more desirable to return home after graduating from American universities. 
 Ernst & Young, the accounting firm, has established a big presence in China and is seeking to recruit American-educated Chinese who speak Mandarin and are interested in returning home. The firm continues to interview international students but does not track how many it hires, said Dan Black, a recruiting leader for Ernst & Young's Americas practice. 
 Mr. Black said the decline in work visas had made it crucial for his organization and foreign students to start the paperwork six months earlier than in the past. This year, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services filled the 65,000-worker visa quota on Oct. 1, the first day of the new fiscal year. 
 Mr. Black said that Ernst & Young treated all job candidates with respect, but some international students have said they felt that other organizations did not always do the same. 
 ''I don't know if they feel they're being treated outwardly hostile, but there's a subtext that those with Middle Eastern names aren't really being considered,'' Ms. Steinfeld of N.Y.U. said. ''It's a reality that like most of the population, recruiters are more suspicious of Middle Eastern-sounding names.'' 
 Shafaq Khan, 20, a Columbia University sophomore, agrees with that assessment. Reared in Saudi Arabia but a graduate of an American high school, she is a naturalized citizen (her father is an American citizen) and thus does not have to be concerned with frustrating visa issues. She is planning to become an investment banker and is searching for an internship with a small venture capital firm. 
 In the process, she said, she has encountered patronizing interviewers. One asked, with surprise, ''Why do you speak English so well?'' 
 ''I'm sometimes met with skepticism and suspicion about my background,'' she said. ''I feel I'm always justifying and explaining.''
 Even with the frustration that some international students feel, there are stories of success. Administrators say that exceptions are often those students with specialized skills or degrees. Shern Frederick, 21, a Princeton senior from Trinidad and Tobago, just received his first offer, from an energy and utility company in Houston, as an energy trading analyst. He has not decided whether to accept. 
 Mr. Frederick, who studied operations research and financial engineering, said finding companies that would interview him at all had been the toughest part. Even though he appreciates his good fortune in being offered a job early, he recalls the sting of an incident at a Houston airport several years ago. 
 ''A customs officer approached me, and when I showed him my student visa, he was skeptical,'' Mr. Frederick said. '''Where do you go to school?' he asked me twice. I said, 'Princeton.' He asked, 'Are you sure?' It was unbelievable.''

HEADLINE: Latin America -- Hey, Remember Us, Right Next Door?

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO 

 BODY:
What will it take to get the United States to pay attention to Latin America? A resurgence of anti-American guerrillas? 
 That rueful question crosses minds here because, even as Washington worries about poverty and inequality generating new enemies for America in the Islamic world, it has shown much less urgency about similar problems festering in its own backyard. 
 When George Bush began his first term, Latin Americans had reason to hope that the pattern, evident since the collapse of the Soviet Union, would change. In a speech during the 2000 campaign, Mr. Bush had promised that, ''should I become president, I will look south, not as an afterthought but as a fundamental commitment.'' After he took office, his first state visit was to Mexico. 
 Then, of course, came the Sept. 11 attacks. As Washington focused on Afghanistan and Iraq, the Western hemisphere quickly reverted to the ancillary role it played during much of the war on communism. 
 During the cold war, at least, there were moments when Cuba, Chile or Nicaragua riveted Washington's attention. But now, Latin Americans say their region is almost completely off Washington's radar screen.
 At recent conferences in Mexico and Chile, Mr. Bush spoke of the power of trade to transform and unite the hemisphere. But as many Latin Americans see it, rather than seeking agreements that would spread and share prosperity, Washington is driving the hardest of bargains in trade talks and putting its commercial interests first. 
 In the meantime, to reduce their dependency and gain some leverage, Latin Americans have sought alternatives. Several countries now divide their trade almost equally among the United States, the European Union and Asia, and the Brazil-led Group of 20 has emerged to challenge Washington on issues from free trade to patents.
 Last year, much of the region's economic growth came from booming trade with China, which is increasingly seen as a card to be played against American hegemony. In the absence of the respect Latin America has always craved most from the United States, money talks loudest, and at the moment, it is China, not America, that seems to be accomplishing the most with it.

HEADLINE: Baseball's New Performance Bonus

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
WOULDN'T it be nice if your future salary was determined largely by what you had done during your best day at the office? That, roughly, is what has happened to Carlos Beltran, the center fielder the Mets signed this week.
 As much as any player in the game's modern history, Beltran made himself a great deal of money -- perhaps an extra $30 million -- by excelling during a brief period.
 Entering last year's playoffs, he looked like a fine player, even an excellent one, with power, speed and a good glove. But he was not one of the game's very best players in the minds of most people. He hit .267 last year, good for 118th place in baseball. 
 Based on all of his statistics, as well as his age and recent contracts signed by other players, Beltran could have been expected to make about $12.9 million a year in coming seasons, according to Jared Weiss, an economics student at the University of Chicago, and Ben Murphy, an author of Baseball Prospectus, a scouting guide.
 In the playoffs, however, Beltran put on one of the more impressive displays in memory, hitting .435 with 8 home runs in 12 games for the Houston Astros and making a diving catch that drew comparisons to Willie Mays. He quickly rose to a category all his own in this winter's free-agent market, and the Mets signed him to a seven-year deal averaging $17 million a year.
 Similarly, Derek Lowe, who won the clinching game of the World Series for the Boston Red Sox, signed a $9-million-a-year deal with the Dodgers last week. Having given up the second-most runs in the major leagues over the last two seasons, Lowe had compiled a resume that suggested a salary closer to $5.7 million.
 The Mets and Dodgers, of course, are hoping that the real Beltran and real Lowe were on display last October and that they are worth the investments. They might well be. As in most areas of life, however, the history of baseball suggests that years of achievement are usually more telling than weeks of it.

HEADLINE: Replanting The Rainbow Flag

BYLINE: By MEGAN COSSEY

 BODY:
WHEN Emily Haddad moved to New York shortly after finishing college in 2001, she didn't know much about the city, but being gay, she knew she wanted to live in a gay-friendly community.
 Her neighborhood of choice? Park Slope. 
 ''It seemed like lesbian central in New York,'' said Ms. Haddad, 24, whose unaccented speech belies her North Carolina roots. 
 Park Slope was the neighborhood where she marched in the Brooklyn Pride Parade during her first summer in New York. She spent another afternoon at the Rising Cafe, a lesbian coffee shop on Fifth Avenue, and ended up in a spirited discussion with some women from Dyke TV, a weekly television show. It was also the neighborhood where she volunteered at the Lesbian Herstory Archives, on 14th Street near Prospect Park. The Archives, and by extension Park Slope, became her adopted home. 
 But she never did make Park Slope her actual home, nor did any of her lesbian friends. ''Dyke Slope,'' as it is affectionately called by many lesbians, was too expensive for them, as it has become for many other New Yorkers. Instead, Ms. Haddad found a cheap, newly renovated two-bedroom apartment in a rowhouse on 51st Street, deep amid the residential sleepiness of Sunset Park. She splits the $1,500 monthly rent with a female roommate, who is straight.
 Ms. Haddad's first priority, she said, was finding a neighborhood with a strong family feel, regardless of any gay presence, though she admitted keeping an eye out for rainbow flags and initially feeling nervous when she held her girlfriend's hand in public. 
 ''I would have loved to live in Park Slope,'' said Ms. Haddad, a filmmaker with long, dark hair and gentle eyes whose day job is at Lambda Legal, a gay rights group, ''but I wasn't finding anything.'' 
 Park Slope has long enjoyed the cultural cachet of being New York's premier lesbian neighborhood. However, as happened with the gay scene in the West Village, its reputation has somewhat outlived its reality, especially for many younger lesbians. 
 ''Park Slope is a done neighborhood,'' said Alice Corporan, 33, a real estate agent who lives in Clinton Hill with her girlfriend. ''The people who are living there have been living there for many years.'' 
 When Ms. Corporan gets a lesbian couple, or anyone else, eager to buy in the Slope, she generally advises that they look elsewhere. Indeed, she has watched her own neighborhood attract an influx of gays and lesbians since she moved there four years ago, and said buyers could land a one bedroom for $300,000, a relative bargain. Park Slope still has an established lesbian population, she said, but they are the ones who can either afford million-dollar town houses or who bought long ago. 
 For her girlfriend, Maria Toro, who is Puerto Rican and grew up in East Harlem, Park Slope was never even an option. Ms. Toro considered it too upper-class, too heterosexual and a little too white, and was drawn to the racial diversity of Clinton Hill. Park Slope, she added, ''is for displaced Upper West Siders who want a little more space at a better price and they bring their baby carriages with them.'' 
 Which isn't to say Park Slope has turned completely straight. According to the Gay and Lesbian Atlas, a report based on 2000 Census data and published by the Urban Institute, an economic and social policy research group, Park Slope ranks first among the city's neighborhoods for lesbian couples per capita. But because the survey measured only the number of couples -- and many of them were between 25 and 54 years old -- it did not include the single, many of whom are quite young and the very women who cannot afford to live there anymore. 
 Park Slope was not always an upper-middle-class neighborhood of renovated brownstones and boutique bohemianism. Maxine Wolfe, 63, a coordinator at the Archives and a longtime lesbian activist, became part of a community of feminists, many of them lesbians, who chose Park Slope instead of the suburbs in the late 1960's and 70's, part of a trend that reversed the postwar white flight from urban areas. By the 80's, said Ms. Wolfe, a retired City University professor, Wall Street companies were giving prospective employees bus tours of Park Slope, a once-edgy neighborhood that had become prime real estate. 
 A report by the Brooklyn Historical Society shows that many lesbians, mostly Latinas and younger women, were being priced out of Park Slope even in the early 90's and settling in neighborhoods like Sunset Park. 
 ''I think the lesbian spirit is still kind of pulsating somewhere, but I don't think it's going to pulsate in the heart of Park Slope,'' said Tina Luongo, 37, a Red Hook pet store owner and Brooklyn native who gravitated toward Park Slope after coming out of the closet at 18. Instead, she said, younger lesbians are heading to less developed areas like Williamsburg, Dumbo and her newly adopted neighborhood. 
 While the number of lesbian couples in Red Hook and Williamsburg as of 2000 was only slightly higher than the city average, many women moving there now are young or single. In recent years, several gay- and lesbian-owned nightspots have sprouted along Red Hook's still sparsely settled streets. One place is the Bluestone, a restaurant and bar with a striking view of Lower Manhattan and, just outside, towering cranes and stacks of shipping containers. The owner, Vanessa Whalen, said people thought she was crazy when she opened last year. But, she added, she knew she couldn't have started such a place in Park Slope. 
 ''It's just too expensive,'' she said, sitting one recent afternoon at Bluestone's oak bar with mahogany inlay, which she built with another woman, a carpenter she met in Red Hook. ''I also don't think the community is there anymore.''
 BUT go farther north to Williamsburg, and there it is. Metropolitan Bar, a gay and lesbian hangout, is thriving among the throes of change. Forsaking the trendier precincts of Bedford Avenue, it sits off the more remote second stop of the L train on Lorimer Street. On a recent weeknight, it was packed with a 20-something crowd, among them Yumi Lee, 22, and her roommate Anna Wolk, who had come from Harlem with a third friend. ''I like this bar,'' Ms. Wolk said, ''and it's one of the more welcoming.'' Besides, she said, ''everyone I know lives in Brooklyn.'' She and Ms. Lee ticked off the neighborhoods: Bedford-Stuyvesant, Sunset Park, Greenpoint, East Williamsburg. 
 Meanwhile, Park Slope is going through its own transition, though its restaurants, boutiques and cafes draw a young, artsy crowd where the distinction between straight and gay is blurry. The Rising Cafe closed in 2003, which leaves only Ginger's, a Fifth Avenue bar, as the remaining seven-day-a-week lesbian hangout. But the owners of Meow Mix, the well-known Lower East Side lesbian club that closed in July, are planning a new venture. One of Meow Mix's owners, Allegra Rose, said a bar would open in the spring, on Fourth Avenue near President Street.
 And in Sunset Park, Ms. Haddad finally got a little of the queer community she was looking for when another volunteer at the Herstory Archives, Ashley Bowers, moved into Ms. Haddad's building with her girlfriend, Emily Holod. 
 The couple agreed that their friend's presence helped them decide to make the move, ''knowing that she felt safe here as a queer person and a woman,'' said Ms. Bowers, as she rushed to show off her big backyard garden.
 All three women possess a growing affection for their neighborhood, even though they don't completely feel at home there yet. They keep an eye out for other lesbians and gays, and take comfort in the rainbow flags that are popping up on cars and windows. 
 ''It makes me happy, it makes me definitely happy to see them here,'' Ms. Bowers said. She has worried a bit more about possible homophobic attention since getting her bright blond hair cut short, but in the same breath she laughed at her fears. ''I think there's more of a sense of community than anyplace I've lived in New York,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Waiting For Wheels

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

 BODY:
''SLOW down and make a left here,'' said Ed Klobus, his hand poised above the steering wheel.
 Carey Vanderborg put on his blinker and slowed down.
 ''Pull up,'' Mr. Klobus said.
 Carey pulled up.
 ''Pull up some more,'' Mr. Klobus said.
 Mr. Klobus was taking Carey, a 16-year-old junior at Jericho High School, for one of his last driving lessons. They practiced parallel parking and squaring off for a turn. Mr. Klobus lectured on safety, talking about reaction times and minimum distances for following traffic; Carey was more interested in parallel parking and three-point turns, which appear to be the crux moves of the road test he will have to pass to get a driver's license. 
 Though Carey had failed his road test once, he seemed fine behind the wheel. But Mr. Klobus could tell you stories: the ones who mistake the gas for the brake, the ones who make a left when they're supposed to make a right. Mr. Klobus has a brake pedal on his side of the car, to which, he said, he owes his life. But that doesn't help the ones who freeze in panic in the middle of an intersection. ''There've been close calls,'' he said. 
 Carey was finished and sat in the back seat, letting his classmate take over. ''My mom thinks I'm a bad driver,'' he said, adding that his brother had recently gotten into a serious car accident. ''I could tell she's really scared for me. She says, 'Even though you're going to pass your road test I'm still not going to let you drive.'''
 Mothers have spoken such words to their sons and daughters for decades. The classes haven't changed that much either. Even the videos look the same, with gruesome car wrecks and a narrative as melodramatic as the blood-on-the-road films that driver ed was infamous for in the 1970's.
 Despite its gradual displacement from school curriculums, driver education remains a rite of passage for Long Island teenagers. If anything, it is more essential than it used to be. With the introduction of the graduated license in September 2003, driver education has become a requirement if one wants to get behind the wheel with a car full of friends at the age of 17.
 Long Island teenagers say being able to drive for senior year is a social necessity. ''If I had the choice I wouldn't take it,'' Ryan Atlas, a 17-year-old junior, said of his driver-ed class in Jericho. 
 But there is a choice, right? Ryan could wake up early for a 7:30 a.m. driver-ed class a couple of times a week for a semester and get that Infiniti all to himself, or he could continue to depend on one of his parents to be in the car with him after 9 p.m.
 Ryan regarded that as no choice at all. 
 But for all the emphasis on driver education, instructors, education officials and parents raise issues about inadequate oversight and inconsistent regulation of the process in New York State. And there is still the question, asked repeatedly by researchers over the past 20 years, if driver ed makes safer drivers.
 Automobile crashes remain the leading cause of death for teenagers. Nationwide in 2003, car crashes killed 3,657 drivers between the ages of 15 and 20. Nearly 8,700 people of all ages -- a fifth of all traffic fatalities -- were killed in crashes involving teenage drivers. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in 2003 on Long Island there were 54 fatalities from crashes involving 15-to 20-year-old drivers, compared with 57 in 1994. 
 What is particularly striking about the statistics is how rapidly the crash rate drops with age. Nationally, 16-year-olds get into crashes at almost twice the rate of 18-to 20-year-olds. Graduated licenses, which add restrictions and postpone the time when teenagers can get full licenses, were meant as a way to change these statistics. The program has worked in other states, reducing teenage crashes by 31 percent in Michigan, for example. 
 In New York, since September 2003, teenagers have had to hold onto their permits, or a restricted form of the junior license, for at least six months. This new rule was meant to extend the amount of practice time for teenage drivers before they were eligible for a junior license. 
 But even junior licenses aren't what they used to be. The junior license is what a teenager gets after driving six months, passing the road test and turning 17. For years it has meant that, until they turn 18, they can drive alone after 9 p.m. only if they are traveling to or from work or school. But an additional restriction was added in 2003, barring junior license holders from driving with more than two passengers under the age of 21, unless a parent or guardian is along for the ride or if the passengers are siblings of the driver.
 In New York, there has always been a way to speed this process up: taking a driver education course. All new drivers, no matter what, have to take a five-hour classroom course before they can take the road test. But if a teenager takes a full driver education course while she is 16 and has held a permit for at least six months, she can get a full license at 17, a year earlier than someone who did not take driver education. 
 Traffic safety researchers have praised the graduated license program but are skeptical about any system in which driver education speeds up the licensure process. Dan Mayhew, senior vice president of the Canada-based Traffic Injury Research Foundation, said he doubts that traditional driver education makes a difference either way in avoiding crashes. But when taking a course leads to a quicker license, he said, driver education can be worse than harmless.
 ''The evidence is mounting that allowing teenagers to get off the learner phase sooner than they would otherwise leads to a higher crash rate,'' he said. He pointed to a study a decade ago in Nova Scotia, where teenagers who got a time discount for driver education had a 27 percent higher crash rate than teenagers who didn't take a formal course and had to wait. In one similar study in Ontario, the rate was 44 percent higher. 
 The studies showed, he said, that a few extra months of supervised practice mattered far more than whether that supervision was formal or not. In an article last year in Injury Prevention, Allan Williams, a senior researcher for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, summed up the research bluntly: ''There is no difference in the crash records of driver education graduates compared with equivalent groups of beginners who learned to drive without formal education.''
 That the Insurance Institute is so unequivocal about the ineffectiveness of driver education may be surprising. It is financed, after all, by auto insurers, many of which give discounts for taking driver education. But the discounts, safety experts say, are given not because driver education has any proven safety benefits, but because people who voluntarily sign up for driver education tend to be safer drivers.
 These conclusions about driver education are not new. In fact, the research behind them has influenced the way driver education has been provided in New York for the past three decades.
 In the early 1970's, almost all New York high schools included driver education as part of the daily curriculum. The districts picked up the costs and local dealerships even donated new cars to the schools, in hopes of gaining new customers. But in the mid-70's, when budgets tightened, driver education was often cut. Like home economics, it was gradually pushed out of the curriculum. Some school districts began financing driver-ed programs by charging students. But as the cost of liability insurance increased and local dealerships stopped being as generous with their cars, more schools began dropping the program altogether.
 In many states, commercial driving schools stepped in and picked up where the secondary schools left off. But in New York the picture was more complicated. The state Department of Education allows the required 24 hours of behind-the-wheel practice and observation to be contracted out to a commercial driving school, but the 18 hours of classroom instruction must be taught by someone with a teaching certificate, not just an instructor's license, and paid by an educational institution. 
 Driving school instructors are critical of a setup that prevents them from running the entire program. Connecticut allows driving schools to manage everything from the curriculum to the cars, and New Jersey will be allowing the schools to teach the classes and give written and vision tests this year. 
 Barbara Davis, owner of the Defensive Driving School in Islip, said the policy of keeping driver education in the classroom means that the commercial school only gets a portion of the student's fees. There are experienced certified instructors on her staff, she said, but after the operating expenses and the insurance payments the portion left over does not allow for attractive salaries. 
 She and several driving school instructors said commercial schools sometimes cut corners, whether by employing unlicensed instructors or paying them off the books. That gives all commercial driving schools a bad name, she said.
 Some say the policy was devised to provide employment options to teachers. 
 ''The Department of Education wants that because it's extra money in their pocket,'' said Barbara Fitzgerald, the owner of Fitzgerald's Driving School in North Babylon. ''And besides, the teachers get an extra job.''
 Education officials counter that the policy keeps the courses regulated. But whatever the reason, keeping a portion of driver ed in the schools has brought its own set of problems. Though driver education is a part of the licensure process and thus a concern of the Department of Motor Vehicles, its oversight rests with the Department of Education. And when two different authorities share one responsibility, it's easy for things to fall between the cracks.
 ''I think somebody has to take responsibility for it and they're not now,'' said Carlos Cuprill, who was in charge of coordinating driver education for the state until he retired from the Department of Education in 2003. The Department of Motor Vehicles, he said, considered driver education the job of the Department of Education, which, in his opinion, did not take it seriously.
 ''They don't seem to think it's necessary,'' he said. ''It's not a priority. It's not reading, math or English.''
 Anne Schiano, an assistant director at the Department of Education, did not dispute Mr. Cuprill's remarks but said the department was working to make the system more efficient. Commercial schools say they are trying to give students the most efficient and effective driver-ed program, but Mr. Cuprill, who often locked horns with commercial school owners, thinks that allowing the driving schools to provide the classroom component of driver ed would not result in better drivers.
 ''When you start doing it for money, you look the other way,'' he said. ''It's not about the quality of instruction, it's about the quality of the money. Unless someone takes responsibility, then what are you doing?''
 Without question, driver education is a big business. There are 74 licensed driving schools on Long Island. They range from small operations out of people's homes to large schools with hundreds of students. Many work on a contract basis with secondary schools, providing the behind-the-wheel portion while the schools teach the classroom portion. To high school students, who usually pay a flat fee between $350 and $450, the division of labor is practically unnoticeable. 
 According to the Department of Education Web site, there were 81 approved programs in Long Island public schools and 28 in private schools in the 2002-2003 school year, the last year for which the department compiled a list. Only a few still offer courses during the regular school day; some students take it after school, but with sports and other extracurricular activities eating up the afternoons, early morning, weekend and summer classes are most popular. 
 Commack High School is one of about a dozen high schools in Suffolk County that does not offer any form of driver education, neither the classroom instruction nor the lessons behind the wheel. Kathy Hollingsworth's children went to Commack and she was determined that they take driver education. The Smithtown school district offered it, but only for Smithtown students. There was St. Anthony's, a Catholic high school in South Huntington, but its driver-ed program fills up quickly. And the Torah Academy, a private Jewish high school with a driver-ed program, recently moved 25 minutes away, from Commack to Syosset. 
 Both of Ms. Hollingsworth's children ended up going to the Torah Academy, where, she said, the behind-the-wheel instruction seemed to be lacking.
 ''She never went on the parkway,'' Ms. Hollingsworth said of her daughter Stacie's class. ''It wasn't needed on the road test so they didn't take them on the parkway. What else do they teach them? How to go down a road and stop at a stop sign?''
 She and other parents have begun urging Commack High School to provide driver education. The school has spent the past few months checking out its options.
 In the meantime, Stacie Hollingsworth is waiting to take her road test again after failing it the first time. She recently took driving lessons to prepare, even though she had already taken a full driver education course this summer at the Torah Academy. The instructors did not offer much guidance, she said. 
 But the prospect of being 17 without a full license is not pretty. Many of her older friends who hadn't planned on taking driver ed ended up taking it because of the new restrictions in 2003. It has become a necessity, she said, but she isn't sure it makes a difference. Her next road test is soon, but the real test starts after she gets her license.
 ''Around Commack I'll be all right,'' she said. ''But once I start hitting the parkways, I'll need a little more practice with that.''

HEADLINE: Honoring the Miners Who Built New York

BYLINE: By ROSAMARIA MANCINI

DATELINE: PORT WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
TWENTY thousand years ago, the glaciers that formed Long Island retreated. The sand that covered the shores of what became Port Washington had a mixture of grain sizes and shapes, different from that typically found along the Island's Atlantic shoreline. Because of this quality, it packed together easily, and was well suited for making concrete. Years later, an industry grew.
 Sand mining sprung up in Port Washington in the 1870's, when New York City's subways, skyscrapers, highways and bridges were first being built. The concrete of New York's infrastructure and buildings -- including the Chrysler Building, the Empire State Building, the World Trade Center, the Queensborough Bridge, the F.D.R. Drive and the West Side Highway -- contain some of the 140 million cubic yards of Port Washington sand mined over the years. 
 There were sand mines in Oyster Bay, Northport and Huntington, all part of a local industry that at its height supported dozens of companies, among them Colonial Sand and Stone, Metropolitan Sand and McCormack Sand, and thousands of miners. But Port Washington, with the largest sandbank east of the Mississippi River and easy barge access to New York City, New Jersey and Connecticut, was the center of the business.
 ''It was good sand, perfect for concrete,'' said 88-year-old John Murro, who worked in the mines for more than 40 years.
 The industry faded by the 1980's, and North Hempstead now owns the land, which is mostly brush. Part of it is the Harbor Links Golf Course. But many here still remember the mines and miners. And those memories have inspired a local community group and a local artist to develop a plan for a monument. 
 The group, the Sandminers Monument Inc., has won the support of Jon Kaiman, North Hempstead's town supervisor, to build a memorial on part of the former site of the mines, along West Shore Road, adjacent to the golf course, in Port Washington. 
 ''It will not only recognize the industry's influence on the local economy,'' Mr. Kaiman said, ''but it will memorialize a piece of our heritage and recognize the workers who had a hand in creating New York City.''
 If the town board approves the plan, fund-raising will begin, said the group's lawyer, Robert Klugman. He said the fund-raising campaign would target both state and federal agencies. At least $100,000 is needed, he said.
 Mr. Kaiman and Fred Pollack, a North Hempstead town councilman, plan to present the proposal to the town board in February, along with other preservation plans. Mr. Kaiman said he expected the board to approve the proposal.
 The mines and the workers, mostly immigrants from Italy, Poland and Scandinavia, are a source of pride around here.
 ''If we don't do something to remember these workers, then people will forget them, and it will be as if nothing ever happened here,'' said Leo Cimini, president of the group that pushed for the memorial.
 Mr. Cimini, of Port Washington, did not work in the sand pits, but said that as a former president of the local Sons of Italy chapter, and resident of the town since 1969, he has long been aware of the mines and their history. 
 The memorial is to be designed by Lauren Garofalo, 22, a graphic designer who grew up and lives in Port Washington. It will consist of a six-foot sculpture of an 1890's sand miner pushing a wheelbarrow filled with sand. Emerging from the sand will be the New York City skyline. 
 Ms. Garofalo, who is not being paid for her work, said the design had originated as an assignment for a graphics class she was taking while at Bennington College in Vermont. The assignment called for the design of a memorial. Ms. Garofalo discussed the project with her parents and older sister, who suggested she design a monument to the sand miners who worked in her hometown. 
 ''It would be a dream to have something I worked on actually be built,'' Ms. Garofalo said. 
 Her professor liked the idea and her work and suggested Ms. Garofalo try to have it built. She eventually met Mr. Cimini, and discovered that he was working on a similar plan with local residents. They joined forces and the sand miners monument group was established. 
 The group plans to assemble a pictorial history of the mines, to be displayed near the statue. The statue itself is to be placed in front of what is essentially the only remaining physical evidence of the mines -- a 48-foot long steel gate that was an entrance for Colonial Sand and Stone, one of the largest companies, and, behind it, a tunnel that housed a conveyor belt used in later years to transport the sand. 
 The first laborers dug the sand out by hand and pushed wheelbarrow loads up planks and onto schooners and scows in the Long Island Sound for delivery to Manhattan. Later, the sand was dug by machinery, and moved by rail cars and conveyor belts to the processing area.
 ''It was very difficult and dangerous, I've had quite a few escapes from cave-ins,'' said Mr. Murro, who was a miner and a switchman. ''There were so many bad accidents, but I was just one of the lucky ones.''
 In later years, local sentiment grew against the mines, when some argued that the environmental toll on the land was too great.
 George Williams, chairman of North Hempstead's Landmark Preservation Commission, said the mines were also the backdrop for early movies, including ''The Perils of Pauline'' (1914) and ''The Rose of the World'' (1918). But it is their history as part of the Island's industrial past that endures. 
 Elly Shodell, oral history director of the Port Washington Public Library, wrote for the library ''Particles of the Past: Sandmining on Long Island, 1870's-1980's,'' an oral history of the mines. The book includes an interview with Sabatino D'Amico of Port Washington, who is now 85, and who worked in the mines as a mechanic and foreman.
 ''It was good work, but hard work,'' Mr. D'Amico said in a recent interview. ''We did it with passion because we knew were helping to build New York.''

HEADLINE: Data May Add To Dollar's Doldrums

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
THE report last Wednesday that the monthly trade deficit reached $60.3 billion in November surprised forecasters and sent the dollar reeling against other major currencies.
 The dollar rebounded at the end of the week, but new data due on Tuesday -- for flows of foreign funds into American stocks and bonds for November -- could undermine it again.
 The dollar has weakened in the face of a rising trade deficit because money from abroad must flow into the United States to cover that gap, as well as to cover the broader current account deficit, which also includes services. If that flow slows, the dollar may face more downward pressure. 
 The most recent data on fund inflows, for October, showed that foreigners bought a net $48.1 billion of stocks and bonds. For the 12 months through October, the net inflow was $853.5 billion, far more than the current account deficit, which is expected to top $600 billion in 2004. 
 Despite that margin, a slowdown in foreign investment in November is likely to disturb currency traders because they will extrapolate any slowdown into the future. And the $48.1 billion for October was already the smallest monthly net inflow since October 2003 and well below the $67.9 billion monthly average since then. 
 The problem is bigger than it appears because the numbers published by the Treasury Department in its monthly news release overstate current net inflows. On its Web site, the Treasury advises that these published numbers should be adjusted for stock swaps in mergers between American and foreign companies and for principal payments made on asset-backed securities.
 When those adjustments are made, the net inflow for October slips 7.2 percent, to $44.6 billion, and the net inflow over the 12 months through October drops 6.6 percent, to $796.9 billion.

POP QUIZ -- When was the last time the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index set their highs for a year on a day when both gauges fell?
 The answer is 1977, when both the Dow and the S.&P. 500 fell on the first trading day, Jan. 3, and never regained their footing. By the end of the year, the Dow was down 17.3 percent and the S.&P. 500 was off 11.5 percent.
 The Nasdaq composite index was still relatively new that year, having started in 1971. And it bucked the trend, rising 7.3 percent for 1977. It managed to post its high on Dec. 30, the last trading day.
 All three market gauges declined on the first trading day this year and have yet to recover, so a replay of 1977 is possible. But even a two-week decline in the S.&P. to start the year is not necessarily a bad sign. 
 On 24 other occasions since 1945, the S.&P. 500 has opened a year with a decline over the first 10 trading days. But the index was down for the year only 11 of those times.

DATA WATCH -- The Consumer Price Index for December is due on Wednesday, with forecasters predicting no increase, according to the consensus forecast compiled by Bloomberg News. That would mean that inflation for 2004 was 3.6 percent, the highest since 1990, when the index jumped 6.1 percent.
 Other data this week will include housing starts for December, expected to show a jump of 7.8 percent, and leading indicators for December, expected to show a climb of 0.1 percent.

HEADLINE: How Did He Become the Government's Favorite Architect?

BYLINE: By Arthur Lubow. 
Arthur Lubow, a contributing writer, last wrote for the magazine about the new Museum of Modern Art.

 BODY:
Ariving through Los Angeles, pointing out the large public buildings he has designed, Thom Mayne is getting glummer and glummer. On the outskirts of town is the acclaimed Diamond Ranch High School, a succession of angular shapes clad in corrugated metal, marching dynamically up a steep ravine. Down in tough South Central lies the Science Center School, which combines a lofty renovation of a historic armory with a tilted bar of a new building that sinks to the ground and is protected from the street by a planted berm. Not far away, at the corner of First and Main in the heart of downtown, sits the powerful, brooding Caltrans District 7 building, a headquarters of the California transportation department; it is a collaboration with the artist Keith Sonnier, whose embedded fluorescent tubes evoke car taillights caught in a long-exposure photograph. Sharp-edged and off-kilter, wrapped in corrugated or perforated metal, these three high-profile projects were all completed in Mayne's home city in the last few years. So why is the architect looking so unhappy? ''It seems like a moment in time when I am getting architecture out of projects, and I can't be complaining,'' he says unconvincingly. Then he immediately adds, ''If I wasn't actually dissatisfied, I wouldn't be me.'' A little while later, he is still musing: ''It's what it could have been, in your own brain. I don't know why it's so painful. 
Maybe it's something that's not attainable. Maybe I'll know it when I get there.''
 For a long time, Mayne ferociously resisted what he calls the ''con-tamination'' of his profession. He terrorized and alienated clients in his struggle to avoid the compromises that occur when drawings are converted into buildings. At 60, this former bad boy now finds that his firm, Morphosis, is winning some of the most prestigious commissions in the country. Even more surprising, he appears to have become the first-choice architect of the U.S. government, which, under the ''design excellence'' program of the General Services Administration, has retained Morphosis to build a federal office building in San Francisco, a courthouse in Eugene, Ore., and the satellite facility for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration outside of Washington. All three projects are currently under construction. In New York, Morphosis recently won two important competitions: for the Olympic Village in Queens, which is a mixed-use waterfront development that is scheduled to go up whether or not the Olympic Games come to New York in 2012, and the art studio and engineering building of Cooper Union. ''It's really been a kick,'' he says. ''The last two major competitions in New York, I've gotten both of them.'' 
 That an exponent of L.A. edginess should be making it big in Washington and New York is a testament to the maturation of both Mayne and American architecture. The leading Los Angeles architects -- Frank Gehry, Eric Owen Moss and Mayne among them -- are loosely linked by their exploration of unconventional forms and materials, and by their ability to deliver innovative work on a tight budget. In the sprawl of Los Angeles, there is room for progressive architecture. ''There's always been a freedom out here that lets us grow our ideas and get them built,'' Gehry says. ''I don't think he could have done the Caltrans building in an Eastern city. It went up under the radar. It couldn't happen in New York. Every time you go to the bathroom there, people notice.'' Aside from the critical scrutiny, New York is a notoriously expensive, bureaucratically thorny place to build, and for the last half-century, its skyline has been shaped mainly by developers, not designers. But today, provocative design sells. As for Mayne, he is no longer waging hand-to-hand combat with his clients or his demons. One time -- ''When he was a really rebellious and angry young man,'' says his wife, Blythe Alison-Mayne -- he grabbed a client by the collar and lifted him off his feet. ''I was intoxicated with the idea of autonomy as a young man, and saw architecture as being something against the status quo,'' Mayne says. ''In the first 25 years, I didn't have a client who would talk to me afterward. They said, 'Arrogant bastard.' Because I just had to plow through, and I did, to get it done.''
 Michael Rotondi, who was Mayne's original partner in Morphosis, recalls showing up with him at an early residential project and seeing that the wobbly-looking concrete work that they had asked the contractor to correct was still in place. ''Get in the car, Mike,'' Mayne said. They returned with a rented jackhammer, and, in front of the aghast workmen, Mayne blasted out the offending blocks; the partners later made their own forms and poured the concrete themselves. ''In those days, Thom was very impatient,'' Rotondi says. It was the mid-70's. Mayne, an adamant leftist, so disapproved of bourgeois clients that he purposely made a table out of sharp metal (under a deceptively safe-looking glass top) to grab and cut neckties. ''It ended up slicing our shirts, because no clients with ties would sit down at it,'' Rotondi says.
 Although, as in that instance, the anger often proved self-defeating, the romantic idea of conflict animated Mayne's work. The confrontational style that he affected personally he also adopted formally. A typical Morphosis project sets two or more systems in opposition. The collision is most obvious in the restaurant renovations that he completed in the mid-80's on the west side of Los Angeles: 72 Market Street, Kate Mantilini and Angeli. The ascendant architectural style at the time was postmodernism, in which a smorgasbord of historical elements -- a mansard roof, a Palladian doorway, a Tuscan color palette -- would be assembled in a pastiche that was profoundly ahistorical. Mayne was the antihomogenizer: he made sure that everyone noticed that a renovation was a violent intrusion on an existing structure. When he was designing a free-standing building on an empty lot, Mayne used his imagination and imported the conflict. For his first large-scale residence, the Crawford House in Montecito, he made rhythmic markings on the site -- inspired by the Nazca lines in the Peruvian desert -- at 16-foot intervals, and represented them in the building with seven redwood-clad vertical ''totems'' that he topped with north-facing skylights. This repetitive system collides with another line -- the arc of a concrete wall, which, although incomplete and interrupted, constitutes fragments of a large circle. Passionate about his geometry, Mayne recalls a conversation in which the client, on the verge of signing a large check, questioned the necessity of a concrete pillar that had no function other than continuing the 16-foot repetitive sequence. ''It's essential,'' Mayne told him. ''If that's gone, the house is gone. It's about the primitive marking of the site.'' The architect and client sparred throughout the design process of the Crawford House. ''It's an engagement that comes from two different ways of looking at the project,'' Mayne reflects. ''It's a house for them, and a personal expression of where they have arrived in the world. For me, it was my first large free-standing building and an opportunity to do certain things conceptually. I'm not that interested in the domestic environment, only as it intersects a broader conceptual idea.'' Richard Blades, another residential client of the early 90's nearby in Santa Barbara, says he had to insist that his house be widened by two feet. ''The original house was too narrow to put furniture in,'' Blades says. ''There wasn't enough room for a closet. Thom thought you don't need a closet larger than a shoebox. He slammed his hand down and said, 'How many clothes do you have anyway?' ''
Flash-forward to March 1999. Mayne had just won a juried competition to build a federal courthouse in Eugene, Ore. Ed Feiner, the chief architect for the GSA, which administered the ''design excellence'' program, was thrilled. Judge Michael Hogan, the politically conservative, devoutly Christian jurist who represented the district court, was appalled. ''You read something like 'the bad boy of L.A. architecture,' and then you look at some of the buildings, and you don't see anything that looks like a courthouse,'' Hogan says. ''To a federal judge, a court should probably look like the Supreme Court.'' At Feiner's urging, Hogan got in touch with Mayne. In the course of two red-wine-fueled weekends in the Oregon woods and a privately financed European research trip to see courthouses by Richard Rogers in Bordeaux and Jean Nouvel in Nantes, the judge and the architect, with their key staff members, enlightened each other about modern architecture and American jurisprudence. After 27 versions, the three courtrooms that dictate the unconventional form of the courthouse wound up as teardrop shapes, thereby eliminating the space that goes unused on each side of the judge's bench in the traditional rectangular format. The jury box is pushed off to the outside of the teardrop, indicating that the jurors are spectators, not actors, in the unfolding drama. ''If you sit in this jury box, you understand completely what your job is,'' Hogan says. The courtrooms admit light on three sides, satisfying Hogan's wish to have ''an architecture of openness.'' A convert to the cause of modern architecture, Hogan says, ''The building, I'm convinced, will be a destination for the Northwest.''
 For Mayne, who remains politically committed, the opportunity to rethink the configuration of a courtroom was gratifying. Typically, on a government project, the specifications for each component are dictated inflexibly. Exciting as the Diamond Ranch High School is in its form, the classrooms inside are standard issue. ''I didn't get to touch the rooms, so I didn't touch education,'' he says. ''It's very hard for me to accept how far down the food chain architects are. I thought through architecture I would be able to deal with first principles. It was very aggravating to be put in the position of decorating.'' 
 In his early work with Morphosis, Mayne excelled at details, like the heating elements concealed in the load-bearing beams of the Crawford House or the intertwined hot and cold spigots in the bathroom of the Blades House. ''A lot of the early work was a collection of micro-events,'' he says. ''It operated at the level of door handle. It was corporeal, always connected to touch.'' Working now with big projects on tight budgets, he has funneled his love of materials and construction into innovative engineering and land reshaping. At Diamond Ranch, where the steep site was almost unbuildable, he devoted $11 million of the total $29 million budget to contouring the landscape. Among the achievements is a playing field at the rooftop level of the school, with amphitheater seating in the bowl-shaped, scooped-out hillside above it. By comparison, the Nazca scrapings at the Crawford House were child's play.
 In San Francisco, the Morphosis federal office building now under construction is an unusually narrow skyscraper. The small floor plate, which is common in Europe but unorthodox here, provides a higher proportion of offices with light and views. Even more radically, it allows the building to dispense with air-conditioning in favor of a natural ventilation system, which uses a computerized, weather-sensitive program to open and close windows, and circulates air between the floors and between the building's perforated-steel outer skin and glass inner skin. (Only in a temperate climate like San Francisco's would this particular scheme be thinkable. Even there, because of security concerns, the bottom five floors need to be sealed, and therefore air-conditioned.) ''We've got 14 hours maximum out of the year when it may be a little warm,'' Mayne says. ''I worry about it. But if we're not willing to take these risks, we're finished as a culture. What we're gaining is double the energy efficiency.'' The engineering requirements for energy conservation in turn affected the social protocol: because the perimeter spaces cannot be enclosed, the executive offices are located in the core, and the windowed areas are reserved for communal lounges and support-staff workstations. Another space-saving measure -- skip-stop elevators, which open only on every third floor, encouraging occupants to use the grand staircases and landings -- could also have social consequences once the building opens.
 The pressure of satisfying a prescriptive program within a restrictive budget has liberated Mayne from the preciousness that tinged some of his earlier work. Instead of inventing systems of conceptual complexity and forcing the program to conform to it, he now is dealing with sites and programs that impose their own complexity. In an ambitious recreation and housing center that is scheduled to open in mid-2005 at the University of Cincinnati, Mayne and his team dealt once again with a site in a ravine. Unlike Diamond Ranch High School, however, the Cincinnati project is jostled by other new construction. ''It is jammed between the stadium, the student-union building, the student services building, as well as the old basketball arena and the old track,'' says Jay Chatterjee, a professor of architecture and planning at the university. ''He had to create a very substantial building, over 350,000 square feet, for all the athletic facilities and a student dorm. It has three or four major circulation paths it has to connect with. It has entrances and exits on different levels.'' Of all of Morphosis's current projects, Mayne seems to be most enthralled by this one. ''I love it because it's all made out of connective tissue,'' he says. For his guiding metaphor, he has evolved from opposition to connection.
''I lived in a state of rage from 12 to 20,'' Mayne says. ''Until college, I was beyond an outsider. I was a voyeur of life.'' Irrepressibly voluble and, notwithstanding a close-cut salt-and-pepper beard, engagingly boyish, Mayne wears his years of psychoanalysis on his sleeve. He was 10 when his parents divorced, and in the court proceedings, he was asked to choose between them. This painful episode may help explain his aesthetic fascination with conflict. He grew up in Los Angeles with his struggling single mother, who dressed him in a hat, tie and herringbone suit. ''We had a tablecloth on a mahogany table even when we had no money,'' he says. This early feigned gentility may underlie his distaste for fake veneers and his desire to expose underlying structures and concepts.
 Perhaps. On the other hand, Mayne came of age in the 60's, when hatred of authority and yearning for authenticity were to be expected. After graduating with an architecture degree from the University of Southern California in 1968, he went to work as an urban planner. Four years later, with five other architects, he formed a new school, the Southern California Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc), which aimed to bring to Los Angeles the critical attitude toward the profession that was being practiced at Cooper Union in New York and the Architectural Association in London. More than three decades later, SCI-Arc is still going strong (although Mayne himself now teaches at U.C.L.A.). 
 Around the time of the founding of SCI-Arc, Mayne began an architectural firm in the beachside community of Venice with two school friends who were also teachers. ''It was not really a practice as much as it was a garage band,'' says Rotondi. ''We would invent stuff if we didn't have things to do. That's what the teaching basically was, to get the ideas out of our head. Otherwise, they would be like ingrown toenails.'' Rather than hang out a shingle composed of the names of the principals, the anticorporate firm titled itself Morphosis, after the Greek word for ''take shape.'' Their clients were friends of friends, or parents of students. ''We mowed lawns to stay alive,'' Rotondi says. When Mayne decided to take a year to earn a master's degree at Harvard, there was no project-related impediment to his doing so. Rotondi recalls that upon Mayne's return in 1978, they went to see the house that Frank Gehry had just completed for himself in Santa Monica. With this residence, built out of fragments composed of corrugated siding and chain-link fencing, Gehry rethought conventional ideas of domesticity and integrity. ''We just stood and stared at it,'' Rotondi recalls. ''The fact that Frank was being attacked gave us a sense that he was doing something right.'' If there is a Southern California style of contemporary architecture, it is based on an infatuation with the materials and processes of construction, a fragmentation of wholes and a pragmatism about costs. These qualities have always characterized Mayne's work. ''Thom knows how to build,'' says the architect Enrique Norten, who is currently working on a branch of the Brooklyn Public Library. ''From the very beginning, he thinks about the materiality of the building -- the processes and the construction -- and that knowledge goes into the design.''
 Over the years, Morphosis grew, with commercial projects in Los Angeles and Japan. As in most architectural practices, however, the recession of the early 90's proved crippling. As it happened, Rotondi and Mayne parted ways just before the economy crashed. ''We had 25 or 30 people,'' says Blythe Alison-Mayne, an M.B.A. who worked in the fashion industry before coming over to run the Morphosis business. ''We went down to six or seven. It was a disaster.'' Thom (who also changed his legal, though not his professional, name to Alison-Mayne when he and Blythe married in 1981), adds, ''I was 50, 52, and I was worth minus half a million dollars.'' Once business picked up, first with towers in Seoul and Austria, then with the big federal and California projects, the firm grew rapidly back to its former size. That posed other difficulties. ''It's hard to find people with experience who haven't been corrupted by the commercial world,'' says Kim Groves, who has been at Morphosis since 1987.
 The open-plan Morphosis office in Santa Monica has a collegial feel, with Mayne stepping back to allow the other architects space to develop their own ideas. Nonetheless, in this generically named firm, Mayne is the only principal. ''It doesn't take long to find contradictions,'' he says. ''I'm aware of this, and I do some kind of dance. I balance my own intuitive abilities and my interest in a collective process.'' 
 Certain formal elements recur in Mayne's buildings. Beginning with the Sun Tower in Seoul of 1997, he has liked to fold perforated metal skins like origami; in the San Francisco federal building, for example, the skin fans out at the plaza level to form the roof of a day-care facility. His buildings often have ''double skins'' -- originally a formal exercise started with the Sun Tower but now used mainly to save energy. Skip-stop elevators (a space-saving innovation pioneered by a progressive Moscow architect in the 1920's) first appeared in the graduate housing he built at the University of Toronto (completed in 2000) and then at the San Francisco federal building. It is part of his scheme for the Cooper Union building, along with a grand central staircase, also an element shared by many of his public projects. The bands of windows that will open manually in the metal exterior of Cooper Union are cousins to those at Caltrans and the San Francisco federal building. The billboard-size signage in Toronto would later appear at Caltrans and will recur in Eugene.
 For the 61-acre Hunters Point riverfront project in Queens, where the Olympics will be held if the Games come to New York in 2012, Morphosis has developed an urban plan that will preserve three-quarters of the land as parks. Although the northern end of the tract will feature residential towers, the bulk of the housing will be contained in undulating, ribbonlike low-rise buildings, tilted at a 14-degree angle toward the water. ''It's an interpretation of the river and its lyrical, more natural state,'' Mayne says. ''And the housing provided a demarcation -- and also a windbreak and a shading -- for the parks.'' Mayne has long been interested in ribbon housing as an alternative to high-rises. His competition entry for the Spreebogen development in Berlin in 1993 and a magazine-solicited proposal for the World Trade Center site in 2002 both relied on it. Furthermore, his use of ribbonlike buildings in Queens to evoke the ''edge condition'' of the river harks back to the way in which his curved walls marked the boundaries of the Blades and Crawford houses. 
 With age, even the most iconoclastic architect develops an iconography. Although progressive architects, including Mayne, usually try not to repeat themselves formally, the real test is whether they allow their idiosyncratic vocabulary to dictate hackneyed, predictable results. Mayne has avoided this trap. For much of his career, he has had to slip his conceptual concerns below his clients' surveillance monitors. ''Huge amounts of time I'd be sitting at a table, and my image of myself was as a complete covert operator,'' he says. With the popularity of advanced architecture and his own success, he has come aboveground. He will, however, probably always enjoy the process more than the product. A Morphosis building is a visible celebration of the energies that went into its construction. Completed, it can only evoke, never equal, the beauty of its becoming.

HEADLINE: A Founder of SoHo Has Another Vision for Miami

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
TONY GOLDMAN is often described as one of the pioneers who created SoHo with a series of projects that in the 1970's helped turn the down-at-the-heels manufacturing district into an artists' mecca. Ten years later, he began buying properties in the Art Deco district of Miami Beach; he opened the Park Central hotel there in 1987. He is still buying, selling and renovating properties in both locations. 
 ''I always buy chai," said Mr. Goldman, using the Hebrew word for life, which also represents the number 18. So when he invests in a neighborhood, Mr. Goldman explained, he tries to purchase at least 18 properties, enough to give him clout -- and the chance to make a lot of money if prices increase. 
 In the last 12 months, Mr. Goldman has ''bought chai'' in a new location -- a Miami neighborhood called Wynwood, which doesn't even appear on many maps. Virtually all of Mr. Goldman's Wynwood properties, which he acquired with his son, Joey, 32, are warehouse buildings occupied by shoe wholesalers. At night, the neighborhood is eerie: roll-down gates cover the buildings' facades, and there isn't one car on the streets.
 But Mr. Goldman, 61, believes Wynwood will become the city's next arts district -- ''a kind of Williamsburg,'' he said, ''but with a Latin/Caribbean flavor.'' Its neighbor to the north is the Miami Design District, the enclave promoted by Craig Robins, who worked with Mr. Goldman in South Beach in the 1980's. Its neighbor to the south is the so-called performing arts district, in which a concert hall and opera house designed by the architect Cesar Pelli are nearing completion.
 Miami, it seems, has district fever.
 ''The big story is that the people who made South Beach happen have now crossed the bridge,'' Mr. Robins said. ''The fact that Tony is one of those people is an extremely positive sign.''
 But the performing arts district has benefited from a vast infusion of public money. And the design district already had dozens of furniture and lighting showrooms when Mr. Robins got there in the early 1990's. Wynwood has no such advantage, though it may soon be bordered by Midtown Miami, a 56-acre development expected to replace old rail yards with some 3,000 condominium units, 900 rental apartments and hundreds of thousands of square feet of shops.
 Mr. Goldman is not the only big player in Wynwood. A partnership led by David Lombardi owns a number of warehouse buildings and is developing 36 loft units (of which 33 are already sold, Mr. Lombardi said). In other cases, artists have turned some of the warehouse buildings into studios and galleries. But the biggest attention-getters in Wynwood are private museums. Donald and Mera Rubell opened theirs in 1996, and they are planning to move into an adjacent house later this year. Martin Z. Margulies, a developer of oceanfront condominium buildings, just added 10,000 square feet to his own museum, the Margulies Collection, which focuses on photography and conceptual art.
 Last weekend, Mr. Goldman and his wife, Janet, unveiled their museum, the Goldman Warehouse. But unlike Mr. Margulies and the Rubells, who favor challenging works, the Goldmans prefer huge, happy canvases with thick acrylic paint applied in swirls. They seem sure that the works, by such artists as Jules Olitski, who is in his 80's, will someday be recognized as great. It is similar to the approach they take in real estate: go their own way, and see who catches up.
 Mr. Goldman and his son said they envision the streets of Wynwood filled with artists sipping lattes. But they also know that things don't always happen as planned. 
 Between his success in SoHo and South Beach and his foray in Wynwood, Mr. Goldman made a detour to Philadelphia. There, he announced, he would revitalize a corridor southeast of City Hall, which he dubbed ''Blocks Below Broad.'' As usual, he ''bought chai,'' but after Sept. 11, 2001, he said, the office building market in Philadelphia softened. So Mr. Goldman sold some buildings and shifted his focus to residential development; he expects to build a pair of loft buildings by the hot New York architecture firm SHoP/Sharples Holden Pasquarelli. But the buildings will have small floor plates, he said, because he doesn't want to overwhelm the neighborhood. ''I always think,'' he said, ''from the street up.''
 The street, Mr. Goldman said, must be a place where things develop unexpectedly. ''Artists go to places that have an urban edge -- they don't go to tidy suburban neighborhoods,'' he said.
 Indeed, those artists already in Wynwood have expressed fear that they will be priced out of the neighborhood. But Joey Goldman, who has been working for his father since he was 18, said that isn't going to happen. ''It's going to remain an accessible and largely low-rise neighborhood,'' he said. There is a 120-foot height limit in the district, he said, ''and we are not looking to change that.'' He said he envisions widening sidewalks, to make room for cafes, and building a parking garage, so that streets can be for people, not for cars. ''We already have the site for the garage,'' he said.
 Tony Goldman has turned Goldman Properties (with offices in New York, Philadelphia and Miami Beach) into a family business. His daughter, Jessica Goldman-Srebnick, focuses on the company's Miami Beach hotels, including The Hotel, which was designed by Todd Oldham in 1998. The Goldmans recently opened a new bar on the building's roof. 
 ''We're always looking to improve our properties,'' said Mr. Goldman, standing at the bar with Mr. Oldham during a party last month. (Janet Goldman owns a New York jewelry business called Fragments.)
 One of the most successful parts of The Hotel is the French-Brazilian restaurant Wish. In Philadelphia, one of Mr. Goldman's buildings is home to the nouvelle Mexican restaurant El Vez. And his revival of SoHo began, in large part, with the late, great Greene Street Cafe.
 ''If you feed the people, the people will feed the neighborhood,'' Mr. Goldman explained.
 There will, he promised, soon be a restaurant in Wynwood. Maybe he should call it ''Chai.''

HEADLINE: Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?

BYLINE: By Paul O'Neill. 
Paul O'Neill was secretary of the Treasury from January 2001 to December 2002.

DATELINE: Pittsburgh 

 BODY:
THIS is what we should do about Social Security: At the same time we acknowledge that it is the most successful domestic program in American history, we should also admit that Social Security, in its present form, is unsustainable. And then we should come up with a plan that is different than what President Bush and most of the pundits are proposing.
 We should ask ourselves what would be a worthy aspiration for the financial security of retired Americans in the years ahead. My answer is that we should establish a process that will produce a substantial annuity for every American at retirement age. 
 By substantial, I mean at least $1 million. In order to create a real, fully financed annuity of this size, people must begin saving when they enter the work force. The saving needs to be continuous, and it needs to be left intact so that compound interest can work its magic.
 We can do this. We already have a process in place that requires that we give the government 12.4 percent of our income in the name of Social Security.
 The problem with the current arrangement is that our contributions are a tax, not savings. So we should begin by agreeing that we are going to require all Americans to save, individually, to provide for their financial security in old age. After all, if we don't save on our own for our retirement needs, who will do it for us? Our neighbors? Our children? In a civilized society we have a responsibility to take care of our own needs so as not to be a burden on others.
 Yet we can also recognize that some people may work hard during their lifetimes, and save 12.4 percent of their income annually, and still not produce enough for a $1 million annuity when they retire. The federal government could then make annual, supplemental deposits to their accounts from its general revenues to make up the difference. Those of us who are more fortunate can help those who are not. (It is useful to remind ourselves that the federal government is ''we the people'' -- and the federal government doesn't have any money unless it takes it from ''us the people.'')
 Let me define what I mean by financial security. Financial security begins with ownership of real assets; so the money saved each year in this plan would be the property of the person who saved it. I would use the existing Social Security collection process because it is already in place, everyone understands it and its costs are relatively low.
 The money would then be invested in broad-based index funds with an objective of matching the overall rate of return for all investments in the United States. These funds typically have very low costs because they're not actively managed. That means there would be no windfall profit for stockbrokers in this system.
 Further to the definition of financial security: it means enough money in retirement for all needs -- food, clothing, shelter -- and including medical needs like prescription drugs. 
 If we could work toward this idea, we could reduce our current dependence on the political process for these necessities. When Congress passed and the president signed legislation last year expanding drug coverage in the Medicare program, many politicians acted as though they were granting us some great beneficence. But they don't have any money (or the benefits they pay for) to bestow unless they first take it away from us in taxes.
 As I write this I can imagine the chorus of pundits saying, ''This isn't politically possible.'' Why not? Because it is too complicated for people to understand? Or because the only way to approach change in our society is through small incremental steps, like the president's tepid notion of a limited, voluntary diversion of Social Security taxes into small private accounts?
 Baloney, I say. What stands between a truly worthy aspiration for our society and its realization is political leadership with the courage to dream big.
 The social policy technocrats will have a more legitimate concern: how do we get from where we are to this new and better condition? While I was secretary of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, and I worked on an idea to jump-start the changeover by borrowing enough money to put money into individual accounts now, beginning with the youngest workers. We did some very rough calculations that showed for $1 trillion, we could transfer the population from age 18 to the mid-30's into this new arrangement.
 The value of doing this is twofold. First, it hastens the transition to the new program for society overall. Second, the $1 trillion of borrowing now (to be paid from general revenues over the next 20 years) makes a substantial dent in the unfinanced liability of the current program.
 As to the current program, everyone above the age of 35 could keep their current relationship with Social Security and their benefits intact. Their children, though, would have a better life. And that, after all, is the promise on which this nation has been built.
 So there it is. Do we have political leaders who are interested in surpassing Franklin Roosevelt's achievement of 70 years ago?

HEADLINE: The Book of Jobs

BYLINE: By Virginia Postrel. 
Virginia Postrel is the author of ''The Substance of Style'' and ''The Future and Its Enemies,'' and contributes ''Economic Scene'' columns to The Times.

 BODY:
Thirty-five years ago, an Episcopal minister self-published 100 copies of a slim job-hunting guide and gave them away at a conference for college chaplains, many of whom were facing layoffs. Soon he was getting requests for more and more copies. Two years later, the little book had a commercial publisher, the small Ten Speed Press in Berkeley, Calif. ''What Color Is Your Parachute?'' has since become a classic, the ''job hunter's bible,'' and sold more than 8 million copies. The 2005 edition, with a large grinning photo of its author, Richard N. Bolles, on the cover, was published in November. A lot has changed since the early 1970's, but not as much as we sometimes like to think. Job losses and career angst didn't start with the bursting of the tech bubble or the midlife crises of the baby boomers. Even way back when, white-collar workers, some of them highly trained technical experts, lost their jobs for reasons beyond their control. The first commercial edition of ''Parachute'' singled out aerospace engineers, whose profession was ''being phased out of our society.'' 
 The book takes its title from the idea that sooner or later each of us is going to have to bail out of our current job, usually involuntarily, with only our enduring talents to support us: ''The time to figure out where your parachute is, what color it is, and to strap it on, is now -- and not when the vocational airplane that you are presently in is on fire and diving toward the ground,'' Bolles wrote in the 1973 edition.
 ''Parachute'' arrived on the scene when business practices and employee ideals and attitudes were beginning to shift. The postwar ''loyalty ethic,'' in which workers got security in exchange for obedience, was dying. More Americans were starting to look for personal fulfillment in their work, which made them increasingly likely to change jobs, while employers were becoming more ruthlessly pragmatic about layoffs. ''The view that there was loyalty between company and worker back then was also a myth,'' Bolles said in a 1999 interview in Fast Company magazine. ''Even then,'' he said, ''the conditions that produced the workplace realities of today were very much in place.''
 The Organization Man's loyalty ethic would be replaced by what Charles Heck-scher, a scholar of labor studies at Rutgers University, has called the ''professional ethic.'' Instead of lifetime security, professionals look for challenges and expect rewards for performance. The professional ethic gives employees more freedom, flexibility and respect, but it also gives them more responsibility for their destinies.
 ''Parachute'' is a job-hunting guide for believers in the professional ethic. It starts from an understanding that the employment relationship is an exchange, not an entitlement. A successful job applicant is not someone who simply needs a job, but someone who can solve an employer's problems. ''You want the employer to see you as a potential Resource Person for that organization, rather than as simply A Job Beggar,'' Bolles writes in the 2005 edition.
 Instead of telling readers to send out resumes and answer ads, ''Parachute'' advises them how to look for the hidden jobs, the ones employers may not even have created yet, the ones that truly match their talents and desires. Most jobs are never advertised, Bolles reminds us, and resume screeners are usually trying to eliminate candidates. The book encourages informational interviews, which help job hunters learn about occupations and workplaces and provide employers a low-risk way of getting to know potential hires.
 Over the years, ''Parachute'' has grown like a ramshackle house, adding resources, fine points, numbered lists of tips, personality tests and advice for job-hunting on the Internet. The essential argument is clearest in the original edition, which sums up the job-hunting plan in three marching orders: ''You must decide just exactly what you want to do,'' ''You must decide just exactly where you want to do it, through your own research and personal survey'' and, the key through all editions, ''You must research the organizations that interest you at great length, and then approach the one individual in each organization who has the power to hire you for the job that you have decided you want to do.'' 
 All this hard work, and the many written exercises that accompany the research, understandably turn off some readers. '' 'Parachute' convinced me that getting a decent job was such a fearsomely difficult task that only the extremely lucky or the extremely clever or the well-connected could get one,'' said one librarian who read the book as a teenager in 1987. ''If jobs were plentiful and easy to come by, one wouldn't have to go through all the incomprehensible rigmarole the book had one go through.''
 Bolles repeatedly declares that job-hunting is hard work -- ''the most difficult task any of us faces in life,'' as he wrote on the first page of the original. But this is actually a positive message. You aren't having a hard time finding a job because there's something wrong with you. You're having a hard time finding a job because finding a job is hard. The book assumes that everyone has valuable skills. The trick is to know yourself, to know the market and to put in enough legwork to find the right match.
 More recent editions of the book have emphasized the ''life-changing job hunt,'' a search not only for financial support but also for happiness and meaning. Job-hunting, Bolles writes, ''gives us a chance to ponder and reflect, to extend our mental horizons, to go deeper into the subsoil of our soul. It gives us a chance to wrestle with the question, 'Why am I here on Earth?' ''
 The book's peculiar power comes from its unusual combination of market realism, psychological insight and spiritual idealism. ''Parachute'' is suffused with the Protestant idea of the calling, but it is not Max Weber's grim, ascetic version. Instead, Bolles offers the grace-filled version of labor I recognize from my Presbyterian childhood, which was when I first heard of the book. Bolles believes God has given each of us special skills and talents and the responsibility to discover and use them. When we find our mission in life, he preaches, we will enjoy our work.
 The flip side of the professional ethic is that employees have no obligation to stick with jobs or organizations that don't make them happy. While we can't expect our employers to give us praise or loyalty, we can look for work that lets us learn and that offers intrinsic satisfaction. ''Parachute'' has always appealed to unhappy workers as well as unemployed ones. When my family's South Carolina church offered a job-hunting seminar in the 70's using an early edition of the book, the organizers assumed most participants would be laid-off textile managers. Instead, most had jobs; they just didn't like what they were doing. Under the old work ethic, liking your work wasn't expected. Under the new one that Bolles promotes, enjoyment is essential. In the 1972 edition, Bolles called enjoyment ''divine radar'' guiding you toward the job you should be doing. The 2005 edition includes a chapter to help readers identify the skills they most enjoy using and match them to the environments in which they might find the greatest satisfaction. Its title, ''When You Lose All Track of Time,'' suggests a purely secular reading of the book's search for meaningful work.
 The point of a life-changing job hunt is to find work that makes you happy. This idea makes the book not only practical, but intellectually contrarian. Weber claimed that Protestantism divested work of its earthly delight, making it purely a religious duty, while capitalism destroyed that delight forever.
 ''What Color Is Your Parachute?'' is an extended market-grounded argument that Weber was wrong. A century after ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism'' was published, the best-selling book about job hunting is an explicitly Protestant guide to finding joy at work.

HEADLINE: RV's Find a New Fan Base: The Baby Boomers

BYLINE: By ALINA TUGEND

 BODY:
RECREATIONAL vehicles, once considered the domain of older couples hitting the road in retirement, are attracting new interest among baby boomers.
 For as little as $5,000 or more than $1 million, people are buying RV's at a pace not seen in 25 years, according to the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association. The typical RV owner is 49, is married and has an annual household income of $56,000, according to a 2001 University of Michigan study commissioned by the association. 
 ''There's a huge influx of baby boomers who decided this is O.K.,'' said Chuck Woodbury, editor of RVtravel.com, a Web site and online bookstore devoted to RV's.
 In 1978, some 330,000 were sold, according to Statistical Surveys Inc., which does market research for the RV, marine and manufactured housing industries. But the oil crisis would soon cause sales to plummet, given the vehicles' thirst for gasoline; sales fell to a low of 113,000 in 1981. Later in the 1980's, the market would climb steadily, helped by falling interest rates and gasoline prices. The Persian Gulf war caused a sales decline in 1991, as consumers worried anew about fuel costs, but sales rebounded later in that decade. And concerns about air travel after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, encouraged even more people to check out RV's. In 2003, some 289,000 were sold. 
 ''It's been golden since 1991,'' said Tom Walworth, president of Statistical Surveys. ''There's been lower fuel prices, low interest rates -- it's been the perfect storm for RV's.'' And owners can write off an RV as a second home on their taxes. 
 RV's are available in many sizes, models and prices, but consumers first have to make a basic choice: Do they want a towable RV -- what many people call a camper -- meaning that it is pulled by a vehicle or placed on a truck? Or do they want a motorized, or self-contained, version? 
 A vast majority of RV's, about 70 percent, are towable, and are usually less expensive than the motorized type. 
 The most expensive type of towable is called a fifth-wheel travel trailer; it can cost as much as $100,000. This type has two levels, sleeps up to six and is towed by a pickup truck. The most portable is the truck camper, which is mounted on a pickup bed or chassis. This version can sleep up to six and can run from $4,000 to $26,000.
 Motorized RV's come in three models, called Classes A, B and C; Winnebago Industries has the largest share of this market. 
 The Class A version is the most popular. It looks like a bus in the front, offering a wide view, and is generally the roomiest; it can be longer than 30 feet and sleep up to six. Such RV's may cost from $50,000 to more than $1 million, partly depending on the decor. Among the possible luxuries are granite counter tops, queen-size beds, plasma televisions and home theaters.
 Class B motor homes, also called van campers, look more like family vans. They are cheaper than the Class A models -- and smaller, sleeping up to four. They are generally priced in the $50,000 range.
 Class C models are generally shorter than those in Class A. But because part of a Class C hangs over the driver's area, there is more sleeping space; it can accommodate up to eight. These RV's often run $48,000 to $140,000.
 A current industry buzzword is ''slideouts'' -- walls that can move out several feet after the RV is parked, to make the living room or bedroom (or even the kitchen, depending on the model) feel more like a small Manhattan apartment than a motor home.
 Mr. Woodbury warns that no matter how inviting an RV looks in the showroom, buyers should be wary about buying one too quickly. ''Take the emotional reaction and put a lid on it,'' he said. ''You see something that looks really good and you want to buy it. But with an RV, you're buying a house that's fully furnished. You need to look at the plumbing, the cupboards -- are they stapled together or more substantial? One RV I leaned up against and my hand almost went through the wall.''
 If you are interested in buying an RV, Mr. Woodbury said, you may want to rent one for a few weekends first.
 ''You might rent a motorized one, and realize that after you pull into the campground, you can't just hop into town,'' he said. ''Maybe you should buy a trailer so you can unhook it and go see a movie.''
 Or you may find that you keep bumping your head in the same place; RV's come in different seating and sleeping configurations, and the only way to figure out what works best is to take it on the road for a few trips. ''It may be too big, it may be too small, maybe you don't like where the bed is,'' Mr. Woodbury said.
 RV rental rates vary, but according to Cruise America, a big rental company, a motor home runs about $90 to $200 a day.
 What if you buy an RV but decide to sell it a few years later? Dealers are quick to note that RV's hold their resale value much better than cars. Banks can offer financing for RV's for up to 20 years, but shoppers may want to consider the effect of such long-term loans on a possible resale later. 
 And consumers do not have to limit their shopping to local dealers; Daniel Castagna, president of Crestwood RV Center in Tuckahoe, N.Y., says that more than half his sales are over the Internet and that buyers receive free plane tickets to pick up their RV's. Today's RV owners don't buy their vehicles only for two-week jaunts to national parks. They use them for weekend camping, ski trips and tailgate parties at football games. Many RV's even have places to store what the dealers call toys -- including dirt bikes, surfboards and gliders.
 And just as RV's have become more like hotel rooms, the campgrounds have become more like hotels. The more luxurious ones, which can cost about $40 a night, have indoor swimming pools and party areas. State and national parks may offer just basic amenities, but they can be great for those who want to get away from it all -- and can cost as little at $5 a night.
 HIGHER fuel prices over the past year have not seemed to have an effect on sales, said David Humphreys, president of the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association. But it is not clear how big an impact a combination of higher gas costs and steeper interest rates may have on sales this year. A motor home gets 8 to 12 miles a gallon, or a little more if it has a diesel engine, Mr. Castagna said.
 Mr. Woodbury, like many other RV aficionados, says an RV offers ''a wonderful way to travel; it's wonderful with kids.'' 
 ''But people have to be careful,'' he added. ''For many people an RV can be the second-most-expensive purchase of their lives, and it's important to make sure it works for you.''

 BODY:

PREP
By Curtis Sittenfeld.
406 pp. Random House. $21.95.
 Seemingly bathed in a golden light of good fortune, the wealthy keep pieds-a- terre, have trust funds that rival the gross national product of tiny African nations and, of course, are educated at the finest, most upper-crust prep schools. All this is known about the species. What isn't as widely known is what actual life is like behind the hushed, ivy-armored walls of America's elite prep schools. Not the repressive, secret-society-driven hothouse captured in ''Dead Poets Society,'' but life in your typical, sunny, everyday New England boarding school.
 Curtis Sittenfeld's debut novel, ''Prep,'' is a four-year, semester-by-semester tour of Ault, a fictional private boarding school in Massachusetts that's populated with boys and girls in khakis and blue blazers whose names alone identify them as spawn of the prosperous. After all, who but the affluent and flamboyantly well bred would dare saddle a child with names such as Tab or Aspeth, which sounds all too much like a lisped pronunciation of ''aspic.''
 John Knowles wrote the seminal American boarding school bildungsroman, ''A Separate Peace'' (1960), which drew heavily on his own experience at Phillips Exeter, and gave rise to an entire class of coming-of-age at sleep-away-school books. But unlike ''A Separate Peace,'' ''Prep'' doesn't heave with poetic angst. Sittenfeld's heroine, Lee Fiora (while certainly classifiable as an alienated adolescent), possesses a Midwesterner's level head and a gimlet eye for all things top-drawer. It is Lee's observations of what it's like to be a scholarship student thrust into a world of privilege that shape the novel. 
 While Lee is obviously bright, her parents are confused as to why she'd want to leave Indiana, and her perfectly acceptable local high school, for an expensive private school on the East Coast. Despite what Lee tells her family, her desire to attend Ault has little to do with the three R's, and everything to do with the prospect of canoodling with a Weejun-wearing laddie.
 ''I'd pretended it was about academics, but it never had been. . . . I imagined that if I left South Bend, I would meet a melancholy, athletic boy who liked to read as much as I did and on overcast Sundays we would take walks together wearing wool sweaters.'' 
 Upon arriving at Ault, Lee finds that life isn't as picturesque as she'd imagined. The reality is she isn't the teacher's pet. She isn't the smartest kid in the class. In fact, she pales in comparison with almost all her fellow students. She isn't the blond alpha girl whom you either want to be or be with; or the charming male sleepover-artist; or the popular, nonthreatening African-American guy; or the shy, high-achieving, suicidal Asian girl. Lee isn't despised or particularly well liked; she is no type. She is just Lee.
 What Lee does excel at is disappearing into the wallpaper, hovering just on the fringes, watching, taking mental notes and sitting in judgment of her peers. Even as Lee's estrangement from her family back home grows, their differences magnified by the miles between them, she resists reaching out to her fellow students. She is determined to protect herself at all costs from any sort of awkwardness, passing up school dances and parties to stay in her dorm eating canned soup and paging through old Ault yearbooks.
 There is never a moment when Lee entertains the notion that she might compete with her fellow students intellectually or financially, especially not those like the New York ''bank boys,'' the sons of Wall Street tycoons. Lee's father, a sweet, albeit obnoxious, man, owns a mattress franchise. That he bristles at Lee's embarrassment about her middle-class origins only deepens their estrangement. Lee quickly learns the old adage: Only no money and new money talk about money.
 ''Money is not discussed,'' she says. ''People have so much, so it's like nobody needs to mention it.'' Still, Lee, like any traveler in a foreign land, quickly learns to recognize the signs that differentiate one class from another.
 ''You can tell by people's rooms -- whether or not they have stereos, or if the girls have flowered bedspreads, or if they have silver picture frames. . . . And things like, you can send your laundry to a service or you do it yourself in the dorm machines. Or even some of the sports, how much the equipment costs. Ice hockey is a really expensive sport, but something like basketball isn't that much.'' 
 It would be very easy to blame the school's not-so-subtle caste system for Lee's problems and unhappiness, but Sittenfeld doesn't. Lee is no saint, and no victim, but rather a willing cog in the machine of exclusion. She declines, for instance, to get involved with a kind and good-looking young man who works in the school kitchen because he's a townie. Gradually, however, Lee comes to acknowledge that it wasn't so much the fantasy of strolling hand in hand with some Camus-quoting lacrosse player that drew her to Ault, but her own desire to do better, to socially trade up.
 In the course of four years Lee slowly becomes more like those she has sat in judgment upon. The uptight freshman who is shocked that girls break the rules by smoking off campus is, by her senior year, stealing into an unoccupied day-student room at night for sex. 
 It is the sex between Lee and her crush, Cross, a boy far more popular than she is, that lifts the book, overlong at more than 400 pages, out of its sophomore slump, and restores its narrative momentum. Sittenfeld captures the teenage hook-up experience in a way that isn't too cringingly young-adult or clinically distant. Lee enjoys the sex and the attention, though she is not naive enough to believe a boy like Cross would ever openly date a girl like her. Yet she is girl enough to hope she is wrong. In the end, however, Lee's passivity, her refusal to pursue anything past the point where it might get embarrassing, limits her as a character. This isn't to say the story doesn't feel true to life. Sittenfeld's dialogue is so convincing that one wonders if she didn't wear a wire under her hockey kilt. 
 Which leads to another question. Most novels are autobiographical in some way, first novels in particular. But even allowing for that, ''Prep,'' both in structure and in narrative, feels like a memoir. Without an author photo of a teenage Sittenfeld posed on the quad of an elite East Coast boarding school, we can't know. And it doesn't really matter. What is of interest, and why ''Prep'' deserves pride of place on any summer recommended reading list, is the incisive and evenhanded way in which Sittenfeld explores issues of class. 
 Read as fiction, Sittenfeld's novel sets up dramatic expectations that aren't met. By the end of the book -- which culminates in graduation, naturally -- we see that life at Ault hasn't changed Lee in any profound way. She is still awkward, perhaps less vigilantly critical, but you wonder if perhaps she would have become this person even if she had spent her high school years in South Bend. As it is, there is no defining moment, no Knowlesian Gene-and-Finny-in-the-tree scene where we feel that life will never be the same again, or some truth about human nature is revealed.
 Postgraduation, we learn which friends Lee still sees, and how the lives of her fellow students have panned out -- the feeling here is not unlike the Hollywood movie trope of running capsule summaries of what's happened to all the characters as the credits roll. In the last pages we see how Lee, having moved beyond Ault, now looks at the world. She has learned a lesson some never do: that the rich can not only be complex and interesting, they can teach a judgmental middle-class girl something about tolerance and grace.

HEADLINE: Rookie's Streak Still Alive, But Barely

BYLINE: By BILL MODOONO

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH, Jan. 15 

 BODY:
The Ben Roethlisberger beef jerky is no less tangy. The ''Big Ben'' T-shirts are no less garishly fashionable. And the ''Roethlisburger'' remains inflation-proof at $7. 
 None of that was likely to change, regardless of what happened Saturday at Heinz Field. What was remarkable was the streak that inspired all that local commerce somehow remained perfect, even if the man behind it looked imperfect. 
 It took a couple of missed field goals and an effective running attack, spearheaded by two Pro Bowl-caliber backs, to bail him out. But Ben Roethlisberger, the Pittsburgh Steelers' rookie quarterback, ran his streak of consecutive victories to 14 games and, in the process, probably grew up a bit, too. With the Steelers' 20-17 overtime victory over the Jets, the feeling in Pittsburgh was that Roethlisberger had to experience a little growth spurt to keep his streak, and his team's championship hopes, alive. 
 ''It wasn't me out there today,'' Roethlisberger said. ''I did everything I could to lose this game.''
 In a season that has been magical for Roethlisberger and his team, the only thing he can do wrong, it seems, is come close to producing a losing effort.
 He bounced a couple of passes to Hines Ward and somehow plunked another off the stomach of Dewayne Robertson, the Jets' 317-pound defensive tackle. Roethlisberger was so ineffective in the first half (4 for 12, 48 yards) that Coach Bill Cowher did not even bother to use his timeouts, even though the Steelers had the potential to get the ball back with time left on the clock.
 Roethlisberger came out of his funk somewhat in the second half, but the mistakes he made had even bigger consequences. One underthrown ball was returned 86 yards by the Jets' Reggie Tongue for a touchdown, and an overthrown pass to Plaxico Burress with 1 minute 58 seconds left in the game was intercepted by David Barrett to set up what could have been the winning score, except that Doug Brien's field-goal attempt hit the crossbar.
 As always, the Steelers had an effective running game. Jerome Bettis (27 carries, 101 yards) and Duce Staley (11 carries, 54 yards) helped Roethlisberger through some rough spots in his first playoff game.
 ''I've got to play better,'' said Roethlisberger, referring to the Steelers' game next Sunday at Heinz Field for the American Football Conference championship. ''We have to step it up. The game we played today is not going to cut it.''
 Roethlisberger was not sharp, but he did demonstrate the poise that has endeared him to his coach.
 ''He does display a calm about him,'' Cowher said. ''He has the ability to move on to the next series.''
 During Pittsburgh's final series, Roethlisberger completed 3 of 4 passes for 30 yards and moved his team into Jets territory. From there, the combination of Staley and Bettis moved the ball into a position to allow Jeff Reed to convert the 33-yard winning field goal.
 Roethlisberger's favorite target, Ward (10 catches for 105 yards and a touchdown), called the game ''a great learning experience'' for his young quarterback, who did not disagree. He also deflected rumors about a sore thumb and rejected the notion that any of his receivers should be blamed for his two interceptions. 
 He did say, however, that he may have made a mistake in not wearing his gloves enough in practices during the week. Unseasonably warm weather during the week made them unnecessary.
 Roethlisberger called the interceptions ''a misread on my part; I made the mistake.''
 The mistake that resulted in Tongue's touchdown came while Roethlisberger was scrambling to avoid a rush. And he badly underthrew Antwaan Randle El to set up Barrett's big return.
 Roethlisberger admitted that he was probably trying to do too much on the play, but he took advantage of a similar opportunity in overtime, and it resulted in a 17-yard completion to Ward. 
 Roethlisberger admitted to approaching his first playoff game as if it were just another game; that approach was good for his nerves, but it produced mixed results.
 ''Maybe next week, he said, ''I need to be a little more stressed.''

HEADLINE: Why Stock Markets Stayed Calm in Southern Asia

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
NATURAL disasters often provoke sharp stock market declines where they occur, usually followed by recoveries that are almost as intense. Ten years ago this week, the Kobe earthquake in Japan sent stocks there tumbling 5 percent before they snapped back. 
 The Sri Lankan market followed a similar path after a tsunami struck on Dec. 26, but it was the exception. Despite the huge devastation, other markets in southern Asia had no big gyrations, and ended the ensuing week flat to higher. 
 The bonds of the affected countries, as well as their currencies -- which can be volatile even in benign circumstances -- suffered few ill effects, either. 
 ''The stock markets in the region have generally not been impacted by the disaster and, in fact, have behaved differently than expected,'' said Mark Mobius, manager of the Templeton Global Emerging Markets fund, in a note to investors. Markets in Indonesia and India ended the trading week after the tsunami more than 1 percent higher, while the Thai and Malaysian markets were little changed. Sri Lanka's market fell sharply immediately after the disaster, then got most of the lost ground back later, ending the week down about 4 percent. In the month ended Friday, stocks rose in all these countries except for India; for American investors, returns were higher in all five countries because their currencies rose against the dollar. 
 Paul Niven, head of strategy at F&C Asset Management, a fund management company in London, pointed out that many Asian stock markets have continued to rally this year. ''Such behavior may seem odd at a time of such unprecedented disaster across numerous countries,'' Mr. Niven said, ''but it does appear that markets are behaving entirely rationally.''
 He and other investment professionals say there was no widespread selling because the tsunami damage, though extending for thousands of miles along the Indian Ocean's rim, had negligible impact on industrial capacity. It may seem perverse when juxtaposed with the immense loss of life, analysts say, but the disaster may even produce economic and commercial benefits as rebuilding begins.
 The tsunami resulted in ''a tragic human loss, but it turns out much of the damage was done in outlying areas where not much of the production is focused,'' said Anthony Chan, an economist at J.P. Morgan Fleming Asset Management in New York. 
 By contrast, said Mr. Chan, who has studied market effects of past natural disasters, ''if something like that would have hit central Tokyo or Beijing, investors would have hit the sell button.''
 But after such events, he said, markets tend to recover as attention shifts to reconstruction and the accelerated economic output that accompanies it. ''Whenever there's a typhoon or other natural disaster, once rebuilding takes place it adds to overall economic growth,'' he said. In the case of the tsunami, he added, ''the huge amount of aid will be a positive contributor to growth.''
 Mr. Chan and others drew a distinction between natural disasters and events that originate with human menace or meddling, and they said investors were doing the same. ''Why no panic? People understand that earthquakes haven't suddenly become more likely,'' said Jerome Booth, research director at Ashmore Investment Management, a London firm specializing in emerging markets. He contrasted the tsunami and its randomness with ''the increase in uncertainty surrounding events of terrorism and disease, like SARS.'' He was referring to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, an infectious disease that had a negative effect on Asian markets last year.
 Ashmore has not cut and run. Mr. Booth says that his Asian equity portfolios are more heavily invested in the southeast area of the region, ''because we see more value there,'' and that he has not changed his outlook as a result of the tsunami.
 ''In terms of types of stocks, we like Thai banks, Thai infrastructure companies and Indonesian materials companies,'' Mr. Booth said, though he declined to name individual stocks, ''and also telecoms in Indonesia and the Philippines, as mobile businesses are doing well on the back of rising domestic demand.'' 
 He said the tourism industry in southern Asia would bear the brunt of the economic impact.
 Daniel Lian, a Morgan Stanley economist who follows Southeast Asian markets from Singapore, predicted a limited effect on growth in the region, even in Indonesia, near the epicenter of the earthquake that set off the waves. But he said the economic implications for Thailand were more severe.
 ''While the six affected Thai provinces account for only 2.7 percent of G.D.P., we believe the damage done to the kingdom's major economic activity, tourism, will have a multiplier effect on the entire economy, as close to a third of Thailand's international tourists visit resort facilities in these provinces,'' Mr. Lian wrote in a note to investors. He said the country might receive only 75 to 80 percent of the number of tourists forecast for this year.
 Fund managers and analysts are also keeping an eye on industries like transportation and insurance. ''Various insurance companies have been hit, for example Thai Reinsurance and Bangkok Insurance,'' said Hugh Young, the Singapore-based head of equities for Aberdeen Asset Management. He added, though, that insurers are thought to have passed ''a substantial chunk'' of their risk to international reinsurance giants, so the impact ''is not catastrophic.''
 Turning to other segments of the market, Mr. Young noted that various companies with tourism businesses had been affected. These include two Sri Lankan companies: Aitken Spence, a tour operator, and John Keells, which has interests in hotels, soft drinks and supermarkets. Mr. Young said the tsunami was ''arguably beneficial for companies involved in reconstruction, for example, Siam Cement.'' Mr. Young said his portfolios held all five of these companies.
 Mr. Mobius, at Templeton, also favors sectors related to rebuilding coastal areas. ''Construction companies and building materials companies will see more business and probably higher prices,'' he said. ''We are already seeing that happen with cement producers in the region.'' He said cement prices were already starting to rise in Indonesia and expected to climb in Thailand.
 Mr. Niven, at F&C, agreed that construction companies were benefiting, and said investors had been buying stocks like Semen Gresik, a cement maker in Indonesia, helping to push that market higher.
 Mr. Mobius and Mr. Young contended that the insurance industry, though suffering somewhat now, might ultimately gain from the tsunami. That is because of ''the possibility of higher premiums and definitely more awareness of the value of insurance itself,'' Mr. Young said. ''Traditionally the countries, businesses and individuals affected would have been underinsured before the disaster,'' he added.
 Any impact on the insurance industry is likely to be confined to Asia, Mr. Niven said. ''U.S. and European insurers have minimal exposure to claims,'' he said, ''and several, such as Generali, have already stated that there will be no impact on earnings.'' Generali is one of Italy's largest companies.
 MR. CHAN, at Morgan, said the tsunami might have positive economic and investment implications outside Asia. Tourism-related industries in the affected countries are bound to suffer, but that may mean more business for the same industries elsewhere.
 ''The airlines that go to those areas will certainly be impacted,'' Mr. Chan said. But he added that ''people are not going to stop traveling.''
 ''They will gravitate to areas that make you feel more comfortable or secure,'' he added. ''If you don't take an airline to go there, you take one to go somewhere else. For the airline industry as a whole, it's a wash.''
 In the long run, he said, the tsunami may help strengthen Asian economies and markets because ''rebuilding takes place with more modern buildings and equipment, so it raises capabilities'' of manufacturers in the affected economies.
 The tsunami is ''a forced way to modernize,'' Mr. Chan said. When local companies build homes, factories and infrastructure, ''there will be a lot of expert advice to guide them,'' he said. 
 ''All of that,'' he added, ''is going to enhance productivity and the productive capacity of the region.''

HEADLINE: One of a Kind

BYLINE: By Bill Cunningham

 BODY:
Nan Long, a fashion model who shows designers' creations for a living and has access to anything she wants to wear, instead enjoys making her own clothes.
 She has been sewing since she was 8, when her mother, a home economics teacher in Orlando, Fla., made clothes for her and her sisters. 
''I was always proud of my homemade clothes; my sisters weren't,'' she said. 
 Observed over a period of two years on Fifth Avenue, where her agency is located, she caught the eye of this photographer with her choice of unusual fabrics, from fake fur to stretch ski cloth, and the perfect matching of mitered stripes. She seems to be fearless, working with almost any fabric. In the latest picture, bottom left, taken last month, she wore a plaid cape lined in velvet with matching plaid pants. Fake fur is used on its own or as a lining for a denim jacket. Her trousers are made with a perfect fit and often topped with smoothly tailored jackets and coats that clearly tell of an accomplished home sewer and tailor.
 Ms. Long's only formal training was as a four-month intern in Geoffrey Beene's workrooms and years of having designers fit their clothes on her body.
 Among others like her, with an entree to designer samples, she is a rarity in choosing to make her own clothes to suit her individual style. And in an age of shop-till-you-drop, she is unusual in taking pleasure in home sewing.
 Below left, Ms. Long was spotted modeling in last fall's collection of Michael Kaye Couture.

HEADLINE: How to Retire Rich

 BODY:
If you are like most people, your sadness over losing, say, $1,000, would be twice as great as your happiness at winning $1,000. That all-too-human tendency to feel the pain of a loss more deeply than the joy of a gain is called ''loss aversion'' and is one of the central discoveries of behavioral economics -- a branch of the dismal science that recognizes that when it comes to money, people are motivated by various impulses that are measurable and even predictable, but seldom rational. 
 Behavioral economics has vital implications for retirement savings. But in his zeal to privatize Social Security -- a quest which is itself driven more by ideology than economics -- President Bush is obscuring better approaches to a comfortable retirement for all Americans. 
 We all know that the benefits from Social Security do not provide enough income for a comfortable old age. But they do provide a guaranteed basic level of financial stability for all old people and, in so doing, enhance the socioeconomic well-being of everyone. And for the large majority of old people for whom Social Security makes up more than half of income, it is the difference between destitution and the ability to live with dignity. Clearly, the reliability of the income stream is critical. Mr. Bush does not want you to believe that such social and financial stability is possible. In a forum last Tuesday aimed at persuading ''younger folks'' to support privatization, he said that Social Security would be ''flat broke'' in the coming decades. That is false. The system's trustees expect that even if nothing whatsoever is done, the current system will be able to pay full benefits until 2042, when it will be able to pay 70 percent of the promised benefits. The independent Congressional Budget Office is even more optimistic. Of course, no one is suggesting that no reforms be made. But modest, straightforward tax increases and benefit cuts, phased in over generations, are all it would take to bolster the current system. 
 As the Social Security safety net is strengthened, it is also essential for government and business to work together to make it easier for everyone in the work force to increase personal savings. Unfortunately, the coming fight over the president's plan for privatization will very likely draw attention away from the simple and uncontroversial changes that would help people prepare on their own for their retirement years, including:

AUTOMATIC ENROLLMENT -- About half of employees work for employers who provide 401(k) retirement savings plans. But only three-quarters of eligible employees participate, and of those, participation is steeply skewed toward high earners.
 The evidence from research is overwhelming that participation increases significantly if employees are automatically enrolled in the 401(k), rather than being required to sign up, as is usually the case. (Employees would be free to opt out if they did not want to participate.) One typical study -- by Brigitte Madrian, an economist at the Wharton School, and Dennis Shea, compensation and benefits specialist at Aetna -- analyzed a Fortune 500 company that switched to automatic enrollment in early 1998. By mid-1999, overall participation increased to 86 percent from 36 percent. The jump was especially striking among low-income workers, with participation rising to 80 percent from 12 percent for people making less than $20,000 and to 83 percent from 24 percent for those making $20,000 to $30,000. Participation also soared among younger workers. Studies show that participation rates stay high once employees are enrolled. 
 Automatic enrollment overcomes procrastination, a natural response to something deemed painful, such as giving up some take-home pay to save for retirement. It also overcomes ''status quo bias,'' which tends to keeps nonparticipants from opting into a plan once they've passed up a chance to do so.

AUTOMATIC ALLOCATION -- The next obstacle for would-be savers is the explosion of choices within 401(k)'s and other retirement plans. A typical plan now lets employees choose among 15 stock, bond and cash accounts. Too much choice leads to paralysis, a response that is especially common among low- and middle-income savers. As a result, employees in the lowest 25 percent of earners generally invest most of their accounts in low-yielding money market or bond funds. An easy solution is to offer employees an option to have their contributions automatically invested in balanced, prudently diversified, low-cost funds.

AUTOMATIC ESCALATION -- Over all, only 5 percent of employees contribute the maximum allowed by their plans. Status quo bias makes it unlikely that an employee will change a contribution later. Loss aversion deters an employee from increasing the percentage even after a raise, because an increased payroll deduction may be perceived as a pay cut. The fix is to enroll employees in a program that automatically increases the percentage of pay whenever they get a raise.
 The Bush administration has put forth two fine ideas for increasing personal savings outside of Social Security, but has not pursued either to the fullest. One would let taxpayers instruct the Treasury to split their tax refunds, which average about $2,000 a year, between a checking account and a savings account. Alas, the administration has not enacted the proposal, even though it requires no new legislation. 
 The other positive initiative was enacted in 2001 and offers a matching tax credit for retirement savings by low- and middle-income taxpayers. Unfortunately, the credit suffers from several design flaws. For instance, only people who earn enough to have a tax liability qualify for the credit. That requirement eliminates 80 percent of the 60 million lowest-income filers. Expanding eligibility to that group would cost the government about $5 billion a year, bringing the total annual cost of the credit to a relatively small $7 billion. 
 For the most part, however, the administration's savings initiatives, such as the retirement savings account, are totally off the mark. Their main feature -- lofty new upper limits on the amount of savings that can be tax-sheltered -- has little or no effect on the vast majority of families and individuals. In 2001, the Government Accountability Office found that raising the contribution limit on 401(k) plans benefited fewer than 3 percent of participants, most of whom were making more than $75,000 a year. 
 Social Security privatization and tax incentives for the affluent have another major drawback that endangers everyone's retirement security. Neither would add to national savings -- the sum of government and individual savings that is a key determinant of the nation's overall standard of living. Privatization would not add to national savings because every dollar that goes into a private account would be offset by the government borrowing needed to establish the private system. Tax incentives for the rich do not add to national savings because they simply induce wealthy people to shift current assets from taxable to tax-free accounts. 
 Put more simply, with privatization and continued high-end tax breaks, the few would get richer as the many fall behind. Preserving Social Security while increasing savings outside Social Security is a better way to achieve a prosperous retirement.

HEADLINE: After the Tsunami, Hoping for the Balm of Tourism 

BYLINE: By LISA KALIS and JAMES BROOKE; Lisa Kalis reported from New York for this article, and James Brooke from Phuket, Thailand.

 BODY:
HOW quickly -- if ever -- can the devastated resorts of Thailand, Sri Lanka and the Maldives return to business as usual? 
 While the humanitarian crisis from the Indian Ocean tsunami is horrific -- with about 150,000 people dead and thousands more still unaccounted for -- the impact on tourism may be somewhat limited. In the main tourist destinations affected, the beach resorts of Thailand and Sri Lanka and the islands of the Maldives, the majority of hotels are ready for business. Of those damaged, many should reopen within months.
 When it comes to tourism, the region has faced bigger challenges. Rakesh Shankar, an economist specializing in Asia with the research group Economy.com, said the tsunami's impact would be far less than the SARS outbreak, which kept tourists away from Asia for two years. ''The question is, Are countries going to have the infrastructure to deal with it,'' he said. He expected that tourism would be mostly back to normal by the summer in Thailand, and within a year in Sri Lanka. However, in the Maldives, he said full recovery could take two or three years. 
 Chua Hak Bin, senior regional economist for DBS Bank in Singapore, also predicted that the long-term impact on tourism would be minimal. ''This is fundamentally different than SARS or the terrorist attacks in Bali,'' he said. He estimated that in Thailand, tourist arrivals to the southern province would drop by about 20 percent in the first six months of 2005 and that the numbers would then return to normal.
 Other natural disasters have also been more costly. Robert Hartwig, chief economist at the Insurance Information Institute, estimated insurance claims of less than $5 billion, mostly from large hotel chains and multinational corporations. Last year, the hurricanes in Florida cost insurers $21.6 billion, 33 percent of which went to hotels and other businesses. 
 Here is a picture of how countries struck by the tsunami are affected. 

Sri Lanka
 ''It is a coastal disaster,'' said John Vasatka, general manager for Amanresorts hotels in Sri Lanka. ''You go one or two kilometers inland and you don't see the effects.'' Based on what he had seen so far, Mr. Vasatka said he thought the damage seemed more limited than Florida's Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which he also witnessed. ''It's a much more localized area. We hope it will be much easier to rebuild.'' 
 For Sri Lanka, the disaster came at a particularly crucial time. In 2002, the country emerged from a 20-year civil war and it seemed to be at a turning point for tourism. (One travel magazine recently named it ''the new Bali.'') Through October, the number of foreign visitors, mostly from Western Europe, had risen 12 percent over same period in 2003, according to Sri Lankan tourism officials.
 ''We were looking forward to a bumper season,'' said Geoffrey Dobbs, a British expatriate who came to Sri Lanka 10 years ago and now owns four tourism properties there. 
 As of early this month, 56 of Sri Lanka's 243 hotels were closed. In a press release, the tourist board estimated that nearly all the major beach hotels would be open by the end of February. The luxury Triton Hotel on the west coast, one of nine properties on Sri Lanka owned by Aitken Spence Hotels, is an exception; it's closed indefinitely while the company assesses the damage. 
 Upscale Amanresorts, based in Singapore, had two new hotels planned on Sri Lanka for 2005. A spokeswoman, Trina Dingler Ebert, said the chain decided to move into Sri Lanka because of its pristine beaches and relative lack of development. Water did not reach the company's Amangalla hotel, built behind a 17th-century Dutch fort in the popular city of Galle. However, the mid-January opening has been pushed back a few weeks while the city itself rebuilds. (Galle, on the southwestern corner of the island, was particularly hurt, and half of its 49 hotels are closed.) The opening date for the damaged Amanwella resort near Tangalle has been pushed from January to February. 
 Waves damaged the 16 beach villas at the luxury Blue Water hotel, owned by Jetwing Hotels, but they are once again open. Another Jetwing property, the Yala Safari Game Lodge on the southeastern coast, was completely washed away, and many staff members and guests died. The lodge should be rebuilt within a year, said its marketing director, Lalin de Mel. 
 Not all of Sri Lanka's attractions are damaged, or on the coast. The 37 hotels in Colombo are open, and the Cultural Triangle, archaeological sites restored with help from Unesco, lies safely inland. The east coast of the island suffered the most deaths, but had relatively few hotels, according to the Pacific Asia Travel Association. 
 Mr. Dobbs's Sun House hotel, in Galle, is unharmed and housing families in need. Two other Dobbs properties, Taprobane Island and the Beach House, were damaged, but in a phone interview, Mr. Dobbs said ''People are bouncing back much more quickly than I thought they would.'' 

Thailand
 Damage was mainly limited to three districts on Thailand's southwestern coast. Sethaphan Buddhani, a director for the Thailand Tourism Authority in New York, said the hotel damages totaled $300 million in the area of Phangnga, $400 million in Phuket and $700 million in Krabi. He estimated that reconstruction would be mostly complete within six months, although reconstruction in two other destinations, Phi Phi island in Krabi and Khao Lak beach in Phangnga, will take a year. 
 The impact has been eased, Mr. Buddhani said, by tourists heading to other Thai locations. (Until tourism demand picks up, international flights to Phuket have been suspended or reduced by Hong Kong Dragon Airlines, Korean Air, Asiana Airlines, Orient Thai Airlines, Silk Air, Air Asia and Thai Air.)
 Khao Lak, just north of Phuket, saw some of the worst damage, with almost all of the beach's 30 hotels damaged. The 319-room Sofitel Magic Lagoon Resort and Spa had just opened in May; it is closed. The Meridien Khao Lak resort opened in July; many of the beach villas have been destroyed. They are expected to reopen in November. 
 Princess Ubolratana of Thailand and her 21-year-old son, Poom Jensen, were both staying at La Flora resort in Khao Lak, which opened in April. Her son did not survive. The hotel's villas were destroyed, and water damaged the main building. When a spokesman for La Flora, Andrew Jones, visited the hotel in early January, a car hung from the second-floor ledge of a nearby building. He estimated that the hotel will reopen by the end of the year. 
 In the Krabi province, the more casual Phi Phi island was hit hardest, with most of its nearly 15 hotels now closed. 
 Phuket fared better, Thai tourism officials said, with only 10 percent of the beaches affected. The Dusit Laguna and Chedi resorts are open but need some repairs, while the Amanpuri, Banyan Tree, Sheraton Grande Laguna and JW Marriott resorts are fully open. Le Meridien Phuket Beach Resort is closed, and not due to reopen until April, so guests are being moved to Le Royal Meridien Phuket Yacht Club.
 Thais are confident that tourism will get better, often citing the case of Bali, which has largely recovered from the Oct. 12, 2002, explosion that killed 202 people, mostly foreign tourists. (During the first nine months of 2004, Bali received about 1.1 million visitors, 1.4 percent fewer than during the first nine months of 2002.) Next month, the Tourism Authority of Thailand plans to begin a $25 million Save Andaman campaign and fly 1,000 Japanese and European travel agents and writers to Phuket on all-expenses-paid trips designed to show that most tourism facilities are intact. 
 The government plans to take road shows to Russia and Scandinavia, and to work with European governments to lift their recent travel warnings on Phuket. In a sign of a turnaround, the first European charter flight since the disaster is scheduled to arrive in Phuket on Feb. 2. And Thai Airways says that while international reservations for the second half of January are down 11 percent, February is off only 4 percent.

Maldives
 ''This is the worst disaster we've had in the Maldives,'' said Moosa Zameer Hassan, an assistant director of the country's tourism ministry. About 80 people died, including three British tourists -- far fewer than in many other countries, but relatively large for a country of about 340,000 residents and 1,190 coral islands. The coral reefs absorbed much of the waves, but phone, water and power systems were damaged. 
 Since the Maldives, a popular diving destination, are so dependent on tourism, its gross domestic product was expected to drop from the forecasted 5.5 percent growth in 2005 to 1.5 percent, according to the Pacific Asia Travel Association.
 ''It will take a long time to get our industry back in shape,'' Mr. Hassan said. 
 Some reefs close to shore have been silted over. ''It will be a matter of a little more inconvenience,'' Mr. Hassan said. ''You may have to go to the next reef for snorkeling.''
 Recently, 63 of the Maldives' 87 resorts were reported to be operational. Mr. Hassan estimated that the others would take several months to reopen, and up to a year for six that were badly damaged. 
 Jetties at the Soneva Gili Resort were damaged, along with windows and sun decks and the like. It should be mostly open by early February. Its sister property, the Soneva Fushi Resort, is intact and open.
 Rooms and services at the One & Only Kanuhura resort are also open, except for 18 damaged villas. Occupancy is now at 20 percent, according to a spokeswoman, Katie Barr, but she said bookings were stronger for the spring. The Four Seasons is closed while engineers assess the damage. According to the tourism ministry, the Hakuraa Club, Velavaru, Dhonveli Beach and Kandooma are also closed.

HEADLINE: Waiting for Wheels

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

 BODY:
''WHAT'S the rule about yellow lights?'' asked Dan Hickey, when the car had came to a halt a few seconds before the light turned red.
 Ben Verdeschi responded almost by reflex: ''If you're not sure don't go.''
 ''Would you have gone at that light if I wasn't in the car?'' Mr. Hickey asked.
 ''No,'' Ben said. 
 Ben, a sophomore at Hendrick Hudson High School in Montrose, was out for one of his last lessons behind the wheel in a driver education course. Mr. Hickey quizzed him on the year-and-a-half-old licensing restrictions in New York, told him where to keep his hands on the steering wheel, told the other student in the car, Scott Gilbert, not to wear the hood up on his sweatshirt during the road test. 
 While Mr. Hickey talked about mirrors and lights and emphasized safety issues, the two teenagers kept their laser-like focus on what they needed to know to pass the road test. 
 The basics of driver ed have not changed much. 
 Some of the videos are new, with hip-hop soundtracks and stars like Tyra Banks and Evander Holyfield warning against the perils of drunken driving. But to teenagers, they're as corny and as melodramatic as the blood-on-the-road filmstrips that driver ed was famous for in the 1970's. 
 With the introduction of the graduated license in September 2003, driver ed has become a requirement for any 17-year-old who wants to drive alone after 9 p.m., or drive ''American Graffiti'' style, with a car full of friends. 
 Yet the way driver ed is managed in New York has given rise to a thorny set of issues. Instructors, education officials and parents have voiced concern about inadequate oversight and inconsistent regulation. The cost of driver ed, which is no longer part of the regular public high school curriculum, means that not everyone can afford to take it. And there is still the question, asked repeatedly by researchers over the last 20 years: Does it make safer drivers?
 Nationwide there have been a number of licensing reforms in recent years, but one statistic remains unchanged: automobile crashes are still the leading cause of death for teenagers. In 2003, car crashes killed 3,657 drivers between the ages of 15 and 20. Nearly 8,700 people, of all ages, were killed in crashes involving teenage drivers. It is a trend that has fluctuated but stays high. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, there were nine fatalities in 2003 in Westchester from crashes involving 15-to 20-year-old drivers, compared with eight in 1994 (2002 was an unusually deadly year, with 23 deaths). 
 What is particularly striking, however, is how rapidly the crash rate drops with age. In New York, according to the Department of Motor Vehicles, 16-and 17-year-olds get into crashes that lead to injury more than twice the rate of drivers over 18. Those statistics mirrors national figures. If practice does not make drivers perfect, the numbers show that it makes them safer. 
 Graduated licenses, which add restrictions for younger drivers and postpone the time when teenagers can get full licenses, were meant to change these statistics. Although figures are not yet available in New York, the program has worked in other states, reducing teenage crashes by 31 percent in Michigan, for example. 
 The New York licensing rules are somewhat confusing. In nearly all situations, 16-year-olds now take a written test and then have to drive for six months with a permit or a restricted form of the junior license (obtained after successfully navigating the road test). Only when they are 17 can they get a full-fledged junior license. This new rule was meant to extend the amount of practice time for teenage drivers. 
 Even a junior license isn't what it used to be. Before 2003, it meant that, until they turned 18, teenagers could drive after 9 p.m. without an adult only to work or school. The new restriction also bars junior license holders from driving with more than two passengers younger than 21, unless an adult is along for the ride or if the passengers are siblings of the driver.
 There is one way to speed up this process: taking a driver education course. All new drivers, no matter what, have to take a five-hour classroom course before they can take the road test. But if a teenager takes a full 48-hour driver education course while he or she is 16 and has a permit for at least six months, it's possible to get a full license at 17, a year earlier than someone who did not take the full course. To teenagers, that is a crucial year.
 ''You're driving your whole senior year,'' Ben said. ''You're driving at night. That says everything.''
 Driver-ed classes are, not surprising, rarely short on students.
 Traffic safety researchers have praised the graduated license program, but are skeptical about any system in which driver education speeds up the licensing process. Dan Mayhew, senior vice president of the Canada-based Traffic Injury Research Foundation, said there have been numerous studies about these sorts of time discounts. Like many safety experts, he doubts that traditional driver education makes a difference in avoiding crashes. But when taking a course leads more quickly to a license, he said, driver education can be worse than harmless.
 ''The evidence is mounting that allowing teenagers to get off the learner phase sooner than they would otherwise leads to a higher crash rate,'' he said. He pointed to a 1995 study in Nova Scotia, where teenagers who got a time discount for driver education had a 27 percent higher crash rate than teenagers who didn't take a formal course and had to wait. In one 1996 study in Ontario, the rate was 44 percent higher. 
 The studies showed, he said, that a few extra months of supervised practice mattered far more than whether that supervision was formal. In an article last February in the professional journal Injury Prevention, Allan Williams, a senior researcher for the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, sums up the research bluntly: ''There is no difference in the crash records of driver education graduates compared with equivalent groups of beginners who learned to drive without formal education.'' 
 That the Insurance Institute is unequivocal about the ineffectiveness of driver education may be surprising, considering that it is financed by auto insurers, many of which give discounts for taking driver education. But the discounts, safety experts say, are given not because driver education has any proven safety benefits, but because people who voluntarily sign up for driver education tend to be safer drivers, in the same way that honor roll students are better risks (and also often receive insurance discounts).
 The research behind this conclusion has influenced the evolution of driver education in New York over the last three decades. In the early 1970's, almost all New York high schools included driver education as part of the daily curriculum. The districts picked up the costs and local dealerships even donated new cars to the schools, in hopes of gaining new customers. 
 But in the mid-70's, when budgets tightened, driver education was often cut. Like home economics, it was gradually pushed out of the curriculum. Many public school students had to go to private or parochial schools if they wanted to take the course. 
 In the early 1990's, some school districts began financing driver education by charging students. But as insurance costs increased, and local dealerships stopped being as generous with their cars, other schools dropped the program altogether.
 In many states, commercial driving schools stepped in. The Department of Education spells out the state's policy: the 6 hours of behind-the-wheel practice and 18 hours of in-car observation may be contracted out to a commercial school, but the 18 hours of classroom instruction must be taught by a certified schoolteacher who is paid by the school. Additionally, the school itself, whether public or private, must ultimately supervise the entire course, even if it contracts out the behind-the-wheel portion.
 Driving school instructors have fought for years to change the policy. Many in the industry say it was put in place to keep money in the schools or to provide employment options to teachers. Private schools can even make a profit from driver education, particularly when the surrounding public schools aren't offering it.
 Education officials counter that the policy keeps the courses regulated. Whatever the reason, keeping a portion of driver education in the schools has brought its own set of problems. Though driver education is a part of the licensing process and thus a concern of the Department of Motor Vehicles, its oversight rests with the Department of Education. And when two different authorities share one responsibility, it's easy for things to fall between the cracks.
 ''I think somebody has to take responsibility for it and they're not now,'' said Carlos Cuprill, a former official from the Department of Education who was in charge of coordinating driver education for the state until he retired two years ago. His position has not been filled. Mr. Cuprill said driver education was considered exclusively the job of the Department of Education, and in his opinion, the department did not take it seriously.
 ''They don't seem to think it's necessary,'' he said. ''It's not a priority. It's not reading, math or English.''
 Anne Schiano, an assistant director at the Department of Education who oversees driver education programs, agreed that much about the current system could be made more efficient. There are responsibilities, like approving the credentials of driver-ed instructors that the department is involved in but has no legal authority over. It lacks resources for others, such as updating its list of approved schools. ''We go through a ton of paperwork in this office for a responsibility that is not ours by law,'' she said, adding that she has been working with the D.M.V. to simplify the process.
 Mr. Cuprill is a staunch defender of the policy that keeps part of driver education in the classroom, which he said was one of the few unambiguous rules for a program that is unevenly directed. But while the ''game of seesaw,'' as he calls it, goes on between the two departments in Albany, businesses have been popping up to fill the void. Commercial schools say they are trying to give students the most efficient and effective driver education program, but Mr. Cuprill said the development will not result in better drivers.
 ''When you start doing it for money, you look the other way,'' he said. ''It's not about the quality of instruction, it's about the quality of the money. Unless someone takes responsibility, then what are you doing?''
 There is no doubt that driver education has become a big business. There are 660 licensed driving schools operating statewide, 31 of them in Westchester. They range from small operations out of people's homes to large schools with thousands of students. Many work on a contract basis with secondary schools, providing the behind-the-wheel portion while the schools teach in the classroom. To high school students, who usually pay the school between $350 and $450, the division of labor is practically unnoticeable. 
 According to the Department of Education Web site, there were 21 approved driver-ed programs in Westchester public schools, and 17 in private schools, for the 2002-2003 school year, the last year for which the department compiled a list. Very few offer courses during the school day; some students take driver ed after school, but with sports and extracurricular activities eating up the afternoons, early morning, weekend and summer classes are most popular. 
 The largest school in southern New York is the PAS Auto School, which operates in New York City and in several upstate counties, and has contracts with 16 Westchester schools, more than any other private driving school. For the 2003-2004 school year, PAS had 4,112 students. 
 The owner of the school, Allan Lazarus, dismisses the conclusions of the studies. There is no substitute, he said, for the instruction that teenagers get in driver education. And if the new laws created an incentive for driver education, all the better.
 ''The kids who learn how to drive and never take driver's ed tend to be much worse drivers,'' he said. ''The kids who take driver's ed have a much better chance.''
 Mr. Lazarus said he supported the policy that kept the classroom portion of driver education in schools. But he has found a way around the state's division. He recruits retired schoolteachers who are certified in driver education, and introduces them to secondary schools, which then hire them. 
 ''Even though I'm only legally responsible for the in-car,'' Mr. Lazarus said, ''I feel an obligation to coordinate the efforts of the two parts of the program.''
 Schools that are offering contracts for the behind-the-wheel portion sometimes engage in competitive bidding. 
 ''Bidding is a horrible system, I believe, because you will have schools that don't have good instructors,'' said Isa Dominijanni, the owner of Formula One driving school in Mamaroneck. ''There are one-, two-people operations out of their homes. They don't carry high limits on insurance. So they can charge almost nothing for driver's ed.''
 She said the driving schools sometimes didn't even deliver on the complete six hours of driving time. 
 ''In the long run,'' Ms. Dominijanni said, ''the ones who end up paying the price are the students who don't get the education they need.''
 Jeremy Beamon went to Alexander Hamilton High School in Elmsford, which did not offer any driver education. 
 ''We were sort of baffled when we discovered they didn't have it,'' said his mother, Faye Beamon. ''When the time came, we had to go outside.''
 She flipped through the phone book and found a commercial driving school in White Plains. Jeremy took the mandatory five-hour course. But as a commercial school, it could not offer the official 30 hours of classroom instruction, and it did not offer any time behind the wheel. So Jeremy did not get his full license until he was 18, which meant his parents often had to drive him wherever he went after 9 p.m. Many of his friends did not take driver ed, either.
 ''The classes were quite expensive and some people couldn't afford it,'' Ms. Beamon said. 
 Some public school teachers are also frustrated by the current arrangement. Charlie Northshield, who teaches driver-ed classes in the afternoons and evenings at Rye High School, brings police officers and relatives of drunken driving victims into his classroom, takes the students to traffic court and makes them keep driving journals. When he also taught the driving portion, he would try to make sure students had experience in rural, urban and night driving. 
 For years now, he has to cede the driving half of the class to a commercial school. He said he was generally pleased with their instruction, and acknowledged the economic impossibility of running a full driver-ed program, with its own cars, on a school budget. But there are drawbacks.
 ''I could always relate what we were doing when I taught in the field to what we were doing in the classroom,'' he said, adding: ''You could really emphasize the skills more.''
 Back at Hendrick Hudson High School, the next group of four drivers was waiting for Mr. Hickey to take them on the road. They all echoed the same sentiment: driver education had become more popular under the new, stricter regulations. 
 ''Before they made the six-month rule nobody would take it,'' said Nick Yaven, a sophomore from Cortlandt Manor. ''Now most people take driver's ed.''

HEADLINE: The Special Delivery

BYLINE: By Matt Lee and Ted Lee

 BODY:
'There's no school for learning how to deliver very fragile, perishable wedding cakes,'' Barbara Arvanitis said from behind the wheel of her white Ford Econoline, as she inched up a pothole-ravaged Third Avenue in rush-hour traffic.
 If there were a school for cake movers, Arvanitis, 47, would be its headmistress. For 19 years, Arvanitis has transported the work of New York City's top pastry artists from their studios to the banquet halls where the cakes are admired and then devoured, and she claims never to have had a full-blown cake catastrophe on the job.
 Wedding cakes, after all, are unusual cargo. A 300-pound tuna destined for Masa carries a risk, but a $25,000 Ron Ben-Israel sculpture of eggs, butter and sugar en route to East Hampton for a wedding is something else entirely, especially when you add to the journey a 90-degree day, a traffic-choked Long Island Expressway, a flight of stairs, a wet lawn. 
 As Arvanitis approached the Queens-Midtown Tunnel, car horns braying on all sides, she sat back in her seat, unruffled. The cake protruding from a cardboard box in the back of the van was comparatively low on the stress scale: a three-and-a-half-foot-tall, five-tiered sweet 16 by the designer Colette Peters, worth a couple thousand dollars.
 Her usual routes are the grand Midtown venues: the Pierre, the Waldorf, the Metropolitan Club. But Queens is familiar enough. It's where she got her start in 1981 as a sales representative for Hostess cakes. She had just graduated from college and had already developed a clear image of what she wanted to do with her life.
 ''I liked being around sugar, sweets and pastries, and I liked movement -- real, physical movement,'' she said. ''So I put that combination together.'' She delivered Sno Balls and Twinkies to bodegas and delicatessens in Bushwick, Brooklyn, and found she enjoyed it. In 1985, Arvanitis got her big break when she crossed paths with the society baker Sylvia Weinstock. Virtually overnight, she went from pastry driver to handler of fine confectionary art.
 ''When I first started, I was terrified,'' she said, as we accelerated out of the tunnel onto the expressway. ''I would drive 15 miles an hour up and down the avenues with my hazards on. After every pothole, I'd look over my shoulder at the cake to see what had moved, what had fallen off, if anything.''
 With experience, Arvanitis discovered that each cake has its own personality, and that getting to know what each cake could tolerate, in terms of climate, vibration and bumps, was critical. ''You develop a skill for handling each cake,'' she said. ''The pastry chefs I'm working for now -- some of whom I've been working for as long as 10 years -- I know their cakes.
 ''I'm pretty much a nervous wreck with people I really haven't done a lot of work for,'' Arvanitis said, referring to the up-and-coming baker Elisa Strauss. An earlier Strauss tour de force -- a detailed cake villa, complete with tall palm trees and a swimming pool filled with a liquid gel -- was particularly precarious.
 And Strauss was nervous, too. ''Barbara has my life in her hands every weekend,'' she said. ''My dad's a surgeon, so I shouldn't be melodramatic. But what would I do if anything happened?'' The two have yet to develop a complete trust for each other. ''Give it another six months, a year,'' Arvanitis said. ''We'll be fine.''
 In the last few years, Arvanitis's services have been so in demand that she is able to choose her clients. She let two go recently, one for ''lack of skill with climate control'' and another who wouldn't stick to a schedule. ''If I tell you I'm coming at 3,'' Arvanitis said, ''and you're still finishing the piping on the cake, that throws me off.''
 During high wedding season, Arvanitis may have as many as nine cakes to deliver in a single Saturday. Her deliveries have taken her inside places she would otherwise never see, like the White House, the Smithsonian and celebrities' homes. As more brides demand cakes by marquee chefs, Arvanitis's van has also become a familiar sight at private airstrips. She once delivered a six-box colossus to Barry Diller's jet at Teterboro Airport, which was then flown to a London wedding. During a recent LaGuardia delivery, a six-tiered cake for a wedding in the Bahamas wouldn't fit on the jet, so the family chartered a second one, just for the cake.
 Arvanitis spotted Le Cordon Bleu, a windowless party palace under the Jamaica Avenue el, and pulled the van into the service alley. She cast a glance across the uneven asphalt. 
 ''We're going to have to hand-carry it,'' she said. ''Forget the dolly.'' Arvanitis and her assistant, Mike Daronco, opened the double door on the flank of the van and moved in on either side of the box, peering into the top to confirm that nothing had shifted en route.
 ''This is a light cake,'' Arvanitis said. ''Some are extraordinarily heavy. A four-tiered carrot cake is like moving a sofa.'' They hoisted the box together and sidestepped about 25 yards to the service door, entering a battleship-gray catering-hall kitchen. Through the double doors to the left was a red room with mirrors, empty but for a table of waiters in dinner jackets.
 ''I've got the cake for the party,'' Arvanitis said, approaching.
 ''We got five parties tonight,'' said an older man, the manager.
 ''This is for a sweet-16 party,'' Arvanitis said.
 ''We got two -- Amanda or Jessica?'' he asked. Arvanitis's instructions listed the mother's name and cellphone number, but she didn't budge. The manager went back to his office to research the issue.
 ''That's the last thing I'd do,'' she said, ''rattle the mother while she's getting ready.''
 The banquet manager solved the mix-up and ushered us into a van-size service elevator. In the blue-mirrored Corinthian Room, Arvanitis and Daronco slid the box onto a long table, about where the mother would sit in a few hours. 
 She slit the box along each seam with a box cutter and let the sides fall, revealing the cake. She slid both her hands between the cardboard box bottom and the cake platform, loosening the double-sided tape with her fingers. She then cradled the cake, palms up, directly beneath its center of gravity. We all stepped back as she lifted the cake, pivoted and rested it on the table, then pulled her hands from beneath the platform. She centered it, rotating the cake so the fondant medallion inscribed with ''Sweet Sixteen!'' faced the rest of the party.
 ''After I've staged the cake on the table, I take a moment to step back and look at it,'' she said. ''I appreciate the beauty of the cake and appreciate that I got it there, and then it's over.'' On to the next cake.

 BODY:
SEMICIRCULAR rows of benches face the front of the room. A raised platform faces the benches. Anyone who has ever attended college will recognize the setting at once: a lecture hall.
 That's what archeologists figured they found last year when they unearthed room after identical room -- 13 in all -- at a site that appears to have been part of the ancient University of Alexandria in Egypt. What's more, those 13 classrooms adjoin a theater uncovered 25 years ago. The auditorium, they now realize, must have functioned as one of the biggest lecture halls of them all. If so, then the large-enrollment lecture course has endured as the heart of higher education not simply since the founding of Harvard nearly four centuries ago, as scholars previously thought, but for a couple of millenniums.
 If some educators have their way, however, the lecture course will soon occupy the same dustbin of history as the chariot race. ''I don't think the solely lecture-based course will survive,'' says Carol A. Twigg, director of the Center for Academic Transformation at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in upstate New York. ''And,'' she adds, ''it shouldn't.'' 
 The freshman lecture course has always made economic sense: a student-teacher ratio of 700 to 1 helps underwrite all those small seminars for juniors and seniors. Now Ms. Twigg intends to convince institutions of higher learning that they can save even more money while improving the quality of education. Since 1999, the center has awarded $6 million in grants to 30 institutions of higher learning to reimagine the large-enrollment introductory course by introducing technological elements. Beginning this academic year, the most successful course redesigns are being passed on to 20 new institutions, which two or three years from now, if all goes according to plan, will pass their own refinements on to other institutions, and so on, until each course model is factory-ready to ship to any college that wants it. The hope is that these alternative approaches will redefine the freshman experience once and for all.
 THIS challenge to the introductory lecture course is hardly the first. For decades, progressive educators have been critical of what they call a push technology. It's all information, no interaction. It's unidirectional: lecturer-active, student-passive. It's indiscriminate; the same lessons reach each student regardless of individual interest, skill or intellect.
 ''We have a fundamental mismatch between how students learn and the lecture method,'' says Arthur Levine, president of Teachers College at Columbia University. Students, he says, generally think in concrete terms: ''Show me the pieces. Show me how they work.'' By contrast, he says, teachers tend to think in abstractions, and assume that their students do, too, that they're sitting out there in their lecture hall seats, bolted to the floor, saying, ''Tell me the theory.''
 Large lectures survive, in part, because they're an efficient way to deliver the mass of facts necessary to build foundational knowledge in a discipline.
 ''That doesn't mean we can't do them better, though,'' says Diana Oblinger, a vice president of the EduCause Center for Applied Research, a nonprofit organization that promotes technology in higher education. ''People need to do more than just learn facts. They need context. They need to have not just rote memorization but a way to transfer one situation to another.
 ''The real key,'' Ms. Oblinger says, ''is interactivity,'' which has become a dominant concept in higher education today, and one that encompasses interaction with the teacher, with other students, and with the material itself, often through the use of information technology.
 The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for one, is rethinking the prevailing model on its own. It is converting its infamously daunting introductory physics lecture courses to what it calls Technology Enabled Active Learning, or TEAL. The principal coordinator of the effort, John Belcher, used to teach the university's introductory physics courses and, he says, ''I wouldn't go back.'' The failure rate in the classes was typically 10 to 12 percent, he explains, but ''most notable was that only 40 percent of the students were coming to class by the end of the term.'' And it wasn't just his classes that suffered attendance drop-off; other M.I.T. professors working within the large lecture format reported that attendance at the end of the semester would rarely rise above 50 percent. ''Whatever you think of the pedagogy of large lectures,'' Mr. Belcher says, ''if students aren't coming, it's a problem.''
 His opportunity to address the situation came when Alex d'Arbeloff, an alumnus and former M.I.T. Corporation chairman, established a $10 million Fund for Excellence in M.I.T. Education. Mr. Belcher's solution has been a ''flat classroom.'' Students are divided into groups of nine at round tables, and teams of three share one laptop, where they can follow the instructor's Power Point presentation or even monitor results from real (not virtual) desktop experiments through sensors that feed into the computer. Instructors circulate, intervening where necessary, answering questions, asking questions and, yes, delivering the occasional lecture. In this case, though, lectures are brief and in an intimate setting.
 So far, M.I.T. has instituted the new format in the course on electromagnetism, and it seems to be working. In a study that tested students on concepts before and after a semester, TEAL students demonstrated a comprehension nearly double that of the large-lecture students. For that reason, M.I.T. is going to apply the model to the other half of the introductory physics curriculum, a course on mechanics, by next fall.
 TEAL is only one of many acronyms out there. In designing it, Mr. Belcher borrowed heavily from the Student-Centered Activities for Large Enrollment Undergraduate Programs, or Scale-Up, at North Carolina State University. But Mr. Belcher had to adapt it to M.I.T.'s specific needs, incorporating visualizations of electricity and magnetism, for instance. On the whole, though, TEAL follows Scale-Up's example right down to the round tables' supposedly ideal diameter, as determined by North Carolina State designers after testing several other sizes on students: seven feet.
 If Mr. Belcher had to go hunting for a model for TEAL, Ms. Twigg's goal is to create a one-stop clearinghouse. For a modest fee to cover administrative and consulting costs, an institution could buy both a new pedagogical model and the know-how to implement it. For that reason, some of the alternatives that the Center for Academic Transformation is now producing might well be the ones that stick.
 ''You do unto students what was done unto you,'' Ms. Twigg says. ''If you don't see alternatives that work as well as or better than what you know, then you won't think about change. I can say with great confidence that once people become familiar with alternative, more effective ways of structuring the student learning experience, the solely large-lecture course will disappear.
 ''But it's been around for how many hundreds of years? So you can't expect it to change in two years.''
 The center's Program in Course Redesign began when the Pew Charitable Trusts approached Ms. Twigg about rethinking higher education. As a vice president of EduCause, she had advocated the potential for technology in academia. ''In other areas,'' she says, ''technology reduces costs and improves the quality of service.'' So, she wondered, why not in higher education? ''It seems obvious, but not to a lot of people.''
 Pew's donation paid for the initial phase, in which 30 institutions developed pedagogical models in any number of disciplines. For this second phase, 20 new institutions have agreed to underwrite the costs of implementing the most successful models and refining them further. For now, the models are being applied to precalculus, psychology, Spanish and statistics; eventually humanities, biology and chemistry will be the focus. 
 So far, five distinct pedagogical models have emerged. One simply supplements the lecture with online quizes (as was the case in the University of New Mexico's general psychology course) or small problem-solving groups (as in the University of Massachusetts-Amherst's introductory biology). Another model substitutes online sessions for one or two of the weekly lectures, either in a scheduled computer lab (as in Pennsylvania State University's introductory statistics course) or anywhere anytime (University of Tennessee-Knoxville's introductory Spanish).
 A third model offers a smorgasbord of options; in fact, it's called the ''Buffet'' model. Instructors at Ohio State University, the institution that created this model, work with the 3,250 students taking introductory chemistry to match individual backgrounds, skills and goals with an appropriate combination of laboratories, projects, videos, study sessions, good old-fashioned homework and large lectures.
 Nearly all the institutions using these three models reported a rise in student test scores that ranged up to 10 percentage points and increases in attendance of, in some cases, more than 20 percent. At the same time, they also report decreased costs of an average of 37 percent. ''By using technology for those aspects of the course where it would be more effective, and by engaging faculty only in tasks that require faculty expertise,'' Ms. Twigg explains, ''an institution can decrease costs per student even though the number of students enrolled in the course remains unchanged.''
 The other two new pedagogical models take place outside the classroom, and that's where results become more ambiguous, at least academically. The Emporium model eliminates all class meetings in mathematics in favor of a ''learning resource center'' -- a lab that (as at Virginia Tech) houses banks of computer workstations and provides access to personalized assistance 24 hours a day. And the fully online model (as in the University of Dayton's intro psychology course) is just that. 
 Yet you don't have to be a knee-jerk naysayer, only a parent paying tuition, to ask: $27,000 a year to sit in front of a computer? Ms. Twigg laughs at the question. ''It's one course,'' she says, ''not their entire baccalaureate experience.'' Still, that course might well leave some students who say ''show me the pieces; show me how they work'' showing themselves.
 In fact, Dayton reported problems with students dropping or withdrawing from intro psychology -- over two semesters, 8 and 10 percent more students from the online courses than from the traditional course. And for those students who stayed, exams and collaborative exercises indicated ''no significant differences'' between the traditional and online formats. 
 Among the Emporium institutions, Virginia Tech and Northern Arizona University saw changes that were not statistically significant, a result that, as Virginia Tech reported, ''bears out course personnel's general observation that the new system appears to work less well for conceptually difficult material.'' What was statistically significant about the off-classroom models were the decreases in per-student costs: from $139 to $84 at Dayton, $91 to $21 at Virginia Tech, and $138 to $82 at Northern Arizona.
 Ms. Twigg is not worried. She points out that the program is being gradually rolled out to figure out which models to pursue as well as to refine them.
 THE large lecture is not without advocates. Kenneth Elzinga, a professor of economics at the University of Virginia, says that when he learned he would be teaching a course of 700 students, ''I was just shocked. I thought, 'This can't work. I don't even believe in this.' It took me a long time to come to peace with it.'' Today, every Tuesday and Thursday, he teaches 1,000 students. First he delivers one lecture to more than 500 students at 11 a.m., then he repeats the lecture at 12:30 p.m. word for word.
 What changed his mind was the realization that for students, being part of such an enormous gathering fosters ''a certain bonding experience.'' The reason is ''what economists call 'economies of scope': a shared experience that allows students to discuss topics at mealtime and in dorms with classmates who encountered the same ideas that same day.'' 
 ''I'm not a Luddite,'' he adds. But with online communication or videotaped lectures, Mr. Elzinga feels the talks wouldn't have the same impact: ''What's lost is this camaraderie of the classroom that somehow seems to be a positive experience for a lot of students here.'' 
 Ms. Oblinger offers another defense: ''Some faculty are wonderful performers.'' 
 An example from the Program in Course Redesign itself reinforces this observation. The University of New Mexico's report on its experiences says that the decision of the school to eliminate two of three weekly lectures by a popular associate professor in psychology was met with ''considerable, sustained student protest.'' The university relented, reinstating one of the lectures.
 It's an example that speaks to a reason beyond the pedagogic or the economic -- beyond reason, even. The lecture format might lend itself to a flat classroom and a fleet of laptops. But what about the lecturer -- that eminent presence planted at the front of the room, dispensing depths of knowledge in the very voice of authority, commanding attention with a display of erudition that is nothing if not theater? It would be difficult to imagine a Vladimir Nabokov pacing among a bunch of seven-foot-diameter tables, occasionally consenting to interrupt his literary discourse long enough to lean forward and offer interactivity. As far as Mr. Elzinga and even Ms. Oblinger are concerned, we shouldn't have to.
 A Socrates practicing his method, however, might be a different story. In the idle moments between grant applications, this is what Ms. Twigg envisions: a contemporary version of the ancient Greek navigating a sea of laptops, soliciting questions, and perhaps, even from freshmen, eliciting wisdom. 
 Oh, yes: and saving money.

HEADLINE: Working With the Enemy 

BYLINE: By Douglas McGray. 
Douglas McGray is a freelance writer specializing in social and political issues.

 BODY:
IN the years since Brad Jupp's mix of intellect and rhetorical brass knuckles earned him a job leading contract negotiations for the Denver Classroom Teachers Association, a few things happened, the likes of which have come to be expected from teachers' unions and school districts. There was the time the governor invoked an obscure, century-old labor law to seize authority from the district and force the union into arbitration. There was the time the district decided to hold a contentious round of negotiations in public, and enraged teachers pelted the stage with handfuls of pennies and nickels. And in 1994, there was the strike. Mr. Jupp, his hair down to his shoulders, stalked the state capitol, bullhorn in hand, while 3,000 fellow teachers shouted demands and shut Denver's public schools for five days. 
 The only surprising thing is what happened next. 
 For the last five years, Mr. Jupp has overseen a plan, expected to be rolled out districtwide next year, that will pay teachers substantial bonuses based in part on how well their students perform, with financial incentives to teachers who choose to work in the city's less affluent neighborhoods or teach hard-to-staff subjects. 
 The ideas aren't new; several states and districts have experimented with some form of performance pay, primarily bonuses to entire schools whose test scores improve. But the idea of rewarding individual teachers invariably touches off a political firestorm and eventually gets derailed. 
 Indeed, the national teachers' unions -- the National Education Association, a network of mostly suburban and rural school systems, and the American Federation of Teachers, its smaller, more urban counterpart -- have spent decades fighting such ideas in favor of a formula that sets salaries according to classroom experience, with a bump for extra time in graduate school. 
 Yet Denver's plan is something else altogether: not only does it reward individuals, but it was designed, tested and sold to a majority of the city's teachers by the union itself. 
 As a result, Denver's union, one of the N.E.A.'s larger locals, ''became pariahs at N.E.A. meetings,'' the school board president, Les Woodward, says in an observation echoed by others. ''They were believed to be working on a project contrary to the interests of any unionized teacher.'' Some teachers agree, particularly those who remember the rights and raises unions won in the 1960's, and how they won them: by fighting administrators and elected officials, not by joining them. Yet in minimizing seniority-based raises, Denver won its first really substantial increase in more than two decades: up to an additional 20 percent in performance raises and bonuses. That could bring salaries to the level of Denver's suburban schools, which have lured away many experienced city teachers. 
 In union halls, administration offices and policy institutes across the country, all eyes are on Denver to see if the gamble pays off -- for teachers, for the district or even for both. 
 Mr. Jupp's hair is buzzed short now. In a striped oxford shirt and round, rimless glasses, he looks the part of an eager English and social studies teacher, which he was until he began working on district education policy full time. His rabble-rousing energy makes it easy to imagine him on the picket line. 
 ''It's pathetic,'' he says, shaking his head as he offers his view of conventional union strategy. ''We reject offers that would change how teachers are paid and get locked in collective bargaining agreements where we're fighting for 10th- or 100th-of-a-percent raises.'' He doesn't accuse teachers' unions of narrow self-interest, as some critics do, just myopia and inflexibility -- at the worst possible time.
 Nationally, teachers' unions may be facing the most hostile environment they have seen in decades. For all the reach and resources that critics condemn them for mobilizing against education reform, unions increasingly find themselves bystanders to the big changes that affect life in the classroom. 
 Deep cuts in state financing have left most school districts short on cash, with many locals powerless to negotiate the annual raises their members expect. Mayors like Michael R. Bloomberg in New York are bringing far more leverage and public scrutiny to the negotiating table than a school administrator ever could, while demanding sweeping changes. Republican governors in Pennsylvania and Michigan, longtime labor strongholds, have pushed legislation that undercuts the unions, including limiting their right to strike. Elsewhere, charter schools and privatization have multiplied opportunities for nonunion teachers: this summer in Denver, the governor's new accountability plan will privatize its first struggling school, and Philadelphia has already privatized nearly four dozen. 
 Meanwhile, the Bush administration has been frank in its disregard for unions, branding the N.E.A. an impediment to progress (or, as former Education Secretary Rod Paige quipped, ''a terrorist organization''). That message seems to have resonated. After Mr. Bush passed his signature education law, No Child Left Behind, over fierce union opposition, the N.E.A. tried without success to persuade voters to hold it against him during his re-election campaign. 
 The hard line of the No Child Left Behind era has put most union locals on the defensive. In Denver, however, the union is following an opposite strategy: in exchange for greater influence on policy and for higher wages for its members, it is embracing some of the platforms of conservative critics and legislators. 
 ''Brad has a long-term vision for the union,'' says Denver's superintendent, Jerry F. Wartgow. ''That the union has to change.'' 
 Denver didn't change because it wanted to, Mr. Jupp says. It changed because it had to. But while thousands of other local teachers' unions may ultimately face the same pressure, few appear to see it that way. 
 JUST a few months before the first horse-drawn streetcars began ferrying passengers though downtown Philadelphia, a small group of school administrators and university scholars gathered there, in August 1857, to announce the first national education association. The new union -- a men's club for the first decade, with dues of $2 a year (or $20 lifetime) -- organized academic conferences and proposed innovations like a federal Department of Education, Greek and Latin classes in high school and standard spellings for common words like ''tho,'' ''altho'' and ''thru.'' But by the end of the century, the N.E.A. had attracted scarcely more than 2,000 members. School administrators, who made up most of the membership, finally began forcing their teachers to join (a decision many would probably like a second crack at). 
 It wasn't until the late 1950's that teachers' unions finally came of age, widely adopting industrial union tactics. Almost immediately, strikes broke out across the country. The fight throughout the 1960's for a rigid pay schedule brought better wages for women and minorities. By 1973, organized teachers had become such a force that Woody Allen could joke, in ''Sleeper,'' about the end of the world coming when Albert Shanker, then president of the New York local, ''got hold of a nuclear warhead.''
 But wages began to stagnate in the 1970's. Locals bargained increasingly for industrial-style contracts, setting parameters on how much teachers could be required to work, down to the minute, and what kinds of duties administrators could ask them to perform. In New York City, for example, the contract, including side agreements, swelled to more than 1,000 pages. Critics came to question whether that kind of approach made sense in an intellectual work environment, and they challenged the unions' commitment to quality education. 
 As their ranks grew, the unions grew wealthier. Today, the N.E.A. claims 2.7 million members and the A.F.T. 1.3 million, the source of more than an estimated $1 billion a year in dues-based revenue. Taking advantage of their new clout, the unions threw most of their weight behind one party (last year, political action committees of the N.E.A. and A.F.T. gave $3 million to Democratic campaigns, and almost nothing to Republicans). That brought forth a new set of critics who sought to weaken opposition to right-leaning candidates and causes. 
 When ''A Nation at Risk,'' the Reagan administration's indictment of American public education, gave birth to the modern ''education reform'' movement, teachers felt the full sting of blame. Unions fought back unequivocally. 
 Mr. Shanker, then president of the A.F.T., was an exception. ''He said that, yes, there are problems in the public school system, and we need to be part of the larger coalition that pushes for change,'' explains Richard Kahlenberg, a senior fellow at the nonprofit Century Foundation who is writing a biography of Mr. Shanker. The last years of Mr. Shanker's 30-year presidency were spent exploring new ideas like teacher certification, standards and school choice. The vast majority of local leaders did not follow him, but a handful did, and so-called progressive unionism began to take shape.
 A local in Toledo, Ohio, created peer review, a then-radical system in which teachers evaluated colleagues and recommended laggards for dismissal. The Minneapolis local restructured tenure and created mentoring programs for inexperienced teachers. In Philadelphia, the local intervened to help keep experienced teachers from using their seniority rights to flee schools in poor neighborhoods. An N.E.A. chapter in Columbus, Ohio, is now collaborating with a group of union leaders and administrators to rank local universities by the performance of the young teachers they graduate.
 Mr. Jupp had no intention of becoming an advocate for this kind of unionism. He had dreamed of organizing workers since he was a teenager. ''It was an Oedipal thing,'' he cracks -- his father was management in a unionized typesetting shop. 
 So when Adam Urbanski, a vice president of the A.F.T. and a longtime local leader in Rochester, announced the formation of the Teachers' Union Reform Network, or TURN, to encourage experiments outside the traditional scope of union business, Mr. Jupp was skeptical. 
 ''Teachers' unions,'' Mr. Urbanski wrote in a 2001 article, ''still expend most of their energy and resources on defending a very small minority of troubled members; they still define their mission narrowly in terms of bread-and-butter issues; and they still confine themselves to reacting to management's provocations.'' 
 As for the way teachers are paid, ''there is absolutely no question that there will be an end to the proletarian system that rewards people for sticking around and accumulating random credits,'' he wrote, sounding more like an activist school board chief than a union leader. If such change is inevitable, he added, ''it's better working from our draft than from their draft.'' The idea has become something of a motto for TURN: ''Reform or be reformed.''
 Recalling his first meeting with Mr. Urbanski and his colleagues, Mr. Jupp sounds sheepish. ''I was actually really rude,'' he says. ''I told them they sounded like a bunch of superintendents'' -- with some unprintable language, for emphasis. They talked too much about education policy, he thought, and not enough about the financial and professional interests of their members.
 The pressure for change intensified in Denver, when on a cold Halloween in 1998, the superintendent approached Mr. Jupp with a warning: The school board wanted merit pay for teachers. The board knew it would be controversial, maybe even impossible. ''I knew the culture of teachers,'' says Mr. Woodward, the board president. ''You didn't, in polite company, use the words 'merit pay.' You could use the F-word before you could use merit pay!'' 
 Mr. Jupp was furious.
 Unions offer a range of arguments against linking pay to what goes on in the classroom -- that it is unhealthy for teachers to compete with one another, that they will cheat, that it is impossible to quantify good teaching, that the benefit to students is not proven, that all teachers deserve equal reward, that it allows management to play favorites. The bottom line is solidarity. 
 Yet performance pay, in theory, is rooted in fairness and free-market principles. When funds are scarce, why should a district give everyone a small but equal raise, regardless of the talents they bring or the extra hours they work, when they could spend a little more on their most valuable teachers and neediest schools? 
 As in most school districts, negotiations over salary in Denver were always bitter, and teachers often walked away with a raise that barely kept up with inflation. Faced with relentless financial pressure, Mr. Jupp and other union leaders began to think what had been unthinkable: that paying teachers differently might be a route to higher salaries, at least for some. ''We're always trying to prove that people's reforms are no good,'' he says of unions today. ''We live in this bunker mentality, where we say, 'We're willing to accept your change, but don't come to us until you've fixed all the problems with it.' ''
 Eventually, the Denver union proposed a two-year experiment with performance pay (later extended to four years), beginning in 1999. Only schools where at least 85 percent of teachers supported the idea would participate -- and only 16 of 104 schools did. But the union decided to be more than a reluctant partner: it raised more than $1 million from foundations to finance the pilot project and hired a Boston-based consultancy to help plan it.
 The union put Mr. Jupp and its future president, Becky Wissink, in charge, and eventually two principals joined them. The team settled on a complicated hybrid of bonuses for achievements that teachers told them they endorse -- for getting board-certified, for earning higher degrees in subjects they teach and for reaching individual goals they set with their principals. There would also be bonuses if their students improved on standardized tests, if the district labeled their school ''distinguished,'' if administrators gave them a good evaluation and if they taught a subject or accepted a school assignment the district identified as a high priority. 
 Last year, the union pronounced itself satisfied with the experiment and agreed to make the system permanent. (Performance pay has wide public support in Denver, but for the plan to go districtwide, residents must approve a property-tax increase in November of an estimated $60 a household.)
 But without a fierce, last-minute union lobbying effort the new salary plan would never have won majority support. Only four months before teachers voted to allow permanent performance pay, polls put support at only 19 percent, with more than half of Denver's teachers strongly opposed. So the union printed campaign literature, and sent volunteers classroom to classroom. They stressed that performance pay would never dock anyone's salary; but a ''no'' vote would stand between teachers and big raises. They told teachers to forget the horror stories about merit pay, that Denver's new pay plan was devised by their own, by the union. 
 The morning of the vote, Ms. Wissink remained unsure about the outcome. She wrote two speeches, one if the measure passed, another if it failed. Ultimately, 59 percent voted to accept it. 
 Still, Mr. Urbanski -- progressive unionism's most visible advocate -- says he does not know if Denver's plan will work. Students showed some gains during the pilot project, but the sample was small and results inconclusive. If too many or too few teachers get substantial raises, the system will collapse. Roughly 85 percent of teachers met all their objectives during the pilot, earning a $1,500 bonus, which prompted union leaders and their administrative partners to write stricter, more standardized goals into the final plan. Incentives to teach at underprivileged schools may also be too modest. 
 Many critics of unions have praised Denver's work. But as Frederick M. Hess, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, notes, that may be ''a strategic decision,'' less a hearty endorsement of Denver's plan than an attempt to encourage other locals. They hope Denver is a sign of change to come.
 ''PERFORMANCE pay has been abused, it has been misused,'' says the N.E.A. president, Reg Weaver. He wears a cellphone holstered at each hip, like a Washington gunslinger. Despite his warm demeanor, the comparison is not far off: Mr. Weaver's education landscape is full of character assassins and budget robbers masquerading as reformers. ''I know a state union president, Jolene Franken, in Iowa,'' he says, then hushes his voice. 
 ''Three years ago, she went out on a limb against the wishes of the members. And the politicians and the business people screwed her. They got her, man.''
 For union leaders, change can be dangerous. In 2000, leaders in Cincinnati cooperated with their district to introduce a performance pay plan. A year later, the teachers kicked their president out of office and then killed the plan by a vote of 1,892 to 73. Last year, teachers voted presidents out of office in Boston and Chicago, concluding that they were talking too much about education policy and neglecting basic issues of pay and working conditions. For now, Ms. Wissink remains popular enough in Denver, but opinion can turn quickly.
 ''Education reform is in the eye of the beholder,'' Mr. Weaver concludes. He sees most such policies as efforts to promote private schools, weaken the union or change course just for the sake of change. His platform is straightforward: more education financing, higher salaries, better teacher training, smaller classes and no vouchers. 
 ''When I speak I am not speaking out of turn,'' he says, explaining his focus. ''I am speaking based on the policies that have been passed by our 9,000-member representative assembly.'' Mr. Weaver is unenthusiastic about performance pay. Denver ''decided they wanted to do it, and who am I to say they can't?'' he says. ''Locals and states can do whatever they want to do. But they usually try to stay within the policies of the organization, which is good.''
 What about salary perks to encourage experienced teachers to teach in more difficult schools? At one failing middle school in Denver's poorest neighborhood, half the teachers have less than three years of experience -- a disaster, according to the N.E.A.'s research on the value of veteran teachers. ''See, I want all schools to be such that they don't have to worry about picking and choosing,'' he says. ''That might be idealistic, but that's what I want.''
 Do tenure, seniority and the traditional pay schedule always work in everyone's best interest? ''Of course not,'' he says after a long pause. ''But I can't say that. Our enemies will take that and use it against us.'' 
 The A.F.T.'s new president, Edward J. McElroy, is less cautious. He stresses that representing teachers' interests should always be the main focus of a union leader, not education policy. ''If someone gets elected to be a union leader, they didn't get elected to be dean of education,'' he says. But he is not convinced a union like Denver's is on the wrong track. While TURN has encouraged more substantial changes than the A.F.T. leadership has thus far, Mr. McElroy suggests that unions across the country may have to evolve along similar lines. 
 ''We may have to look at alternative means of compensation,'' he agrees. He has no desire to see tenure eliminated, but he calls the timeline for firing teachers ''overly long.'' 
 Seniority, too, sometimes carries too much weight. As for market incentives to increase the number of experienced teachers in struggling schools or in hard-to-staff subjects, ''there may be some value in that,'' he acknowledges.
 ''We may have to look at some things we haven't,'' he says. ''That creates controversy among members. But it is controversy worth dealing with.'' 
 Opinion can divide along district lines, with members of embattled locals -- like New York City, at the moment -- often overwhelmingly focused on protecting rights and salaries against take-backs, and teachers in less contentious districts more willing to experiment. It can also break along demographic lines. Young teachers often accept changes in the way they are evaluated and paid; older teachers, the union's lifeblood in many districts, have seen so many education fads sold and recalled, they are often deeply skeptical, especially of anything that might weaken bargaining clout. 
 New York City's union president, Randi Weingarten, ''is herself pretty progressive, but she's got a huge membership, split in many different directions,'' says Julia Koppich, an education consultant and expert on unionism. Ms. Weingarten headed an A.F.T. task force that proposed reconsidering the way teachers are paid, as Denver is doing, Ms. Koppich says, ''but she'd get killed if she recommended it in New York.'' 
 If performance pay fails in Denver, Mr. Urbanski fears what it will mean for its union and those in districts trying to follow its example (Wichita, Kan., for instance, is now trying to model a plan after Denver's). ''I would not advise unions to enter into collaborations unless they are strong,'' he says. ''The kind of collaboration that is perceived as being in bed with districts won't last.''
 In Denver, there are plenty of people in the educational community who think that Mr. Jupp no longer represents the mainstream. ''He is viewed as something of an administrator now,'' says Ann Bailey, principal of Thomas Jefferson High School. 
 Across town, at Horace Mann Middle School, a group of teachers who voted for performance pay nevertheless criticize the union for waiting to decide on key elements, including more standardized criteria that teachers must meet, until after the final vote took place. 
 Teachers allowed an inch and the union took a mile, says Suzie Bowman, an English-as-a-second-language instructor. 
 Margaret Bobb, a science teacher, agrees: ''People are feeling betrayed.''
 Nonetheless, with the plan, the Denver union has had more impact than it has enjoyed in decades. 
 Ultimately, Mr. Jupp predicts, unions will have to be more flexible in their opportunism. ''I don't want teachers' unions to be so good that they bargain themselves out of existence, like some of our brothers and sisters in the manufacturing and airline industries,'' he says. ''We could bargain our business to a standstill, because we're not looking at the overall health of the industry. There are too many 'cheap carriers' out there taking vouchers for charter schools.'' 
 Ms. Wissink shares his fears: ''I can see a whole charter school district.''
 But that does not mean they believe unions should lessen their influence. Rather, they should broaden their interests. ''What we've done is create a new place in the world where teachers are at the table talking about instructional quality,'' Mr. Jupp says. The union could be just as productive a partner in curriculum development or in testing. ''I wish we were able to reach end to end through the district's operations,'' he says. Union skeptics hardened during the battles of the 1960's and 1970's might find that prospect terrifying. But they might also find something to appreciate in the results.
 ''There are a lot of policy ideas that suggest if you just press the red button and nuke the unions, change will come quicker,'' Mr. Jupp says. 
 Collaborating with the union may protract the process, he says, but at the very least, ''it doesn't engage in the fantasy that you can make your enemy go away.''

To the Editor: Spending a night last summer at the Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables, Fla., for her father's birthday made a lasting impression on my 10-year-old granddaughter.
 I didn't scrimp, and I let her order from the regular menu rather than the $5.95 children's menu, which looked very similar to McDonald's. She also had the Champagne brunch on Sunday morning at $30, the half-price rate for children. 
 It was not a waste. She has been to enough places to be able to recognize quality, and now she'd like a night at the Biltmore for her birthday. I have spoiled her forever. With her new expectations of luxury linens, service, atmosphere and beautifully prepared food, how will she be able to survive an economy hotel?

HEADLINE: The Big Unknown Of Modern Retirement

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Articles often discuss asset accumulation for retirement -- whether historical stock market returns can be expected to continue, for example (''The Risky Assumption in Social Security Change,'' Economic View, Dec. 26), or whether workers are putting the right amount of money aside (''Before Slicing, Make Sure That the Pie Is Big Enough,'' Fundamentally, Dec. 26). 
 But what about one great unknown: the likely mass liquidation of stocks by individual investors and pension funds, all aiming to convert to solid, stable and reliable income production? 
 Who will the stock buyers be at the high prices expected by more sellers than buyers? Just as demographic changes will result in too few workers paying for too many retirees, there may be too few buyers to absorb the liquidation of stocks by pension funds, life insurance companies and individual investors. 
 Conversion from asset accumulation to income production is the hard part of the retirement security process. Producing a solid stream of income for 20 to 30 years requires a lot more than projecting historical stock market and bond returns.

HEADLINE: MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET? 

BYLINE: By Patrick McGeehan

 BODY:
An influential group of New York business leaders supports a plan to build a $5 billion rail tunnel under the Hudson River that would bring commuters to a new train station at the foot of Macy's on 34th Street. The directors of the Partnership for New York City, concerned about relying on century-old infrastructure for getting their employees to work, decided late last year that the proposed tunnel should be a priority for government financing, said Kathryn S. Wylde, president and chief executive of the partnership. Before that, Ms. Wylde said, the city's business leaders were not convinced that New York needed another hole in the ground. But after hearing from officials of New Jersey Transit as well as the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the partnership changed its priorities for 2005, saying that the tunnel is as critical to the economy of New York as a new transit hub downtown and an extension of the No.7 subway to the Far West Side.

Dropouts in America:
Confronting the Graduation
Rate Crisis
Edited by Gary Orfield
Harvard Education Press,
hardcover/paperback
Review by Karen W. Arenson
 Most Americans take high school graduation for granted. It's college they are less certain about. But ''Dropouts in America'' provides an alarming reminder that roughly half of all black, Latino and American Indian students -- and a third of all students in the United States -- do not graduate from high school in four years.
 Gary Orfield, director of the Civil Rights Project at Harvard and a professor of education and social policy, warns of the consequences: ''Dropping out often leads to economic and social tragedy.'' But the issue has not been high on the civil rights agenda because, he says, the data has not conveyed the urgency of the problem. This volume aims to correct that, by taking an intensive look at different aspects of the question: who is affected, the role of high-stakes testing and approaches to reducing the dropout rate. Some chapters, like one on data collection, are too technical for the lay reader but shed important light on an often-ignored aspect of public policy.
 Daniel J. Losen, a research associate at the Civil Rights Project who contributes a chapter, applauds the inclusion of graduation-rate reporting in the No Child Left Behind law but calls for better monitoring of what actually happens to students. The scrutiny given to test scores has led some schools to push out low-scoring students to improve the look of their graduation rates. 
 In another chapter, Robert Balfanz and Nettie E. Legters of the Center for Social Organization of Schools at Johns Hopkins University discuss ''promoting power'' -- how well a high school fares in promoting students grade to grade. Of about 11,000 high schools with 300 or more students, they found that ''surviving to the senior year is at best a 50-50 proposition'' at nearly 1,000 of the schools -- up from only 530 a decade earlier.
 The weakest schools are concentrated in the South and in cities in the North and West, and most students in them are racial minorities. But the authors also found minority high schools with strong records, thanks to higher spending per pupil.
 The book ends on an optimistic note. James M. McPartland of Johns Hopkins and Will J. Jordan of the CNA Corporation, a nonprofit public policy research organization in Washington, offer solutions, arguing that three components are required to improve graduation rates: innovations in curriculum and instruction that set high standards and give students time and support to meet them, the creation of norms and relationships that are conducive to learning, and systems that give teachers a role in shaping change.

HEADLINE: East Asia -- Constructive Patience With North Korea

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
North Korea is not a country, but a cult. In dealing with a cult, it is not usually very productive, as President Bush has done, to call its Dear Leader ''evil'' and ''a pygmy.'' 
 After four years of ideology and imprecations but no progress in dealing with North Korea, with its comatose economy and its increasingly worrisome nuclear weapons program, many in Asia want the United States to change its approach and start trying to achieve practical results patiently and in small increments -- even if that means being civil to the North's dictator, Kim Jong Il. At the least, they pray that Washington will resist the urge to do anything precipitous that would set off a crisis. 
 Whether by explosion or implosion, any sudden change in North Korea could be calamitous for the region, many Asians believe. For one thing, its nuclear weapons could be used, or could slip into rogue hands. Die-hardism is probably a greater risk in North Korea than it ever was in communist Europe: over six decades of isolation, the population has been drilled relentlessly to worship the Kim family and despise America, Japan and South Korea, the scapegoats for all the country's woes. 
 A collapse of Kim family rule would probably unleash floods of desperate refugees on the country's neighbors. The coast guards of Japan, Russia and South Korea have detailed plans to head off an expected rush of boat people, and China has stationed more troops along its border with North Korea.
 The contrasts across the Demilitarized Zone are stark. In December, Freedom House, which monitors civil and political rights, ranked North Korea among the most repressive countries on the planet, but South Korea among the freest. Average income per person in the South is at least 13 times that in the North. 
 Given these huge differences, most South Koreans want to reunify the peninsula very gradually, over perhaps 50 years, starting with economic ties that they hope will infect the North with creeping capitalism. 
 Many American conservatives would prefer to see the North collapse by next weekend, though they might settle for 2010. A broad coalition of Korean-Americans, Christian and human rights activists, and conservatives in Congress wants to hurry the process along by flooding North Korea this year with cheap portable radios that can receive broadcasts from outside the country, and with prepaid cellular phones that can connect with the Chinese network. 
 News of these plans spurred North Korea's propaganda machine last fall into a fury of hostility. Now, with the North's missiles able to strike Tokyo and its artillery within easy range of Seoul, officials in both capitals want to lower the temperature and revive regional talks that have been stalled for seven months. 
 A positive sign to Asians: Christopher Hill, the American ambassador in Seoul and a moderate, is expected to be the new assistant secretary of state assigned to deal with North Korea. JAMES BROOKE

''From time to time,'' said Michel Barnier, the French foreign minister, ''it can be useful to listen to each other.''
 The comment, made in an interview devoted largely to France's desire to improve ties with the United States, reflects a global preoccupation as President George W. Bush embarks on his second term this week with a new foreign policy team. Countries around the world, whether allies or not, want to be heard -- about terrorism, yes, but also about development, trade, the environment and the weak dollar.
 The first-term view of America as an unrivalled power with a single focus, uninterested in consultation, its perceived arrogance captured by the photographs at Abu Ghraib, will be hard to shake. Still, Mr. Barnier suggested, ''the United States cannot be alone for the next 30 years, confronted by the problems of the world.'' 
 For a moment after Sept. 11, 2001, the war on terror dictated new alliances. Russia and China, among others, found common cause with America in battling militant Islamists. But that season may be ending: Russia is irked by what it sees as American meddling in its back yard, not least Ukraine, and China is complaining about American support for Taiwan and opposition to the lifting of a European embargo on arms sales. 
 America, of course, is not as isolated as the French may believe. Romania's new president, Traian Basescu, rode to victory last month on a platform of close adherence to the line in Washington and London. Romanians loved it. Like others in central and eastern Europe, they still see the United States as a beacon.
 But in the West, America's image is tarnished, and Mr. Bush is widely disliked. From Berlin to Madrid, people want proof that the trans-Atlantic alliance still counts and still involves mutual respect. 
 Mr. Bush is scheduled to visit Brussels next month, a gesture meant to show new sensitivity to Europe's concerns. His mission will not be easy, but the situation in Iraq may focus minds on the need for cooperation. 
 The Middle East is the nexus of the world's expectations from the president. Mr. Bush and his secretary of state-designate, Condoleezza Rice, may ease hostility to America if they are seen to bring fresh energy -- and greater balance -- to their approach to the Palestinian conflict, and if they can find a way to start withdrawing from Iraq this year. 
 The war against Islamic terrorism will inevitably remain a central focus for the United States, one whose urgency pushes all else aside in many Americans' view. How Mr. Bush conducts it, and especially the outcome in Iraq, will probably prove to be pivotal to his legacy.
 But to concentrate on Islamic terrorism to the exclusion of all else would probably hurt the president in the rest of the world. Africa wants greater attention to debt relief and more open trade. Latin America feels neglected and is turning to China as an economic partner. The Dec. 26 tsunami focused attention on poverty, an issue where the world wants more American leadership.
 That is America's lot, the poisoned fruit of its power: The world looks to it for peace, for prosperity, for virtually everything. The burden is an impossible one, and one complicated by all the ambivalence that great power inspires. Even as they look to Washington, countries resent the fact that they are obliged to do so.
 What most of the world wants from Mr. Bush is for American power to be wielded with greater subtlety. Otherwise, the coalitions he has fostered to confront North Korea's nuclear weapons or Iran's nuclear ambitions may prove fragile, potentially leaving him to face an expensive, perilous and lonely new war.
 America's might is unrivalled. The question is how best to use it

HEADLINE: Europe -- Breaking Up Is Hard to Do

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
As Europeans reconcile themselves to another four years of the Bush presidency, there is a growing recognition that the trans-Atlantic alliance, while not sundered, has changed irrevocably.
 The bitter clash over the Iraq war, the open yearning in some European capitals for George W. Bush's defeat at the polls, even America's tolerance of a weaker dollar, which has hurt European exporters -- all attest to a relationship tinged by suspicion and mutual incomprehension.
 For some here, the best remedy is simply to have more realistic expectations of the United States. Europeans, they say, must accept that they are no longer the fulcrum for American foreign and economic policy. 
 ''When you go to Texas, when you go to Florida, you find Europe is no longer the center it once was,'' said Bernard-Henri Levy, the French writer-philosopher, who recently completed a seven-month trip around the United States.
 ''The center of gravity in the United States has completely shifted west, to Asia rather than Europe,'' Mr. Levy said. ''It's not because of American mischief. The map of the world has a different shape.''
 Still, there is much the Atlantic partners can do together, whether it is curbing the nuclear ambitions of Iran, rekindling the Middle East peace process or righting the imbalances in the global economy. Among immediate steps, Europe hopes the Bush administration will curb its trade and budget deficits, which would bolster the dollar and take some pressure off the euro. Europeans, notably Tony Blair of Britain, want the White House to get serious about brokering a deal between Israel and the Palestinians.
 The tumultuous events of the last few years show the complementary strengths of the United States and Europe: America's military might and unswerving political principles; Europe's ability to find multilateral solutions, exemplified by the quiet success of the European Union.
 Realism about the United States does not mean cynicism. Many Europeans who deplore Washington's blunt methods and go-it-alone tendencies still say the United States can recapture its moral leadership.
 ''The most burning priority is to return to the due process of law in the prisons the U.S. established after 9/11,'' said Michael Naumann, editor of the influential German paper Die Zeit. He said that only through a full accounting of the Iraq war, admitting what went wrong, could the United States play a positive role in fostering democracy in the Middle East.
 For Mr. Naumann, who once worked as a book publisher in New York, America's most lasting contribution would be to reclaim its status as a wellspring of the arts. Too many Europeans, he said, view American culture as synonymous with raunchy television like the ''Sex and the City'' series. ''What I wish most from the United States is the next novel from Tom Pynchon,'' he said. MARK LANDLER

HEADLINE: Hail to the Chief! And the City He Lives In

BYLINE: By JENNIFER 8. LEE. 
JENNIFER 8. LEE is a reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:

Why Go Now
 Because this is where the power is. This bluest-of-the-blue city may have given President Bush a paltry 9 percent of its vote, but this week it rolls out the red carpet for his second inaugural. You don't have to be a Republican to appreciate the pomp of the swearing-in on Jan. 20, although hard-core Democrats might want to visit some other week (or wait four years) given the Republican gloating that pervades political circles. 
 Why go? Because the reasons not to have gently receded in recent years, spurred by Mayor Anthony A. Williams's focus on revitalizing downtown Washington. Prostitutes and crack houses have given way to professional couples, quirky boutiques and ethnic fusion restaurants. 

Where to Stay
 In recent years, the city has experienced a miniboom in trendy boutique hotels -- though some residents are still irked by the absence of a W. The Topaz Hotel, 1733 N Street NW, (800) 424-2950, www.topazhotel.com; Hotel Rouge, 1315 16th Street NW, (800) 738-1202, www.rougehotel.com; Hotel Monaco, 700 F Street NW, (800) 649-1202, www.monaco-dc.com; and Hotel Helix, 1430 Rhode Island Avenue NW, (800) 706-1202, www.hotelhelix.com, all offer colorful, idiosyncratic rooms, though they're owned by the same company: Kimpton Hotels. The starting rates also vary: usually $119 to $169, for the inauguration they are $319 to $409, with minimum stays required.
 Washington also has a ready supply of charming historic hotels over an extensive price range, including the luxurious Hay Adams, 1 Lafayette Square, (202) 638-6600, www.hayadams.com, with its close proximity to the White House.. Rooms start at $495 and suites go to $5,800. The St. Regis Hotel, 923 16th Street NW, (202) 638-2626, www.stregis.com/washington, is where Washington's political journalists gather regularly for on-the-record group breakfast discussions with notable politicians. Rooms go for $265 to $495, suites $620 to $3,500. 
 The Tabard Inn, 1739 N Street NW, (202) 785-1277, www.tabardinn.com, is one of Washington's best-kept lodging secrets -- 40 old-fashioned rooms featuring wrought-iron beds that start as low as $86 a night for a single (with a shared bath).
 The Hilton Washington, 1919 Connecticut Avenue NW, (202) 483-3000, www.hilton.com, is referred to as the Hinckley Hilton (to distinguish it from the dozen other Hiltons in the Washington area) for being the site of John Hinckley's assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan in 1981. Its hulking semicircular exterior evokes a Jetsons aesthetic, but its size is what also makes it a favorite for black-tie events, including the annual White House Correspondents Dinner. Rooms start at $130.

Where to Eat
 Where else would Terry McAucliffe, the departing chairman of the Democratic National Committee, buy a drink for Vice President Dick Cheney? The boisterous Cafe Milano, 3251 Prospect Street NW, (202) 333-6183, www.cafemilanodc.com, has fashioned a reputation as the gathering spot for the political elite and visiting celebrities (a reputation due more to slavish service than an inspiring menu). Keep an eye on the four tables along the wall opposite the bar. Their visible and central location at this Euro-trendy Georgetown restaurant makes them a favorite of the status-conscious. Dinner with wine, appetizer and dessert will run about $60 to $80 a person.
 Situated halfway between Capitol Hill and the White House, the swank Signatures, 801 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, (202) 628-5900, www.signatures-dc.com, is a popular draw for lobbyists, Justice Department officials and the staff members of the Republican leadership (especially those working for the majority leader, Tom Delay of Texas). Look for politicos on Tuesday, when the fusion sushi creations (ceviche-style shrimp and papaya, toasted bagel and asparagus) are half price in the bar and lounge. Dinner is typically $50 to $70 a person.
 Unlike most old American cities, Washington has almost no critical mass of ethnic white immigrants to give it a distinct culinary legacy. Ethiopians have filled that gap, opening up restaurants, coffee shops and specialty markets in Adams Morgan and along U Street. Notables include Dukem, 14-18 U Street NW, (202) 667-8735, where Ethiopians eat Ethiopian food, and the more atmospheric Meskerem, 2434 18th Street NW, (202) 462-4100, where non-Ethiopians eat Ethiopian food (dinner at either is $20 to $30 a person).

What to Do During the Day
 If you want to nuzzle beers alongside the young Congressional staff members who are the low-paid workhorses of the democratic process, go to any number of Capitol Hill bars for the early evening happy hours. Almost all feature drink or food specials to attract budget-minded young professionals. The bipartisan Hawk 'n' Dove, 329 Pennsylvania Avenue SE, (202) 543-3300, has cheap domestic beers. The Capitol Lounge, 229 Pennsylvania Avenue SE, (202) 547-2098, has 10-cent wings on Tuesday.
 In a city where taxpayer dollars keep most museums free, a $14 general admission to the International Spy Museum, 800 F Street NW, (202) 393-7798, www.spymuseum.org, stings. But the well-executed (albeit kitschy) presentations are informative, including a special exhibit, ''The Enemy Within: Terror in America -- 1776 to Today,'' which costs $4 extra (or $5 for the exhibit alone). 

What to Do At Night
 For the best chance of spotting a Bush twin in her natural habitat, head toward Smith Point in Georgetown, 1338 Wisconsin Avenue NW, (202) 333-9003, a preppy underground joint down a musty staircase that has made its reputation as a favored hangout for Jenna and Barbara Bush (with the Secret Service in tow). They've also been spotted with friends at the chic and sleek Cafe Asia, 1720 I Street NW, (202) 659-2696, four blocks from the White House.
 The U Street Corridor, historically the spine of African-American culture in Washington, is one of the few points where White Washington meets Black Washington. Familiarize yourself with the faces of up-and-coming Democratic operatives at the faux-Western bar Stetsons, 1610 U Street NW, (202) 667-6295, or the more stylish Local 16, 1602 U Street NW, (202) 265-2828. 
 Having survived the 1968 riots and encroaching gentrification, Ben's Chili Bowl, 1213 U Street NW, (202) 667-0909, www.benschilibowl.com, remains Washington's quintessential place for a late-night bite, attracting corporate lawyers, nonprofit staffers and blue-collar workers. 
 Not far away, the cavernous 930 Club, 815 V Street NW, (202) 265-0930, www.930.com, is the performance space of choice for most headliners that pass through the district, like George Clinton and Chuck Brown. 
 Go-go, the city's indigenous percussion-driven funk music, is something that native Washingtonians embrace as if it were a losing hometown baseball team. To find live go-go performances these days, pick up a copy of Washington City Paper and skim the listings for Experience Unlimited, Rare Essence and Raw Image Band.

Where to Shop
 Kramerbooks at DuPont Circle, 1517 Connecticut Avenue NW, (202) 387-1462, www.kramers.com, is where political operatives can be spotted performing the ''Washington read,'' flipping through a book index to see if they are mentioned. This Washington institution was thrust into the national spotlight when it fought Kenneth Starr's subpoena for Monica Lewinsky's purchasing records. (She reportedly bought ''Vox,'' Nicholson Baker's book on phone sex, for President Clinton there.)
 Politics and Prose, 5015 Connecticut Avenue NW, (202) 364-1919, www.politics-prose.com, in the affluent neighborhoods of Northwest Washington, serves as a literary haven for the city's liberals and is the premier spot for book signings by the likes of Madeleine K. Albright.
 An unapologetically preppy boutique, Sherman Pickey, 1647 Wisconsin Avenue NW, (202) 333-4212, www.shermanpickey.com, exudes Washington's polo-and-seersucker fashion aesthetic. It's one of the few stores where you can pick up Vineyard Vines ties, the pastel patterned neckwear that has transcended the partisan divide (both Democrats and Republicans order custom-made versions for their top fundraisers) and have become a standard way for politicos from the White House to K Street to express their individualism.
 Shops selling vintage couture, designer home furnishings and foreign knick-knacks have given the inverted L along U street (between 14th and 16th) and 14th (between S and U) a hipper atmosphere.

Your First Time or 10th
 C-SPAN conveys little of the energetic buzz of a live Senate vote. Senators stream into the elegant chamber as roll call is called and indicate their yea or nay with hand gestures as subtle as any in a Sotheby's auction. Gallery passes are required and can be obtained from the office of one of your state's senators. Congress is in recess until Jan. 19.

Where to Stay Wired
 The coffee lounge Tryst, 2459 18th Street NW, in Adams Morgan, (202) 232-5500, offers free wireless to its clientele who bring in laptops. With its plush armchairs and warm lighting, Tryst is a favored social forum for Washington singles, not to mention the locale for many Missed Connections postings on the local Craigslist. 

How to Get There
 Washington is served by three airports -- Dulles International, Baltimore-Washington and Reagan National. Amtrak also links Washington to cities up and down the East Coast through Union Station. 

How to Get Around
 On Washington's Metro system (www.wmata.com), a $1.35 fare will get you to most areas of the city (though not directly to Adams Morgan or Georgetown). Taxis work on a tiered zone system, which starts with a base fare of $5.50 in the city center but escalates with each additional zone, each additional passenger and a rush-hour surcharge.

HEADLINE: Health Care's Unlikely Surgeon

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
EVEN in electoral exile, Newt Gingrich has the political power to stir things up with a single provocative remark. Last week, when asked on ''Fox News Sunday'' if he might consider a bid for the White House in 2008, Mr. Gingrich, the former House speaker, replied, ''I'm not ruling that out.'' 
 That set conservative commentators and Web sites buzzing. They noted that his answer came a day before the publication of his new book, ''Winning the Future,'' which offers a presidential-like agenda for big issues like national security and health care. His book tour, they added, will take him through early primary states. ''We'll see if he's running for president,'' said Jeffrey A. Eisenach, a Gingrich protege and a co-founder of the conservative Progress and Freedom Foundation, in an interview. ''It would be exciting.''
 It would also be improbable, given Mr. Gingrich's stormy departure from Congress in 1999, when he resigned as speaker after the loss of Republican seats in the House and a reprimand after an ethics investigation into the use of tax-exempt contributions for political purposes. 
 But public life in America is full of second acts. And Mr. Gingrich, 61, already has one -- as a well-paid broker of ideas and influence in the field of health care policy. He has become probably the most visible spokesman for a set of ideas about health care that is gaining support in the Bush administration and in business. 
 Part of his blueprint is fairly uncontroversial: for example, he wants to modernize the nation's health care system with information technology, bringing patient records and prescriptions out of the realm of ink and paper documents and into the age of computers and instant access. 
 The goal is to reduce medical errors and improve efficiency, saving lives and dollars, and the policy challenge is mainly how to find the right financial and other incentives to encourage doctors, clinics and hospitals to make the shift. On health care technology, Mr. Gingrich has repeatedly worked with liberal Democrats like Representative Patrick J. Kennedy of Rhode Island and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York. 
 But other parts of his prescription for American health care come directly from the conservative playbook. 
 He advocates applying the principles of the ''ownership society'' to medicine, notably health savings accounts and consumer-directed health care. The idea is to give individuals tax breaks to assume the responsibility for paying more of their own medical costs and to rely less on the government and insurers. Market forces, supporters have said, will bring more options, lower prices and higher quality to health care, as they have done for other categories of goods and services.
 Critics fear that such policies risk magnifying the problems of a costly American health care system that now leaves 45 million people uninsured. 
 ''The danger here is that all you're doing is creating incentives for rich, healthy people to break away from poor, sick people,'' said David Cutler, a health economist at Harvard. ''You end up penalizing sick people, making their insurance more expensive and harder to obtain. That may just increase the burden on community hospitals, states and the federal government.'' 
 Mr. Gingrich disagrees, saying he sees a historic opportunity to transform the American health system and make health care policy a conservative issue. Republicans, he said, have traditionally been portrayed as the bad guys who want to curb entitlement spending and thus limit care. So conservatives, he added, have tended to surrender health policy to the Democrats. Mr. Gingrich says the arrangement is beginning to change because of Republicans like President Bush and Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader.
 ''You've never had a politician of the center-right be willing to talk about health for a sustained period of time,'' Mr. Gingrich said. ''That's what we're talking about here -- a center-right model.''
 Base camp for Mr. Gingrich's health policy work is his Center for Health Transformation, a for-profit organization that occupies new office space overlooking K Street, the main street for Washington lobbyists. The center was founded a year and a half ago as an offshoot of the fast-growing health care practice in Mr. Gingrich's consulting firm, the Gingrich Group. 
 The center moved into its new offices a few months ago to accommodate its rapid expansion. Its members, mostly corporations, pay yearly fees of up to $200,000; their number has nearly tripled in the last year, to 65. Most of the center's 10-member staff moved over from the Gingrich Group.
 Mr. Gingrich, by all accounts, is a dervish of activity. Besides health care, his other main focus is security policy. He serves on the Bush administration's Defense Policy Board and on the Commission on National Security in the 21st Century, a bipartisan group conducting a review of security policy. Last year, he delivered 41 paid speeches, collecting up to $50,000 a speech. He travels often and he travels light, working from an ultrathin notebook computer and a cellphone. 
 In his 20 years in Congress, Mr. Gingrich had plenty of experience working on health care issues. He strenuously opposed the Clinton administration's drive for a national health plan, viewing such a proposal as a state-controlled system instead of a market-oriented approach -- ''the American model,'' as he calls it. 
 Today, Mr. Gingrich regards health policy as a pursuit made for someone of his interests and background. 
 He has long been a technology enthusiast. In the early 1980's, he suggested to the Reagan administration that tax credits be offered to households that bought personal computers. Health care is widely seen as in dire need of efficiency-enhancing technology; it is the nation's largest industry, consuming more than 15 percent of the gross national product, and is steeped in politics.
 ''I am very interested in applying science and technology to big issues of national importance, issues with both a moral and a policy dimension,'' Mr. Gingrich explained. ''That's how I operate.''
 A COLLEGE professor turned politician, Mr. Gingrich is by nature a wonk. He delivers speeches that are filled with references to the management guru Peter Drucker, the futurist Alvin Toffler and the late quality-control maven W. Edwards Deming. The talks are also peppered with historical analogies. (He received a Ph.D. in European history from Tulane University.)
 In a speech in late November, Mr. Gingrich told an audience in Washington, ''Health is about 30 times more difficult than national security.'' He seems to relish the complexity, though that does not deter him from a politician's penchant for sound bites.
 Recent speeches and an interview provided some examples. 
 Speaking to technology executives and hospital administrators in October, he offered this rationale to justify investments in health information technology: ''First you save lives, and then you save money. You have to put the moral dimension first.''
 Citing studies that concluded that as many as 100,000 Americans die each year from preventable medical errors, he said at a health conference in November: ''Paper kills. It is immoral for us to keep using paper records.''
 At the same conference, explaining why people would take better care of their health if they had to pay more of their own medical bills, he said: ''No one washes a rental car. We have turned our health care system into a rental car.'' And, discussing the looming health crisis from bad diets and sedentary lifestyles, he said: ''Obesity and diabetes are the first information-age epidemics. We need to treat them as epidemics.''
 Then, in a December interview, after proposing that daily physical education classes be made mandatory from kindergarten through high school, he said: ''So we're going to say to people, 'We're going to pay for your dialysis at age 45, but we'd hate to make you exercise regularly.' What kind of a society is that?''
 Over the years, his ability to grasp complex issues and distill them into simplified messages has been crucial to his success as a policy advocate. The notion of health savings accounts had been circulating in conservative research organizations since the 1980's, but it was not until the Republicans assumed control of Congress in 1994 and Mr. Gingrich became speaker that the proposal received a hearing in Washington. 
 ''Gingrich liked it immediately because he's an idea man,'' recalled John C. Goodman, an economist and a leading proponent of the accounts. 
 Mr. Gingrich backed a provision in a 1996 bill that led to a pilot project for the tax-free accounts. In November 2003, he was brought in to persuade members of the House Republican caucus to set aside their qualms about the high cost of a prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients. His pitch was that a Medicare drug benefit was inevitable and a small price to pay for the Medicare bill's endorsement of health savings accounts -- a decisive step, in Mr. Gingrich's view, toward a more market-oriented health care system. 
 SO far, there has been no rush by companies or individuals to health savings accounts. The accounts allow people to set aside tax-free savings but typically require individuals to pay the first $1,000 of their yearly medical expenses, and families the first $2,000. People have been slow to embrace the accounts because they are new and different, Mr. Gingrich said, but he is certain that the plans will become popular and more varied. ''These are much more radical proposals than people thought at the time,'' he said. 
 Mr. Gingrich is a conservative of a libertarian bent, emphasizing the role of individual choice and responsibility. Health savings accounts appeal to his libertarian sympathies: the higher the deductible, the lower the insurance premiums. Make your choice, take your bet, live with the consequences.
 He also regards information technology as a libertarian force that increases the power of individuals. One of his first initiatives after he became House speaker was to push for a Web site -- called Thomas (thomas.loc.gov), in honor of Thomas Jefferson -- where House and Senate bills, resolutions, committee reports and the Congressional record are available. Suddenly, anyone with a personal computer linked to the Internet had the same access to information that had long been available to Washington insiders and lobbyists. 
 Esther Dyson, an author and technology consultant, advised Mr. Gingrich during the 1990's on the Internet's implications for the economy and public policy. She came away impressed, she said, by his intellect and knowledge of technical subjects. ''He has the ability to get down to first principles, and that leads to thinking that strikes people as radical,'' Ms. Dyson said. ''Health care needs some radical thinking. It needs disruption.''
 Mr. Gingrich's thinking on health has been shaped by first-hand research. Preventive care intrigued him, so in the summer of 1999 he traveled to the Preventive Medicine Research Institute, a nonprofit foundation in Sausalito, Calif., and spent a week in its program. The regimen included a vegan diet of fruit, vegetables, whole grains, beans and lots of soy. There was daily exercise and meditation to reduce stress. ''The third straight day of tofu gets to be a challenge,'' he recalled.
 Asked if he had made changes in his diet and lifestyle, Mr. Gingrich pulled a pedometer off of his belt and said he walks whenever he can, taking lengthy strolls four times a week, usually outdoors but sometimes on a treadmill. 
 He says he has made other changes as well. He eats more vegetables and fish and less meat, and he often substitutes wine for beer. ''This does not mean I've given up Guinness,'' he said. ''I'm not that pure.'' He says that his regimen is not austere but that he has lost 20 pounds since he left Congress six years ago.
 Mr. Gingrich has also been a champion of preventive health care. He introduced the president of the Preventive Medicine Research Institute, Dr. Dean Ornish, to Dr. Mark McClellan, the administrator of Medicare. Later this month, Dr. Ornish will testify at a Medicare hearing on whether to provide coverage for rigorous diet and lifestyle programs for people with heart disease. Dr. Ornish noted that he does not always agree with Mr. Gingrich. ''But Newt is a real visionary on this issue, and he's also a master politician,'' he said. ''That's very valuable for someone like me.''
 Mr. Gingrich's stature, and his connections in Washington at a time when Republicans control the White House and Congress, help explain the growth of his health business. In June 2003, Van R. Johnson, chief executive of Sutter Health, a large nonprofit doctor and hospital group in California, was in Washington to meet with administration officials. Mr. Johnson and members of his board were there to discuss health policy issues, especially programs using information technology to improve the quality of care.
 Over lunch, Cesar V. Conda, then an assistant to Vice President Dick Cheney for domestic policy, asked Mr. Johnson if he knew that Mr. Gingrich was advising the administration on health technology. ''No, I didn't realize he was involved,'' Mr. Johnson recalled replying.
 The White House referral led to a lengthy meeting with Mr. Gingrich in September 2003. Mr. Johnson was impressed, and Sutter joined the Center for Health Transformation. 
 Mr. Conda, now a principal at DC Navigators, a lobbying and public relations firm, recalled that Mr. Gingrich often urged White House officials to make health information technology a national priority. His advocacy was effective, Mr. Conda said. In the State of the Union address last year, President Bush spoke of a need for electronic health records, and last May the president appointed a national health information technology coordinator, Dr. David J. Brailer, though the federal financing of the effort is uncertain.
 ''Everybody around town, from the vice president and Karl Rove to everyone else in Republican circles, they listen to Newt,'' Mr. Conda said. ''He has a lot of influence and impact.''
 The members of the Center for Health Transformation describe it as a hub for networking and fresh ideas, kept in motion by its celebrity boss. ''Newt Gingrich is one of the most active and brilliant guys I've ever met,'' said Mr. Johnson of Sutter. ''He never stops.''
 The center's membership is diverse, spanning a wide range of suppliers, buyers and professional groups. It includes BellSouth, Eli Lilly, NDCHealth, Wellpoint, I.B.M., Siemens, Novo Nordisk, Booz Allen Hamilton, PricewaterhouseCoopers, the Hospital Corporation of America, Mount Sinai Medical Center, the American Diabetes Association and the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill. Members said that Mr. Gingrich could open doors and get things done, and that in his presence a meeting between companies took on the character of a problem-solving policy discussion instead of a business pitch or sales call.
 BellSouth, the regional phone company based in Atlanta, spends $900 million a year on health care for its employees, retirees and their families. Mr. Gingrich stimulated the company's thinking on the benefits of chronic care programs and electronic health records, said to Terry Womack, its vice president for human relations strategy.
 BellSouth is starting a pilot program to help people with diabetes, and it will participate in a project to set up a computerized health network including its workers, doctors, hospitals and insurers in three counties in Georgia. ''Newt Gingrich has been a fundamental catalyst for the direction we're headed,'' Mr. Womack said.
 Mr. Gingrich says his center's two main criteria for policies are the improvement of health-care results and the lowering of costs. ''We have no theology here,'' he said. Yet even many of his center's corporate members have misgivings about his dogmatic belief in free-market health care. ''We have a lot of companies who say, 'We like this strategy of the center, but we hate that one,''' said Nancy Desmond, the center's chief executive, who was chief of staff for Mr. Gingrich when he was in Congress.
 IN Washington, Mr. Gingrich often gets the same reaction. Mr. Kennedy, a son of Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, recalled beginning a speech at a health care conference last year by saying, ''I have never agreed with Newt Gingrich on anything in my life, but we do both agree health information technology should be a national priority.''
 A few days later, Mr. Gingrich came to his office, and Patrick Kennedy found him seated on a couch next to a few trade union officials from Pawtucket, R.I. ''You can imagine my trepidation and the looks on their faces,'' Mr. Kennedy said.
 But the unlikely pair, Mr. Kennedy said, has forged a ''good working relationship.'' Mr. Gingrich spoke at a conference led by Mr. Kennedy at Brown University, and Mr. Gingrich was an adviser on Rhode Island's bid for a $5 million federal grant for a regional health information technology project; the state won the grant last November.
 Mr. Gingrich also gave Mr. Kennedy suggestions on legislation he proposed last year, calling for up to $5 billion in federal grants over the next 10 years to help build community health technology networks. ''The Republicans run the show, so Newt Gingrich has a better handle on how to proceed,'' Mr. Kennedy said.
 But outside of health technology, the two men remain worlds apart on policy. 
 Mr. Gingrich said he had no problem with people taking an a la carte approach to his agenda. ''That's O.K., just take the piece you like,'' he said. ''We'll find other people to support the other things we advocate. If we are going to transform health care, it has to be a big canoe.''

HEADLINE: A Second Term, Seldom a Charm

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The day after he was re-elected in a landslide in 1972, Richard M. Nixon remarked, according to the diary of his chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, that ''most second terms have been disastrous'' and that he was ''determined that his won't be.''
 Characteristically, Nixon's historical analysis was on the mark; his hopes of averting disaster were not. Within weeks, the Watergate scandal had exploded, and barely 18 months into his second term, Nixon resigned to avoid impeachment.
 No outsider knows, as President Bush prepares for his second Inauguration, on Thursday, how much attention he is paying to his predecessors' second-term experiences. But the picture is rather grim. 
 In the last 100 years, said Lewis L. Gould, professor emeritus of history at the University of Texas and author of ''The Modern American Presidency,'' ''there has not been one good second term.''
 Presidents have, of course, had some accomplishments in their second terms.
 Ronald Reagan won a sweeping overhaul of the income tax code, one of the most important economic measures of the last half of the 20th century, and an arms control treaty with the Soviet Union.
 Bill Clinton built a budget surplus and used air strikes to end ethnic violence in Kosovo. 
 But those are the exceptions. By and large, presidents have either exhausted their best ideas in their first terms and had little energy left for their last four years, or they have become overconfident and set goals they were unable to reach. 
 Woodrow Wilson could not persuade the Senate to approve the Versailles Treaty and fulfill his dream of having the United States join the League of Nations. He spent the last year and a half of his presidency crippled politically and debilitated by a stroke.
 Franklin D. Roosevelt failed in his plan to pack the Supreme Court with supporters of his policies, and his effort to purge Congress of anti-New Deal Democrats in the 1938 midterm elections came to naught. 
 Dwight D. Eisenhower misjudged several cold war crises: he was caught unawares by the Soviets' launching of Sputnik, the first space satellite; and he clumsily tried to cover up the purpose of a U-2 spy plane shot down over the Soviet Union. Meantime, his trusted chief of staff, Sherman Adams, had to resign after he accepted gifts including a vicuna coat from a businessman who had tax problems with the government. 
 Nixon was forced out of office.
 Reagan was undermined by the Iran-contra scandal and indictments of administration officials.
 Mr. Clinton was investigated over his campaign finances and impeached for his affair with an intern. He ended his presidency with a series of embarrassing pardons.
 Mr. Bush has one big advantage over most of his predecessors. Except for Roosevelt, he is the only modern president to begin his second term with his party in control of both houses of Congress. 
 It is a safe bet that Sherman Adams's resignation, the Watergate and Iran-contra investigations and the Clinton impeachment would never have occurred if Congress had not been controlled by the opposition party. But protection from scandal does not guarantee a successful term. ''Presidencies are like an hourglass,'' said Stephen Hess, who was a White House aide in Eisenhower's second term and is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''By the second term, the sand is running out.''
 Often, presidents' best ideas are used up in their first terms, and they have few policy goals left over. As lame ducks, their political influence quickly wanes. In their sixth year in office, their party usually loses seats in Congress in the midterm election.
 Mr. Bush hardly lacks new initiatives. ''What's remarkable about this president,'' Mr. Hess said, ''is that his second-term agenda is more creative than his first.''
 Rick Shenkman, a presidential historian at George Mason University, argued that Mr. Bush's ambitious agenda -- democracy in the Middle East, fundamental changes to Social Security and the tax system -- might represent the kind of overreaching that caused other presidents to fail in their second terms.
 Second-term presidents, Mr. Shenkman said, worry that their administrations will be consumed by ennui. ''To fix that,'' he continued, ''they come up with a big, exciting agenda. They think they are masters of the universe.''
 If the Roosevelt presidency had ended after his second term, with his reputation sullied by the court-packing plan, the country still in the throes of the Depression and Pearl Harbor more than a year away, he would not be regarded so highly today.
 Mr. Clinton, on the other hand, had hardly any agenda in his second term. His main goal, it seemed, was to fend off Newt Gingrich. Reagan was the only two-term president since Ulysses S. Grant to leave office and have someone from his own party elected to succeed him. 
 Maybe Mr. Bush can break the pattern. But even if he does not, he can take heart in this: As badly as history has treated presidents in their second terms, it has treated even worse those who lost trying for a second term. Think of Herbert Hoover, Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush.


CORRECTION-DATE: January 30, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article on Jan. 16 about the way presidents fare in their second terms misstated the reason Bill Clinton was impeached. He was accused of perjury and obstruction of justice, not of having an affair with an intern.

HEADLINE: What the Teams Want And What the City Gets

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Just after he was elected, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg told New Yorkers in his first State of the City speech that there was no money in the budget to subsidize two $800 million baseball stadiums for the Yankees and the Mets.
 Three years later, the city faces a $2 billion gap in the coming fiscal year's $47 billion budget. Nonetheless, the mayor and Gov. George E. Pataki are on the verge of approving three new sports sites -- a football stadium for the Jets, a baseball stadium for the Yankees and a basketball arena for the Nets -- that will require a combined public investment of at least $1.1 billion.
 It is not easy to assess precisely what the taxpayers will get out of their investment, which is equivalent in cost to a major Manhattan skyscraper or 25 schools with 600 seats each. In part, that is because the economic benefits are based on studies commissioned by the teams themselves, and promoted by the government sponsors of the projects. 
 Nonetheless, from interviews with public and team officials, it is starting to become clearer how much tax money will be spent on each project, and what city residents are being promised in return.
 The Jets stadium will require a combined public investment of $600 million from the state and city. In exchange, New York will get a football team back from New Jersey, and a West Side stadium with a retractable roof that can be used for games, Olympic events and large conventions.
 The new Yankee Stadium will require a public investment of about $300 million. New York will get a modernized, more comfortable stadium a block north of the existing stadium in the Bronx; more baseball fields and tennis courts for the public; and new garages and transportation stations.
 The Nets arena in Brooklyn will require a public investment of about $200 million and the condemnation of several blocks of housing and stores. New York will get a basketball team back from New Jersey and an arena with a public garden on top that is intended to serve as an anchor for a residential and commercial development. The arena could also be used for high school or college games.
 All three projects would be built on public land and use tax-free bonds for financing. All three are also designed to bypass the city's land use review process and a vote by the City Council, thereby avoiding potentially troublesome public hearings.
 Beyond the physical improvements, the mayor, the governor and the teams themselves assert that the projects will spark new development and generate far more in state and city tax revenues than government will spend. But many independent critics say these indirect benefits are speculative compared with the cost to the taxpayer.
 ''Nationally, many of these projects wound up costing more and delivering fewer public benefits than promised by their proponents,'' said Doug Turetsky, chief of staff for the city's Independent Budget Office.
 Sports economists have long said that stadiums and arenas often enrich teams but are relatively poor public investments.
 ''There's no intrinsic economic benefit from building a sports facility,'' said Andrew Zimbalist, a leading sports economist who teaches at Smith College. ''You have to look at the details of the financing, the facility and the location.''
 Andrew Alper, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said that while each project was different, all had gone through a rigorous analysis by city officials. He said that for every dollar invested by the city in the three projects, taxpayers would get a return of $3.50 to $4.50 over 30 years.
 ''Our goal is to make the minimum government investment that's required to make a project reality,'' Mr. Alper said. ''We have a range of things we look at in terms of analyzing a rate of return.''
 He said the sports deals were more about direct and indirect taxes, jobs, the vibrancy of neighborhoods and parks than how many basketball, football or baseball games are played.
 The Jets are proposing a $1.4 billion stadium that would be used much of the year as an exhibition hall linked to the nearby Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, enabling the city to attract thousands of new visitors to New York. The team is proposing to invest $800 million in the project and to cover any cost overruns, while the state and city would invest $300 million each.
 More recently, the team has also agreed to pay for a concourse on 33rd Street in front of the stadium and half the cost of two pedestrian bridges over the West Side Highway, at an estimated cost of $75 million.
 The city and state contend that they are only paying for infrastructure, specifically the retractable roof ($225 million) and platform ($375 million) on which the stadium would be built. But infrastructure usually refers to public works like roads, sewers or subways, not to two items without which the stadium could not function or attract a Super Bowl, concerts and basketball games, as the Jets propose.
 ''None of the money is for a stadium or an arena,'' said Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation. ''It's for the economic development portion of the project. The Jets stadium is unique in that it gives us a multiuse facility.''
 The Bloomberg administration describes the stadium as a key element in plans to redevelop the Far West Side of Manhattan and its bid for the 2012 Olympics.
 The Jets estimate that in its first year the stadium would generate $30 million more in tax revenues than it would cost the city and the state, with a net gain over 30 years of $716 million. The team estimates that 75 percent of the revenues would come from trade shows, not football games.
 The city's Independent Budget Office, however, did its own study and pared the net gain of the Jets project by two-thirds, to an estimated $200 million. ''It's only a net positive because of the convention center activities,'' Mr. Turetsky said. 
 Betsy Gotbaum, the city's public advocate, and others argue that the true public investment actually exceeds $600 million. The city, for instance, will presumably pay half, about $18 million, toward the cost of the pedestrian bridges and $30 million for the tunnel connecting the stadium and the Javits Center. The Jets say that the $55 million deck over the highway depicted in their stadium renderings is part of the 2012 Olympic budget and not their responsibility.
 The Nets' $430 million Brooklyn arena, in the Long Island Rail Road yard at Atlantic and Flatbush Avenues, is an eye-catching but ultimately modest element of a larger $2.5 billion residential and commercial development next door. The developer Bruce Ratner bought the New Jersey-based team for $300 million last year, intending to use it as a lever to build the arena, 4,500 apartments and 2 million square feet of office space on a 21-acre site in downtown Brooklyn.
 The project has won considerable support in Brooklyn, but some local residents and others object to the state's willingness to condemn land on behalf of a private developer, especially in an area that is finally enjoying a revival. They also say that the level of subsidies outweigh the benefits of the project.
 Mr. Ratner's initial request for $450 million in subsidies and infrastructure work has been whittled down to $200 million to $215 million in negotiations with the city and the state, according to officials involved in the talks.
 A newly revised analysis by Mr. Zimbalist, the sports economist, estimated the net fiscal impact of the entire project at $1.06 billion over 30 years. Proponents argue that the principal benefit is the housing, about half of which would be for middle-, moderate- and low-income tenants. Of course, those apartments would benefit from an as yet undetermined level of tax breaks and other incentives.
 Real estate executives in Brooklyn said that Mr. Ratner was considering a sharp reduction in the amount of office space, and an increase in the number of apartments.
 Sifting out the value of the arena alone is difficult, but based on Mr. Zimbalist's original analysis, it would appear to be a modest $107.5 million over 30 years, after deducting the cost of the public investment.
 ''The arena is an indirect value creator,'' Mr. Alper said. For the developer, he added, ''the economics are really in the commercial space and the housing.''
 Unlike the projects for the Jets and the Nets, there is little if any opposition to plans by the Yankees, which spent much of the 1990's belittling the Bronx and demanding a stadium in Manhattan. The team ultimately found that abandoning the Bronx was politically untenable. 
 The Yankees have told public officials that their offer to pay the entire cost of building a new stadium in the Bronx was motivated, in part, by a recognition that they would have to ''pay most of the freight'' to get the project done under the Bloomberg administration. 
 New rules in Major League Baseball allow the team to deduct much of the cost of construction from the revenues that the Yankees are required to share with other teams.
 The Yankees have agreed to pay the estimated $800 million cost of a new 50,000-seat open-air stadium in Macombs Dam Park, across 161st Street from the current stadium, which was built in 1923 and refurbished in the 1970's, according to state and city officials. The team, which does not expect to pay rent for the land, has asked the city and state for about $300 million in ''infrastructure work,'' including about $160 million for new garages, a ferry terminal on the Harlem River, a Metro-North train station and 16.7 acres of new parkland to replace Macombs Dam Park. 
 As part of the deal, the city would create a park along the Harlem River, south of Macombs Dam Bridge, with Little League ball fields and a softball field. There would also be basketball courts, with tennis courts and possibly a soccer field atop the garages.
 The Yankees project dovetails with efforts by the Bloomberg administration and Bronx Borough President Adolfo Carrion to rejuvenate the surrounding neighborhood. There are plans to turn the dilapidated Bronx Terminal Market into a major retail center, with a waterfront park. Mr. Carrion wants to preserve most of the existing stadium and build a hotel, conference center and Yankee museum and sports-related high school in the area.

HEADLINE: Breaking The Code

BYLINE: By Nicholas Confessore. 
Nicholas Confessore, a former editor at The Washington Monthly, is a reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
One afternoon late last month, I paid a visit to the offices of Americans for Tax Reform, the conservative lobbying outfit headed by Grover Norquist. Though Norquist ranks among the Republican Party's leading operators, neither he nor his organization is quite yet a household name. Outside the Beltway, he is known mainly, if at all, for the cheerfully visceral quotations that regularly appear next to his name in newspaper articles. (Shortly after the G.O.P.'s Election Day victory, Norquist mused to The Washington Post that the city might become less bitter and fractious now that the Democrats had been more or less neutered. ''Certain animals run around and are unpleasant,'' he noted, ''but when they've been fixed, then they are happy and sedate.'') Inside the Beltway, however, Norquist has made his mark as a political organizer. Each Wednesday morning, more than a hundred leading conservative activists, policy pundits, talk-show producers and journalists, joined by assorted Hill staff members and White House aides, gather in Americans for Tax Reform's conference room to discuss the issues of the day, from prescription drugs to school choice. Within Republican circles, Norquist's job is to organize other organizations, making sure the different branches of conservatism are moving in the same direction, at the same time, to the greatest extent possible. His particular genius is for persuading one organization to reach beyond its own agenda to help out another -- for getting, say, the cultural traditionalists at the Eagle Forum to join the business libertarians at the Competitive Enterprise Institute in opposing fuel-economy standards for automobiles by convincing the traditionalists that, as Norquist once explained to me, ''it's backdoor family planning. 
You can't have nine kids in the little teeny cars. And what are you going to do when you go on a family vacation?''
 Taxes, though, are Norquist's first passion. A.T.R. was formed 20 years ago, at the Reagan administration's behest, to rally grass-roots conservative support for an ambitious bipartisan effort to reform the federal tax code, which would culminate in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Norquist, then a 29-year-old Reagan acolyte and former speechwriter at the United States Chamber of Commerce, was brought on board as the group's executive director. He soon discovered that many conservatives were deeply skeptical of the legislation, which proposed to slice reams of special-interest tax credits, breaks and shelters out of the tax code in exchange for lower marginal rates across the board. They were attracted to the idea of more tax cuts, but suspected that they might later be double-crossed. ''They said, 'We're going to get rid of these credits and deductions, we're going to broaden the base and then they're going to come back and raise the rates again, and we won't even have the deductions and credits anymore,''' Norquist recalled, sitting behind a massive desk, with a county-by-county map of the 2004 election results -- a blur of Republican red -- hanging nearby. ''At which point, I said, 'Well, what if we made it difficult for them to raise rates?'''
 Thus was born the Pledge. This was a promise, first circulated by Norquist in 1985 and originally signed by more than 100 members of Congress, never to vote to raise tax rates. The Pledge helped deliver enough conservative votes to pass tax reform, but not enough to prevent future backsliding. Four years later, President George H.W. Bush, who had famously promised voters that there would be ''no new taxes'' on his watch, changed his mind. Faced with a swelling federal deficit, he proposed a budget deal that raised taxes overall and even added a new bracket for high-income earners, and he urged Republican members to support it in the name of paying down the debt. 
 Bush's betrayal -- a seminal moment in Republican politics, and one that reverberates still -- is immortalized in an enormous framed reproduction of an Oct. 2, 1990, Wall Street Journal editorial, occupying most of one wall near the entrance to A.T.R.'s office suite. Titled ''Honor Thy Pledge,'' the editorial listed the names of Republicans who took Norquist's oath and urged swift retribution on anyone who ended up voting with the president. More than 30 eventually did, providing the crucial margin for Bush's tax hikes. But the editorial isn't hanging there to commemorate failure: 1990 was the last year any G.O.P. politician at the national level voted for any income-tax increase, period. ''Had Bush broken his pledge and gotten re-elected, it would have made the Pledge much less valuable, maybe completely worthless,'' Norquist told me. ''But because the most famous pledge-taker-slash-pledge-breaker lost re-election, on that subject, it's had an effect.''
 In the years since Bush's defeat, Norquist's way of thinking about taxes -- that they should be cut whenever and wherever possible -- has become the central tenet of American conservatism. Currently, the Pledge has been signed by 222 members of the House and 46 Senators, which includes pretty much every Republican in both chambers. It has also been signed by Bush's son President George W. Bush, who has not only kept his pledge but also made cutting taxes the signal domestic accomplishment of his first term. Taxes are likely to be at the heart of Bush's second-term agenda, too: not long after Election Day, Bush announced that the tax code had become ''complicated and outdated'' and ''a drag on our economy'' and that it was time, once again, for tax reform. Earlier this year, Bush named members to a bipartisan commission to get the ball rolling. ''All options,'' a Treasury Department official warned, ''are on the table.'' Boilerplate as they may sound, those kinds of words can set Washington aflame like little else. Just as in 1986, the call for tax reform puts at risk hundreds of special provisions, affecting nearly every organized interest in town, from insurance companies to charities, from Wall Street banks to forklift manufacturers, from the biggest state in the union on down to little municipalities putting out tax-free bonds. 
 But the pressures Norquist and his allies have brought to bear on American politics over the last two decades make it unlikely that Bush's attempt at tax reform will much resemble the 1986 version. During the latter half of the 20th century, most Democrats and Republicans accepted -- at least in theory -- the notion that taxation should be as broad-based as possible; no one swathe of the public, and no one sector of the economy, should absorb too much of the cost of government, both because it was unfair and because it was inefficient. The 1986 act brought the federal tax code closer to that vision by cutting loopholes and, as a consequence, expanding the pool of taxpayers. But Republicans today have something else in mind. By their lights, the old consensus is not only outdated, but egregiously so, even offensively so. Bush's call for reform gives them a chance to replace it with something else. 
 And in many respects, the replacement is already well under way. After four rounds of largely Republican-inspired tax legislation, today's code is a profoundly different instrument than the one that existed when Bush first took office. And though the White House has never publicly laid out a common rationale for its policies, Bush's changes -- which have cut income taxes on high earners, reduced rates on capital gains and dividend income, temporarily eliminated the estate tax and allowed businesses to write off the cost of new capital purchases more quickly -- depart drastically from the old model of reform. Bush's cuts have greatly reduced the costs formerly borne by corporations and the wealthy, leaving the tax code considerably less progressive than it once was. Instead of getting rid of loopholes so that fewer businesses escape paying taxes, conservatives have essentially set out to universalize those loopholes, aiming for a day when corporations won't have to pay taxes at all. (According to a recent report from the Center for Tax Justice, a liberal watchdog group, 82 of America's largest corporations paid no income tax in one or more years of Bush's first term.) Bush's tax reform, in other words, is shaping up to be not merely a departure from the spirit of the 1986 reform -- but a wholesale repudiation of it.
Though the end result was far from foreordained, the basic outlines of what would become the Tax Reform Act of 1986 began bubbling up on both sides of the aisle a couple of years into Reagan's first term. Liberal Democrats had long favored dumping corporate deductions and tax shelters for the wealthy; Republican supply-siders -- the architects of Reagan's large 1981 tax reduction -- were looking to push new cuts through Congress but needed to assuage deficit hawks in both parties who were concerned about the rising budget shortfall. Some of Reagan's political advisers had become concerned that loopholes for the wealthy might become a Democratic campaign issue in '84, while others had come to believe that narrow tax breaks weren't a very effective way to encourage growth in particular industries. Economists of all stripes agreed that the code had become so complicated by loopholes that it was sucking up potential growth. ''Pre-1986, you could get a tax reduction for investing in tobacco farms and bull sperm and windmills and things like that,'' notes Stephen Moore, then a budget expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation and now a senior fellow at the Cato Institute. ''The tax code looked like a piece of Swiss cheese.''
 But that wasn't an accident. During the 70's and early 80's, the Beltway lobbying industry, known colloquially as ''K Street'' after the downtown avenue populated by trade associations and corporate offices, metastasized into the Fifth Estate of American politics. Over the years, these lobbyists spent millions of dollars to persuade members of Congress to carve this or that break into the tax code, breaks that benefited thousands of well-connected companies and individuals. And they were a powerful force against reform. As the reporters Jeffrey H. Birnbaum and Alan Murray explained in their definitive 1987 account, ''Showdown at Gucci Gulch,'' ''the groups with an interest in the existing tax system were well organized and ready to defend their breaks at a moment's notice; the populace who stood to benefit from lower rates was unorganized and diffuse.'' In 1985, the year tax reform began to be seriously considered in Washington, corporate PAC's substantially increased the amount of money they pumped into House and Senate coffers -- cash that exerted a powerful effect on rank-and-file members of Congress. Only by working in concert, from a shared sense of what reform should look like, could Democratic and Republican tax reformers keep a deal from being scuttled.
 In policy terms, that required the '86 effort to be a compromise between two groups that had vastly different visions of what an ideal tax system would look like. Ultimately, each side achieved some of its goals: liberal reformists got more corporations and high earners back on the books, while conservatives got lower marginal tax rates. ''Any time you change the tax code, it's obviously going to be controversial,'' says Ronald Pearlman, a Georgetown University law professor who helped create the Reagan administration's initial package of reform proposals. ''And it's nice to be able to say you've got bipartisan support for big, gutsy changes.''
The last four years in Washington have upended most of the political realities that fostered the bipartisan results of 1986. The most visible change is that Washington is no longer a functionally bipartisan town. Three successive electoral defeats have rendered the Democrats, once Washington's entrenched ruling class, a beleaguered opposition party. Significantly, Republicans have not only widened their hold on power but also tightened it. In the 10 years since the G.O.P. takeover of Congress, the House, in particular, has become progressively more centralized and top down than it was during the era of Democratic control. Important legislation tends to emerge from the leadership offices and be put to up-or-down votes; rank-and-file Republicans play a diminished role in policy making, and the Democrats next to no role at all. In November, Representative J. Dennis Hastert, the House speaker, announced that he wouldn't allow votes on any bills that lacked majority support among the Republican caucus, whether or not measures enjoyed majority support among the country's elected representatives as a whole.
 As Bush's second term takes shape, the G.O.P. has little incentive to broker compromises, and by all appearances, not much interest either. That means that to a degree unimagined in the 80's, tax reform under Bush can be a discussion within the Republican Party, among people who share a basic sense of how the tax code needs to change. The various constituent parts of the conservative coalition, of course, have multiple stakes in the broader agenda of tax cutting. Large industrial concerns might be most interested in lowering the tax bill on purchases of equipment; rich party donors would like to see the top marginal tax rates reduced; and social conservatives have rallied around calls for permanently eliminating the so-called marriage penalty. The key visionaries of conservative-style tax reform, however, are a vanguard of anti-tax activists, conservative economists and a handful of Republican politicians who have made taxes their pet issue. Like all conservatives, they think that the government is too big and that taxes ought to be lower and flatter. But This group has also come to share a few articles of faith about the relationship between taxes and growth. One is that for years the American economy has been enormously handicapped by excessive taxation on savings and investment; because people and businesses are discouraged from saving, the theory goes, there is a pervasive shortage of capital for future investments. Another belief is that lifting those burdens would create a permanent increase in most Americans' standards of living. Still another belief is that cutting all those taxes won't worsen the deficit, because the growth the cuts will unleash would produce more than enough income -- and, therefore, tax revenue -- to make up the difference. 
 Most economists typically find this line of argument questionable. (When rates on savings and investments were cut back beginning in the 70's, they note, the savings rate actually went down, indicating that people's propensity to save probably isn't greatly affected by changes in marginal tax rates.) So Bush's proposals are unlikely to win the kind of expert consensus that the 1986 one did. But if the administration can count on much more resistance to its vision from professional economists, it can count on far less from the constituency that was once the most formidable obstacle to fundamental reform of the tax code: K Street. In part, this is a consequence of the broader power shift in Washington. When the parties shared power, business lobbyists could bid Democrats and Republicans against one another. (Reagan's 1981 tax cut became a deficit exploder in part because Congressional Democrats, eager to win back business support following the disastrous 1980 election, were competing against their Republican counterparts to see who could open more corporate loopholes in the tax code.) With Democrats more or less out of the picture, lobbyists must rely far more heavily on the G.O.P. to look after its interests -- and that gives Republican leaders more leverage over K Street than vice versa.
 Thanks to this arrangement, Bush's first three tax bills were fairly ''clean'' ones, containing relatively few special-interest breaks narrowly benefiting a given industry or corporation. That doesn't mean K Street hasn't done well under Republican rule. Bush's fourth tax cut -- a bill originally intended to fix an existing tax provision deemed illegal by the World Trade Association and passed with little public notice shortly before Election Day -- was packed with billions of dollars worth of corporate giveaways, most of it to the manufacturing sector. But it does mean that the party can compel business interests to delay narrow gratification -- special-interest loopholes that arouse public ire and inspire a political response -- in support of a broader and more ambitious ideological agenda that will pay dividends down the line. ''As long as we have the annual tax cut, all the business guys are in line,'' Norquist explained to me, noting that business trade associations like the National Association of Manufacturers helped lobby for Bush's 2001 cut, even though it did nothing to reduce corporate rates. Norquist described his pitch to K Street this way: ''This year, we're doing a tax cut. You want to help us with this year, you're at the front of the line for next. You didn't get in this year, you can get in line for next year. But we're going to be doing a tax cut, however small, because we can go as small as we have to to get a tax cut every year. That is what we did for the last four years. That is what we are going to do for the next four years.''
 Just as important as the sequencing of Bush's tax cuts has been the substance of them, which provides a hint of where tax reform is likely to go. In theoretical terms, Bush's cuts have brought the United States tax code closer to a system under which income from savings and investments aren't taxed at all and revenues would be raised exclusively from taxes on labor. The consequence of those policies is that a greater proportion of tax revenues now come from what the middle class earns and a smaller proportion from what the wealthy earn. Whatever changes the Bush administration pursues, there is every reason to believe it will aim to move further in that direction. ''I think Bush does have a master plan on tax policy,'' Stephen Moore says. ''The goal is to eliminate all taxes on savings and investment. That means no capital-gains tax, no dividends tax, no estate tax, no tax on interest.'' 
How you view this arrangement depends a lot on whether you buy the assumption that letting the wealthy off the hook will eventually benefit everyone else. Early one recent Saturday morning, I paid a visit to John Podesta, the last chief of staff to serve under Clinton, at his home in Washington. He greeted me at the door in sweat pants and a T-shirt, and we sat down at his kitchen table to talk taxes. Podesta has a lean, shrewd face, a twinkle in his eye and a reputation as one of the party's canniest operatives; these days, he heads the Center for American Progress, which he founded a little more than a year ago to incubate new policies and approaches among left-of-center types.
 Podesta has little faith in the conservatives' trickle-down approach. He also says it is bad economic policy -- ''fatally flawed,'' as he put it. ''We're already seeing the current account deficit increase by $600 billion a year,'' he continued. ''People are mortgaged to the hilt. The middle class is now being fundamentally squeezed. They've gotten no benefit from the tax reduction. G.D.P. growth is going almost all to corporate profits. And we're creating an overall economic circumstance in which the dollar is certain to drop, interest rates are certain to rise and growth over the long term looks kind of sketchy.'' 
 To understand why the G.O.P. has pursued such a policy, Podesta argues, you have to look at the political dividends, not the economic ones. ''What are the structural elements of what they are trying to do with the tax code?'' he began, busying himself at a small coffee machine. ''I would say there are three. One is to eliminate taxation on wealth and investment. Second is to create a revenue stream that aims at a government the size of which we haven't seen almost since before the Depression.'' Already, he points out, the government takes in far less than it spends, forcing the Bush administration to borrow billions of dollars to cover the revenue lost from cutting taxes. ''Three is that if you build in taxation only on wage income, you have massive resistance by the middle class to letting those taxes rise. So you've kind of locked in three structural components that end up being highly beneficial to wealthy people, and I think, from a conservative governance point of view, create not just restraint on the growth of government, but essentially pressure to downsize the government.''
 Podesta's analysis suggests that conservative tax reformers are in something of a bind: telling middle-class voters you want them to pay for more of the government so that they will want to shrink it is not a very good way to win their votes. Conservatives insist, however, that their plans not only won't deepen the deficit; they won't increase the load on the middle class either. Not long ago, I spoke with South Carolina's new Republican senator, James DeMint, who over the past few years made a name for himself on tax issues in the House. DeMint's campaign Web site included pictures of him standing next to a tall stack of I.R.S. regulations and displayed statistics like the number of pages in the tax code (45,622) and the number of hours Americans spend each year filling out tax returns (6.1 billion), sure to ruffle taxpayers' feathers. Like many conservatives, he says that the middle class is already paying for most of the government -- they just haven't figured it out yet. ''People don't understand the cost of government,'' he told me. 
 DeMint says he believes that taxes paid by corporations and wealthy investors tend to end up costing middle- and working-class people money, in the form of higher prices at the cash register or the lost jobs that result when rich people have to pay the estate tax instead of investing in, say, steel factories. Taxes on capital, from this point of view, are inevitably self-defeating: they are simply passed along to the rest of us, along with the accountant's bill. But because average workers pay less in ''visible'' taxes than corporations and the rich, they tend to think they're getting a good deal out of the federal government. ''They're paying a disproportionate share of their income in taxes, and they don't know it,'' DeMint said. ''So, politically, they're not activated to change it, because they can't see the taxes. They don't have that sense of urgency.''
 DeMint advocates scrapping the entire tax code, including income taxes and taxes on wealth, and replacing it with a flat national sales tax. By his reasoning, that would convert all the hidden taxes embedded in the price of goods and services into one tax that is printed at the bottom of a cash-register receipt. Middle-class people wouldn't pay any more in federal taxes than they're effectively paying now, and they would end up economic winners, since the simpler tax system that resulted would be less of a drag on the economy. And once people were paying all their taxes up front, and could see how expensive the government really was, they would be much more inclined to demand huge cuts in spending than they are today. ''The intent here is not to shift the tax burden to the poor,'' he said, ''but to allow every American to see the real cost of government.'' Left unsaid, of course, is the alternative: if middle-class taxpayers wanted to keep the same size government that exists today, they would have to pay for it up front. 
 But if you don't share conservatives' assumption that the middle class ends up footing the bill for onerous taxes on capital, a new flat sales tax would -- as Bush's previous cuts already do -- simply shift even more of the burden of taxation from businesses and the wealthy over to the middle and working classes. ''Any responsible person advocating tax reform has to admit the following: A reform that is revenue-neutral has losers,'' said Gene Sperling, a leading Democratic budget expert who served as a top economic adviser for John Kerry during the 2004 presidential campaign. ''There's a basic math to that. Every Republican flat-tax proposal lowers the rate on people at the top. Now, if you're raising less revenue from the most well-off, one of two things are going to happen. You're either going to raise more revenue from the middle class, or you're going to pass on more debt to our children. The only argument against that is supply-side magic -- that somehow, lowering taxes will generate more revenue so there's a free lunch for everyone.''
 When I noted that Republicans seem much more energetic about tax reform than Democrats, Sperling got a little exasperated. ''It's not that Republicans are so much more noble,'' he said. ''The usual dialogue that happens on tax reform is, people love the idea of reducing deductions and lowering rates in theory. When they get to the specifics, they realize that they have to get rid of very popular deductions that people know well for the possible benefits of a system they don't know.'' For example, proposals for replacing the income tax with a tax on consumed income -- that is, the income people use to buy things -- have circulated among left-of-center tax experts for years. DeMint's sales tax is one version of a consumption tax. But, Sperling argues, it's a lot harder to design a version that is actually revenue-neutral, progressive in structure and politically viable: ''First, you're getting rid of popular breaks like the mortgage deduction, and second, by the time time you've finished exempting food, clothing and so forth, the new tax has gotten pretty high.'' And unlike Republicans, he maintains, Democrats aren't willing to pretend that there can be tax reform without any losers. (Later this month, Podesta's policy institute will release a detailed plan that eliminates loopholes, cuts taxes on the middle class and creates more savings incentives for those without much wealth income -- but finances it mostly by reversing Bush's rate cuts on the rich, who, of course, would be the losers should Podesta's plan come to pass.)
So what will Bush propose? The president did cause a minor stir during the campaign in the summer when he mentioned that a national sales tax was ''the kind of interesting idea that we ought to explore seriously.'' But he has since retreated into anodyne rhetoric about simplifying the code and promoting savings and investment. 
 In part that's because a sales tax is indeed controversial; DeMint's Democratic opponent temporarily erased a double-digit deficit in the polls by hammering him on the sales tax, though DeMint did win in the end. But it is also because, while Republicans generally know what direction they want to move in, they don't agree on exactly how to get there. DeMint's is only one of several Republican tax-reform plans that have percolated through Washington in recent years. There are other sales-tax proposals, plus plans that put a flat tax on all forms of income or institute a European-style value-added tax (V.A.T.), basically a sales tax levied at each stage of production.
 In theory, the members of Bush's tax commission are supposed to approach their efforts with an open mind. In practice, its purpose is to test the political waters, to see which version of conservative tax reform would be most palatable to the public and how far it can be pushed. ''It'll come out with three or four proposals, which are already written, and already on people's desks,'' Grover Norquist told me. ''So this is not a commission to invent something, or several somethings. This is a commission to discuss several somethings. Poke 'em, bring 'em around the country, test-fly them, run 'em up the flagpole, see who shoots at it, see who salutes.'' Norquist argues that much as Bush's 2001 Social Security commission helped detoxify the argument over whether to privatize that program, the tax commission will make it safer to propose new ideas, even radical ones. Given the ultimate end goals of conservative tax reformers, this is no small concern: as a confidential 2002 memo prepared by the Treasury Department notes: ''Any reform is likely to have vocal losers and largely silent winners. In other countries, the adoption of a consumption tax has led to election losses for the incumbent party.''
 For now, the Bush administration appears to be heeding that warning. After floating a few provocative ideas in the press last year -- eliminating the deductions for mortgages and state and local taxes, benefits enjoyed disproportionately by ordinary workers and families -- White House officials signaled that they were more likely to pursue the kind of incremental changes Bush has already shown a taste for when debate commences in earnest. ''We don't have to decide whether we want a flat tax, or a V.A.T. or a retail sales tax,'' Norquist said. ''Because there are a dozen things you have to do that would get you to the point which would get you to one of those three.'' 
 But as Bush's first four years have made clear, incremental doesn't equal inconsequential. During his first term, the president floated the idea of large tax-free savings accounts, sort of like supersize I.R.A.'s, in which people who already have lots of money to save -- that is, high earners -- could shelter large amounts of income. Add in further cuts in taxes on capital gains and dividends, elimination of the estate tax and a move to make Bush's earlier income-tax reductions permanent, and even without big all-at-once tax reform, conservatives will come pretty close to legislating a new contract between the government and its citizens, one that has the power to change politics profoundly. 
 ''Here's the danger,'' Norquist said. ''They'll say, 'Let's wait for tax reform,' which will be this sort of angels-dancing-on-the-head-of-a-pin argument. That may never be real. There may never be something that everyone agrees is tax reform. What was it -- Zeno's paradox, where you never quite get where you're going?
 ''You keep taking half-steps, eventually you're pretty darn close,'' he went on to say. ''I'll take three half-steps and call it a day.''

HEADLINE: Bush to Return to 'Ownership Society' Theme in Push for Social Security Changes

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 15 

 BODY:
The unifying theme on domestic policy in President Bush's Inaugural Address on Thursday will be the president's vision of an ''ownership society'' as he tries to galvanize support for fundamental changes he wants in Social Security, tax policy and other areas, administration officials say.
 ''When people have a stake in something,'' Treasury Secretary John W. Snow said in an interview on Friday, explaining the president's rationale, ''it makes the whole social system work better.''
 ''The president,'' Mr. Snow added, ''wants to pursue policies that encourage ownership.''
 The boldest example of this approach is the intensifying campaign by the Bush administration to radically alter Social Security, the most popular and expensive government program ever, so that workers can put a portion of their payroll taxes into their own investment accounts. 
 But the ownership society encompasses other initiatives as well, including those that make temporary tax cuts permanent, minimize taxes on income from investments, revamp workers' health insurance and encourage low-income people to own their homes.
 The intent is to change Americans' relationship with the government to allow (or, critics say, to force) people to look less to Washington and to take more responsibility for their finances and their retirement.
 Politicians and economists disagree on whether Mr. Bush's proposals would actually accomplish this. 
 In a speech on Thursday at Catholic University here, Vice President Dick Cheney offered what may turn out to be a preview of this portion of the president's Inaugural Address. He said: ''One of the great goals of our administration is to help more Americans find the opportunity to own a home, a small business, a health care plan or a retirement plan. In all of these areas, ownership is a path to greater opportunity, more freedom and more control over your own life, and this is a goal worthy of a great nation. Everyone deserves a chance to live the American dream, to build up savings and wealth and to have a nest egg for retirement that no one can ever take away.''
 Grover Norquist, an influential conservative tactician, said the ownership society could solidify the Republican Party just as Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal and Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society were the foundation of a Democratic Party majority for generations.
 ''If this is successful, this will define the Bush administration for the next 100 years,'' Mr. Norquist said. ''People who are more independent and don't feel dependent on the government are more likely to be available to the Republican Party.''
 Mr. Bush's political opponents say the ownership society is simply one more effort by the president to take government benefits away from the needy and put more money in the pockets of the well-to-do.
 ''It's an appealing label,'' said Robert D. Reischauer, an economist who directed the Congressional Budget Office when Democrats controlled Congress and is now president of the Urban Institute, a research center. ''But with ownership comes responsibility and risk, and that's the down side. We buy insurance and collectivize pension benefits and health care to reduce the risk.''
 Robert B. Reich, who was secretary of labor in the Clinton administration, said he worried that ''people will, through bad luck or poor decision-making, find themselves in dire straits.''
 ''The whole purpose of social insurance,'' he continued, ''is so you won't find yourself in old age without any assets or find yourself poor and sick and without access to health care.'' 
 Others question whether most Americans have the ability or the inclination to make complicated financial decisions involving their retirement and their health care.
 In their book ''Coming Up Short,'' Alicia H. Munnell and Annika Sunden, economists at Boston College, examined the record of 401(k) plans, the retirement accounts in which workers control their investments and employers often contribute money. Only 25 percent of eligible workers participate in the plans, they found, and 9 of 10 invest less than the maximum, even when that means they are forgoing contributions from their employers. About 60 percent have dangerously undiversified portfolios, and most cash out their accumulations when they change jobs, rather than saving the money for retirement.
 ''With 401(k)'s, we've had an experiment in handing over to families the responsibility of saving and planning for retirement, and what we have found is that they make mistakes at each step along the way,'' Ms. Munnell, an economic policy official in the Clinton administration, said in an interview.
 ''It's not because they're stupid,'' she added. ''It's because people live very busy, very complicated lives. They're working. They're getting their kids educated. They really do not have time to become financial experts.''
 Mr. Snow said he thought such views were unnecessarily paternalistic. ''I think choice is a good thing,'' he said.
 In a speech this month to the American Economic Association, Martin Feldstein, a Harvard economics professor and Bush supporter, made the economic argument for reducing the influence of the government in people's lives. 
 ''Existing programs,'' he said, ''have substantial undesirable effects on incentives and therefore on economic performance. Unemployment insurance programs raise unemployment. Retirement pensions induce earlier retirement and depress saving. And health insurance programs increase medical costs.''
 This underscores a fundamental difference between the Republican and Democratic philosophies. 
 Republicans mostly believe that the role of government is to foster greater individual economic achievement, even if it leads to more economic inequality. The Democratic philosophy is that the government should provide a safety net, even if it leads to economic inefficiency.
 In the case of Social Security, Mr. Snow suggested that it would be weeks, if not months, before the details of the proposal were revealed. First, he said, the administration was concentrating on persuading Americans that basic changes were needed in the program.
 But when those details are known, experts on Social Security say, they may not include as much private ownership as officials have suggested when they are advocating the principles.
 If workers are allowed to invest $1,000 a year in the private accounts, the most allowed under many plans, the accounts would accumulate only about $140,000 after a 44-year working life, a nice sum, perhaps, but hardly a fortune.
 The types of investments permitted are sure to be strictly limited. Workers will probably not be able to withdraw the money before retirement, even if they are having financial difficulties. And when they retire, they will almost certainly be required to buy a financial instrument called an annuity, which will pay them a few hundred dollars a month for the rest of their lives but which they cannot leave to their heirs.
 On taxes, Mr. Bush is likely in his speech on Thursday to call for making the tax code fairer and simpler and for making permanent the tax cuts enacted in his first term, which will expire before the end of the decade. Those measures, which the administration says would contribute to ownership by giving the government less of people's money, are not expected to be acted on this year.
 For this year, the president is pressing for two tax-protected savings accounts. One, meant to generate retirement savings, would allow individuals to contribute $7,500 a year and withdraw the money tax-free after they turn 58. The other would also allow a $7,500 annual contribution and would permit the money to be withdrawn tax-free for any purpose at any time.
 Since few people are able to invest more than $15,000 a year, these accounts would mean that for most, investment income would go completely untaxed.
 In the case of health insurance, the administration is promoting an arrangement called health savings accounts that were authorized by the 2003 Medicare law. Under the arrangement, employers buy health insurance for their workers with a high deductible. Sometimes workers have to pay as much as $5,000 a year for medical care before the insurance kicks in. But theoretically some of the money the employer had been paying for more expensive health insurance with lower deductibles is placed into the workers' health savings account, and it accumulates tax-free if it is not withdrawn.
 The notion is that these plans will lower health costs because workers will assume the responsibility of shopping for alternative or less expensive treatment. Critics say it would lead sick people to forgo needed treatment.
 So far, neither employers nor workers have been enthusiastic about participating in the program, and only a few are doing so. It has been impossible to prove whether these accounts lower costs and whether the workers are satisfied with their ownership.

HEADLINE: Russia -- You Go Your Way, And Let Us Go Ours

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
What Russia wants from the United States, increasingly, is less and less.
 A much-touted ''dialogue'' on oil and gas that only two years ago was supposed to open the spigot to American consumers has languished instead, as Russia has turned to markets in China, Japan and India.
 President Vladimir V. Putin's handling of the prosecution of Yukos Oil, once the country's largest, most-Western-oriented producer, has exposed what can only be considered his indifference to American opinion on matters of transparency and the rule of law. 
 Even in the war on terror, one area where Mr. Putin and President Bush have found common ground, the scope for cooperation appears to be shrinking, in large part because of concerns about American involvement within what Russia regards as its historical sphere of influence.
 Russia, for example, has withdrawn its support for an observation mission on its dangerous southern border with Georgia. The mission, run by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe with American help, has been credited with curbing the movements of Chechen separatists. But in New York last Thursday, Russia's Minister of Defense, Sergei B. Ivanov, said the presence of American forces in Georgia and in Central Asia was ''a very sensitive issue for us.'' Russia has countered with a military buildup of its own in the region.
 Not too long ago, Russia seemed to value American respect. Mr. Putin is a proud leader of a proud nation that still considers itself a balance, if not a rival, to the world's only superpower. 
 But judging by his brusque public remarks recently in response to a Houston bankruptcy court's actions in the Yukos case, the overturning of disputed presidential elections in neighboring Ukraine and other issues, Mr. Putin intends to reconstruct a strong Russia politically, economically and militarily, regardless of what Americans may think of his methods. 
 Mr. Putin, it seems, does not seek respect from the United States as much as an end to what he views as American hectoring and meddling. Russia has its own interests, and Mr. Putin his own view of how to achieve them -- and that doesn't give the new Bush administration a great deal of leverage when it wants something from Russia.

HEADLINE: A Question Of Numbers

BYLINE: By Roger Lowenstein.

 BODY:

The Conservative New Deal
In 1938, the Social Security Act was only three years old, but its future was already very much in doubt. Conservatives claimed it would bankrupt the nation, and independent critics argued that the way it was financed amounted to ''financial hocus-pocus,'' as one editorial in The New York Times put it. President Franklin D. Roosevelt defended the program, said by a cabinet member to be his favorite, with some of his trademark oratory. ''Because it has become increasingly difficult for individuals to build their own security,'' the president told a national radio audience, ''government must now step in and help them lay the foundation stones.''
 Social Security did become the cornerstone -- not only the biggest government entitlement plan but also the most universal, the most popular and the most enduring. But the debate over Social Security never ended. Barry Goldwater wanted to repeal it; Milton Friedman wrote in 1962 that it was an unjustifiable incursion on personal liberty; and David Stockman, the budget director who personified Ronald Reagan's efforts to shrink the federal government, tried to take a hatchet to Social Security, which he called a ''monster.''
 But in this 70-year struggle, no other conservative has ever come as close to transforming the program as George W. Bush. He is making Social Security reform, including a partial privatization, a centerpiece of his second term. If the most ardent ideologues have their way, such a reform would be a first step toward a wholly new approach to retirement security -- one that would set aside the notion of collective insurance and guaranteed minimums for that of personal investing and responsibility. 
 This could do more to reverse the New Deal, and even the Great Society, than Goldwater, Stockman and Reagan ever dreamed of. ''We call it a conservative New Deal,'' says Stephen Moore, author of ''Bullish on Bush: How George W. Bush's Ownership Society Will Make America Stronger.'' In Moore's words, it will be a fundamental shift ''from an entitlement society to an ownership society.'' The key to this transformation, according to a generation of conservative thinkers and crusaders, is reducing the size and changing the nature of Social Security, which now pays benefits of half a trillion a year, and which will only grow bigger as America grows older. 
 The campaign to privatize has not only been about ideology; it has also focused on Social Security's supposed insolvency. Moore's book calls Social Security a ''Titanic . . . headed toward the iceberg'' and a program ''on the verge of collapse.'' A stream of other conservatives have bombarded the public, over years and decades, with prophecies of trillion-dollar liabilities and with metaphors intended to frighten -- ''train wreck,'' ''bankruptcy,'' ''cancer'' and so forth. Recently, a White House political deputy wrote a strategy note in which he said that Social Security is ''on an unsustainable course. That reality needs to be seared into the public consciousness.''
 The campaign is potentially self-fulfilling: persuade enough people that Social Security is going bankrupt, and it will lose public support. Then Congress will be forced to act. And thanks to such unceasing alarums, many, and perhaps most, people today think the program is in serious financial trouble.
 But is it? After Bush's re-election, I carefully read the 225-page annual report of the Social Security trustees. I also talked to actuaries and economists, inside and outside the agency, who are expert in the peculiar science of long-term Social Security forecasting. The actuarial view is that the system is probably in need of a small adjustment of the sort that Congress has approved in the past. But there is a strong argument, which the agency acknowledges as a possibility, that the system is solvent as is. 
 Although prudence argues for making a fix sooner rather than later, the program is not in crisis, nor is its potential shortfall irresolvable. Ideology aside, the scale of the fixes would not require Social Security to abandon the role that was conceived for it in 1935, and that it still performs today -- as an insurance fail-safe for the aged and others and as a complement to people's private market savings. 

PREDICTIONS AND BEST GUESSES
 About 47 million people -- retirees and their dependents, under-age survivors of deceased workers and the disabled -- receive a check from Social Security every month. The money for this colossal endeavor comes from a payroll tax on current workers and on their employers. The program is a model of efficiency; expenses are low, as pension plans go, and participation is near universal. Benefits rise with the level of earnings, but they are tilted toward progressivity, so that those at the bottom get more in proportion to their earnings and those at the top get less. Social Security also delivers a considerable nonmonetary benefit: people who have contributed throughout their working lives know that, regardless of the ebb and flow of their careers and, indeed, of the stock market, a guaranteed pension awaits them.
 Currently, Social Security is running a hefty surplus; the payroll tax brings in more dollars than what goes out in benefits. By law, Social Security invests that surplus in Treasury securities, which it deposits into a reserve known as a trust fund, which now holds more than one and a half trillion dollars. But by 2018, as baby boomers retire en masse, the system will go into deficit. At that point, in order to pay benefits, it will begin to draw on the assets in the trust fund. 
 The debate over Social Security's solvency is really two debates. The first is over how long the trust fund will last. The law requires the Social Security Administration to estimate its financial condition for 75 years into the future, and the agency's conclusions depend on the assumptions it makes about what America will look like decades hence -- how much people will earn, how large their families will be, how long they will live. 
 Politicians and other commentators tend to speak about these long-range trends, or at least about Social Security's finances, with an air of precision. This is almost amusing, since few economists can predict the swings in the federal budget even a year in advance. Joshua Bolten, head of Bush's Office of Management and Budget, said of Social Security last month, ''The one thing I can say for sure is that if left unattended, the system will be unable to make good on its promises.'' But the Social Security Administration itself pretends to no such certainty. Its actuaries (about 40 are on staff) frankly admit that the level of, say, immigration in 2020, or of wages in 2040, is impossible to forecast. ''The only thing we are sure of is that it won't happen precisely as we project,'' says Stephen Goss, the chief actuary at the agency. And the trustees' annual report, which is based on the actuaries' analysis, takes pains to say that it is not making a prediction. It makes a projection -- three different ones, actually -- that amount to informed but very rough guesses. The agency's best guess, labeled its ''intermediate'' case, is that the system will exhaust its reserves in 2042. At that point, as payroll taxes continue to roll in, it would be able to pay just over 70 percent of scheduled benefits. That would leave a substantial deficit, but one that Congress could easily avert if it were to act now when the projected problem is more than a generation away. 
 What's more, there is a strong case to be made that the agency is erring on the side of being overly pessimistic. If its more optimistic projection turns out to be correct, then there will be no need for any benefit cuts or payroll-tax increases over the full 75 years.
 No one can definitively predict that outcome, either, of course, but David Langer, an independent actuary who made a study of Social Security's previous projections compared with the actual results in 2003, thinks the ''optimistic'' case is its most accurate. Over a recent 10-year span, the trustees' intermediate guesses turned out to be quite pessimistic. Its optimistic guesses were dead on, and its pessimistic case -- sort of a doomsday situation -- was wildly inaccurate. 
 And, contrary to widespread belief, recent demographic trends have been modestly better (from an actuary's gloomy standpoint) than anticipated. For instance, longevity hasn't increased as much as expected. Partly as a result, since 1997 the agency has pushed back, by 13 years, the date at which it projects its reserves will be exhausted. In other words, as the cries of impending doom started to crescendo, the guardians of the system have grown more optimistic. 

IS THE TRUST FUND TRUSTWORTHY?
 The second debate concerning solvency is over whether the securities in the trust fund will be honored or whether, in Moore's pointed imagery, the fund will resemble a bank ''after it's been robbed by Bonnie and Clyde.'' This seems an odd preoccupation. Social Security does not own junk bonds or third-world debt; it invests in U.S. Treasuries, considered the safest investment on the planet. Since 1970 there have been 11 years in which Social Security has operated at a deficit; each time, it redeemed bonds from the trust fund without a fuss. Goss, the agency's actuary, says he has no doubt it will be able to do so again. ''Absolutely,'' he said when asked if the trust-fund bonds are sound.
 This isn't what some conservatives have said. Paul O'Neill, the former treasury secretary, went so far as to say that Social Security has no assets. In anti-Social Security literature, the ''no assets'' contention isn't even debated; it's treated as gospel. According to Michael Tanner, head of the Cato Institute Project on Social Security Choice, the agency's pauperism has turned America's seniors into ''supplicants'': after working and paying taxes their entire lives, ''they earn the privilege of going hat in hand to the government and hoping that politicians decide to give them some money for retirement.'' The implication is that the money isn't there: graybeards will have to beg for it. 
 Cato, a libertarian policy center founded in the late 1970's, has been arguing for 25 years that Social Security is on the verge of crisis. In a recent position paper, Tanner wrote that Social Security faces a horrendous unfinanced liability of $26 trillion over 75 years. In a footnote, he cited the 2003 trustees' annual report. Actually, the trustees' intermediate projection is for a deficit, over 75 years, of $3.7 trillion. Though that is a lot of money, it could be covered by an immediate surcharge to the payroll tax of less than two percentage points, or by various combinations of tax hikes and benefit cuts, each of them quite manageable. But $26 trillion is too big a hole to fix. When I asked Tanner about the footnote, he admitted that the trustees didn't actually say $26 trillion; Tanner derived the figure by counting the cash-flow deficits that the trustees project from 2019 on out. In other words, he ignores the next 15 years or so, during which time Social Security will be running a surplus. And he assumes that the assets in the trust fund, which should be accruing interest into the 2040's, won't exist, either. Tanner counts only the bad years and only the bad numbers. Another doomsayer, former Republican Representative John Kasich, pegged the Social Security deficit at $120 trillion in a recent op-ed -- some 32 times the agency's figure. (Kasich toted up annual deficits in nominal -- not inflation-adjusted -- dollars for every year through 2080, by which time a hamburger could cost $40.) 
 Such hyperbolic claims aside, there is a serious issue at the heart of what worries critics. It isn't that the trust fund is broken; it's that the existence of the fund is seducing the government to spend more than it otherwise would, thus brooking larger deficits in the future. Since Social Security lends its surplus to the Treasury (that's what it means to be investing in Treasuries), it is parking its surplus cash with the government. And just as lending money to a child outside a candy store may impose an impossible temptation, so the government may feel tempted while it holds onto Social Security's purse. 
 Ideally, Congress would recognize that the surplus is only temporary and would, therefore, take pains that the money lent to it is properly saved -- that is, that it run a surplus. But the government is operating at a deficit. So you must conclude that rather than saving Social Security's surplus, the government has been spending it -- on the military, education, tax cuts. In only 15 years, the government will have to start repaying its debt to Social Security. It will be able to do so. If need be, it will borrow, as it has borrowed for many purposes since 1776. The amount of borrowing, which could very gradually scale up to 1 or 2 percent of the country's gross domestic product, will be far smaller than the present federal deficit, which is just under 4 percent of G.D.P. But to avoid layering one deficit atop another, the government needs to exercise discipline -- to not overindulge in candy -- in the years when Social Security is running a surplus. 

DEMAGOGUES, DOCTORS AND DEFICITS
 The fear that the trust fund would represent a ''perpetual invitation'' to Congress has bedeviled Social Security since its inception. Economists of the 1930's knew that every pension plan starts with more workers contributing into the system than there are retirees. But down the road, as those workers retire, obligations mount. Therefore, they recognized, any system that builds an adequate reserve for the future must collect more than it needs in the early years. And though social scientists of the 30's could not anticipate the war or the baby boom that would follow it, they knew that America's population was going to age. 
 In 1934, when Franklin Roosevelt formed the Committee on Economic Security to design what was in effect the first federal safety net, the committee hired three actuaries to stargaze into the future. The actuaries predicted that the proportion of Americans over 65 -- then only 5.4 percent -- would rise to 12.65 percent in 1990, meaning that retiree costs would soar. They were just a tad high; the actual figure would be 12.49 percent.
 The committee was sharply divided on how to prepare for this demographic onslaught. Harry Hopkins, who oversaw the New Deal's relief program, thought the U.S. should simply pay retirement benefits from general funds; the more fiscally minded Henry Morgenthau Jr., the treasury secretary, wanted a self-financed system. F.D.R. sided with Morgenthau; above all, he said the system should be simple -''nothing elaborate or alarming about it.'' 
 But alarm was very much the order of the day. When Roosevelt was swept into office in 1933, he had been preoccupied with the emergency of the Depression -- 10 million unemployed, 18 million on relief, the country's business output cut by a quarter and its morale shattered. He responded with a whirlwind of legislation and with rhetoric that, for a while, truly inspired. By 1934, the energy of the New Deal's first days had begun to subside, and yet the Depression had not abated. Meanwhile, the administration was being outflanked by political zealots, utopians and snake-oil salesmen, who increasingly appealed to desperate Americans. In California, the novelist Upton Sinclair was running for governor on a radical platform to ''end poverty.'' In Louisiana, Huey Long was leveraging his ''share the wealth'' movement into a national campaign. The Rev. Charles Coughlin, a demagogic and incendiary radio orator, was attracting millions of listeners with his attacks on bankers, Bolsheviks and assorted other villains. 
 By far the oddest of these ducks was an elderly doctor in Long Beach, Calif., Francis Townsend, who had lost his county medical job to the Depression. Dr. Townsend, a onetime ranch hand and mining speculator, wrote to the local newspaper suggesting a fantastic retirement scheme: the government should distribute $200 a month to each American over 60 and pay for it with a sales tax. When recycled through the economy, he augured, these lavish pensions would ''abolish unemployment'' forever. His proposed stipend was well above the average American's monthly wage, and his plan was demonstrably unworkable. But in rural America, it had the lure of an elixir. ''Townsend Clubs'' popped up across the country. Millions of members were recruited, a weekly newspaper was printed and dozens of U.S. representatives dutifully lined up in support. 
 ''The Congress can't stand the pressure of the Townsend Plan unless we have a real old-age insurance system, nor can I face the country without'' one, Roosevelt told his labor secretary, Frances Perkins. Each had been thinking of social insurance since well before the emergence of Townsend -- as governor of New York, Roosevelt dispatched Perkins to England to study the British state insurance system. But characteristically, F.D.R. had let the idea simmer until the moment was ripe. The domestic agitation was his opportunity.
 In January 1935, the Economic Security committee delivered a sweeping proposal for ''cradle to grave'' insurance. Much of the bill merely authorized the federal government to distribute aid to the states, but two aspects of it were revolutionary: a plan for unemployment insurance and one for retirement. F.D.R., however, was greatly troubled by a detail in the latter. Though the payroll tax was scheduled to rise, in staircase fashion, within two generations it would be insufficient to cover benefits. Perkins explained that as the number of retirees rose, funds from the Treasury would have to cover the shortfall.
 ''Ah, but this is the same old dole under another name,'' F.D.R. said. F.D.R. had hoped that handouts would no longer be necessary as the economy recovered, and he shrewdly anticipated that in future generations, welfare-type programs would be vulnerable to political attack. He wanted Social Security to be different -- universal and enduring. Therefore, he insisted, it had to be self-supporting. Thus was conceived the (soon-controversial) trust fund. To build a future reserve, the New Dealers doubled the initial level of the payroll tax to 2 percent, applied up to a cap that was initially set at $3,000 of income. This added a regressive aspect to the plan, shielding the highest income brackets. Nonetheless, in August 1935, legislation was enacted that, in F.D.R.'s words, would ''give some measure of protection to the average citizen.''
 The public strongly supported the new program, but conservatives attacked it as a socialistic scourge. Playing on the fact that each worker was to receive a government number, the Hearst papers published front-page illustrations of a man wearing a chain with a dog tag. Henry Ford said Social Security could cost Americans their basic freedoms, like the right to change jobs or to move from one town to another. A shareholder in a utility filed suit, claiming that the payroll tax was unconstitutional. The case went to the Supreme Court, where, in 1937, Justice Benjamin Cardozo, as if to resolve the historic debate over federalism, ruled, ''The conception of the spending power advocated by Hamilton . . . has prevailed over that of Madison.'' The new agency's organizational elan won over some critics. W. Albert Linton, a skeptical insurance executive, visited the Social Security headquarters in Baltimore and was amazed when the staff plucked his name and address from among the 26 million records. ''I think it is amazing,'' he said, ''the way they have solved the technical aspect.'' 
 But the opposition wouldn't die. The issue that sparked the loudest protest was one that still burns today: the trust fund. Deductions from pay envelopes began in 1937, but benefits weren't scheduled to start until 1942, and there was a great deal of mistrust about where the money was going. Government actuaries sheepishly explained that Social Security was building a reserve eventually expected to reach $47 billion. This was an awesome sum -- eight times the total then in circulation. Alfred Landon, the Republican who ran against Roosevelt in 1936, called it ''a cruel hoax'' on the American people. His platform, sounding uncannily that like that of Republicans today, stated, ''The so-called reserve fund . . . is no reserve at all, because the fund will contain nothing but the government's promise to pay.'' Arthur Altmeyer, head of the Social Security board, came under heavy fire at a Congressional hearing. Looking for a way to safeguard the reserve, he made an intriguing suggestion: why not let the government invest in sound private securities, and thus insulate the surplus from Congress's eager hands? As Altmeyer recounted in his memoir, Arthur Vandenberg, a Republican senator from Michigan, threw up his hands and snickered, ''That would be socialism!''
 To quell the furor, Roosevelt turned to that standby device for embattled politicians -- an advisory council. The council arrived at an expedient solution, though one with troubling longer-term implications. It suggested increasing benefits for the first generation of retirees, even though that group had paid little in payroll taxes. An amendment in 1939 raised their benefits and also created new classes of beneficiaries -- wives, widows and survivors. This was a departure from the principle that all workers would be treated equally (couples would get more than single workers) and added an element of ''need'' -- a point that would rankle conservatives and later fuel the privatization movement. But in the political climate of 1939, it had the advantage of soaking up surplus taxes and greatly reducing the rate at which reserves would accumulate in the trust fund. F.D.R., anxious to have the controversy settled, went along, even though the changes paved the way for the eventual deficits he had feared.

THE FIRST (AND ONLY) CRISIS
 The crunch came, as actuaries had predicted, in the late 1970's. Part of the problem they had not foreseen; Social Security benefits were skyrocketing because of inflation. In the 70's, Congress decided to index retirees' benefits to the cost of living. The timing was awful. Not only did inflation soar, but incomes -- the basis of payroll contributions -- stagnated. Critics like those at the newly formed Cato Institute warned of disaster. A former Nixon cabinet member, Peter Peterson, began to attract attention by arguing that any pay-as-you-go system (in which one generation supports another, as today) was inherently unstable, and advocated deep cuts in the rate at which benefits increased. The criticism had an ideological as well as an economic edge. In a pre-financed system -- in which, for instance, each worker invests for his own later retirement -- society never faces a liability. But individuals may come up short (if their investments fare badly) and live out poorer retirements. President Carter, responding to the darkening outlook, became, in 1977, the first president to legislate a belt-tightening.
 Carter's efforts, however, didn't suffice. The trouble was that Social Security's actuaries had been way too optimistic. The actuaries had assumed that from 1978 to 1982 inflation would total 28 percent; the actual figure would be 60 percent. And they had predicted that wages would grow by 13 percent after inflation, whereas, in fact, real wages didn't rise at all; they declined. Social Security's experts were hardly the only people surprised by the dreadful economy, which was buffeted by skyrocketing oil prices, Middle East turmoil and a slumping stock market. Regardless, in 1981, Social Security experts announced that the trust fund would run dry in a year or two. That left the problem up to a new president, Ronald Reagan. 
 As a candidate for president, Reagan had proclaimed that he was ''pledged to a Social Security program that will reassure these senior citizens of ours they're going to continue to get their money.'' By then, Social Security had become a program that politicians couldn't afford to oppose and, indeed, that most Americans supported. President Eisenhower, a Republican, had proved this in 1956 when -- to the great disappointment of conservatives -- he supported a significant expansion of Social Security to include the disabled. But among adamant free marketers, the dream of upending Social Security lived on. One of the more prominent postwar opponents, in fact, was Reagan, a disarming actor then transitioning to political life.
 Reagan began speaking out against Social Security in the late 50's. At the time, Democrats were trying to extend Social Security to health care -- to what would eventually become Medicare -- and Reagan worked with the American Medical Association to try to stop them. The A.M.A. conducted a stealth campaign (unearthed in 1999 by the political scientist Max Skidmore) known as Operation Coffee Cup, in which doctors' wives would urge women in their communities to oppose the plan in letters to Congress. Reagan produced a record album for that campaign in which he criticized Social Security for ''supplanting'' private savings and warned that subsidized medicine would curtail Americans' freedom. Warm and folksy even as he envisioned a bleak Orwellian future, Reagan said that Big Brother could start with health care, ''and pretty soon your son won't decide when he's in school, where he will go or what he will do for a living. He will wait for the government to tell him.'' 
 Reagan gave slightly altered versions of this speech in personal appearances around the country, attacking Social Security as a ''sure loser'' of a program, and one that would worsen, not alleviate, the hazards of age. In the 70's, Reagan continued to sermonize against Social Security, often suggesting that it be made voluntary or more voluntary. At first blush, this sounded reasonable. As most people don't save enough for their retirement, however, under a voluntary system many who opted out would wind up destitute. Higher-earning workers (who get a lower proportional return on their payroll taxes) would opt out for certain. This problem is known as adverse selection. Wealthier people contributing higher taxes exit the system, leaving less revenue and a higher burden for the poorer people who remain. In effect, it would become an unpopular welfare program. 
 Once Reagan was in the Oval Office, he allowed his budget director, David Stockman, to handle the crisis. Stockman, who was waging a war on government spending, tried to exploit the moment to curtail Social Security sharply. It was Stockman's idea to cut benefits to early retirees by one-third. Without those cuts, he warned, the U.S. could suffer ''the most devastating bankruptcy in history.'' There were two weaknesses in the Stockman approach. First, he exaggerated. The deficit looming in 1983 was only temporary. (Since the birthrate dropped during the Depression, the number of seniors coming of age in the 1990's would decline, providing the agency with a respite.) Second, Stockman was politically naive. By proposing cuts for people on the verge of retirement, he triggered vehement protests. Members of the Republican-controlled Senate showed their instinct for self-preservation by voting 96-0 for a resolution intended to distance themselves from Stockman. James Baker, Reagan's chief of staff, urged the White House to do likewise. So Reagan, like F.D.R., bounced the problem to a commission, this time led by a well-known economic consultant, Alan Greenspan. 
 The 15-member commission got nowhere until December 1982. Then, with default only months away, an unofficial subgroup began to meet in secret. Robert Ball, a former Social Security commissioner, and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan negotiated for the Democrats opposite Baker for the White House. 
 In the end, they compromised on a combination of benefit cuts and tax hikes. The payroll tax, then 10.16 percent, was already scheduled to rise, but the negotiators sped up the implementation of the increase. (Today the rate is 12.4 percent.) Moreover, Congress agreed to hike the retirement age from 65 to 67. This change, which is being phased in very slowly (the retirement age is now 65 and 6 months) had the same effect as cutting benefits. Greenspan and company now calculated that Social Security would build a giant reserve, sufficient to see it through the middle decades of the 21st century. This was the original F.D.R. approach -- build a trust fund. President Reagan said the package ''assures the elderly that America will always keep the promises made in troubled times a half-century ago.'' 
 Social Security's next few annual reports made best-guess (intermediate) projections of solvency for 75 years, meaning it expected the system to remain solvent until 2060 and beyond. So the question that should arise now, but that has been oddly ignored is, What happened? 

ARE ACTUARIES tOO GLOOMY?
 Nothing did. Or in the words of Robert Ball, the nonagenarian former commissioner, ''nothing in the real world.'' But perceptions changed, and the balance of opinion began to shift in favor of reform. To some extent, that shift was bipartisan. In the mid-1980's and early 90's, Democrats discovered they didn't love deficits after all. When it began to appear that Congress was incapable of keeping its hands off Social Security's surplus, fiscally prudent Democrats like Moynihan and Bob Kerrey came out in favor of individual accounts. President Clinton famously campaigned to ''save Social Security first'' -- meaning that Congress should balance the budget. Meanwhile, the popular impression that any fool could make money in the stock market (for a while, any fool did) made private accounts seem like a natural. In the 1996 campaign, even among Republican contenders, only Steve Forbes favored privatization; by 2000 it was party doctrine. 
 Social Security's actuaries also began to make more pessimistic assumptions about the future. To quote the report of yet another Social Security advisory panel, this one from the mid 90's, ''It is pointed out that while today there are 3.3 workers paying into the system for every beneficiary drawing benefits, over time this ratio will change to two workers per beneficiary. . . . However, this has almost nothing to do with why there is a . . . deficit.'' The report continued, ''The ratio was fully taken into account in the 1983 financing provisions.'' So why did Social Security begin to forecast a more rapid exhaustion of the trust fund? Social Security was burned in the 70's and early 80's by being too optimistic. Now the actuaries are leaning the other way. ''It's a less optimistic estimate today,'' says Harry Ballantyne, who was chief actuary until 2001. 
 Social Security's key long-range projection is that, over 75 years, it will come up short by an average of 1.89 percent of payroll. Though deficits would still loom beyond 2080, the problem could be fixed until then by an immediate tax increase of 1.89 percent, or a benefit cut of roughly 13 percent. (Democrats tend to favor a combination.) But this all assumes that the middle projection is right. And several underlying assumptions of that middle projection tend to exaggerate the potential deficit. The first concerns longevity. A 65-year-old man today can expect to live to nearly 82. According to the most likely projection, in 2080 he should expect to live to 86. Goss says that the agency is assuming that medical technology will deliver more ''miracles.'' Most demographers agree with him, and some even think the agency is not being optimistic enough. The only trouble is, as Goss notes, that over the past 20 years ''they have been wrong at every turn. There has been less improvement than we were expecting.'' Indeed, the improvement in mortality has slowed significantly. And no one is sure why it has slowed. Nonetheless, the agency expects a sharp rebound over ensuing decades. Its fiscal gloominess thus depends on a speculative uptick in medical miracles. 
 Immigration is another contentious point. Immigration is good for the system because immigrants are earners and taxpayers. Though immigration has been rising, Social Security projects that it will taper off sharply, from 1.2 million a year to 900,000 in 20 years. This forecast is curious, because if the birthrate in America declines as anticipated, the country will need more foreign workers. 
 Rising wages are also a boon to Social Security's finances. Forecasting wages is difficult, as the trustees' report frankly admits, but it seems undeniable that as society ages, businesses will be harder pressed to find workers, and that should push wages higher. The trustees, however, project that real wages will grow at only 1.1 percent a year -- roughly equal to the level of the last 40 years. 
 The basic point here is that tiny swings in any of these or other factors could improve -- or worsen -- the program's balances. If a few of them lean in the direction of the optimistic forecast, the trust fund will cover benefits through 2080, or close to it. Would such a program, which appears to be solvent or near solvent until the limit of what is humanly forecastable, be improved upon by the various schemes for privatization?

PRIVATE ACCOUNTS DON'T SAVE MONEY
 Social Security does not provide, and was not meant to provide, a satisfactory retirement on its own. The average stipend for a 65-year-old retiring today is $1,184 a month, or about $14,000 a year. About half of Americans also have private pension plans, but for two-thirds of the elderly, Social Security supplies the majority of day-to-day income. For the poorest 20 percent, about seven million, Social Security is all they have. Even those figures understate the program's importance. According to an agency publication, ''Income of the Population 55 or Older: 2000,'' 8 percent of elderly beneficiaries were poor, but a startling 48 percent would have been below the poverty line had they not been receiving Social Security. Charles Blahous, the White House point man on Social Security, publicly criticized this calculation as ''mindless,'' and the Social Security agency no longer computes the figure. 
 Conservative economists say the figure is irrelevant: if Social Security didn't exist, people would save more. This may be true of economists, but what about the rest of us? The argument illustrates the ideological agenda of those who favor privatization: they want to change people's behavior. But how will the proposals to privatize, several of which are before Congress, actually work? Basically, younger workers would be allowed to divert a portion of their payroll taxes into individual accounts. Upon retirement, these workers would get lower Social Security benefits supplemented by whatever had accumulated in their portfolios. 
 But since the diverted money would not be available to pay benefits to current retirees, the government would have to undertake significant borrowing to pay people now in their middle and older decades. Eventually, the system might transition to one in which most people mostly relied on their personal accounts. But this transition would take many decades.
 The president is expected to back a plan similar to one recommended by the advisory council he appointed, in 2001. That plan opts for a slow transition, keeping entitlement-type minimums in place. The amount of money to be diverted into personal accounts -- and therefore, the potential gains -- is relatively small. Some free-market purists are unhappy about this. But Bush's economists, whatever else is said of them, are determined not to re-enact the Stockman debacle by moving too quickly and enacting immediate cuts. They have read their history. 
 The White House asked the Congressional Budget Office to analyze one advisory council plan. That plan would allow workers born after a certain date (perhaps 1950) to siphon about a third of the payroll tax into individual accounts, up to $1,000 a year. The money could be invested in any of three choices (other plans provide for wider menus) and would be converted into an annuity upon retirement.
 The C.B.O. assumes that the typical worker would invest half of his allocation in stocks and the rest in bonds. The C.B.O. projects the average return, after inflation and expenses, at 4.9 percent. This compares with the 6 percent rate (about 3.5 percent after inflation) that the trust fund is earning now.
 Proponents hail the plan for forcing savings on the government. But the diversion of money into individual accounts would save the government nothing, since it would have to borrow to offset the loss of the diverted dollars. The individual accounts represent a transfer, not a savings.
 The second feature of the plan would link future benefit increases to inflation rather than to wages. Because wages typically grow faster, this would mean a rather substantial benefit cut. That cut would mean a savings for the government. This is a political choice; we can always save money by reducing benefits. But it's important to stress that the savings result from cuts, not from the decision to privatize. 
 Overall, the plan is gentler toward lower-income seniors than wealthier ones, but all seniors would be poorer than under present law. In other words, absent a sustained roaring bull market, the private accounts would not fully make up for the benefit cuts. According to the C.B.O.'s analysis, which, like all projections of this sort should be regarded as a best guess, a low-income retiree in 2035 would receive annual benefits (including the annuity from his private account) of $9,100, down from the $9,500 forecast under the present program. A median retiree would be cut severely, from $17,700 to $13,600. On the plus side, budget deficits would be lower in the future. But, because of the lengthy transition, that ''future'' is exceedingly remote -some 50 years down the road. In the interim, deficits would rise by up to 1.5 percent of the country's G.D.P. 

ONE WAY TO USE THE MARKET
 One rationale for privatization is that workers would get a better return on their money in Wall Street securities than with Social Security's dowdy old Treasuries. This notion, which has Wall Street investment banks salivating, was especially in vogue during the 90's, when the stock market was soaring. When the bubble burst, advocates reined in their sales pitch, but they still are unrealistically sanguine. Last year, Tanner of the Cato Institute wrote that ''over the worst 20-year period of market performance in U.S. history . . . the stock market produced a positive real return of more than 3 percent.'' Actually, the market has done worse than 3 percent per annum in nine different 20-year periods. 
 In any case, Social Security could capture the return on stocks, without putting individuals at risk, by investing in equities directly. This would also achieve another frequently stated objective: keeping the government's hands off the Social Security trust fund. That option would be far more efficient, in economic terms, than separating the money into 150 million disparate accounts. Costs are much lower for one big investor. And more important, in a system of individual accounts, benefits will vary with individual choices, and some people will make poor ones. In Sweden, where the retirement system has included private accounts since 2000, the majority of Swedes made excessively risky investment choices by putting money into stocks at the market top, according to Richard Thaler, a University of Chicago behavioral economist. Finally, pooling the investment pools the risk, and thus reduces the danger of retiring at the wrong time. In a system of personal accounts, someone who retired after a market crash would be out of luck.
 So it is notable that all the current proposals to privatize involve the economically inferior option of individual accounts. But privatization advocates aren't motivated solely, and perhaps not even primarily, by economics. Glenn Hubbard, Bush's former top economic adviser, wrote in Newsweek that an ''obvious objective'' of privatization is ''to advance the president's ownership society agenda.'' Such pro-free-market sentiment has a long lineage. Remember Senator Vandenberg, who fretted in the 30's that public ownership of private securities would amount to socialism? Even though state pension funds and some U.S. agencies, including the Federal Reserve, put some pension money in stock-index funds, conservatives still react as if such a solution for Social Security were akin to turning it over to the Kremlin. Peter Ferrara, a former White House staff member under Reagan and now senior fellow at the Institute for Policy Innovation, who has been proposing Social Security privatization plans since the late 1970's, told me that economics ''was not my primary motivation. It was ideological. We don't want the government controlling that much investment.'' 

HOW BUSH WOULD CUT BENEFITS
 There is a policy choice that unites Social Security's critics -- from Goldwater to Reagan to Bush -- which is that the program should be balanced by shaving benefits rather than by raising taxes. They favor smaller government, so shrinking Social Security (rather than increasing its financing) serves their broader aim. Indeed, though the public continues to oppose cutting benefits, Bush has ruled out any solution that involves a tax hike. 
 Reagan said the program had morphed from the humble insurance plan formulated by F.D.R. (for whom he voted four times) into a swollen caricature of government excess. The first Social Security recipient, a legal secretary in Vermont named Ida Fuller, started with a benefit of $22.54 a month. Today's retirees obviously do better (even after adjusting for inflation). Nonetheless, according to Lawrence Thompson, who was the Social Security acting commissioner in the 90's, the retiree program is not really more ''generous'' now than it was in the past. Like other pension systems, Social Security was designed to replace a fixed portion of a retiree's previous earnings. For a single person with average earnings, initial benefits were intended to replace about 40 percent of income. They are still pegged to 40 percent of income.
 Since wages generally rise faster than inflation, retirees in each generation get more in real dollars than those in previous ones. Contemporary critics, like Kasich and the Bush council, would slow the rate of future increases by linking benefits only to inflation. Though this would save a lot of money, its effect on retirees should be understood. 
 Seniors now get an initial benefit that is tied to a fixed portion of their pre-retirement wages. If the index was changed, their pensions would be pegged to a fixed portion of a previous generation's income. If this standard had been in force since the beginning, retirees today would be living like those in the 1940's -- like Ida Fuller, which would mean $300 a month in today's dollars, as opposed to roughly $1,200 a month. 
 One way or another, societies with more old people have to devote more resources to them. Right now, benefits amount to 4.3 percent of G.D.P. The trustees' most likely projection assumes that over the next 75 years that figure will rise to 6.6 percent. In the more optimistic case, benefits will rise to 5.2 percent. Given the substantial increase in the elderly population, neither of these figures seems rash or out of proportion. The increased cost would be on a par with that of making Bush's first-term tax cuts permanent, which is projected to be about 2 percent of G.D.P.
 And though future generations of workers will have to support more retirees, they will also be having fewer children. In fact, according to the Social Security actuaries, the total ''dependency'' burden (that is, the number of nonworking seniors and kids that each working-age adult will have to support) will remain lower than at its baby-boom peak. ''In a grand social sense,'' says Thompson, the former Social Security commissioner, ''we can support more seniors where there are fewer people in day care.''

THE INESCAPABLE COSTS OF AGING
 Ultimately, every 75-year forecast is just a guess, and therefore every approach must accommodate a range of possible outcomes. Plans that link worker benefits to the stock market automatically adjust -- if the economy underperforms, then workers get lower benefits. This enhances, rather than mitigates, whatever is the trend in people's private savings. As Thompson says, ''The default adjustment is you eat less.'' This could be brutal and also unfair, especially to the post-1983 generation of workers that, on the say-so of Greenspan and Reagan that the trust fund would be honored, has paid a sacrifice in both reduced benefits and higher taxes. 
 What other solution is there? Ball, who joined the system in 1939 as a $1,620-a-year district officer in Newark, has thought of one. He starts from two premises: it would be reckless not to make some adjustments now, but foolish to make too much of 75-year prophecies. ''In 1928, there was no way to forecast the Depression, World War II, the birth-control pill. We have to stop acting as if 75-year estimates were absolute,'' he told me. 
 Nonetheless, Ball would tweak the system in several modest ways to reduce the projected deficit. For instance, he would very gradually raise the cap on income subject to the payroll tax, now at $90,000. This would reverse a recent regressive trend. Income distribution in America has become more skewed, thus upper-income folks have earned more money that has escaped the tax. Ball would also add three other, smaller fixes to further tighten benefits and raise taxes. (There are many variations of these fixes floating around the Beltway.) After Ball's prescription, how much of a deficit would then remain? Possibly a fraction of a percent of the payroll, possibly zero. The answer would depend on the net effects of future birth rates, wars, diseases, inventions and so forth. Enter now Ball's little accommodation to uncertainty. It is that Congress simply resolve now to impose, 50 years hence, a payroll tax increase sufficient to close whatever gap exists over the ensuing quarter-century. This could not be enforced now, of course, but that is Ball's point. He wants to free the Congress, and the rest of us, from the annual game of insisting on an exact and illusory far-off balance; to diminish the perception that we must urgently adjust to economic and demographic developments too distant to be forecast.
 The 2004 ''Economic Report of the President'' takes dead aim at such an approach. It reckons that all pay-as-you-go systems will eventually be doomed by demographics, and that solutions like Ball's will only push back the date that the trust fund runs out of money by a few years. The White House worries that any fix that covers 75 years of benefits could still bequeath a deficit in the 76th year. ''The nation must act to avert a long-foreseen future crisis in the financing of its old-age entitlement programs,'' the report states. Its assumptions may be true, or they may not be, but the conclusion suggests a misplaced allegiance: We have an obligation to the distant future, but don't we owe a greater debt to the current generation and to those that immediately follow? 
 Prudence dictates taking steps now to minimize the possible shortfall. This could include raising the cap, some modest cuts and tax increases and a gradual redeployment of the trust fund into assets that may not be tapped, willy-nilly, for whatever legislative purpose. But only a real crisis would dictate undoing an institution that has provided a safety net for retirees, that has helped to preserve in the social fabric some minimum of shared responsibility and that has been supported by workers in good faith. And, in looking at Social Security today, the crisis is yet to be found.

HEADLINE: Superlatives (and Contradictions) in a Fraud Trial

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
AFTER the blizzard of high-profile corporate-executive trials last year that featured Martha Stewart, Frank P. Quattrone and John J. Rigas, Americans might be forgiven for saying ''enough!''
 But, like it or not, the frenzy is likely to start anew on Tuesday, when the government begins its case against Bernard J. Ebbers, the former C.E.O. of WorldCom.
 Prosecutors have accused Mr. Ebbers of conspiracy, securities fraud and filing false statements to regulators in an $11 billion accounting fraud, the biggest in history; he faces up to 85 years in prison if convicted on all counts. The fraud led to the largest corporate bankruptcy in history when WorldCom collapsed in 2002. 
 The company's lead investment banker, Citigroup, paid $2.65 billion to settle claims by investors who were burned in the meltdown, and 10 former WorldCom directors agreed to pay $18 million of their own money to settle the same lawsuit.
 The superlatives, firsts and continuing fights over WorldCom are a big reason that the Ebbers trial is being called the granddaddy of all fraud cases. Not undeservedly, it is also being billed as a coda to the excesses of the stock market bubble that catapulted and then consumed the telecommunications industry in the last half decade.
 In digging through WorldCom's wreckage, the government has methodically built its case against Mr. Ebbers, a former high school basketball coach who turned a cut-rate long distance telephone company into a behemoth worthy of the name he gave it. Prosecutors have secured guilty pleas from five of his underlings, including his former chief financial officer, Scott D. Sullivan.
 Judge Barbara S. Jones of United States District Court in Manhattan denied attempts to move the trial to Mr. Ebbers's home state, Mississippi, and rejected motions to grant immunity to witnesses for the defense. On their face, these victories would seem to presage a slam-dunk for the government's case. But legal analysts say the trial will be anything but clear-cut because Mr. Ebbers is such a contradictory figure. 
 Many trials involving former corporate highfliers come down to whether the executive planned or knew about the fraud, or whether the dirty work was done by subordinates with his or her direct knowledge. Proving that Mr. Ebbers was ''in the loop'' will not be easy. According to managers who worked with him, Mr. Ebbers was a detail-oriented and hands-on executive who was concerned -- even obsessed -- with sales growth figures and efforts to cut costs.
 But he did not appear to be a financial whiz capable of devising Enronlike accounting schemes, they said, and instead was more focused on buying companies to merge into WorldCom and on increasing revenue. While prosecutors say they have damning voice mail messages and memos, Mr. Ebbers rarely sent e-mail messages, making it harder to compile a paper trail of instructions to subordinates. 
 ''It's pretty much what did he know, what should he have known and what he was aware of based on conduct,'' said Michael Missal, a partner at the law firm Kirkpatrick & Lockhart Nicholson Graham and a contributor to the bankruptcy court report on WorldCom last year by a panel led by Richard E. Thornburgh, the former attorney general. While not a complete review, Mr. Missal said, ''our reports showed that Ebbers did have involvement in the financial reporting process.'' He added, ''The question will be: How deeply was he involved in the process?'' 
 Prosecutors are likely to call former co-workers, including the five financial officers who have pleaded guilty, to the stand. Mr. Sullivan, Mr. Ebbers's right-hand man, will be a particularly important witness.
 The defense is likely to counter by saying that these witnesses are motivated to cooperate with the government because they are eager to reduce their possible maximum sentences, which range from 15 to 25 years. Former directors and financial industry analysts may also be called, though Mr. Missal said Mr. Ebbers generally kept his own counsel so witnesses with direct knowledge of his plans may be hard to find.
 In lieu of a specific memo showing that Mr. Ebbers instructed Mr. Sullivan or someone else to cook WorldCom's books, the government would have to build a case around Mr. Ebbers's motivation, legal specialists said. Here again, contradictions abound.
 Mr. Ebbers was a persuasive salesman and an aggressive businessman, having bought dozens of companies over two decades. Seeing opportunity in the breakup of AT&T, he was among the earliest entrepreneurs who helped usher in cheap long-distance service.
 But as WorldCom grew, Mr. Ebbers also became a slave to Wall Street. Under pressure to meet analysts' expectations, he had to continue buying companies. When a downturn in the broader market hurt WorldCom's stock, prosecutors say, the company used accounting gimmicks to paper over losses and buoy its shares.
 Whether Mr. Ebbers ordered those antics, or was even privy to them, is the question. Prosecutors are likely to try to show that there was no way an executive so involved in the company's climb could not have been involved in its demise. 
 The company was not the only thing at stake. WorldCom made Mr. Ebbers fabulously wealthy. He borrowed millions of dollars against his stock to buy a 500,000-acre ranch in Canada, where he was born, and acquired timberland, boats, homes and businesses.
 Yet Mr. Ebbers kept his WorldCom shares even as they fell. And while he lived lavishly, at least on the surface he seemed loyal to his company.
 He also has humble roots, which his lawyers are sure to emphasize. After moving to Mississippi, he ran some motels before entering the telephone business in the 1980's. Without formal training in engineering or finance, he relied on grit and instinct.
 As defense lawyers have done in other cases against corporate executives, Mr. Ebbers's are likely to portray him as someone who focused on the big picture and let his accountants handle the books.
 ''The government has to paint him as a robber baron whose sole goal was to get rich,'' said Robert W. Seiden, the president of Fortress Global Investigations and a former prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney's office. ''The defense has to play up the Horatio Alger angle: a guy with a simple background who built a fledgling industry into an alternative to AT&T.''
 How the jury weighs these competing pictures may be crucial to whether Mr. Ebbers is convicted, particularly because the accounting in question may prove too arcane and incomprehensible for the layperson.
 If the prosecution succeeds in lumping Mr. Ebbers in with other executives who have become synonymous with greed and excess, like Ivan F. Boesky and Michael R. Milken, he stands a good chance of being found guilty. At the same time, juries may identify with Mr. Ebbers's modest background and give him the benefit of the doubt.
 ''Jurors are very, very forgiving,'' said Angela C. Agrusa, a partner at the law firm Baker & Hostetler in Los Angeles who has won two civil cases against WorldCom, ''as long as you're not dealing with the death of a human being.''

HEADLINE: Social Security Bashing: A Historical Perspective

BYLINE: By DANIEL GROSS. 
Daniel Gross writes the ''Moneybox'' column for Slate.com.

 BODY:
PRESIDENT BUSH claimed last week that the Social Security system would be ''flat bust, bankrupt'' in 40 years ''unless the United States Congress has got the willingness to act now.'' 
 Given that professional economic forecasters are seldom correct when they predict what will happen in the next four quarters, it is difficult to accept 40-year estimates made by an amateur forecaster, even if he is the president. From its very origins, Social Security has tended to inspire apocalyptic economic projections. Now that economic claims and counterclaims about the program's future are multiplying, it is worth revisiting the response that greeted the introduction of Social Security 70 years ago. 
 In June 1934, in the teeth of the Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt called for ambitious government programs to ensure ''the security of the home, the security of livelihood and the security of social insurance.'' After the midterm elections that year, when Democrats expanded their already huge Congressional majorities, he moved quickly to introduce legislation. 
 The Social Security Act called for the government to offer modest unemployment benefits and to provide immediate assistance to poor older people. Starting in 1941, workers reaching the age of 65 would receive a guaranteed federal pension. To pay for Social Security, the United States would build up a reserve fund financed by new payroll taxes on employers and workers -- a combined 2 percent in 1937, rising to 6 percent in 1949. 
 Though mild by today's standards -- Social Security taxes now sop up 12.4 percent of payrolls -- the proposal sent many authorities on the American economy into paroxysms. Silas Hardy Strawn, a former head of the United States Chamber of Commerce, called the plan one of many ''attempts to Sovietize America.'' B.C. Forbes, the proprietor and editor of Forbes magazine, was similarly aghast. ''It has not been established why politicians should invade the field of voluntarily subscribed annuities,'' he wrote, ''since this field is already equitably covered by thoroughly trustworthy insurance companies.'' 
 Executives of the nation's largest corporations fretted that Americans would abandon thrift if the government began to guarantee retirement incomes. ''Industry has every reason to be alarmed at the social, economic and financial implications,'' said Alfred Sloan, the chief executive of General Motors and the Jack Welch of his day. 
 Newsweek, then as now a crucial harvester of conventional wisdom, summed up the reasoning of ''critical economists'' this way: ''Most employers can't afford the 6 percent insurance levies. This means they will cut wages, or raise prices, or both. Result: Increase in living costs, decrease in public confidence. Sum total of criticism: Recovery retarded.'' 
 People sympathetic to the Roosevelt goals also criticized the plan. ''Since industry will make every effort to pass on its levy to the consumers, it means that the young employees -- in their dual role of workers and consumers -- will bear the major cost of the accumulated problem of old-age dependency,'' Abraham Epstein, executive secretary of the American Association for Old Age Security, wrote in The Nation.
 Most troubling to economy watchers was the prospect of the government's stockpiling reserves of tax payments -- a projected $10 billion by 1948 and more than $40 billion by 1980. Marion Folsom, the treasurer of Eastman Kodak and a Roosevelt ally, said that establishing the fund would divert a large amount of money from consumer purchasing power. ''That is bound to have a depressing effect on general conditions,'' he said. 
 Despite occasionally hysterical opposition -- Senator Daniel Hastings of Delaware predicted that the bill's passage would ''end the progress of a great country and bring its people to the level of the average European'' -- the Social Security Act was passed by huge majorities in August 1935. 
 As the program developed and the years unfolded, virtually all of the dire claims made about its economic impact failed to come true. Rising taxes in the 1940's did not inhibit companies from earning profits, creating jobs or expanding pension plans. In fact, the middle decades of the 20th century are generally regarded as a sort of golden age for both companies and labor. 
 ''There weren't many periods in our history that were much better than the two decades from 1945 to 1965,'' said Richard Sylla, an economic historian at the Stern School of Business at New York University. ''We had high growth, high productivity and low inflation.'' 
 And, needless to say, the advent of Social Security failed to introduce Soviet-style socialism on American shores. 
 It is important to note, however, that Social Security did not, on its own, ensure economic security for all older Americans. In 1959, the poverty rate for the elderly stood at 35.2 percent, though that was down from more than 50 percent during the Depression. It took the passage of another hotly contested and expensive social insurance program -- Medicare, in 1965 -- to reduce poverty among the elderly substantially.
 Social Security inspired alarm and heated rhetoric in the 1930's because it involved a fundamental reordering of a portion of the economy and a basic change in the compact between the government and its citizens. Seventy years later, President Bush's desire to transform Social Security from a government-provided guaranteed income to a self-directed savings program also betokens far-reaching changes. As such, it is likely to generate its share of far-reaching claims, both for and against.
 One often-sounded warning about Social Security did materialize. Critics and supporters alike argued that the government might be tempted to spend the reserve funds that would pile up. Indeed, in the last four fiscal years, some $634 billion ostensibly collected to ensure the long-term viability of Social Security has been spent on current programs, according to figures from the Office of Management and Budget. 
 As Mr. Epstein wrote nearly 70 years ago: ''Experience everywhere indicates that politicians will hardly be able to keep their hands off such money.''

HEADLINE: Unmarried Fathers Gain Tax Incentive In Pataki Proposal

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki will unveil a program this week that would make New York the first state in the nation to use tax credits, along with other incentives, intended to motivate low-income fathers to work and pay child support, according to state officials.
 ''We think that engaging the dads has to be the next phase of welfare reform,'' said a senior administration official who provided details of the plan in advance on the condition that he not be identified. ''We want to encourage really poor dads to get into the economic mainstream by rewarding work.'' 
 The central proposal of the plan would vastly expand the state's Earned Income Tax Credit for fathers under 30 who earn less than $12,000 a year and who do not live with their children but are up to date in their child support payments, the official said. The maximum annual credit such a man can receive now is $390 from the federal government and $130 from the state. Under Mr. Pataki's proposal, the same man could receive up to $1,560 from the state.
 Such tax credits, which provide low-wage earners with cash payments that far exceed what they might have paid in taxes, are already available to low-income working parents who have custody of their children -- mostly women. They are widely believed to have been pivotal in helping millions of women leave welfare rolls in the last decade and stay in their jobs.
 Until now, however, no state has extended such a credit to those parents -- mostly men -- who do not have custody of their children. To qualify for the credit, a recipient must have a legitimate job, creating an incentive for men and women to leave the underground economy and find work on a company payroll. 
 In addition to the tax credit, the official said, the administration will propose creating intensive work programs and child-rearing courses for unemployed fathers, giving new discretion to judges and child-support magistrates to order unemployed fathers into work programs, and suspending child support obligations if the father marries the mother of the child and lives with her.
 The proposals are to be included in the governor's budget proposal tomorrow.
 Although ground-breaking, the tax credit program proposed by the governor is limited in scope. It is restricted to men 18 to 30 who are current on their child support, which the administration estimates to be only 10,000 men statewide. In addition, their income must be less than $11,490 annually to be eligible for both the federal and state credits. Officials estimate the program in subsequent years would attract as many as 5,000 additional men a year. 
 Even the expanded credit for noncustodial parents would be a small percentage of what is available to the parent who lives with a child. A single mother with two children who earns $6,500 a year is eligible for a federal credit of $2,610 and a state credit of $783, for a total payment of $3,393.
 Under the governor's proposal, the state official said, the noncustodial father of those children earning the same amount as the mother would be eligible for $380 from the federal government and $1,520 from the state. The average credit from the state would be closer to $980, the official estimated.
 The plan would cost $16 million in the first year. With the state facing a deficit of at least $6 billion, it is unclear whether Mr. Pataki can get his proposal through a divided Legislature. The tax credits, which in effect are income payments for the working poor, tend to be popular among liberal politicians. Marriage incentives and work programs tend to be favored by conservatives.
 Still, even the prospect of charting new ground in reaching poor unwed fathers won praise from national welfare policy experts for the governor and for Robert Doar, the commissioner of the Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, who did much of the research behind the proposal. 
 ''It is an innovative and promising direction,'' said Vicki Turetsky, a senior staff lawyer at the Center on Law and Social Policy, a liberal advocacy group based in Washington. ''The concepts have been bouncing around for some time, but what is really new and exciting here is the promise of implementation. I don't know of any other state even thinking about this.''
 The genesis of the plan can be found in both the successes and shortfalls of the vast changes to federal welfare policy in 1996, which imposed time limits on welfare payments and added incentives for welfare recipients to find work.
 Since then, more than one million women in New York alone have left the public assistance rolls for work. Nonetheless, although most of those women have more income than before -- thanks in part to the tax credits and other government benefits like day-care subsidies -- extensive research shows that many still earn just above the poverty level ($15,670 for a family of three) and struggle to cover the costs of running a home. Many go without the occasional meal or leave children unsupervised when they go to a late-night job, the research shows.
 Many researchers have also found that a working, involved father would alleviate the financial stress for such families, as well as provide many other benefits to children. In his first term, President Bush proposed spending $1.5 billion on state programs that encouraged marriage through various means, from counseling to bounties.
 That proposal was criticized by liberals and women's groups who argued that marriage made little sense unless the man was working. And employment rates for low-income black men have declined since the 1996 changes.
 Increased competition from women for low-wage jobs may be part of the reason, but a section of welfare reform that called for increased efforts to pursue low-income men for child support has also driven thousands of men out of legitimate jobs or into debt.
 The idea behind the governor's proposals is to give poor young fathers immediate reinforcement when they enter the labor force in a legitimate job, administration officials say, especially if they are giving some of that money to their children.
 The governor's plan includes both carrots and sticks, however. Allowing judges and child-support magistrates to order unemployed and underemployed fathers into work programs is sure to raise the hackles of poverty rights advocates.
 ''Expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit to men is a very good idea in principle,'' said Mark Levitan, a senior policy analyst with the Community Service Society, a research and advocacy group for liberal causes based in New York. ''But as for judges' ordering men into work programs, my gut reaction is that it sounds like involuntary servitude, and the marriage stuff is the worst form of social engineering.''
 But Ms. Turetsky, of the Center on Law and Social Policy, said that suspending overdue child support after a couple married amounted to significant relief to the new family. 
 ''Right now most of that money is kept by the state and used to repay welfare debts incurred by the mother,'' she said, ''which undercuts the stability of the family.''

HEADLINE: Alert to Gains by China, India Is Making Energy Deals

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
India's prime minister warned on Sunday that China had moved ahead in securing worldwide oil and natural gas supplies, the bluntest expression yet of energy worries among Indian leaders. In the last two weeks, they have pursued a series of energy deals that have surprised global markets. 
 ''I find China ahead of us in planning for the future in the field of energy security,'' Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said in a speech here at the convention of India's oil and gas industry. ''We can no longer be complacent and must learn to think strategically, to think ahead, and to act swiftly and decisively.'' 
 Like China, India has a fast-growing economy but stagnant domestic oil production, which has led to a rapid rise in energy imports, at a cost that has soared with high oil prices.
 Indeed, India has become even more dependent than China on volatile producing countries in the Middle East, buying nearly three-quarters of its oil from them now, compared with less than half a decade ago.
 Government-owned Chinese oil companies have been busy in the last two years buying large stakes in gas fields in Indonesia and Australia and exploring possible investments in American and Canadian energy companies. After staying relatively quiet until recently, Indian companies, also government controlled, have completed their own agreements in recent days.
 On Jan. 7, for example, three Indian companies concluded a $40 billion deal to buy liquefied natural gas from Iran over the next 25 years and to invest in gas fields there. The biggest of these, the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, emerged on Monday as a rival to China in bidding for a stake in oil operations taken from Yukos by the Russian government in a dispute over back taxes and, some say, politics.
 And on Thursday, Indian officials concluded an agreement to build a separate gas pipeline from Myanmar across Bangladesh to supply eastern India. Ecuador's oil minister, Eduardo Lopez, is in New Delhi this weekend to negotiate the possible sale of stakes in oil fields in his country to Indian companies.
 Abdallah S. Jumah, the chief executive and president of Saudi Aramco, is also here this weekend. He said that the company, which produces almost all of Saudi Arabia's oil, wanted to invest in refining and marketing operations in India, and would be prepared to discuss possible Indian investments in refining, marketing and petrochemicals businesses in Saudi Arabia.
 Subir Raha, chairman and managing director of the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, said in an interview that ''substantive discussions'' were under way with the Saudis and the Russians. He said his company was also interested in Canadian oil concerns with operations in South Asia -- including Niko Resources, which has been active in India -- and would consider buying companies outright or investing in their oil fields.
 Mani Shankar Aiyar, India's minister of oil and natural gas, said in an interview that Asian nations could avoid discord over energy and would be able to cooperate. He pointed to a gathering here on Jan. 6 of ministers from Asia's largest oil-producing and consuming nations that helped produce the gas agreements with Iran and Myanmar, and said that Asian governments should learn from regional free trade agreements on other continents in establishing a common energy policy.
 ''The Americas are together, Europe is together, Africa is together -- Asia is to remain divided?'' he said quizzically. ''Asia needs to come together.''
 Mr. Aiyar's ministry will begin a campaign on Tuesday to promote the auction of 20 onshore and offshore blocks of land for oil exploration.
 Until the mid-1990's, India banned 100 percent foreign ownership of its oil and gas fields and has been considered unenthusiastic about such investments since then.
 Only one foreign company, Niko Resources, initially won a block in the last auction two years ago, and it was disqualified later when Indian officials said it did not meet their rule that a successful bidder have a minimum net worth of $1 billion.
 G.C. Saxena, group general manager of the ministry's hydrocarbons directorate, which is running this month's auction, said the minimum net worth requirement had been lowered to $500 million, which would accommodate Niko.
 Niko has been successful in drilling for natural gas off India's southeastern coast as the minority partner of Reliance Industries of Mumbai. Asked if the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation might be interested either in acquiring Niko or forming some kind of alliance with it, Mr. Raha replied, ''Both,'' then declined to elaborate except to say, ''Niko is of interest to us; let me leave it at that.''
 Niko executives were flying here on Sunday for the auction of oil exploration blocks and could not be reached for comment.
 The biggest multinational oil companies, like Exxon Mobil and BP, have largely avoided exploration in India, which has a reputation for bureaucratic red tape and corruption.
 Some of the most promising natural gas exploration and development lately has been north of Sri Lanka in the Bay of Bengal. The recent earthquake and sea wave did little damage to those operations because they are in very deep water, and the force of the wave was distributed from the top of the ocean to the seabed nearly 7,000 feet below, said A.S. Umi Krishnan, of India's National Institute of Oceanography.

HEADLINE: Measuring Literacy In a World Gone Digital

BYLINE: By TOM ZELLER Jr.

 BODY:
There was a time when researching a high school or college term paper was a far simpler thing. A student writing about, say, Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, might have checked out a book on the history of aviation from the local library or tucked into the family's dog-eared Britannica. An ambitious college freshman might have augmented the research by looking up some old newspaper clips on microfilm or picking up a monograph in the stacks. 
 Today, in a matter of minutes, students can identify these and thousands of other potential resources on the Internet -- and, as any teacher will attest, they are not always adept at sorting the wheat from the chaff. 
 Now the Educational Testing Service, the nonprofit group behind the SAT, Graduate Record Examination and other college tests, has developed a new test that it says can assess students' ability to make good critical evaluations of the vast amount of material available to them. 
 The Information and Communications Technology literacy assessment, which will be introduced at about two dozen colleges and universities later this month, is intended to measure students' ability to manage exercises like sorting e-mail messages or manipulating tables and charts, and to assess how well they organize and interpret information from many sources and in myriad forms. About 10,000 undergraduates at schools from the University of California, Los Angeles to Bronx Community College are expected to take the test during the first offering period, which ends March 31. 
 Still, just what is meant by ''information'' or even ''technological'' literacy remains a hotly debated topic in academic circles, and there is no widespread agreement on whether such skills can be taught, much less measured in a test. What seems certain, however, is that a lucrative market is emerging for testing companies that are willing to fill the perceived need. 
 The initial technology test is aimed at midlevel college students, but the Educational Testing Service says it has also received inquiries from high schools and businesses. And while the new assessment is not a high-stakes requirement for academic advancement like the SAT, it seems inevitable that most students will one day need to prove themselves along these lines. 
 Part of the problem, many educators say, is that the traditional vetting process for information is now so easily bypassed. 
 ''In an earlier time, information came, really, from only one place: the university library,'' said Lorie Roth, the assistant vice chancellor of academic programs for the California State University system, one of seven school systems that worked with the testing company over the last two years to develop the test. ''Now it is all part of one giant continuum, and often the student is the sole arbiter of what is good information, what is bad information and what all the shades are in between.'' 
 But not everyone agrees that measuring information literacy can be done, even with a standardized test. 
 ''There is a basic problem with identifying a single set of skills that could possibly relate to all people,'' said Stanley Wilder, the associate dean of the River Campus Libraries at the University of Rochester in New York, who wrote a withering assessment of the information literacy movement in The Chronicle of Higher Education two weeks ago. ''There isn't a serious critique of any of the assumptions that info-literacy makes,'' Mr. Wilder said in an interview. ''They'll tell you that it teaches critical thinking, but there's never been a study that measures whether students are really lacking this, or whether libraries can impact this.'' 
 Be that as it may, it is true that the information literacy movement could prove a windfall for companies like the Educational Testing Service. 
 Developing metrics for measuring how much students know -- or how much they have yet to learn -- has become a lucrative market. Eduventures, a research firm in Boston, estimated the assessment market for prekindergarten to Grade 12 -- excluding the college years and beyond -- at $1.8 billion for 2003. Given President Bush's announcement last Wednesday that he plans to expand the standardized testing mandated under the No Child Left Behind Act -- which includes a commitment to ''ensuring that every student is technologically literate by the time the student finishes the eighth grade'' -- the market for assessments is certain to grow. 
 Beyond the SAT, the Educational Testing Service controls a separate boutique market of higher-level tests like the Graduate Record Examination and the Graduate Management Admission Test. Despite its nonprofit status, it is the world's largest private educational testing and measurement organization. The company administers and scores nearly 25 million tests annually in more than 180 countries, and posted $825 million in revenues for fiscal year 2004.
 In an extensive report, ''Tech Tonic: Towards a New Literacy of Technology,'' published in September, the Alliance for Childhood, a nonprofit group that is often skeptical of technology in schools, was critical of the new test. ''For E.T.S., this is part of a broader global plan to develop and promote international technology literacy standards, and then offer countries around the world a chance to buy a full array of assessment products and services that can be used to implement their standards,'' the report said.
 But if critics see this as an unjustified entry into an already littered field of standardized tests, the company argues that the information age -- and a new culture of accountability -- demand it. 
 ''I think there's always that tension,'' said Teresa Egan, the project manager who is steering the test's release at the end of this month. ''People feel there's too much testing across the board now. Or they ask whether we are focusing so much time on testing that students don't have time for other educational experiences.
 ''But the public wants accountability. People want to ensure that colleges are actually preparing students for the future -- the future being an information society.'' The technology test will cost colleges around $25 a student -- discounted to $20 for institutions that sign up during the first testing period. Students will take the Web-based exam in classrooms or instruction labs, logging on with access codes purchased by their schools. Scores in the first round will be aggregated for each institution; the company aims to make scoring for individual students available in 2006. 
 In 2001, the testing company brought together an international consortium of educators, technology specialists and government representatives to begin defining the core characteristics of information consumption at the college level. 
 Knowing where and how to find information, they agreed, was just the beginning. Interpreting, sorting, evaluating, manipulating and repackaging information in dozens of forms from thousands of sources -- as well as having a fundamental understanding of the legal and ethical uses of digital materials -- are also important components. 
 ''Critical thinking is a central aspect of the new economy,'' said Robert B. Reich, the secretary of labor in the Clinton administration, who is now a professor of social and economic policy at Brandeis University. Professor Reich is also the author of the 1991 book ''Work of Nations: Preparing Ourselves for 21st Century Capitalism,'' which provided a something of a touchstone for the information literacy movement. ''Our high school curricula are locked into an industrial age that may have only a tangential relationship to the information age,'' he said in an interview. 
 To the extent that efforts like the new technology test help reshape curriculums along these lines, Mr. Reich said, they probably will help. 
 According to Ms. Egan of the Educational Testing Service, the test is also fun. 
 ''Can you help me find a good source of products and gifts designed for left-handers?'' reads a sample question from a fictitious office manager. ''I'd like someplace that offers a wide range of merchandise with product guarantees -- also that has an online catalog and online ordering. Discounts would also be a plus.''
 Fictitious colleagues might then make suggestions via e-mail, and the test taker might also get input by instant message from people using screen names like SkyDiver, JJJunior and TVJunkie. The test taker would be asked to consider the various sources and suggestions, and to rank them by relevance to the original request. 
 Other parts of the test ask students to do everything from the seemingly mundane (like sorting e-mail messages into appropriate folders) to head-scratching tasks like ''reordering a table to maximize efficiency in two tasks with incompatible requirements,'' according to a brochure. 
 Asked if she had taken the test herself, Ms. Egan responded, ''What a cruel question. 
 ''I took it earlier on, when there was no way to produce a score from it. But I knew myself that there was a lot I needed to learn.''

PERSON: Zhao Ziyang

HEADLINE: Zhao Ziyang, Chinese Leader Purged for Supporting Tiananmen Protesters, Dies at 85

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY

DATELINE: BEIJING, Monday, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
Zhao Ziyang, the former general secretary of China's Communist Party who was stripped of power for supporting the students during their 1989 pro-democracy Tiananmen Square protests, died in a Beijing hospital on Monday, his family said. He was 85, and had been in a coma since Friday after suffering a series of strokes.. 
 For the past 15 years, Mr. Zhao had lived under house arrest not far from the government offices where he once led China.
 During his long confinement, he had become a powerful symbol for those Chinese who believe the government must reassess its bloody crackdown at Tiananmen. He blamed top leaders for ordering the military assault, and he refused to embrace the official line that the demonstrations had been a ''counter-revolutionary rebellion.'' 
 In what would be his last public appearance, Mr. Zhao visited students at Tiananmen on May 19, 1989. He pleaded with them to leave, apologized for having arrived ''too late,'' and warned that the authorities were planning to remove them. It is now clear that Mr. Zhao made the visit directly after being fired by China's Politburo.
 Martial law was announced the next day in a prelude to the crackdown on June 3-4, when soldiers fired on protesters throughout Beijing, killing hundreds, possibly more. Mr. Zhao's visit to Tiananmen was also notable for the dazed-looking aide, captured in a famous photograph, who accompanied him: Wen Jiabao, now China's prime minister.
 Mr. Zhao's role at Tiananmen came to overshadow his other legacy as a principal architect of the sweeping economic changes that began in the 1980's under Deng Xiaoping, then China's paramount leader. Mr. Zhao pushed to develop coastal provinces with special economic zones that could lure foreign investment and create export hubs -- the blueprint for what is the backbone of the current Chinese economy.
 ''Deng Xiaoping's entire economic package, a good part of it, was really Zhao Ziyang's brainchild,'' said David Shambaugh, who wrote a 1984 biography of Mr. Zhao. ''In coastal development, agriculture, price reform and industrial reform, those were Zhao's ideas. Deng got the credit, but they were Zhao's ideas.''
 Unlike Mr. Deng and Mao Zedong, Mr. Zhao had not been a military hero during the Communist revolution. Nor had he taken part in the Long March of 1934-35, the unifying rite of passage for the generation of Communist leaders who founded the People's Republic of China in 1949.
 Instead, Mr. Zhao's political apprenticeship came as a provincial bureaucrat. Born in 1919 in central China's Henan Province, he joined the Communist Youth League in 1932, then joined the Chinese Communist Party six years later. He served in the military during the war against the Japanese, then during the Chinese revolution, but his posts were largely administrative.
 Mr. Zhao had no formal training as an economist but exhibited a pragmatic style and had record of success that eventually attracted Mr. Deng's attention. Dispatched to southern China after the Communist victory in 1949, Mr. Zhao focused on land reform issues as he steadily rose through the political ranks in Guangdong Province. 
 Few issues were more politically charged in newly Communist China. Efforts to fulfill Mao's vision of a socialist utopia led to the abandonment of private land plots in favor of agricultural communes. But the misguided collectivization schemes of the Great Leap Forward of 1958-60 became a historic catastrophe. An estimated 30 million people died during three horrific years of famine caused by a collapse in food production.
 In 1962, Mr. Zhao, then the top provincial official in Guangdong, introduced a plan to disband the commune system and return private land plots to farmers while assigning production contracts to individual households. The system worked and would become a model that helped the rest of China rebuild agricultural output.
 Politically, though, Mr. Zhao would not be rewarded. In 1967, he was persecuted during the purges of the Cultural Revolution for ''revisionist'' thinking and spent four years in forced labor at a factory. He re-emerged in 1971 as an official in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, seemingly as a born-again Maoist. He gave a speech renouncing private enterprise and material incentives.
 But his conversion was apparently not very genuine. He returned to Guangdong in 1972 and then moved to Sichuan Province in 1975. There, he introduced land reforms similar to those he had used earlier in Guangdong and loosened controls on industry. He allowed farmers and factories to set prices for their products, a decision that saw three years of production increases.
 His performance also gained the attention of Mr. Deng. A Sichuan native, Mr. Deng had survived two purge attempts to eventually emerge as China's paramount leader after Mao's death in 1976. Mr. Deng wanted to solve China's economic problems with pragmatic solutions, not ideological experiments, and in 1980 he brought Mr. Zhao to Beijing as deputy prime minister.
 Later that year, Mr. Zhao was elevated to prime minister, a job that made him the titular head of the government and placed him in charge of the Chinese economy. At Mr. Deng's behest, he acted boldly, embracing economic reform by expanding self-management for peasant farmers and some industries. In 1987, after the ouster of Hu Yaobang, who was deemed too lenient toward student protests, Mr. Zhao became general secretary of the Communist Party, a job that made him Mr. Deng's presumptive heir. 
 He apparently had his doubts. 
 ''I'm not that fit to be the general secretary,'' Mr. Zhao said in an American television interview about a month before being appointed to the job. ''I'm more fit to look after economic affairs.''
 Nonetheless, Mr. Zhao was not meek. He made a famous speech at the opening of a Communist Party congress in 1987 in which he declared that China was in ''a primary stage of socialism'' that could last 100 years. As a result, he argued, China needed to experiment with a variety of economic approaches to stimulate production.
 It was a deft refinement that managed to place experimenting with market economics within an evolutionary framework for socialism. 
 But Mr. Zhao's policies earned him many enemies among Marxist ideologues and hard-liners in Beijing who blamed him when the economy overheated in 1988. Inflation soared, as did reports of corruption. His influence in the government he putatively led began to wane. Mr. Zhao's enemies also pounced on his embrace of political liberalization. ''He thought the goal of Chinese political reform was to build up democracy and rule of law,'' said Wu Guoguang, who was among a group of advisers who consulted with Mr. Zhao on various issues and now teaches politics at Chinese University of Hong Kong.
 Mr. Shambaugh, the biographer, said Mr. Zhao was increasingly desperate by 1989 as his power was quickly eroding. On May 4, he made a conciliatory speech toward Tiananmen protesters without Mr. Deng's clearance. In the weeks before the crackdown, Mr. Zhao and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, then the Soviet leader, met in Beijing as the protests continued. The image projected to the world was of two like-minded Communist reformers.
 But Mr. Zhao sealed his demise by telling Mr. Gorbachev that all major decisions by China's Central Committee had to be approved by Mr. Deng, who was technically in retirement. This was hardly revelatory but speaking about Mr. Deng's role in public violated a major taboo. It also was regarded as a signal by Mr. Zhao that Mr. Deng was responsible for the government's intransigence on calls by protesters.
 Mr. Deng quickly stripped Mr. Zhao of his powers, and later, of his job. In the months after Mr. Zhao was placed under house arrest, he was pilloried in the Chinese press. But, ultimately, no charges were brought against him.
 ''He has been steadfast that his views are correct, and their views were wrong,'' Mr. Shambaugh said before Mr. Zhao's death. ''He has given not an inch in the past 15 years.'' 
 Even in isolation, Mr. Zhao made news, if only outside China. When former President Bill Clinton visited China in 1998, Mr. Zhao managed to issue a letter calling for China to reassess the Tiananmen crackdown and acknowledge that it had made a grave error. Coverage of the letter was banned in China.
 Mr. Zhao's confinement was loosened enough during the 1990's that he began traveling within China, if under watch. But he still needed permission from the highest levels when he requested to go on vacation in southern China to pursue his passion for playing golf.
 He is survived by his second wife, Liang Boqi, four sons and a daughter.

HEADLINE: In the pursuit of face-to-face sales and Web site traffic, Expedia and Travelocity.com open shops in tourist areas.

BYLINE: By Bob Tedeschi

 BODY:
VIRTUAL travel agents are virtual no more.
 After years as online-only brands, Expedia and Travelocity.com will begin selling vacation activities the old-fashioned way. Both companies are opening kiosks and small retail shops in major tourist areas this month. 
 The companies said the change would help them reach customers who had not yet purchased travel services online and would strengthen the companies' bonds with hotels, where many of the kiosks will be located. The new locations will also help the companies get a much bigger slice of the lucrative vacation activities business, selling services like helicopter tours, luau outings and show tickets. The activities market has no dominant player, with most tourist destinations relying on regional companies to market local tours and services. 
 ''We felt we could make a pretty good business here by bringing our credibility to a space where there is no brand,'' said Jamie McDonald, vice president of destination services at Expedia, a unit of IAC/InterActiveCorp. ''At the same time, we felt we could help our customers while they're in a destination.''
 The kiosks underscore the latest trend among online travel agencies, which have been trying in recent years to evolve into travel retailers, rather than simply Web sites that quote published air and hotel rates and pass orders on to suppliers, according to Henry Harteveldt, an analyst with Forrester Research, a technology consultant. 
 The moves come as travel sites fight to maintain their profit margins. Airlines have cut the commissions they pay to travel agencies and now market their own sites more aggressively. Hotels are also directing customers to their own sites by reducing the number of discounted rates available to online agencies. Mr. Harteveldt estimated that kiosk sales generate profit margins of about 20 percent, compared with 10 percent to 18 percent profits for hotel sales online and 5 percent to 10 percent margins for rental cars. 
 ''Kiosks are a core plank to their future foundation,'' Mr. Harteveldt said. ''It makes them less reliant on selling airline tickets and individual products, and more about selling vacation packages, destination services, etc. These guys are all about becoming a new form of retailer, much like L.L. Bean.'' 
 But Expedia clearly hopes that the kiosks will attract new customers to the online business as well. The kiosks, which will begin carrying the ''Expedia!Fun'' brand this week, have been operating in about 55 hotel lobby areas for years, under various brand names, serving customers who walk in or call. At one Activity World kiosk that Expedia began managing last spring in the Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel, about 80 percent of the customers had not used Expedia for their vacation booking. 
 ''So our hope is, if it's your first experience with the Expedia brand, maybe you come back to the site and we'll see some sort of boomerang effect,'' Mr. McDonald said.
 Expedia's retail kiosk effort began in earnest last spring when it bought, for an undisclosed sum, Activity World, which sells luau outings, bike tours and other activities on behalf of vendors in Hawaii. The company has since invested in similar companies in other destinations, including Mexico and New York, and will probably expand to London, Paris and other ''key destinations where consumers spend money on tourism activities,'' Mr. McDonald said.
 Mr. McDonald added that the kiosks, which are typically staffed by two employees at hotel lobby desks or within small retail spaces, did not signal a large shift toward full-service storefront travel agencies, with all the attendant costs in labor, rent and office expenses. He said that Expedia!Fun customers who want help booking airfare or hotels would be advised to log on to Expedia.com.
 ''We still feel good about it as a small retail operation,'' Mr. McDonald said, adding that he expected the kiosks to be less profitable than Expedia's core online business. 
 The kiosk initiative of Travelocity, owned by Sabre Holdings, also began with an acquisition -- the 2004 purchase of Allstate Ticketing, which sells Las Vegas show tickets, Grand Canyon and Hoover Dam tours and other activities in more than 20 kiosks in and around Las Vegas. The kiosks will this month begin bearing signs that read: ''ShowTickets.com, a Travelocity company.'' 
 According to Michelle A. Peluso, Travelocity's chief executive, the retail booths will help the company improve its relationships with hotels in Las Vegas in particular. ''When we sell their show they get a percentage of the revenue, so they can make a lot of money with those shows. So this helps us provide more value to them than just selling hotel rooms,'' she said. ''This clearly depends on our relationship with our customers.'' 
 ShowTickets.com's print advertising campaigns, which involve millions of brochures in Las Vegas, will also incorporate the Travelocity brand, Ms. Peluso said, giving the company greater exposure to future online bookings. Given the benefits of the kiosks and the fact that the business is already profitable, Ms. Peluso said the company was ''actively looking at expansion plans.''
 Part of the travel sites' shifting retail strategy, according to Mr. Harteveldt of Forrester, can be seen in how online travel agents are changing the ways they market airline seats. Travelocity, for instance, will introduce a new feature tomorrow called Flight Navigator, which will display a range of attributes about flights, including the availability of meals on board, whether the seats offer extra legroom and the number of seats available for a certain rate.
 ''They're helping customers understand why there might be a difference in price, which is absolutely the mindset of a retailer,'' Mr. Harteveldt said. 
 That effort is critical in helping attract more business from customers while also improving relationships with suppliers, Mr. Harteveldt added. ''If Travelocity can help customers understand the value in an airline ticket that might cost $30 more, then both Travelocity and the airline has a more profitable sale,'' he said. ''The airline might say, 'Well, because I can advertise my product more effectively on Travelocity and I'm getting a higher average ticket sale there, I'll give them first dibs the next time I've got a promotional fare to distribute,''' he said.
 Ms. Peluso of Travelocity said that Flight Navigator and other recent Web site improvements were a signal that the company no longer thought of itself in purely travel-related terms. 
 ''When we're in the office tossing around the names of companies we aspire to be, we talk about Williams-Sonoma, Target, Home Depot,'' she said. ''We're not talking about American Express.''

HEADLINE: Newish Mayor Embraces An Old Game

BYLINE: By JOYCE PURNICK

 BODY:
MEET the (almost) new Michael R. Bloomberg. He appeared last week in the Bronx, delivering a carefully orchestrated State of the City address that would have been inconceivable just three years ago.
 The once defiantly apolitical business executive delivered an upbeat message that his prospective opponents tried hard to impugn, but barely touched -- maybe because this time, Mr. Bloomberg played the game. He dropped the names, waved the flag, curried favor, did the shtick he once seemed to reject even when many New Yorkers -- including this one -- said he needed it. 
 He probably helped himself with voters. At the same time, the man on the stage at Hostos Community College was not the man this city elected, not really. And that seemed a little sad, a reflection of a political system that forces its candidates into familiar molds.
 With the 67-minute speech came flags, a bit of militarism, ethnically appropriate guests, on-message themes, jokes, multiple applause lines. Do we really need that? Guess so.
 Not that this was an extreme makeover. The mayor still reads nearly every word, stumbles over some and will never be a compelling orator. But in the first month of his re-election year, with the polls showing that many New Yorkers still don't find him simpatico, he is doing more than kissing babies, visiting neighborhoods and speaking with a little extra oomph.
 He and his advisers have adapted a few Karl Rove-type techniques, stopping short of ''Mission Accomplished.'' Every minute of the mayor's speech was planned and choreographed, as was his entrance.
 Mr. Bloomberg used the main entrance to the auditorium at Hostos and, as he had just a few times before, walked down the aisle shaking hands, the way presidents work Congress at their State of the Union speeches. Then there were guests on stage, almost all Latino and from the Bronx, which has a large Latino population and is home to a presumed mayoral candidate, Fernando Ferrer.
 Also presidential-style, the mayor introduced his guests individually, including former Representative Herman Badillo; a firefighter; a correction officer; a hospital administrator; members of the military; a fourth-grade student who succeeded in summer school; and Tomas Vellejo, a mail clerk at John Jay College who, helped by a city program, had bought his first home.
 Mr. Vellejo stood and smiled. ''Tomas, bienvenidos al sueno Americano!'' said Mr. Bloomberg, standing in front of a panorama of city and state flags, maps of the city and a banner that read ''City of Opportunity.'' There were photographs of students, of children in a park, of workers -- all intended, explained his press secretary, to echo themes in the speech, like creating better schools, safer streets and jobs.
 IN the relentlessly rosy-hued speech, Mr. Bloomberg emphasized the rebounding economy, the property tax rebates and reductions in crime, traffic and fire deaths. Viewed as wealth- and Manhattan-centric, he focused on programs that benefit the poor, the homeless and the middle class; dropped the names of all the borough presidents; proposed some modest initiatives; and avoided mention of the city's projected $2 billion budget gap.
 All standard, and helpful to mayors, who don't have to give these speeches at all. Under the City Charter, they have to report to the City Council, but could presumably do so in a letter. Letters don't get television time or headlines.
 Hence the speech. But do they need human props and all the rest? As Mr. Bloomberg has noted, the election will be a referendum on his record, and he has a substantial one. He used the speech to present his view of his successes from the statistics on crime, fire and traffic. 
 He spoke about education and about stabilizing the city budget after Sept. 11, in part by raising taxes, to the delight of his critics. (One wonders what they would have done when the city was in such dire straits. Slashed services, or waited for an economic revival that might not have come?)
 The mayor has plenty of flaws, too, like failing to firmly take on the president, the governor or the Metropolitan Transportation Authority when their policies hurt the city, and treating as inevitable his plan for a stadium on Manhattan's Far West Side.
 There's plenty to talk about without the bells and whistles. But we demand them, so we will get them. ''You only have a couple of minutes on the evening news to get your message across, so you try to do it in as many ways as you can,'' said Edward Sky-ler, the mayor's press secretary. ''You try to get the biggest bang for your buck.''

HEADLINE: As Rice Prepares to Move Up, Diplomacy May Be on Rise, Too

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
Her confirmation as the 66th secretary of state is a foregone conclusion, and the White House plans to swear her in on Inauguration Day. But starting Tuesday morning, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will begin what could stretch to two full days of questioning Condoleezza Rice about almost every aspect of her past performance and future plans.
 No question looms larger than just what kind of secretary of state Ms. Rice will be. She declined to be interviewed for this article, but her associates and even some of her rivals say she shows every sign of setting a course aimed at putting diplomacy at the top of the Bush administration's foreign policy agenda after a period dominated by military action in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 Ms. Rice's goals vary from restoring America's reputation in the capitals of Europe through a vigorous campaign of public diplomacy to actively promoting free institutions throughout the Middle East and renewing involvement in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, and include a heightened focus on free trade and economic issues, associates say. 
 In campaign speeches for President Bush last fall, Ms. Rice likened the current world climate, including the daunting insurgency in Iraq, to the period of skirmishing that followed World War II, when the United States took the lead in establishing international institutions and the policy of containing the Soviet Union that rebuilt Europe and Asia and won the cold war. 
 ''Europe and Asia are safer as a result,'' Ms. Rice said in October in Cleveland. ''And so it shall be in the Middle East.''
 To put it mildly, that is an ambitious goal. Whether Ms. Rice can begin to achieve it may depend on how well she adapts to a markedly new role, and surmounts problems that have dogged her as national security adviser for the past four years. 
 Her critics have faulted her handling of terrorist warnings before Sept. 11 and her management of fractious internal disputes and flawed intelligence reports in advance of the war with Iraq and the military occupation that followed. They have also faulted her response to the threat of nuclear proliferation in Iran and North Korea and her overall role in a foreign policy that has strained the United States' relations with longtime allies and perhaps spawned new enemies around the world.
 Her success or failure may also depend on how she fares with two strong-willed and more seasoned players, Vice President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, both of whom view foreign affairs as a major part of their own portfolios and with whom Ms. Rice has not always seen eye to eye. Her champions say that Ms. Rice is well aware of how her job will change, and that she is prepared for the switch.
 ''Her role will be different institutionally, as well as practically,'' said the White House chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr. No longer will she be expected to summarize the views of others, but to state her own, saying, as Mr. Card explained it: ''This is what I think. This is what the State Department strongly recommends.'' 
 Secretary of State Colin L. Powell seldom hesitated to tell the president that while Mr. Rumsfeld or Mr. Cheney might have a certain view, he had another. Will Ms. Rice be equally vocal? ''Yes,'' Mr. Card said with a hearty laugh, ''because she knows that Don and Dick will say the same thing.'' And, Mr. Card noted with another laugh, ''She'll have great empathy for Steve Hadley,'' her deputy and designated successor as national security adviser. ''I'm not sure she'll have sympathy.''

Setting a New Course
 But Ms. Rice may well prevail more often than Mr. Powell did, given the broad trust Mr. Bush places in her.
 Mr. Bush told The Washington Post in an interview published Sunday that he expected Ms. Rice to embark on a campaign that ''explains our motives and explains our intentions,'' and added, ''There's no question we've got to continue to do a better job of explaining what America is all about.''
 Even some foreign policy experts who have been critical of Ms. Rice in the past say they see her selection of Robert B. Zoellick, the administration's top trade negotiator and a veteran diplomat, as deputy secretary of state as a sign that she intends to pursue a pragmatic, traditional Republican internationalist approach. 
 Administration officials say that Ms. Rice's choice of a colleague with expertise in trade and economic matters means that she realizes such issues will occupy much of her time, as they did Mr. Powell's, to his initial surprise. 
 Aides say Ms. Rice has also settled on R. Nicholas Burns, the current ambassador to NATO and a veteran Foreign Service officer, as under secretary for political affairs, the No.3 job, and is considering her friend Philip D. Zelikow, a historian at the University of Virginia who was staff director of the commission that investigated the Sept. 11 attacks and her co-author on a book about German reunification, for a job as counselor. 
 Since the start of the new year, Ms. Rice has begun each day at 6:45 a.m. in a ground-floor transition office at the State Department, a minute-and-a-half commute from her apartment at the Watergate, boning up on every aspect of policy.
 Senior officials there say she has made a favorable early impression among the diplomatic ranks as she has attended briefings intended to prepare her for her confirmation hearings.
 ''I think we just need to give her the benefit of the doubt and see how she carries out the responsibilities,'' said James B. Steinberg, who was deputy national security adviser in the Clinton administration and is now director of foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institution. ''I don't think one can draw conclusions from the role she played before as to how she's going to carry out the role of secretary of state, because they're just so different.''
 As national security adviser, and one of Mr. Bush's closest confidants and most frequent after-hours friends, Ms. Rice has held a position of extraordinary influence and trust. She began her relationship with Mr. Bush as foreign policy tutor in his 2000 campaign, and friends say she both helped to shape his views and -- especially after Sept. 11 -- came to anticipate his own goals and wishes, aligning herself with him in a process that often seemed nonverbal. 
 Ms. Rice herself insisted that she saw her role as ensuring that the president received a broad range of advice and options, not taking sides or shutting off debate. Now she will be one of the principal contenders in forming foreign policy and, after Mr. Bush himself, the most visible public embodiment of the United States abroad.
 ''I think the far more reliable approach to predicting the way Condi is going to take to this job both institutionally and substantively is by looking at what Condi does whenever she steps into a position of responsibility,'' said her friend Coit D. Blacker, director of the Institute for International Studies at Stanford and a former Russia specialist in the Clinton White House, who watched her transition from professor to provost, the No.2 position, at Stanford in the 1990's.
 ''I think we can expect her to be a strong, visible, articulate secretary of state who is going to do her best to function as the administration's chief foreign policy spokesman, and I mean that not only in terms of parroting whatever the White House has decided is policy, but in trying to elaborate a second-term foreign policy. She's going to be more reflective, she's going to be more expressive, she's going to stake out positions in ways she's felt constrained from doing.''

A Personal Drive
 Failure has always been unimaginable for Ms. Rice, who turned 50 last year. She was born in segregated Birmingham, Ala., to teachers who pressed her to excel in everything. She started piano lessons at age 3, was tutored in French and Spanish and spent time as a competitive figure skater and concert pianist before pursuing Russian history, earning a doctorate from the University of Denver and joining the Stanford political science faculty and the first President Bush's administration as a Soviet expert on the National Security Council staff as the cold war was ending.
 She is a football enthusiast, a fiend for physical fitness and a star-struck admirer of the comic Bernie Mac. She packs her own lunches to save money and calories in the White House mess, attends the weddings and keeps up with the families of her staff and has put aside her hope to return to academic life at Stanford for a second term by the president's side. 
 She has dismissed her early public image as the president's guide to foreign policy, insisting she has learned as much from him as he from her. 
 Indeed, friends say the hard-headed realism with which she began her tenure -- skeptical of Russia, intent on refocusing on great-power politics after what she saw as the touchy-feely diversions of the Clinton era -- has been tempered by Mr. Bush's ''transformational'' view of the power of American ideals in the world.
 Her aides point to her as the principal author of the administration's formal National Security Strategy, issued in 2002 and criticized at the time for its articulation of the nation's right to pre-emptive military action if needed. But the passage the White House chooses to emphasize now declares that ''America must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity.''
 Her relationship with Mr. Powell was complex and uneven. In the years when they were both out of government, she would sometimes stay with him and his wife, Alma, on visits to Washington, and he sometimes said he thought of her in a fatherly way.
 He preceded her as national security adviser in the Reagan administration, and clearly preferred her as his successor at the State Department to more hawkish candidates.
 By most accounts, Ms. Rice sided with Mr. Powell against administration hawks in pressing for multilateral negotiations aimed at curtailing nuclear programs in North Korea and Iran. But her critics contend that she did so without then providing either the kind of carrots or sustained attention that could have made real progress.

The Confidential Adviser
 And as always, Ms. Rice's most private -- and perhaps most decisive -- advice to the president remains largely a matter of conjecture because she declines to talk about it, and by law the national security adviser is not subject to Senate confirmation or questioning by Congress. 
 Only in response to pressure from the commission investigating the Sept. 11 attacks did Ms. Rice offer a public explanation of her role in the chain of bureaucratic and operational missteps across two administrations that failed to anticipate the attacks. One of her former aides, Richard A. Clarke, accused her in scathing terms of being insufficiently concerned about terrorist threats.
 But what, if anything, did she advise about troop strength in advance of the American invasion of Iraq, or planning for the postwar period? Only she and the president may know for certain. 
 At her confirmation hearings, aides say, they do not expect her to abandon her longstanding pledge of confidentiality of past advice, but she will speak expansively of her goals.
 One Republican senator who likes Ms. Rice but has sometimes disagreed with administration policy said he had warned her, using a football metaphor that she would quickly grasp, that in her new job, she would be much more exposed.
 ''You're going to be flushed out of that pocket all the time,'' the senator, speaking on the condition anonymity because he did not want to prejudge her confirmation, said he told her. ''You're going to be passing for first and 10, but you're going to be running most of the time you're throwing.''

Change Goes Both Ways
 David Rothkopf, author of ''Running the World,'' a history of the National Security Council to be published by PublicAffairs this spring, predicted that Ms. Rice was just as likely to be changed by her job at the State Department as she was to change the State Department.
 ''One of the true maxims of Washington is that where you sit is where you stand,'' said Mr. Rothkopf, who interviewed Ms. Rice for his book. ''She will soon find that instead of being surrounded by people in the White House who are thinking about the president's agenda all the time, she's surrounded by career Foreign Service officers in a massive bureaucracy that has its own agenda and its own traditions. 
 ''She's also a nice person, an open person, who will listen to those people, and be changed by them. And sooner or later, many of the State Department's initiatives will begin having her imprint, and she's going to have pride of authorship.''
 If Ms. Rice's management of the several dozen members of the National Security Council was not always seen as effective, her skills in running a huge bureaucracy will be tested in ways that even the powerful provost's post at Stanford did not. But at least one senior State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, expressed optimism.
 ''I think,'' the official said, ''we have a sense that we're at a moment in history with the president's agenda of fighting terrorism, building democracy, but also re-establishing relations with allies and dealing with the Middle East, when we feel like we're going to fit in.''

HEADLINE: No Call for Agency to Sell Fix For Social Security, Aide Says

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
A senior White House official said on Sunday that career employees of the Social Security Administration would not be asked to advocate ''any specific prescription'' for the program's financial problems, but he defended government efforts to convince people that the problems were severe.
 ''The Social Security Administration is an independent organization that has a duty to fulfill the obligations of making sure that checks go out, and the solvency of the actual system itself,'' said the official, Dan Bartlett, counselor to President Bush. ''There's no expectation that career employees would be asked to advocate on behalf of any specific prescription for Social Security. But one thing they can do, and what anybody can do, is to look at the numbers, and they're undeniable.'' 
 Mr. Bartlett made the comments on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press.''
 The administration says the Social Security trust fund will begin to run a cash deficit in 2018 and will be depleted by 2042, about 10 years earlier than estimated by the Congressional Budget Office. Current tax rates would then be sufficient to pay about 75 percent of scheduled benefits.
 Mr. Bush wants to allow workers to put some of their Social Security payroll taxes in private accounts that could be invested in stocks and corporate bonds. The president believes that ''personal accounts are a part of the solution to the problem, to help give people a greater sense of return,'' Mr. Bartlett said.
 A communications and marketing plan developed by the Social Security agency says employees should disseminate the message that ''Social Security's long-term financing problems are serious and need to be addressed soon.'' The plan says managers should ''discuss solvency issues at staff meetings,'' ''insert solvency messages in all Social Security publications'' and ''place articles on solvency in external publications.''
 The marketing plan came to light after another agency, the Education Department, confirmed that it had paid a conservative commentator, Armstrong Williams, to promote Mr. Bush's main education initiative, known as No Child Left Behind.
 Mr. Bartlett said the administration was conducting a review to see if other journalists had been paid to promote administration policies. ''The president has made very clear that there ought to be a bright line between journalism and advocacy,'' he said. 
 Mr. Bartlett added, ''We do believe we shouldn't be doing these things in the future because for appearance' sake, it does leave a cloud or a distinction over whether somebody is being a journalist or an advocate.'' 
 House Democrats asked the Government Accountability Office last week to identify all federal contracts with ''public relations firms, advertising agencies, media organizations and individual members of the media,'' to see if the contracts complied with a statutory ban on ''covert propaganda.''
 The Senate majority leader, Bill Frist, Republican of Tennessee, said on Sunday that the Social Security Administration should not be used for political purposes but should ''do a better job educating the American people.'' 
 On the ABC News program ''This Week,'' Dr. Frist said that a ''huge demographic tidal wave'' would hit the program in 2008, when the first baby boomers reach the age of 62 and can obtain benefits, reduced for early retirement.
 In a meeting last week with reporters from regional newspapers, Mr. Bush said that he wanted Congress to approve changes in Social Security in ''the first five months of this year.'' While Congress may not achieve that goal, Mr. Bartlett said on ''Fox News Sunday,'' ''the House and the Senate can take major action in the course of this spring''
 On Sunday news programs, Democratic members of Congress said Social Security faced manageable long-term financial problems, not a crisis. 
 Republicans harked back to comments by President Bill Clinton, who said, in a speech in February 1998, that the nation's economic and social gains were ''threatened by the looming fiscal crisis in Social Security.''
 Representative Rahm Emanuel, Democrat of Illinois, who worked as a Clinton aide, said on Sunday that Mr. Bush's proposals showed a fundamental difference between the parties. ''Democrats believe in individual retirement plans as a supplement to Social Security,'' Mr. Emanuel said. ''Republicans believe in individual retirement plans as a way to supplant Social Security.''
 The crisis, Mr. Emanuel said, is that many retirees may outlive their assets. ''Eighty percent of the workers in small business have no employer-based retirement plan,'' he said. ''Nearly 40 percent of households have no type of savings plan outside of Social Security.''
 Dr. Frist said any politicians who minimized Social Security's financial problems were ''flat-out wrong.''

HEADLINE: Fearing New York May Fall Behind, Senator Proposes Stem Cell Institute

BYLINE: By MIKE McINTIRE

 BODY:
Hoping to catch up to other states that are aggressively supporting research on embryonic stem cells, Democratic leaders in the New York Senate announced legislation yesterday that would commit $1 billion to a similar effort in New York.
 The proposal, offered by David A. Paterson, the Senate Democratic leader, calls for the creation of a New York stem cell institute to regulate research in the field, as well as make loans and grants to organizations and companies. It is similar to an initiative under way in California, which approved a $3 billion stem cell research fund last year, and to a $380 million proposal announced last week by New Jersey's acting governor, Richard J. Codey. 
 Mr. Paterson drew attention to California at a news conference at City Hall, saying its program, which is poised to begin making its first research grants within months, represents ''our chief competition.''
 ''Of course, New York still has an advantage because of our vast intellectual power and network of public and private universities, research centers and medical facilities,'' he said. ''But that gap is closing.''
 Senator Eric T. Schneiderman, a Manhattan Democrat, bluntly warned that New York stood to suffer economically if it did not act soon to support private-sector research initiatives. ''If the state of New York doesn't recognize the competitive need, our research scientists are all going to change their tune from 'I love New York' to 'California, Here I Come' in a very short period of time,'' he said. ''We have a very narrow window to meet the challenge.''
 Mr. Paterson made his announcement two days before Gov. George E. Pataki is to present his 2006 state budget proposal. The senator said that he hoped the governor, a Republican, would eventually include the money in the budget for the next fiscal year, which begins in April, but that the administration had not yet expressed an opinion on the matter. 
 Jennifer Meicht, a spokeswoman for the governor, said the administration would not comment on Mr. Paterson's proposal until it had reviewed it. ''Generally, the governor has been supportive of the concept of stem cell research,'' she said.
 Under Mr. Paterson's proposal, the state would borrow up to $1 billion over 10 years. Unless the governor includes funding for it in his budget, the project stands little chance of becoming reality. The initiative would require approval by voters in a referendum, which Mr. Paterson said he favored putting on the ballot later this year.
 With the state facing a projected $6 billion deficit next year, growing to $7.7 billion the year after that, it is unclear how much support there will be in Albany for adding hundreds of millions of dollars to the debt burden. Senator Liz Krueger, a Manhattan Democrat who has proposed a law to create ethical guidelines for stem cell research, said that the roughly $100 million a year to finance the institute was relatively small in the context of the state's $100 billion budget.
 Ms. Krueger said that while it was important that New York move quickly to provide financial incentives to the growing industry, it was imperative that the state not cede too much control to the private sector.
 ''I personally think that California, having moved its money to the table, made some mistakes in how they went forward,'' she said. ''To be honest, they didn't build in enough government oversight and control, and they may have in fact given too much of the decision-making to the biotech industries.''

HEADLINE: Festivities Give Scalpers A Field Day

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
So you want to go to the swearing-in, the parade or other inaugural events on Thursday? Good luck.
 You can check with the Presidential Inaugural Committee to see what is still available. (Not much, officials said.) Or you can poke around the Internet, where capitalism is alive and well through dozens of scalpers who are charging fantastic sums to see President Bush begin his second term. 
 One such entrepreneur, Yianni Konstantopoulos, a health care consultant with the World Bank, came up with plenty of tickets to offer for sale, including a prized pair for the bleachers opposite the presidential parade reviewing stand at the White House. Mr. Konstantopoulos said he obtained the pair at no cost from a friend who paid the face value, $250, for the two and is unable to attend. 
 Mr. Konstantopoulos is selling the tickets for $1,000, and it is perfectly legal in the District of Columbia, where scalping is banned only in public spaces. ''The way I see it, there's a lucrative opportunity in everything,'' Mr. Konstantopoulos said. ''And this is a historic event.''
 If it does not seem quite right, selling access to American history, get over it. The cachet of inaugural events, the limited number of tickets and their tightly controlled distribution has turned Inauguration Day into the political equivalent of Super Bowl Sunday.
 Most everybody who is anybody in Republican circles will probably be there. Even a few Democrats might show up.
 But the inaugural committee, the private group that coordinates events, has its priorities, and that means prominent Republicans, donors to Mr. Bush's re-election campaign and other friends of the administration enjoy prime consideration for prime tickets at the swearing-in ceremony at the Capitol and the parade along Pennsylvania Avenue.
 It is not entirely clear how much room is left over for the general public. A spokesman for the inaugural committee, Kevin Sheridan, said late last week that most events were ''rapidly approaching capacity.'' 
 For average citizens, the parade has been the favorite event, as hundreds of thousands of spectators have lined Pennsylvania Avenue over the years to watch the motorcade and the marching bands that follow.
 But with bleachers now taking up most of the prime viewing space -- seats were selling for as much as $125 -- the demand for unobscured access has intensified. On Friday, a coalition of protest groups sued the government, trying to open the parade route so that more of the common folk (and protesters) can see the parade.
 Through permits granted by the National Park Service, the inaugural committee controls all but a few patches of curbside space that have been given to a handful of other groups. And unlike the case four years ago, spectators will not be allowed to stand in front of the bleachers, reducing the chances for nonpaying spectators to get a clear view.
 Officials of the inaugural committee say the bleachers account for 40,000 seats, leaving room for 100,000 nonpaying spectators. But lawyers for the coalition argue that viewing areas for the public are well behind the curb and, in many cases, blocked by 14-foot-high bleachers. 
 ''This is a question of whether they can take America's Main Street and make a determination that only those with a politically approved viewpoint of the incoming administration has the right to be on it,'' said Mara Verheyden-Hilliard, a lawyer representing the coalition, known as Answer, which has permits for two areas of unobstructed view.
 Channing Phillips, a spokesman for the United States attorney for the District of Columbia, said lawyers were reviewing the accusations.
 Although scalping for inaugural events is nothing new, prices this year appear steeper than in years past, as Internet offerings seem to reflect.
 Mr. Konstantopoulos is hardly the only seller, although others would be hard-pressed to match his genius for securing a supply. Mindful that each senator receives 400 free tickets and each House member 200 for the swearing-in, he said he walked the halls of Congress last week, visiting Democratic lawmakers who were unlikely to have big demands from constituents. He collected more than 30 tickets that way.
 As Inauguration Day draws near, the Washington tickets section of the Web site Craigslist, where Mr. Konstantopoulos listed his parade seats under ''VIP Seating Bush Inauguration Tickets (1600 Pennsylvania),'' has become an enormously popular destination for those seeking tickets to inaugural events. 
 On Sunday, the list included a dozen solicitations alone for the Black Tie and Boots Ball, an unofficial private affair held every four years by the Texas State Society, an organization of Texans who live in Washington. Their party soars in popularity whenever someone named Bush occupies the White House.
 Tickets that cost $125 are available only to society members, and more than 10,000 people are expected on Wednesday night, including Mr. and Mrs. Bush. But sellers offered plenty of them for $600 each or more.
 One seller who asked $2,000 for two tickets, wrote: ''My price only gets higher starting today. If you don't believe that the ticket hounds have bought up all the tickets, than you are dumber than the Democrats who made this day possible.''

HEADLINE: Corporate Retreat, Moat Optional

BYLINE: By SHARON McDONNELL

 BODY:
When the American Bar Association sought a site for the president's reception during its annual meeting a few years ago, it chose the Tower of London, the palace and fortress for every British monarch from William the Conqueror in the 11th century to Henry VIII in the 16th. 
 The 3,000 lawyers and their guests dined outdoors on the Tower grounds and were entertained by the Band of Her Majesty's Welsh Guard, minstrels in Stuart-era costume performing on period instruments, and costumed singers of Tudor music. The lawyers and their spouses were also treated to private tours of the palace and viewings of the Crown Jewels, not to mention a demonstration of swordplay by knights in 15th-century armor.
 ''We thought it would be memorable -- it was part of a program full of highlights, like Prime Minister Tony Blair speaking to them at Royal Albert Hall and a garden party at Buckingham Palace,'' Martin Balogh, the bar association's director of meetings and travel, said of the Tower event, which cost about $400,000.
 Generally, the association holds its meetings in the United States, but it goes to London every 15 years or so because of the common history and legal system, Mr. Balogh said. The London trip was an optional add-on to its annual meeting in New York, which 13,000 people attended. 
 Built as fortresses to repel attackers, castles now have the welcome mat out for a different sort of invader, as American companies and associations rent them -- as well as palaces and manor houses -- for meetings, conferences, gala dinners, product introductions and incentive programs to reward or motivate employees or outside salespeople. 
 Buckingham Palace, Hampton Court Palace, Edinburgh Castle, Blenheim Palace and Leeds Castle in Britain; Versailles in France; and, in Vienna, the Schwarzenberg Palace, the Pallavicini Palace and the Hofburg (the former imperial palace of the Hapsburg dynasty) are only a few of Europe's magnificent spaces that have been rented by American companies or associations. 
 If event planners relish the grandeur of the royal residences, the owners welcome the income. ''We are a charity with no government funding or taxpayer money, so we need to earn money to preserve and maintain these properties,'' said Ann Wilson, sales manager of Historic Royal Palaces, the trust that manages the Tower of London and other properties.
 Among the others -- all available to rent for events for up to 800 guests -- are Hampton Court Palace, a lavish 14th-century structure that features Henry VIII's Great Hall; the Banqueting House, a 17th-century part of Whitehall Palace, famed for its Rubens ceiling; and Kensington Palace, the former home of Princess Diana and of Queen Victoria as a young princess, which houses the royal ceremonial dress collection.
 Historic Royal Palaces recently released a corporate gifts catalog that offers mementos like glassware, sterling silver cufflinks and silk ties with royal emblems. All can be customized for corporate use. 
 Catering to business travelers is a smart move, said Jeremy Brinkworth, director of VisitBritain's business-tourism unit. Only about one in six tourists is a business traveler, but they account for one-third of the money foreign visitors spend, he said.
 For a conference in September 2002, NetJets Inc., which sells shared ownerships in small corporate jets, chose Waddesdon Manor, a half-hour drive from Oxford and an hour and 15 minutes from London. Waddesdon is a mansion in the French Renaissance style, built for the Rothschild family in 1874, with a collection of 18th-century French furnishings and Sevres porcelain, 17th-century Dutch Old Masters, portraits by Gainsborough and Reynolds, and a parterre garden. 
 Warren E. Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, the parent company of NetJets, joined other top business leaders from the United States and Europe and government leaders to exchange ideas about the world economy, corporate governance and investment at the invitation-only event. Lord Rothschild, the fourth Baron Rothschild, attended the dinner for 75 in his mansion -- a rare occasion, as corporate events are usually held in the dairy and other separate buildings -- and the guests enjoyed a narrated wine tasting from his cellars, which hold 15,000 bottles from the family's vineyards in France.
 Waddesdon Manor was selected because of NetJets' international corporate clientele and because the chairman of its Europe division, Mark Booth, knew Lord Rothschild, said Kevin R. Russell, executive vice president of NetJets. 
 While some companies plan their own events to reward top performers, others hire meeting and incentive planning companies to do the job. Laura Vogel, a senior events manager at the Castle Group in Boston, booked Luttrellstown Castle, a 15th-century castle on a 560-acre estate near Dublin, for Symantec in 2003 and Microsoft in 2002. ''Sure, you can reward them with cash or a TV, but the memories tied to an experience like that are invaluable,'' Ms. Vogel said.
 Sometimes, even if they are still privately owned, castles play host to small groups for the night. For an automaker that wanted to reward top-selling American dealerships with an overseas car-related event, Mary T. Ryan, a senior sales planner at the Carlson Marketing Group in Minneapolis, booked a visit to Le Mans, the 24-hour sports car race near Paris. She also booked a stay at Chateau du Luart nearby for the dozen couples involved, plus dinner there with the castle's owner, a marquis, and the racing team. This event presented some unusual challenges.
 ''On incentive trips we look for consistency of rooms, but some rooms were round, since they were in a tower; one had a bed owned by Marie Antoinette; and some rooms lacked a bathroom and telephone, not to mention Internet access,'' said Ms. Ryan, who has also attended events at Versailles in the Hall of Battles and in the Hall of Mirrors, where the chief treaty ending World War I was signed. ''The expectation of many Americans, even if they are well-traveled, is a very high standard of conveniences,'' she said. ''We sent them letters that noted that this was a private residence, not to be confused with a five-star hotel.'' 
 Other castles have been converted to hotels with up-to-date amenities. Glenapp Castle in rural Ayrshire, Scotland, a turreted and towered mansion built in 1870, opened in 2000 as a Relais & Chateaux hotel that American insurance, financial and dot-com companies sometimes book for their exclusive use. All 17 rooms -- decorated in antiques, some featuring ornate cornice details and gas fireplaces -- have VCR and CD players, and telephones in the bedrooms and bathrooms.
 After Sept. 11, 2001, many companies planning incentive trips switched destinations to domestic or nearby foreign locations like Mexico and the Caribbean. But overseas incentive travel has come back in the last year to ''tried-and-true destinations like England, Ireland and Italy,'' said Ms. Ryan, the event planner. She said her clients were planning even more exotic corporate trips, to places like India, Africa and South America, for this year and 2006. 
 Sometimes a castle event is not purely celebratory. A team-building event for ad sales people at Elizabeth Castle on Jersey in the Channel Islands of Britain in 1996 involved using classic interrogation techniques in the dungeons to extract information from one person determined to withhold it. ''In client-sales relationships this comes up all the time,'' said Hamish Reid, general manager of the Jersey Conference Bureau.
 At that retreat, for IPC Media, Britain's biggest consumer magazine publisher, a highlight of the team-building exercises was the chance to rappel down rock faces. One woman dangled for 20 minutes after her rope locked.
 Still, castles and palaces exude a glamour that is hard to resist. ''It's been a childhood dream to do an event in a castle,'' said Gerald Haman, a partner in SolutionPeople, a creativity training firm in Chicago that led strategic planning sessions in Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire, England, for an American financial services company in 2001. ''The primary reason we choose an unusual location like this is to foster change -- it's the symbolism of not being in a box to think outside of the box,'' he said.
 Everyone has a personal vision of the exotic. Mr. Haman recently conducted training for BrainLab, a German software maker, which held its event not at one of the many castles in Germany, but at an Arizona dude ranch.

HEADLINE: Report Finds A Glut in Space For Meetings

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
American cities are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to build convention halls at a feverish pace, even as the convention industry is contracting and attendance is falling, according to a new report by the Brookings Institution. 
 The report comes as New York City, and more than three dozen other cities in the country, are seeking to expand their exhibit space or build new convention centers to capture new business, jobs and revenue. Last year, the State Legislature approved a $1.4 billion plan to add 575,000 square feet of meeting and exhibit space to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. 
 The Brookings report raises questions about the wisdom of joining the convention hall space race. ''You've got cities around the country building new or expanded convention space at a very rapid rate in a market that is already glutted and oversupplied,'' said Heywood Sanders, author of the report, ''Space Available: The Realities of Convention Centers as Economic Development Strategy.'' 
 ''In an environment where every major center around the country is sharply discounting rental rates or giving space away and throwing in incentives, the likelihood of any succeeding is remarkably dim,'' Mr. Sanders said.
 According to the Brookings report, the amount of exhibit space in the United States has jumped 51 percent since 1990, to 60.9 million square feet from 40.4 million. And today about 40 cities are planning to add a total of up to 7 million square feet of space.
 Yet the report indicates that attendance at the nation's 200 largest trade shows has been falling since it peaked in 1996 at 5.1 million. Computer and technology shows, the glamour segment of the industry in the 1990's, as well as mainstays like the National Hardware Show, have suffered declines. Even with a recent upturn, the report said attendance hit only 4.1 million in 2003. 
 The resulting competition was keen a couple of months ago when Deidre Ross scoured the country for an alternative location for the American Library Association's 2010 national conference. Members had complained about logistical problems at the group's meeting last June in Orlando, Fla., and wanted to go somewhere else in 2010.
 Ms. Ross, the library association's director of conference services, talked to officials at the Javits Center, who offered a hefty 40 percent discount on rent for space that could cost $770,000, according to an account in Library Journal. Negotiations are continuing.
 Philadelphia offered to cut its rent by $172,515, the penalty the association would have to pay for canceling its conference in Orlando. The Dallas convention center went a step further, offering to pay the penalty and provide a discount on rent.
 It is easy to see why cities are chasing convention and trade show business.
 ''We'll bring close to 25,000 people to a city,'' Ms. Ross said in a telephone interview from Boston, where she is attending the library association's midwinter conference. ''It isn't just the convention center and the hotel rooms. They're eating out, shopping, going out for drinks. Any city would be happy to have that many people coming for four or five days.''
 But at what cost, Mr. Sanders asked. Declining attendance is affecting small cities as well as major convention destinations like Chicago, New York, Atlanta and Orlando, he said. 
 ''Almost every convention center in the country operates at a loss, not even counting construction costs or debt,'' the report states.
 Executives at the Javits Center say it produces a modest operating surplus, but the numbers show it does not begin to cover $40 million in annual debt service.
 Robert V. Canton, director of PricewaterhouseCoopers's convention and tourism practice in Tampa, Fla., and a leading consultant in the field, dismissed the Brookings report as a ''one-sided'' view of the industry. The convention business tracks the economy, Mr. Canton said. But because so much space is now available, the occupancy rate at convention centers will not rebound as quickly as the economy.
 ''It's true there's been a lot of overbuilding,'' said Mr. Canton, whose company has done three studies for the Javits Center. ''Some communities had no business building or expanding convention facilities. But that's not to say that there aren't convention centers drawing delegates and dollars into communities that otherwise wouldn't be there.''
 In New York, the convention and visitors bureau, NYC & Company, said the Javits Center is currently operating at capacity, in part because New York is like no other city in the country. The bureau says the Javits has been hobbled by a dearth of meeting space, a shortcoming that will be remedied by the expansion. The city also plans to build a football stadium next to the Javits Center that would double as a midsize convention center. Advocates say that more exhibit space will allow the Javits more opportunities to attract more than one trade show at a time. 
 ''There will be horse trading going on between cities and convention centers as the amount of new space gets absorbed,'' said Jonathan M. Tisch, chairman of NYC & Company. ''But we're talking about New York City. Our projections show that the number of trade shows will increase, and we're poised to get more than our fair share of an expanding convention and trade show market.''
 Ms. Ross of the library association said her group was attracted by the Javits Center expansion of meeting space ''because we're such a meeting-intensive group.''
 Current trends have serious implications for smaller cities that do not attract visitors in great numbers, according to Mr. Sanders. But, he said, New York has not been immune. Overall attendance at Javits Center events rose to 2.5 million in 2003 from 1.7 million in 1999, according to a report by NYC & Company. The increase was fueled by a tripling in the number of people who went to public events like the auto and boat shows that draw visitors primarily from the New York metropolitan region.
 But that number masks a large drop in attendance at trade shows and conventions, which are coveted by economic development officials because they draw out-of town visitors who book hotel rooms and restaurant reservations. For those Javits shows, the number of attendees during the same five-year period fell by 25 percent, to 955,150.
 Convention and trade show delegates spend $362 a day on average, compared with $75 by ''day-trippers,'' according to a PricewaterhouseCoopers report for the Javits Center.
 The latest report from NYC & Company indicates that in the first nine months of 2004, attendance at public shows fell by 17.3 percent from a year earlier, and convention attendance dropped 11.2 percent.
 ''New York still has to compete with an enormous number of desirable destinations that can themselves expand convention center space at a remarkable rate,'' Mr. Sanders said.

HEADLINE: In China, a New Capitalist Beachhead

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SANYA, China 

 BODY:
China's leaders once tapped Hainan, this small sunny island off the southern coast of China, to be one of five experimental laboratories for capitalism. Hainan was supposed to compete to become a new Hong Kong, even a future Singapore. 
 But more than a decade later, even as China's hot economy bubbles over with success in places like Shanghai and Shenzhen, Hainan is, well, still an experiment, like a lone laggard. 
 It seems as though this place, despite its postcard-perfect views and year-round summer sheen, might be called one of China's earliest glitches on the road to capitalism, an isolated patch of somewhat undeveloped land that had once captured leadership attention, wads of cash and many talented Chinese wanting to strike it rich.
 ''The early 1990's experiment in Hainan was a failure,'' said Li Renjun, a professor of economics at Hainan University in Haikou, on the north coast of the island. ''It has taken Hainan almost 10 years to recover from that failure.'' 
 The vast sums of capital that flowed into Hainan never built factories or brought migrant workers to its shores, experts say. Instead, they mostly lured speculators, real estate developers and financiers -- many of whom dashed away when things began to collapse in the mid-1990's.
 But now Hainan is hoping to be reborn as a different sort of place; optimists here like to call it the next Hawaii. 
 Rather than buck the speculators' first instincts, officials here are trying to work with them. 
 After years of helter-skelter, boom-and-bust development, Hainan -- a province of eight million people -- is shedding its loftier ambitions of becoming an industrial center.
 It is still betting on property developers, but it is lowering its sights and rebranding itself as a playground for China's new rich. And in this reincarnation, it is finding some long-sought success.
 This tropical island in the South China Sea, just 13 miles off the China coast, is now busily erecting resort towns, golf courses, some multistory condos and low-rise villas. Not to mention a handful of mega-shopping malls. 
 Sanya, a former fishing village on the island's most scenic shores, has been transformed into a bustling tourist haven. Five-star hotels now cling to the beaches of this southern resort town, which each year plays host to the Miss World pageant.
 And a spectacular international conference center in a resort town called Bo'ao is being promoted as China's answer to Davos, Switzerland, where each January the annual World Economic Forum of business leaders, government officials, activists and intellectuals is held. 
 ''We want Hainan to be a vacation spot for China and the world,'' declares Zhu Huayou, a government official in Hainan's Foreign Affairs Office. ''Bali has done something that fits the needs of its customers. We want to do something similar here.''
 Few visitors will mistake Hainan for Bali, with its rich and traditional customs as a backdrop to hundreds of resorts catering to visitors from all over the world. But millions of tourists, mostly from China and Russia, are now beginning to frequent this relatively inexpensive and less-developed island of magnificent beaches and lush mountain landscapes. 
 Last year, more than 3.7 million tourists stayed in hotels in Hainan, a 20 percent increase from 2003, according to local tourism officials. 
 Investors have taken notice. Li Ka-shing, the Hong Kong billionaire, is scouting development projects here. And Citic Pacific, a huge Hong Kong conglomerate, plans to spend hundreds of millions of dollars over the next few years to develop residential and commercial property in Bo'ao. 
 Western hotels are coming, too. Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide -- the operator of Sheraton, Westin and W hotels -- has already opened one resort in Sanya and plans to open another in Haikou, the provincial capital. 
 Marriott International and Hilton Hotels are also newcomers. And so is Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts, which is planning a resort in Sanya, a village that three years ago did not have a single Western-operated hotel.
 ''Our target is to open up the expat and meetings market here,'' said Robert J. Lohrmann, general manager at the Sanya Marriott Resort and Spa. ''We see Sanya as a serious competitor to Bali and Phuket in the next five years.''
 Few Americans come to Hainan for vacation, of course. (Most who come this far visit Beijing or Shanghai instead.) Direct flights from the United States to Sanya are not available. Travelers have to transit through Hong Kong or Guangzhou. 
 But Hainan officials say the number of wealthy Chinese is growing rapidly, with an estimated 236,000 millionaires (in American dollars), according to Merrill Lynch. That's far more than in Russia and India combined, and a lot of that wealth has filtered down to hundreds of thousands of less affluent but increasingly comfortable Chinese.
 They are purchasing luxury items, buying cars and spending more on vacations. 
 Hoping to tap into that wealth, investors and government officials here are once again trying to engineer a real estate boom. 
 Indeed, hundreds of buildings that sat uncompleted for a decade, relics of the 1990's real estate bust, are finally coming to life in Haikou. 
 In the northwest part of town, construction is going on around the clock to build a crush of new high-rise developments with names like Sunshine Classics and Dragon Pearl New City. 
 Yet on some of the city's busiest streets, one can still see stretches of uncompleted buildings that stand out as eerie reminders of the previous boom.
 ''A lot of the buildings on this street went dark in '93,'' Hu Hui, deputy chief editor of The Securities Daily, a Haikou business newspaper, said as he drove down Guomao Road. ''You should have seen what this area looked like three years ago.'' 
 Today, luxury apartments along the sea are selling briskly for $80,000, according to local real estate brokers.
 For a brief time, in 1992, Hainan was China's fastest-growing economic region. People came from all over the country to make their riches in this free-wheeling capitalist outpost. Prostitution and underground gambling flourished. 
 But after 1993, when the government began to rein in some of the excesses, real estate prices plummeted and investors realized Hainan's economy was built on sand. 
 ''The growth of the real estate business was too rapid during those years, and certainly there was a bubble in it,'' said Professor Renjun at Hainan University. ''Officials hoped that Hainan would become a second Taiwan or Hong Kong, but that was just unrealistic.'' 
 Developers once sold apartments for as much as $1,500 a square meter, or about $150,000 for a comfortably sized apartment at a time when the average Chinese worker on Hainan made less than $250 a month. 
 Now, those same apartments sell for as little as $200 a square meter. And villas that were priced at $1 million are now listed at about $100,000. 
 The province's new freedoms, tax breaks and duty-free provisions also often gave rise to illegal car smuggling, government corruption and, for a brief time, even the opening of an illegal stock exchange. 
 State-backed real estate ventures flopped. And a series of scandals in the 1990's destroyed some of the province's biggest financial institutions. 
 Today, Hainan is no longer considered a pioneering province. Instead, it is a laggard in a nation of growing economic might; an island of lost opportunities. While other export-driven coastal provinces, like Zhejiang, Guangdong and Fujian are soaring, Hainan is in recovery. Indeed, of 31 regions with provincial status, Hainan's economic growth has ranked at or near the bottom in all but one of the last 10 years. Four times, it ranked dead last.
 Now, after a series of leadership shake-ups, Hainan's provincial government is looking to turn things around by pushing clean and sustainable growth. 
 ''Because of 1988 and the special policies, Hainan got really hot,'' said Mr. Zhu, in Hainan's foreign affairs office. ''Now, we don't think about it. We just want Hainan to have a good life quality and a good environment. Most important is protecting the environment.'' 
 But some residents here worry that tourism and real estate are not enough to sustain the local economy.
 ''Hainan doesn't have anything of its own, everything comes from outside,'' said Tang Fengyu, an entrepreneur in Haikou. ''People just wait for the central government to act. But they don't want to pollute, so how can it have industry?''
 Developers, however, are naturally more optimistic. They say foreigners, including Japanese, South Koreans and even some Americans, are now coming to Hainan to purchase vacation homes. 
 A growing number of wealthy Chinese are also looking for second homes. 
 Some evidence of that can be seen in Haikou, where Changxin, a Hong Kong developer, is building a huge apartment complex, 900 units surrounded by palm trees, miniature bridges, man-made lakes, waterfalls, lush tropical gardens and a Miami-style shopping street. 
 ''This was all developed this year,'' said Ning Bo, a sales agent at Changxin. ''And now we're 60 percent sold out on the first phase of the development.'' 
 Sanya is also marketing aggressively, with flags in English, Chinese and Russian trying to lure buyers to purchase expensive apartments and villas. 
 Still, many people in Haikou worry that the latest real estate boom could also be a mirage. 
 Developers who acquire land in China, after all, are required by law to start building within two years of acquiring their property. And so whether there are buyers or not, buildings here in China go up, suggesting pent-up demand. 
 Wen Ling, co-chief executive of Xing Ji Guang Yuan, a real estate advisory company, points to one building here that began as a hotel, then was converted into a residential building. But after two weeks of disappointing apartment sales, it was converted again -- this time into an office complex. 
 ''In Haikou, real estate development is really bad,'' Ms. Wen said. ''There's more apartments than people need. How many people can buy an apartment for $70,000?'' 
 Government officials and real estate specialists are quick to say that outsiders are willing to pay that much. And they say that with tighter credit and less speculation Hainan will avoid another bubble. 
 But tell that to Zhao Zhejun, a 36-year-old electrician who is dining at a makeshift restaurant that operates in the shell of an unfinished 14-story building in downtown Haikou. 
 ''There's a lot of work, but no money,'' he said. ''They tell us, 'We'll pay you after we sell the building,''' Mr. Zhao said as he fingered some tools and sipped green tea. ''This is all government money. They love to build buildings like this one that no one lives in. Only the developers see the money.''

HEADLINE: Harvard Chief Defends His Talk on Women

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
The president of Harvard University, Lawrence H. Summers, who offended some women at an academic conference last week by suggesting that innate differences in sex may explain why fewer women succeed in science and math careers, stood by his comments yesterday but said he regretted if they were misunderstood.
 ''I'm sorry for any misunderstanding but believe that raising questions, discussing multiple factors that may explain a difficult problem, and seeking to understand how they interrelate is vitally important,'' Dr. Summers said in an interview.
 Several women who participated in the conference said yesterday that they had been surprised or outraged by Dr. Summers's comments, and Denice D. Denton, the chancellor designate of the University of California, Santa Cruz, questioned Dr. Summers sharply during the conference, saying she needed to ''speak truth to power.'' 
 Nancy Hopkins, a professor of biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who once led an investigation of sex discrimination there that led to changes in hiring and promotion, walked out midway through Dr. Summers's remarks.
 ''When he started talking about innate differences in aptitude between men and women, I just couldn't breathe because this kind of bias makes me physically ill,'' Dr. Hopkins said. ''Let's not forget that people used to say that women couldn't drive an automobile.''
 The Boston Globe first reported yesterday about Dr. Summers's remarks and the stir they created. 
 Not all reactions were negative. Some female academics and the organizer of the two-day conference that Dr. Summers addressed on Friday at the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonprofit economic research organization in Cambridge, defended the remarks as a well-intentioned effort to speak candidly about the persistent underrepresentation of women in university departments of mathematics, engineering and physical sciences.
 ''A lot of people who absolutely disagreed with him were not irritated, and he said again and again, 'I'm here to provoke you,''' said Richard Freeman, an economics professor at Harvard who directs the bureau's labor studies program and invited Dr. Summers to speak. ''He's very good at stimulating debate, but he cares deeply about increasing diversity in the science and engineering workforces, especially since we have many more women getting Ph.D.'s in science and engineering than ever before.''
 About 50 academics from across the nation, many of them economists, participated in the conference, ''Diversifying the Science and Engineering Workforce: Women, Underrepresented Minorities, and their S. & E. Careers.'' Dr. Summers arrived after a morning session and addressed a working lunch, speaking without notes. No transcript was made because the conference was designed to be off-the-record so that participants could speak candidly without fear of public misunderstanding or disclosure later.
 In his presentation, Dr. Summers addressed the question of why so few women were on math and engineering faculties at top research universities.
 ''I began by saying that the whole issue of gender equality was profoundly important and that we are taking major steps at Harvard to combat passive discrimination,'' he recalled in yesterday's interview. ''Then I wanted to add some provocation to what I understand to be basically a social science discussion.''
 He discussed several factors that could help explain the underrepresentation of women. The first factor, he said, according to several participants, was that top positions on university math and engineering faculties require extraordinary commitments of time and energy, with many professors working 80-hour weeks in the same punishing schedules pursued by top lawyers, bankers and business executives. Few married women with children are willing to accept such sacrifices, he said.
 Dr. Hopkins said, ''I didn't disagree, but didn't like the way he presented that point because I like to work 80 hours a week, and I know a lot of women who work that hard.''
 In citing a second factor, Dr. Summers cited research showing that more high school boys than girls tend to score at very high and very low levels on standardized math tests, and that it was important to consider the possibility that such differences may stem from biological differences between the sexes.
 Dr. Freeman said, ''Men are taller than women, that comes from the biology, and Larry's view was that perhaps the dispersion in test scores could also come from the biology.'' 
 Dr. Summers said, ''I was trying to provoke discussion, and I certainly believe that there's been some move in the research away from believing that all these things are shaped only by socialization.''
 It was at this point in his presentation that Dr. Hopkins walked out, and shortly thereafter, Dr. Denton told the Harvard president that she believed his assertions had been contradicted by research materials presented at the conference. Dr. Summers said he responded that ''I didn't think for a moment that I had proven anything, but only that these are things that need to be studied.''
 A late phone call yesterday to Dr. Denton at the University of Washington, where she is the dean of engineering, was not returned.
 Paula E. Stephan, a professor of economics at Georgia State University, said Dr. Summers's remarks offended some participants, but not her. ''I think if you come to participate in a research conference,'' Dr. Stephan said, ''you should expect speakers to present hypotheses that you may not agree with and then discuss them on the basis of research findings.'' 
 Catherine Didion, a director of the International Network of Women Engineers and Scientists, said she was ''surprised by the provocation in tone and manner'' of Dr. Summers's remarks.
 ''Initially all of the questions were from women, and I think there was definitely a gender component to how people interpreted his remarks,'' Dr. Didion said. ''Male colleagues didn't say much afterwards and later said they felt his comments were being blown out of context. Female colleagues were on the whole surprised by his comments.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: January 20, 2005

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about remarks by Harvard's president, Lawrence H. Summers, suggesting that innate differences between the sexes may explain why fewer women succeed in science and math careers used an erroneous title for Catherine Didion, a director of the International Network of Women Engineers and Scientists, who said she was ''surprised by the provocation in tone and manner'' of the remarks. She does not have a doctorate.

HEADLINE: Cut in Hospitals' Medicare Payments Urged

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
An influential federal advisory panel has voted to recommend a cut in Medicare payments promised to hospitals and a freeze in payments to nursing homes and home care agencies next year. 
 The recommendations to Congress, approved by the panel last week, give powerful support to Republican lawmakers and Bush administration officials who want to curb soaring Medicare costs, as part of their overall effort to reduce the federal budget deficit.
 The panel, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, voted to recommend a 2.7 percent increase in Medicare payments to doctors. That is less than the expected increase in doctors' costs, but substantially more than doctors would get under current law. Because of a quirk in the Medicare formula, payments to doctors will be cut 5 percent next year if Congress takes no action. 
 Congress usually pays close attention to the advice it receives from the independent 17-member commission, composed of health policy experts, economists and providers of care. The panel will include the recommendations in its annual report to Congress in March.
 Medicare covers 41 million elderly and disabled people. The cost climbed 8.4 percent last year, to $300 billion, and is expected to increase 30 percent from 2005 to 2007, with the introduction of a drug benefit.
 Because of a new mandate from Congress, the panel drafted its recommendations to reward the most efficient hospitals, doctors and clinics. In effect, panel members said, Medicare payments have to be adequate to cover the costs of an efficiently run hospital, but not necessarily all the costs of an average or typical hospital.
 Under the new Medicare law, hospitals would receive higher Medicare payments in 2006 to keep pace with the rising costs of the goods and services they use. Hospitals were entitled to a 3.2 percent increase, based on an official estimate of those costs, measured by the ''hospital market basket index.''
 But the commission said Congress should reduce the update by four-tenths of a percentage point, so Medicare would increase payments for inpatient and outpatient hospital services by 2.8 percent. The panel said that could save Medicare as much as $800 million in 2006 and $6 billion over five years.
 The proposed freeze in Medicare payments to nursing homes would save $1 billion to $5 billion over five years, without hurting patients, the panel said. Freezing payments for home care services would save a similar amount, it said.
 The chairman of the commission, Glenn M. Hackbarth, said hospitals that consistently lost money on Medicare were, in many cases, ''poor performers,'' compared with other hospitals in the same markets. 
 ''Hospitals that have high costs and high rates of increase in costs may not meet the Congressional standard of efficient providers,'' Mr. Hackbarth said.
 Carmela S. Coyle, senior vice president of the American Hospital Association, said: ''We are very disappointed. The commission's own data show that the financial condition of hospitals is worsening and that hospitals lose money treating Medicare patients.''
 Ms. Coyle said, ''Congress may use this recommendation as a rationale for budget cuts that address the deficit, not Medicare policy.''
 Daniel Sisto, president of the Healthcare Association of New York State, which represents 220 nonprofit hospitals, said, ''We are outraged.'' He said he would be visiting every member of New York's Congressional delegation to argue that the cut would harm the quality of care.
 At a meeting on Dec. 9, the commission considered a draft recommendation saying Medicare should give hospitals a full allowance for inflation in 2006. But last week the panel changed course and recommended the smaller update. Hospital lobbyists said the commission had not explained or justified the change.
 One member of the commission, Ralph W. Muller, chief executive of the University of Pennsylvania Health System, advocated a full inflation update for hospitals, but was unable to get a vote on his proposal.
 ''Malpractice insurance premiums have been going up 30 percent to 40 percent a year for three years,'' Mr. Muller said. ''Nursing costs have been increasing because there's clear evidence that mortality is lower when hospitals have more nurses and better-educated nurses. Prescription drug costs have been going up 10 percent to 15 percent a year. Diagnostic imaging services have been going up at double-digit rates.''
 The commission expressed concern about the proliferation of imaging equipment and services in doctors' offices. Congress, it said, should direct the secretary of health and human services to set national standards for doctors who perform or interpret diagnostic imaging studies billed to Medicare.
 The standards would cover the training and education of doctors who bill Medicare for X-rays, CAT scans, PET scans, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, echocardiography and other imaging.
 Diagnostic imaging saves lives, the panel said, but poor quality studies can lead to repeat tests, misdiagnoses and improper treatment.
 Sheila P. Burke, a commission member, said this recommendation would take Medicare into a ''new world.'' Historically, she said, doctors have been licensed by states and certified by medical specialty boards.
 Mr. Hackbarth agreed. ''We are breaking new ground by suggesting that the secretary ought to set standards'' for some doctors, as he has long set standards for hospitals and nursing homes, he said.
 The panel also recommended an 18-month extension of a law that generally prohibits doctors from referring Medicare patients to new specialty hospitals in which the doctors have financial interests. The ban, scheduled to expire in June, would continue to Jan. 1, 2007.
 Many doctor-owned hospitals specialize in surgery, orthopedics or heart care. Proponents say they provide superior services.
 But the commission said that doctors who invested in such hospitals had a potential conflict of interest that could affect their clinical decisions. Moreover, it said, the hospitals tend to specialize in profitable services and cater to people whose condition is less severe than that of a typical patient treated for the same illness in a community hospital.

HEADLINE: No. 2 Prosecutor Heads for Private Practice

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
TRY playing and replaying the role of assistant district attorney for 32 years, not on some long-lived soap opera but for real, in New York City in an office where the boss, Robert M. Morgenthau, is a legend for his longevity and perspicacity. And where you've been around four years longer than him. And where the workload is incessant. For a fellow with prosecutorial instincts -- John W. Moscow would have wound up in investigative journalism had a college mentor not nudged him toward Harvard Law School -- this is the least boring job on earth.
 But after three decades of public service doing ''God's work,'' as Mr. Moscow calls it when he's been goaded into waxing sentimental about it, he has reluctantly abandoned Mr. Morgenthau and entered private practice for practical reasons. With a son at Yale, and another son about to enter college, his $149,000 salary doesn't stretch far enough. 
 What if he ends up defending the same culprits he's spent a career putting behind bars? Could happen.
 ''Everyone is entitled to a defense, but that doesn't mean it's a denial of the charges,'' he says, nervously rocking in a borrowed chair at his new firm, Rosner Moscow & Napierala, which shares space with another firm in a downtown high-rise near the Staten Island Ferry Terminal. 
 ''I have no trouble representing people accused of crimes,'' he adds. ''But there are a couple of people I would not represent.'' Mr. Moscow has a problem with liars, particularly white-collar liars. 
 ''These are people who are by and large well educated and choose to break the law for their own economic benefit,'' he says. ''There's something very reprehensible about someone using his educational skills to take away somebody's pension. Let me put it this way: White-collar criminals generally operate out of office buildings as opposed to the street, and I'd say you're going to steal more by swindling someone out of a pension than by taking money out of his wallet, right? I think of swindlers as being far more mischievous.''
 It is tempting to suspect that last year's muddled, and unresolved, prosecution of several white-collar officials from Tyco International drove Mr. Moscow out of public service. Mr. Moscow supervised the investigation into alleged fiscal malfeasance by L. Dennis Kozlowski, Tyco's chief executive, and Mark H. Swartz, its chief financial officer (the trial ended in a mistrial last spring) and personally handled the prosecution of Mark A. Belnick, Tyco's lawyer (Mr. Belnick was acquitted by a jury in July 2004). 
 ''We'll do it again,'' he vows, in regard to proving Mr. Kozlowski guilty, before remembering his new status. ''They'll do it again,'' he amends. The retrial of Mr. Kozlowski, scheduled to begin this week, will unfold without him. 
 But Mr. Moscow, a washed-out 56, with skin that hasn't seen enough fresh air and eyes that droop like deflated balloons, swears the Tyco case didn't drive him out of the district attorney's office, though it was ''intense.'' It kept him working 14-hour days, and kept him from blowing off steam on vacation chasing bass in the Finger Lakes, for the past two years. Were it not for Tyco, he would have switched jobs sooner. After sending both sons to private secondary school at Collegiate in Manhattan, his alma mater, the education kitty was already strained. But this case was too important. He seems to be deflecting disappointment.
 ''There was the same judge for both cases,'' he says of Judge Michael J. Obus, who presided over both Tyco trials ''and where he gets his rulings, I don't know. But complaining about a ruling is like complaining about the weather. Anyway, if you work in the D.A.'s office, you have to get used to winning some and losing some. Sure, there are people who can win every case, but that only happens when you don't bring difficult cases to court, or if you sell them out cheap.''
 MR. MORGENTHAU, the Manhattan district attorney, when contacted later by telephone, blames ''a screwball juror'' for the mistrial and blames the luck of the draw -- he says his offices loses 22 percent of the cases it prosecutes -- for the acquittal of Mr. Belnick. He understands, but isn't happy about, Mr. Moscow's departure. Not many lawyers stick around playing public servant for 30 years.
 ''He's a first-rate lawyer, a prodigious worker, and he's not afraid to take on difficult cases,'' says Mr. Morgenthau. ''He'll be missed.'' Away from the office, the boss gets culinary tips from his assistant. It seems Mr. Moscow is a good, and adventurous, cook who cultivates his own gooseberries. Now Mr. Morgenthau grows them too.
 Mr. Moscow, whose father was a political reporter for The New York Times before joining city government during the Wagner administration, graduated from Harvard Law School in 1972 and joined the complaints bureau of the Manhattan district attorney's office figuring to stay a couple of years. His first important case was a racially motivated homicide in Washington Square Park in 1976. In the 1980's he specialized in tax and securities fraud and later in international money laundering. He worked on the Bank of Credit and Commerce International scandal, conducting an investigation that led to B.C.C.I.'s closing, 16 convictions and the recovery of $1.65 billion. 
 His favorite criminal? A swindler named Richard Firestone. Mr. Moscow sent him to prison for selling fake tax shelters and was startled to receive a Christmas card. It said Joyeux Noel on the front, and inside was a picture of a man shackled to a wall with the words, ''Inmate #83-A-1057.'' Too funny. Mr. Moscow still has it.

HEADLINE: Foreign Shares Rise as American Markets Take a Holiday

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
European and Asian stocks started off the week in positive territory yesterday, amid quiet trading as the markets in the United States markets remained closed for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. 
 In Europe, Deutsche Borse's takeover battle for the London Stock Exchange dominated the day, with shares in the German company rising in Frankfurt after two of its shareholders voiced opposition to the plan.
 Otherwise, dealers said many markets were taking advantage of the long weekend in the United States to take a breather in anticipation of a number of corporate results expected today. Wall Street and other American financial markets will reopen today. 
 Traders said the markets were also watching world oil prices, reflecting concerns that rising violence in Iraq could push crude prices upward, resulting in another wave of equity selling.
 In Frankfurt, the DAX index of blue-chip stocks closed 0.3 percent higher at 4,245.51. Deutsche Borse, the German stock exchange operator, rose 4.1 percent in what dealers described as a relief rally on doubts that it would push ahead with plans to buy the rival London Stock Exchange. Two of Deutsche Borse shareholders, a British and an American fund, voiced opposition to the plans.
 In London, shares in the London Stock Exchange, which is holding parallel takeover talks with Euronext, closed 0.9 percent lower. Euronext operates the exchanges in Amsterdam, Brussels, Lisbon and Paris.
 London's FTSE-100 Share Index closed 0.5 percent higher at 4,846.7.
 In Paris the CAC-40 Index closed up 0.7 percent at 3,881.44, ahead of the unveiling today of the A380, the plane on which Airbus is betting its newfound status as the world's leading jet maker. Shares in European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, known as EADS, which owns 80 percent of Airbus, rose 2.3 percent.
 Thales, which makes electronics for the military, was up 0.4 percent after it said it expected increases in both revenue and earnings this year.
 The Dow Jones Stoxx 600 Index, which tracks Europe's 600 largest listed companies, closed 1.04 percent higher, at 254.03.
 Dealers said the markets were sitting back in anticipation of more news today, including profit results from the British supermarket chain Tesco and the music retailer HMV.
 Asian stock markets closed higher yesterday, with the key index rising for a second straight session in Tokyo and hitting a record high in Australia.
 Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 48.71 points, or 0.43 percent, to close at 11,487.10. On Friday, the index rose 80.17 points, or 0.71 percent.
 The Nikkei rose as investors snapped up issues related to the domestic economy, such as construction and banks, buoyed by Friday's release of strong November machinery orders data -- regarded as a leading indicator of corporate capital spending several months ahead.
 The construction giants Kajima Corporation and Maeda Corporation rose, as did selected telecommunication companies, like the KDDI Corporation.
 In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 126.87 points, or 0.94 percent, to 13,621.65. On Friday, the index had lost 78.50 points, or 0.57 percent. 
 In Europe, the dollar opened the week with minor gains on the euro, which was at $1.3071 in late trading after hitting $1.3127 during the day.
 The dollar was also up slightly against the Japanese yen, buying 101.93 yen, up from a five-year low of 101.81 yen on Friday.

HEADLINE: India's Choice

 BODY:
For an AIDS patient in a poor country lucky enough to get antiretroviral treatment, chances are that the pills that stave off death come from India. Generic knockoffs of AIDS drugs made by Indian manufacturers -- now treating patients in 200 countries -- have brought the price of antiretroviral therapy down to $140 a year from $12,000.
 That luck may soon run out. India has become the world's supplier of cheap AIDS drugs because it has the necessary raw materials and a thriving and sophisticated copycat drug industry made possible by laws that grant patents to the process of making medicines, rather than to the drugs themselves. But when India signed the World Trade Organization's agreement on intellectual property in 1994, it was required to institute patents on products by Jan. 1, 2005. These rules have little to do with free trade and more to do with the lobbying power of the American and European pharmaceutical industries. 
 India's government has issued rules that will effectively end the copycat industry for newer drugs. For the world's poor, this will be a double hit -- cutting off the supply of affordable medicines and removing the generic competition that drives down the cost of brand-name drugs.
 But there is still a chance to fix the flaws in these rules, because they are contained in a decree that must be approved by Parliament. Heavily influenced by multinational and Indian drug makers eager to sell patented medicines to India's huge middle class, the decree is so tilted toward the pharmaceutical industry that it does not even take advantage of rights countries enjoy under the W.T.O. to protect public health. 
 In November 2001, members of the World Trade Organization agreed that countries can issue compulsory licenses to permit generic production of patented drugs without the patent holder's agreement in order to protect public health, at home or abroad. But under the Indian decree, getting a compulsory license would be slow and difficult; each application would face a fight from multinational drug firms and the governments that do their bidding. India should adopt laws that expedite compulsory licenses, including allowing challenges to proceed after production begins instead of holding it up. In addition, India must close an important loophole affecting the sick overseas: under the current rules, Malawi, for example, could not import from India an inexpensive version of a medicine that is not under patent in Malawi. This needs to be changed.
 Industry lobbyists managed to insert two noxious provisions in the decree that go well beyond the W.T.O. rules. The decree would limit efforts to challenge patents before they take effect. Also, it is uncomfortably vague about whether companies could engage in ''evergreening'' -- extending their patents by switching from a capsule to a tablet, for example, or finding a new use for the product. This practice, a problem in America and elsewhere, extends monopolies and discourages innovation. 
 While some drugs -- those that existed before 1995 -- will always be off patent in India, some widely used drugs are at risk. So are new generations of much more expensive AIDS drugs that will soon be needed worldwide as resistance builds to current medicines. If the decree is not changed before Parliament approves it, it will be very difficult for India to supply them. India's parliamentarians must keep in mind that this arcane dispute is actually a crucial battleground for the health of hundreds of millions of people in India and worldwide.

HEADLINE: Technology Research Lab In Europe Prepares to Close

BYLINE: By BRIAN LAVERY

DATELINE: DUBLIN, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
Nearly five years after it opened in an old Guinness brewery building, Media Lab Europe, a research institution set up during the height of the dot-com boom by the Irish government and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, will close because of a chronic shortfall in financing.
 Media Lab Europe failed to attract enough private-sector sponsorships, deals under which a company would typically pay 160,000 euros ($209,000) to gain access to the lab's research in areas as diverse as online communities and electronic musical instruments played with hand gestures.
 The project, which envisaged a 10-year budget of 165 million euros, signed only eight corporate and public-sector partners, and only one, AOL Time Warner, has joined since 2003. In that year, the lab brought in 2.6 million euros -- half of it in a yearly stipend from the Irish government -- but running costs for its 60 researchers and staff exceeded 8 million euros. The board decided to close the lab before it runs out of cash later this year. 
 Initial plans for the European version imitated the Media Lab at M.I.T. in Cambridge, Mass., which then received about 90 percent of its financing from corporate sponsors. But in Europe, corporate sponsorships did not catch on.
 By 2004, the Dublin lab had begun to achieve a balance by tapping public organizations as well, Simon Jones, managing director of Media Lab Europe, said in an interview. ''A successful Media Lab must adapt to Europe,'' Mr. Jones said. ''You can't expect Europe to adapt to Media Lab.''
 Ireland remains an attractive destination for technology companies -- Amazon, Google and Intel have all expanded operations here within the last year -- but the lab's demise further erodes the country's effort to brand itself as a European Internet hub through prominent government-backed projects. The lab's closure may also offer some indication of the state of scientific research for institutions across Europe.
 ''The need for innovation is not being met by the top-down, highly bureaucratic and geopolitical funding offered by the E.U.,'' Nicholas Negroponte, Media Lab's founder, said in an e-mail interview. He said that he had hoped the Dublin operation would be ''a virus,'' spurring innovative research and prompting reviews of legislation like bankruptcy rules that handicap entrepreneurs. 
 Mr. Negroponte said he had discussed that potential role with politicians like Romano Prodi, the former president of the European Commission.
 Critics say that Media Lab's financial model was ill-suited to Europe, and especially Ireland, where potential sponsors are mostly subsidiaries of multinational corporations that lack the freedom to finance independent research. 
 Mr. Negroponte pointed out that the dot-com bubble burst almost immediately after the Dublin site opened, leaving the fledgling lab with no time to establish a financial base.
 In addition, the Irish government's contribution of 35.5 million euros to the lab's start-up created significant resentment among academics here. The Irish government also spent 22.5 million euros on the lab's home, and charged a token annual rent of 2 euros for the space in a stone warehouse where Guinness once stored hops for making beer.
 That site made Media Lab Europe the anchor tenant in a Dublin urban renewal project, but may have further isolated the organization from traditional research practices.
 ''At the time, there was very little research money available in Ireland,'' said Kevin Ryan, a computer science professor at the University of Limerick, where several academics were involved in collaborative projects with Media Lab Europe. ''We were all scrounging around for a few thousand here and a few thousand there.''
 Other academics said that Media Lab's slick image and the M.I.T. name won unfair levels of support from politicians like Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, who steered it through his own offices, rather than science departments and research agencies. 
 ''We certainly underestimated the time it would take to reach financial stability,'' Walter Bender, executive director of the Media Lab at M.I.T., wrote in an e-mail interview. ''More important, we underestimated the intangible cost of running a lab outside of the context of a university, where one can have ready access to students, who don't yet know the meaning of the word impossible and provide a natural churn.''

HEADLINE: Is the Steel Industry in a Boom or on a Bubble?

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
Last year was a banner year for the steel industry. Steel companies consolidated and reorganized while demand soared, pushing up prices for steel -- and for steel company stocks. Indeed, the Goldman Sachs index of steel companies was up 40 percent last year, with many of the stocks hitting record highs. 
 ''No question, but price hike announcements sent steel stocks way up,'' said Mark Mousseau, a research analyst at Thomson Financial. 
 So why is the investment community so divided over steel's future? Why do only 6 of the 16 Wall Street analysts who follow the industry have buy ratings on steel stocks -- and three of them have strong sells?
 As Merrill Lynch sees it, 2004 was a harbinger of good times to come. But CIBC World Markets, which downgraded the steel sector to underweight just last week, views the recent run-up in stock prices as the peak before the plunge.
 Investors are understandably torn. ''We're still bullish on the sector but we're already trying to identify when the game will be over,'' said Timothy M. Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management, which owns shares of US Steel.
 Andrew G. Sharkey III, president of the American Iron and Steel Institute, said such uncertainty was typical. ''Last year was extraordinary, but nobody has a crystal ball,'' he conceded. Everyone does have an opinion, though. And while nuances abound, the industry bulls and bears fall roughly into two schools of thought: the bulls say they believe that the domestic industry is in control of its own steel-making destiny, while the bears say that its fate is dependent on events that occur thousands of miles away.
 ''The health of the home industry is driven primarily by the U.S. market, and that means that steel prices are going to firm, even go up,'' said Aldo J. Mazzaferro, the bullish metals analyst at Goldman Sachs. 
 No way, counters Charles A. Bradford, his counterpart at Soleil Securities.
 Mr. Bradford put a sell recommendation on several steel companies in October. In the United States, he said, ''demand for steel was never as strong as everyone thought.'' As he sees it, neither the automobile nor the construction industries, which account for 50 percent of steel consumption, seem poised to soar.
 ''China was sucking up all the steel on the planet,'' he said, so ''customers feared shortages, and they bought double, triple what they needed.''
 Steel users are loath to predict their coming costs. ''The steel industry operates in a global marketplace, and with the volatility of the last few years, I would really hesitate to guess where prices will go,'' said Brian J. Lipke, chairman of Gibraltar Industries, which buys about 750,000 tons of steel a year. 
 Whatever happens, there's no imminent danger to most of the industry. Global steel production hit about 1.1 billion tons in 2004; American companies accounted for about 10 percent of that. Steel prices have dropped from their peak of $756 a ton in November, but they remain more than double the $300 a ton they commanded a year ago.
 China remains the wild card. It is the world's largest importer of steel, but its own steel production is growing even faster than its usage: it could easily switch from customer to formidable competitor soon.
 Indeed, for a few months last fall, China exported more steel than it imported. ''China is a huge swing factor, and if it becomes a long-term net exporter, you are going to see a whole bunch of new steel bankruptcies again,'' said Wilbur L. Ross, who spent the last few years buying up bankrupt steel companies to create his International Steel Group.
 Others worry that smaller nations like Brazil or Thailand will set up their own heavily subsidized steel companies, flooding the market with cheap steel. ''When an industry goes through a strong year like 2004, inevitably some countries respond by building their own steel mills,'' said Mr. Sharkey of the steel institute. 
 The North American steel industry is in far better shape to weather even the worst-case situation than it was just a few years ago. In 1998, just before low-cost steel started flooding American markets again, there were 90 solvent steel producers in North America. By 2003, 28 of them were in bankruptcy, as they kept producing steel for customers whose needs were already sated.
 ''You can't run a steel mill at part speed,'' Mr. Ross said, ''so if you don't have a way to cut out 5 percent of your production, you just keep producing.''
 Since then, some companies have disappeared, some have been acquired. Today, North America has 57 steel producers and only 3 are in bankruptcy. 
 ''This has gone from a widely fragmented, poorly run industry to one that is consolidated and financially disciplined,'' said Daniel A. Roling, the metals analyst at Merrill Lynch. 
 For steel investors, Mr. Ross's decision to sell to Mittal Steel of London for about $4.5 billion -- half in stock, half in cash -- could be especially telling. When the smart money is selling, do you want to be buying?
 But Mr. Ross had other reasons to make his move. Mittal has facilities in Eastern Europe, Mexico and other areas where International Steel Group is weak. Mr. Ross wanted badly to play in those markets -- but he did not want to add new capacity. 
 ''We were at a cost disadvantage competing with them, and we could never reproduce what they had,'' he said. Combining the two companies will yield the world's largest steel maker -- a spot held until now by the French company Arcelor -- with about $31.5 billion in annual revenues.
 But that's not the only reason Mr. Ross chose to hedge his bets. ''No one knows what will really happen to steel,'' he said, ''because no one really knows what will happen to the global economy.''

HEADLINE: Cheney Exercising Muscle on Domestic Policies

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON and ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
Vice President Dick Cheney is playing a potentially pivotal role in shaping the Bush administration's ambitious domestic agenda, supporting larger personal investment accounts for Social Security than many other Republicans and helping gauge how the White House should proceed on Capitol Hill, administration officials and associates of Mr. Cheney say. 
 On issues like Social Security and overhauling the tax code, they say Mr. Cheney tends to mix an instinct for free-market conservatism with a pragmatic knack for vote counting, being the former House member that he is. Although Mr. Cheney is most identified in the public mind with foreign policy, he has also begun assertively rebutting administration critics on domestic issues, as he did in a speech last week on Social Security, while he works behind the scenes to hold together an increasingly fractious Republican Party.
 As on Iraq and other foreign policy issues, Mr. Cheney's views on domestic matters tend to favor bold action even at the risk of short-term political backlash -- what his critics would consider overreaching, reinforcing President Bush's own instincts. But even as he usually favors conservative approaches to whatever issue is under consideration, he also has a realistic streak honed by his keen sense of what members of his party on Capitol Hill are willing and able to push through Congress and deliver to Mr. Bush's desk, people who have discussed domestic issues with him say. 
 On Social Security, Mr. Cheney, in internal administration discussions, has been advocating that the personal accounts Mr. Bush wants to create within the retirement system be at the large end of what has been under consideration, a position likely to hearten many conservatives in Congress who also want to establish the biggest possible accounts, they say. But he has also been supportive of benefit cuts that some conservatives are telling the White House would be political suicide.
 Mr. Cheney is going into the debate over how and whether to rewrite the tax code philosophically inclined to support a single-rate flat tax that would create incentives for more savings and investment, a position shared by many conservatives, Cheney associates say. But, drawing on his long experience as a member of Congress and his informal role as Mr. Bush's primary ambassador to Capitol Hill, he is aware that creating a new tax system might be politically unfeasible, they say, and would be supportive as well of taking steps to achieve the same incentives through changes to the existing progressive income tax system.
 Mr. Cheney's supporters say he has no desire to elbow aside cabinet secretaries or run economic policy day to day. They say Mr. Bush relies on him to step back from the politics of the day and look at policy choices from all angles, considering long-term effects and unintended consequences. John W. Snow, the Treasury secretary, said Mr. Cheney considered himself ''an extra set of helping hands.''
 But by all accounts, Mr. Cheney is deeply involved and discusses domestic policy with Mr. Bush at length. 
 ''They spend significant time on these issues,'' said I. Lewis Libby Jr., the vice president's chief of staff. ''They do discuss these issues with some specificity and detail.''
 Administration officials say Mr. Cheney sits in not only on nearly all policy discussions with Mr. Bush, but also some of those at lower levels, and he has lunch each Wednesday with the senior members of the administration's economic team to stay on top of things. He is the White House's main pipeline to Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, a friend since they both worked together in the Ford administration in the mid-1970's and someone whose support the administration needs for much of its agenda. Mr. Cheney is ''involved in everything,'' said Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff.
 Through his close ties to Republican lawmakers, especially in the House, he plays a central role in setting and carrying out the White House's legislative strategy on domestic matters -- a role that could be especially vital this year, given the reluctance of many Congressional Republicans to embrace changes to Social Security.
 ''When it comes to the art of the feasible, the art of the possible, he is one of the best legislative heads and best political heads in the country,'' Mr. Snow said.
 Mr. Cheney wields considerable influence over personnel issues, and late last year quietly helped shop around for a possible replacement for Mr. Snow before Mr. Bush decided to keep him on for the start of his second term, Republicans familiar with the situation said. 
 He has his own domestic policy staff, and consults frequently with outside economists. Most of all, he has Mr. Bush's ear, and often gets in the last word after all the president's other advisers have had their say.
 ''The way he influences the process depends on the issue and his interest in it,'' said Cesar V. Conda, who was Mr. Cheney's assistant for domestic policy for the first three years of the administration and is now a lobbyist in Washington. ''The most obvious way is he talks directly to the president.''
 In a White House that is still sensitive to any suggestion that the vice president is the puppet master, colleagues and supporters dismiss any suggestion that Mr. Cheney is calling the shots or that he is the de facto Treasury secretary. 
 ''He is a policy player,'' Mr. Card said, adding, ''He is not the penultimate player'' in decision making. 
 But there is little doubt that, by dint of the trust Mr. Bush puts in him, the experience and expertise he brings to many domestic issues and the sheer force of his personality that Mr. Cheney is more than just another adviser. Since 1969, Mr. Cheney has been a White House staff member and chief of staff, a member of Congress, defense secretary, chief executive of Halliburton and, as of Thursday, a two-term vice president.
 ''It's hard to think of any vice president who brings to the table the enormous wealth of experience that Dick Cheney has had,'' said Lawrence B. Lindsey, who was director of the White House's national economic council during Mr. Bush's first two years in office.
 Already, associates of the vice president say, he is flexing his muscles on Mr. Bush's top domestic priority, remaking the Social Security system to include personal investment accounts. 
 Mr. Cheney is said by associates to favor creating investment accounts into which workers could deposit 4 percent to 6 percent of their earnings that are subject to the Social Security payroll tax. That position puts him firmly in the camp counseling a more bolder approach than many other Republicans are contemplating. And after months of signals that Mr. Bush is likely to embrace accounts of a more modest size, it suggests there is less consensus within the White House about how to proceed than is widely presumed in Washington. But unlike many other proponents of large-scale private accounts, Mr. Cheney tends to favor coupling the creation of personal accounts with reductions in the scheduled government-paid benefit for future retirees, people who are familiar with his thinking say. They say he leans toward supporting a proposal already floated by the White House to alter the formula by which initial benefit levels for retirees are set from one based on the growth of wages throughout the economy to one based on increases in prices; since wages tend to grow faster than prices, the effect would be a substantial reduction in the guaranteed benefit relative to what is promised by current law.
 As he is on national security matters, Mr. Cheney is a professional worrier when it comes to the economy. In December 2000, he accurately warned of the impending recession at a time when conventional wisdom held that business conditions were still reasonably good. Over the past few years he was a major voice within the White House in calling for accelerating and expanding tax cuts, in part because of concern that the recovery had not fully taken hold, current and former administration officials and outside advisers say.
 Despite his reputation in recent years for exerting his influence primarily on post-Sept. 11 foreign policy, helping to manage domestic policy is in many ways the more natural outgrowth of his background.
 Once a candidate for a doctorate in political science, he went on to serve in several economic policy positions in the Nixon administration and became chief of staff in the Ford White House. During that time, friends say, he was scarred by what he considered one of the great policy mistakes of recent history, the imposition by President Richard M. Nixon of wage and price controls, a step that flew in the face of the conservative belief in free markets. 
 Over dinner one night in the mid-1970's, he watched Arthur B. Laffer, one of the earliest proponents of supply-side economics, sketch on a napkin a curve showing that, beyond a certain point, higher tax rates generate diminishing amounts of revenue by reducing incentives to work and invest. 
 It was one moment in the introduction to Washington of a new way of thinking about tax policy, and as with many Republicans of the time, Mr. Cheney became increasingly convinced in the late 1970's and early 1980's that lower taxes were the answer to unleashing the economy's potential for growth. 
 As a member of Congress from Wyoming from 1979 to 1989, he aligned himself with economic conservatives. In 1986, he even voted against the streamlining of the tax system championed by President Ronald Reagan, judging it not to do enough to promote economic growth even though it closed loopholes and lowered tax rates.
 ''He's predominantly a free-market thinker,'' said Lawrence Kudlow, a conservative economist and broadcaster who has met regularly with the vice president to discuss the economy and policy. ''He's always had a record of being a deregulator and a tax cutter. I wouldn't call him a supply sider, but he has some supply-side instincts.''
 In late 2002, Mr. Cheney was instrumental in the firing of Paul H. O'Neill as Treasury secretary. At the time, Mr. O'Neill was suggesting that the economy was relatively healthy and that the administration needed to turn its focus to the budget deficit and the government's long-term financial condition. Mr. Cheney, by contrast, saw the economy at the time as still struggling, and was eager to give it a jolt through additional tax cuts, even at the expense of increasing the deficit, people who were involved in the deliberations said.
 Within the administration, they said, there was a raging debate during that period about whether to call for accelerating the scheduled reductions in all personal income tax rates, or just those for the lower tax brackets. Along with Mr. Lindsey and several others, Mr. Cheney backed accelerating all the rate cuts, even if it exposed Mr. Bush to criticism that the move would unduly favor the wealthy, they said. 
 Mr. Cheney's stance, they said, was a major factor in Mr. Bush's final decision to call for cutting all the income tax rates immediately, as well as in the president's call as part of the same proposal in early 2003 to eliminate taxation of corporate dividends. Much of what Mr. Bush proposed ultimately became law.
 While Mr. Cheney's influence within the White House is considerable, he continues with his minimalist approach to public appearances, even when he takes on the classic vice-presidential role of attacking the administration's critics. There were no White House banners, slogans or music at the Social Security speech that Mr. Cheney gave on Thursday at Catholic University in Washington. Mr. Cheney simply walked to the podium, briefly thanked the university, dispensed with any warm-up jokes or anecdotes and went straight to the text of his speech. 
 He delivered his remarks in a monotone -- even when he predicted ''fiscal collapse'' for Social Security if something was not done -- finished within 15 minutes, then left the room without any handshaking or back-slapping.

HEADLINE: Add to Your Shopping Cart: A Trip to the Edge of Space

BYLINE: By By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Jeff Bezos sells books and practically everything else through Amazon.com, the company that made him a multibillionare. Will space be his next commercial frontier?
 Mr. Bezos, 41, announced last week that he would build an ''aerospace testing and operations center'' for his space company, Blue Origin, near tiny Van Horn, Tex., on 165,000 acres that he has bought. 
 Technology zillionaires have already bolstered the privately financed space race. Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft, paid the bills for aircraft designer Burt Rutan to develop SpaceShipOne, the craft that won the $10 million Ansari X Prize last year for reaching suborbital space. Others, including John Carmack, a legendary game designer, and Elon Musk, creator of PayPal, have formed ventures of their own.
 But few have been watched as closely as Blue Origin, which Mr. Bezos founded in Seattle and which has operated in deepest secrecy. Flight operations could begin in six to seven years with a planned ''sub-orbital space vehicle that will take off and land vertically to take three or more astronauts to the edge of space,'' the company said in its press release last week. ''Blue Origin's facilities could help make West Texas a center for private, space-related activities,'' Mr. Bezos said in the prepared statement.
 Mr. Bezos chose an unusual way to make the big announcement for his closely watched company: he gave the story to The Van Horn Advocate, the town's newspaper. 
 Larry D. Simpson, the editor, said Mr. Bezos bought the land more than a year ago and had visited several times a year with his family. ''And lo and behold, he comes in my office last Monday and says, 'We want to give you a news release.''' 
 Mr. Bezos told The Advocate that he spent his summers on his grandfather's ranch in South Texas, where he learned about self-reliance and perseverance -- and ''I hope to give my family the same experiences on my West Texas ranch now.'' 
 Bruce Hicks, a spokesman for Blue Origin, said the space facilities would be a ''very small'' part of the overall property, which was cobbled together from three ranches.
 Mr. Simpson said a spaceport would give a boost to the town of about 3,000 people. ''Up until now,'' he said, ''the main thrust of our economy is the Interstate.''

HEADLINE: U.S. IS PUNISHING 8 CHINESE FIRMS FOR AIDING IRAN

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 

 BODY:
The Bush administration imposed penalties this month against some of China's largest companies for aiding Iran's efforts to improve its ballistic missiles. The move is part of an effort by the White House and American intelligence agencies to identify and slow important elements of Iran's weapons programs. 
 The White House made no public announcement of the penalties, and the State Department placed a one-page notice on page 133 of the Federal Register early this month listing eight Chinese companies affected. The notice kept classified the nature of the technology they had exported.
 Since the Federal Register announcement, the penalties have been noted on some Web sites that concentrate on China and proliferation issues. 
 President Bush has repeatedly praised China for its help in seeking a diplomatic end to the North Korean nuclear standoff. Some officials in the administration speculated in the past week that the decision not to publicize the penalties might have been part of an effort not to jeopardize Chinese cooperation at a critical moment in the administration's effort to bring North Korea back to the negotiating table.
 China has repeatedly vowed to curb its sales of missile technology, starting with an agreement with the first Bush administration in 1992, and expanded with the Clinton administration in 2000.
 But two of the largest companies cited in the State Department's list, China Great Wall Industry Corporation and China North Industry Corporation, known as Norinco, have been repeatedly penalized for more than a decade; each is closely linked to the Chinese military.
 A third company on the penalties list, the China Aero-Technology Import and Export Corporation, or Catic, is one of the country's largest producers of military aircraft and was accused of diverting to military use sophisticated machine tools bought from McDonnell Douglas. Eighteen months ago, a senior State Department official, Paula A. DeSutter, referred to several of the companies as part of China's ''serial proliferator problem,'' and told a Congressional commission on relations between the United States and China that although the Chinese government had often repeated its opposition to missile proliferation, ''the reality has been quite different.''
 In the 1990's, Republicans in Congress began a series of investigations into China's efforts to obtain American nuclear technology and to export missile and nuclear expertise to Pakistan, Iran and possibly other nations. At the time, they sharply criticized the Clinton administration, accusing it of playing down Chinese offenses. Bush administration officials, when asked about the penalties over the past week, said nothing was particularly notable about the latest violations and that no evidence suggested that China's leadership was aware of the sales. 
 One senior American official said the transactions took place ''within the past year or 18 months,'' or well after the last American penalties were announced on Chinese sales to Iran, in July 2003.
 American officials said the list of exports to Iran was classified, but they described them as high-performance metals and components that are banned under the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000 because they could aid the country's efforts to extend the range of its missile fleet. It was unclear whether some of the technology was ''dual use,'' meaning that it could be used for civilian or military purposes.
 Iran's efforts to develop longer-distance missiles that are capable of ever larger payloads are increasingly of concern among intelligence officials. American officials have charged that Iran is trying to develop nuclear warheads, which its leadership denies. 
 ''We suspect that the Iranians also have the Chinese bomb design,'' a former senior American official said several months ago, referring to a design that Abdul Qadeer Khan, the Pakistani nuclear scientist, acquired from China, sold to Libya and was suspected of peddling elsewhere. ''What everyone is looking for is the missile that matches up with the design.''
 American intelligence agencies are focusing much energy, officials say, on identifying major sites for Iran's nuclear and missile programs. That information is collected, in part, to plan for possible military strikes, though President Bush has repeatedly said he is focusing on diplomacy to disarm Iran. 
 Still, Mr. Bush has also repeatedly said he would never summarily rule out any option in a crisis. In an interview broadcast Monday night by NBC News, when asked about using military action in Iran, he said, ''I hope we can solve it diplomatically, but I will never take any option off the table.'' 
 In an article in The New Yorker this week, titled ''The Coming Wars,'' Seymour M. Hersh reports that ''the administration has been conducting secret reconnaissance missions inside Iran at least since last summer.''
 He continued: ''Much of the focus is on the accumulation of intelligence and targeting information on Iranian nuclear, chemical and missile sites, both declared and suspected. The goal is to identify and isolate three dozen, and perhaps more, such targets that could be destroyed by precision strikes and short-term commando raids.'' 
 Administration officials said intelligence agencies had long worked to identify those sites, but they denied that more consideration was being given to striking those sites. 
 ''That's not the plan,'' a senior official said. ''In fact, a lot of energy is going into trying to keep the Israelis from getting ideas along those lines.'' 
 For now, some of the American intelligence is being provided to the International Atomic Energy Agency to spur it to conduct investigations in Iran. Last week, inspectors visited one such military site, called Parchin, where the United States says work may be under way to develop a nuclear warhead. 
 Although the agency took soil samples to determine whether nuclear materials had been present at the site, it has no jurisdiction over missile work, or any authority to enforce the Missile Technology Control Regime, a voluntary international agreement that regulates the sale of missile components and designs. Many of Iran's missiles are based on North Korean designs, and one North Korean company, Paeksan Associated Corporation, was penalized, with the eight Chinese companies. The penalties bar the companies from doing business with the United States government, and prevent them from obtaining export licenses allowing them to buy controlled technologies from American companies. Some of the penalized Chinese companies do little or no business with the United States, but Norinco, a maker of handguns and assault weapons, does millions of dollars of business here, and other companies are constantly in search of American technology.
 Some American businesses have argued that the penalties are often self-defeating, contributing to the huge trade gap with China but doing little to deter Chinese companies from exporting nuclear, chemical or missile technology to nuclear aspirants like Iran.
 A senior administration official, asked about the penalties, said Monday in an interview that the Chinese ''are moving in the right direction generally'' on proliferation and have stopped some exports to North Korea, including a chemical that could be used in reprocessing spent nuclear fuel into weapons.
 But the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the subject included intelligence matters, said that ''while they are helping us on North Korea, they have not been as helpful on Iran,'' perhaps because of China's ever expanding need for oil and other energy sources. 
 President Bush, the official said, was trying to make the point to Chinese officials that their companies ''are not going to be able to sustain the patterns of trade needed for strong economic growth and continued inward investment'' in China if they are repeatedly penalized for aiding Iran.
 But evidence is slight that previous penalties have seriously impeded the growth of the Chinese companies. In her testimony to the China commission, Ms. DeSutter, the senior State Department official, argued that Beijing's nonproliferation commitments of 1992, 1994, 1998, 2000 and, most recently, a specific set of export control rules issued by China in 2002 ''occurred only under the imminent threat, or in response to the actual imposition, of sanctions.''

HEADLINE: A Day for Dr. King, Sharpton and Politics

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN; Jim Rutenberg contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
The holiday to commemorate the life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. has become an important date on the political calendar of the city, a day when politicians of every stripe visit black churches to reach out to black voters.
 But this election year, the holiday served as the unofficial start of the race for mayor, and the seminal event of the day, the one program that few politicians dared to miss, the epicenter of the commemorating and electioneering, was the event organized by the Rev. Al Sharpton in Harlem. 
 They just kept coming -- Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his five Democratic rivals. United States Senator Charles E. Schumer. Representative Charles Rangel. State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. The City Council speaker, Gifford Miller. Andrew M. Cuomo, the former housing secretary. Even Mark Green, the former candidate for mayor in 2001 whose campaign was accused of distributing leaflets disparaging Mr. Sharpton in an attempt to undermine Fernando Ferrer in the primary.
 For Mr. Sharpton, Martin Luther King Day is almost tailor-made for his brand of politics, re-emphasizing the historic role of the church as a source of political and civil leadership for blacks, while allowing Mr. Sharpton to do what he does best, preach politics from the church pulpit.
 ''It is not enough to quote Dr. King,'' Mr. Sharpton said as his voice boomed throughout the Canaan Baptist Church of Christ. ''It is not enough to just remember him once a year. This can't be a drop by and talk to the colored folks once a year. This must be a real commitment for a society of fairness and integrity that Dr. King gave his life for.''
 That was the serious Mr. Sharpton. There was the strutting Mr. Sharpton, too.
 ''I don't know, Bloomberg,'' he said into the microphone as the stage filled up, ''maybe I should run, too.'' 
 In the end, it was a day not just to honor Dr. King's memory, but also to pay respects to Mr. Sharpton, whose political capital seems little diminished in spite of his poor showing as a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president. It is hard to know if officials and hopefuls turned out yesterday looking for Mr. Sharpton's endorsement, or just looking to avoid his opposition. But clearly they turned out. As he reached the church podium from backstage, Mr. Thompson, with a Cheshire grin, paid a slightly exaggerated bow to Mr. Sharpton.
 Mr. Sharpton used the event to promote a politics of unity for which he is not typically known. And that allowed for a unique moment in the city's politics, when political opponents and even personal enemies found themselves sitting side by side, indulging, even praising Mr. Sharpton. There was Mr. Ferrer smiling as he put his hands on Mr. Bloomberg's shoulder. Mr. Sharpton even joked about biting his tongue as he introduced Mr. Green, then joked again that he wouldn't let Mr. Green speak.
 Mr. Green just smiled a bit awkwardly and waved at the audience.
 When Mr. Bloomberg entered the stage there was a spontaneous, more than polite, burst of applause. Mr. Sharpton thanked the mayor for having attended the event each of the last four years. The mayor, who sat on stage patiently listening for more than half an hour as others spoke, gave a low-key speech about how the city was going in the right direction. But he couldn't let the moment pass without a nod to Mr. Sharpton.
 ''I picked up a lot of pointers watching Reverend Sharpton speak: how to project your voice, how to engage your audience and, most critical, the importance of having a full head of hair,'' Mr. Bloomberg said, drawing a hearty laugh.
 Mr. Bloomberg got his biggest applause when he talked about fixing education. He also spoke of creating jobs and affordable housing. But if his reception was polite, even at times generous, Councilman Charles Barron tore the crowd wide open. Mr. Barron, who represents parts of Brooklyn, and is also running for mayor, is a candidate from the mold of Mr. Sharpton, with little patience for poll-tested speeches.
 But he managed to reveal the weakness of Mr. Bloomberg's position among some black voters when Mr. Barron talked about the plan to build a sports stadium on the West Side of Manhattan. With three words, Mr. Barron summed up his critique of the mayor and it set the crowd on fire.
 ''Jets, Nets and the Olympics,'' Mr. Barron said, using those three terms to argue that the mayor's priorities were not their priorities.
 Mr. Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president, hit a similar note when he said of the Jets' desire for a new stadium and the mayor's plan to help pay for it: ''This is a private business. If they wish to have a stadium, let them pay for it themselves.''
 Other Democratic mayoral hopefuls, Mr. Miller, Representative Anthony Weiner and C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, sounded similar themes: that ''the city of opportunity'' of which the mayor had spoken at his State of the City speech, and again at the forum yesterday, was not a place where enough regular New Yorkers live.
 Similarly, Mr. Weiner, after complaining of high unemployment among city minorities, said that voters should be ''profoundly unsatisfied'' that ''the most innovative idea we can have is the big stadium, the big convention.'' Mr. Weiner also called upon his likely fellow Democratic opponents to stay united even as they battle each other. ''We should allow nothing to go on to drive a wedge between us,'' he said.
 Ms. Fields, the one mayoral candidate who actually went to a segregated school -- in Birmingham, Ala. -- but was the last to speak as the room emptied out, said she would fight ''so people that are getting left behind, left out, not included, have a chance.''
 She criticized the small number of minority workers in top city jobs.

HEADLINE: TRANSIT PROJECTS ARE PUT IN DOUBT BY PATAKI BUDGET

BYLINE: By AL BAKER and SEWELL CHAN; Al Baker reported from Albany for this article, and Sewell Chan from Manhattan.

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki proposed a $105.5 billion budget on Tuesday that would dedicate increases in taxes and fees to mass transit but leave in doubt the future of such major projects as the Second Avenue subway and Long Island Rail Road access to Grand Central Terminal.
 While the governor proposed spending $15.2 billion over five years to maintain the New York region's subways, buses and commuter railroads, he proposed ways to pay for only three years and suggested that the higher taxes and fees would pay for $3 billion of the total amount. He said he hoped that federal aid, private assistance and ''innovative financing mechanisms'' would help pay for the remaining two years of the plan.
 Over all, Mr. Pataki's budget seeks to close a projected $4.15 billion gap in the state budget, in part by making deep cuts in health care for the state's low-income and poor people, taxing hospitals and nursing homes and giving New York City only a fraction of the education aid a court-appointed panel said it deserved by next year. 
 Transit and civic groups sharply criticized the budget, saying it would cripple long-awaited transit projects while leaving the financing uncertain for maintenance and upgrades that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has described as essential. 
 New York City residents may be most interested in the governor's proposal to spend $2 billion for the Second Avenue subway and the railroad connection to Grand Central. The authority had asked for $3.7 billion to complete the railroad project and finish the first segment of the subway, from 125th to 63rd Streets, by about 2011. Supporters of the projects said the financing decision could mean that both are delayed until 2020 or later.
 ''This is not going to be done in my professional life and maybe not in my lifetime, which is very disappointing because the state's own economic forecasts can't be fulfilled,'' said Robert D. Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association, one of the city's oldest civic organizations.
 John F. Cape, the acting director of the state's Division of the Budget, acknowledged that the authority ''will continue to face challenges in the coming months and years,'' but he added, ''We are committed to working with them to ensure that they will meet the current and future needs of New York's commuters.''
 Other aides vigorously disputed the advocates' assertion that the subway and railroad projects would have to be delayed. 
 For the city and state university systems, the budget proposes to cut $137 million from operating costs at the senior colleges and gives the trustees the authority to offset those cuts by raising tuition.
 The governor would allow increasing tuition at the State University of New York by $500 and at the City University of New York by $250, and some Republicans and Democrats in the Legislature said the schools would have to use the entire increase because of the governor's changes. 
 In his budget address, delivered to lawmakers and officials in a theater at the Empire State Plaza, the governor said that the state was still facing serious economic trouble and that painful choices were needed to ''take the responsible, prudent path to fiscal stability.'' Under state law, the budget deadline is April 1, which Albany has failed to meet for 20 years in a row.
 He proposed about $700 million in tax increases, including a higher excise tax on wine, and he called for an extension of a tax on clothing and footwear priced under $110, a tax that was supposed to end on May 31. He also proposed to lower more quickly than planned surcharges on two categories of income: between $150,000 and $500,000 and those earning above $500,000. The change would cost the state $190 million in revenue. 
 Mr. Pataki said his tax cuts would encourage economic growth, but this proposal raised objections from one of the governor's chief antagonists, Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the State Assembly. ''This is all about the wealthy,'' said Mr. Silver, a Democrat. He added that the capital plan for the transportation authority was ''totally undefined,'' though it counts on increases in vehicle registration fees and the mortgage recording tax, which is paid by homeowners when they buy a home or refinance their mortgage. 
 The governor said his budget, the 11th of his tenure, increases state spending by 2.4 percent, which he said was less than the 2.7 percent rate of inflation. But that figure assumes that the state will spend $103 billion in the fiscal year ending March 31, although lawmakers had previously put the amount of this year's spending at about $101 billion. Aides to the governor said the spending increase was primarily caused by an accounting change that added the full $4.4 billion cost of the Health Care Reform Act to the state's regular operating budget. That program, which used money from tobacco industry settlements and other revenue to pay for several expensive but politically popular items, like hospital subsidies and health insurance for low-income workers, is set to expire on June 30. 
 Edmund J. McMahon, a policy analyst with the Manhattan Institute, a conservative policy group, said that spending was still too high in New York, with projected gaps of $2.7 billion in fiscal years 2007 and 2008. The governor proposes to increase spending of state funds -- exclusive of federal aid -- by 5.4 percent, Mr. McMahon said.
 In seeking to close the budget gap, the governor focused on health care and Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor, to trim nearly $1 billion in spending, including the reimbursement rates for the state's hospitals and nursing homes. That lower state spending would cause local cuts and lead to about $3 billion in reduced spending on health care across New York, said Jennifer Cunningham, the political director of 1199/S.E.I.U, the health care workers' union. That is because the state's contribution generates matching money from the federal government and localities.
 The governor was under increased pressure this year to comply with an order from the State Court of Appeals to increase school spending significantly to provide New York City's 1.1 million public students with a sound basic education. A court-appointed panel said that would mean about $1.4 billion in new funds for the city next year alone. In his budget, the governor proposed expanding video gambling to increase money aimed at educating the neediest children around the state. That fund would provide $325 million in the first year, which is the precise amount Mr. Pataki proposed last year.
 Beyond that, he proposed providing $4.7 billion in state, local and federal funds for New York City schools over five years, a plan that mirrors one that he submitted to a panel of court-appointed referees last fall, and which the panel rejected. That plan relies on tapping gambling revenues for $1.2 billion, relying on the federal government for $1 billion, and counting on the city to contribute $1.5 billion more, though the Bloomberg administration has vociferously resisted contributing any additional money.
 Michael Rebell, the executive director of the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, the group that brought the lawsuit that led to the court order, said of the governor's plan: ''It's an incredible rehash. It's a disappointment. This warmed-over budget plan has already been rejected by the Legislature.''
 Still, aides to the governor said his budget would increase state education aid to $15.9 billion next year, an increase of $526 million for the entire state and a number they contended was the largest increase any governor has ever proposed.
 ''My goal is to solve the question of how we fund those 207 high-needs districts without raising taxes on New Yorkers, and I've offered this as a solution, and I'm willing to listen to other nontax solutions, but I haven't seen them,'' the governor said.
 Mr. Pataki also called for allowing New York City to open an unlimited number of charter schools by exempting the city from a statewide limit of 100 such schools that was established in 1998. That limit threatened to be an obstacle for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in his effort to open 50 new charter schools and the city cheered the governor's comments yesterday. 
 ''We applaud the governor,'' said Michele McManus Higgins, a spokeswoman for Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein. ''Charter schools provide our children with additional educational opportunities, and we are pleased that we will be able to build upon our efforts and expand these much-needed opportunities for students in our city.''

HEADLINE: No Break in the Storm Over Harvard President's Words

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON and SARA RIMER

 BODY:
Members of a Harvard faculty committee that has examined the recruiting of professors who are women sent a protest letter yesterday to Lawrence H. Summers, the university's president, saying his recent statements about innate differences between the sexes would only make it harder to attract top candidates. 
 The committee told Mr. Summers that his remarks did not ''serve our institution well.'' 
 ''Indeed,'' the letter said, ''they serve to reinforce an institutional culture at Harvard that erects numerous barriers to improving the representation of women on the faculty, and to impede our current efforts to recruit top women scholars. They also send at best mixed signals to our high-achieving women students in Harvard College and in the graduate and professional schools.'' 
 The letter was one part of an outcry that continued to follow remarks Mr. Summers made Friday suggesting that biological differences between the sexes may be one explanation for why fewer women succeed in mathematic and science careers. 
 One university dean called the aftermath an ''intellectual tsunami,'' and some Harvard alumnae said they would suspend donations to the university.
 Perhaps the most outraged were prominent female professors at Harvard. 
 ''If you were a woman scientist and had two competing offers and knew that the president of Harvard didn't think that women scientists were as good as men, which one would you take?'' said Mary C. Waters, chairman of Harvard's sociology department, who with other faculty members has been pressing Mr. Summers to reverse a sharp decline in the hiring of tenured female professors during his administration.
 At the center of the storm, Mr. Summers posted a statement late Monday night on his Web page, saying that his comments at the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonprofit economic research organization in Cambridge had been misconstrued and pledging to continue efforts to ''attract and engage outstanding women scientists.''
 ''My aim at the conference was to underscore that the situation is likely the product of a variety of factors and that further research can help us better understand their interplay,'' he said. ''I do not presume to have confident answers, only the conviction that the harder we work to research and understand the situation, the better the prospects for long term success.''
 Mr. Summers also received support from Hanna H. Gray, a former president of the University of Chicago and a member of the Harvard Corporation, the university's governing body. Dr. Gray said she believed that Mr. Summers's remarks had been misinterpreted. 
 ''I think that Larry Summers is an excellent president of Harvard, firmly committed and deeply respectful of the role of women in universities and one who is anxious to strengthen and enhance that,'' she said.
 At Friday's conference, Mr. Summers discussed possible reasons so few women were on the science and engineering faculties at research universities, and he said he would be provocative. 
 Among his hypotheses were that faculty positions at elite universities required more time and energy than married women with children were willing to accept, that innate sex differences might leave women less capable of succeeding at the most advanced mathematics and that discrimination may also play a role, participants said. There was no transcript of his remarks.
 His remarks caused one professor to walk out and another to openly challenge them.
 In their letter to Mr. Summers, the standing committee on women, reproached him for thinking that he could speak as an individual and an economist at a small, private conference without it reflecting on the university. 
 They said it ''was obvious that the president of the university never speaks entirely as an individual, especially when that institution is Harvard and when the issue on the table is so highly charged.'' 
 On and off the campus, Mr. Summers's remarks were the subject of heated debate yesterday. 
 Denice D. Denton, the dean of engineering at the University of Washington who confronted Mr. Summers over his remarks at the conference, said that her phone had not stopped ringing and that she had received scores of e-mail messages on the subject. She said Mr. Summers's remarks might have put new energy into a longstanding effort to improve the status of women in the sciences. 
 ''I think they've provoked an intellectual tsunami,'' Dr. Denton said. 
 Howard Georgi, a physics professor and former chairman of the department, sent an e-mail message to Mr. Summers, saying he made a mistake in judgment in accepting the invitation to speak as a provoker. Dr. Georgi also sent a note to his students assuring them that they were appreciated. 
 Maud Lavin, who graduated from Harvard in the class of 1976, was one of the first women to take a demanding theoretical math sequence, Math 11 and Math 55, and is an associate professor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Ms Lavin said in an interview yesterday that she would not donate any more money to Harvard as long as Mr. Summers was president, after firing off an angry e-mail message to him.
 ''I am offended and furious about your remarks on women in science and mathematics,'' Ms. Lavin wrote. ''Arguments of innate gender difference in math are hogwash and indirectly serve to feed the virulent prejudices still alas very alive and now even more so due to your ill-informed remarks.''
 Students were also discussing the remarks. Thea Daniels, 21, a Harvard senior majoring in sociology said she and her roommates spent Monday evening talking about them. 
 ''We were just upset,'' Ms. Daniels said. ''It's disconcerting that the man who is supposed to have your best interest in mind and is the leader of your education community thinks less of us.''

HEADLINE: Israel Banks Called Lax on the Return Of Holocaust Funds

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
Israeli banks holding assets from European Jews killed in the Holocaust failed to make a determined effort to return the holdings to their heirs, and when they were returned, they were not returned at their proper value, according to a report of the Israeli Parliament, or Knesset, released Tuesday.
 The Israeli government, as custodian for a large part of the assets, also failed to make a serious effort to maintain their value or to return them to survivors or heirs, the report said.
 ''What we have discovered, in particular the attitude of the banks, has filled us with disgust,'' said the chairwoman of a parliamentary committee, Colette Avital, a Labor Party legislator.
 ''Neither the state nor the banks paid enough attention to this problem,'' Ms. Avital said. ''We don't think the state of Israel should act differently from what we've demanded from other countries.'' 
 Under pressure from the United States and Israel, the banks and governments of Switzerland and Austria have worked to disclose the accounts of those believed to be Holocaust victims and survivors, so assets can be returned to relatives. Switzerland, for example, agreed to pay compensation of $1.25 billion after more than 54,000 dormant accounts traced to World War II or earlier were found in Swiss banks.
 The Israeli report, after four years of investigation, found that 9,000 people or their heirs were eligible for compensation from the Israeli government and the banks, amounting to an estimated $31.5 million. Of those 9,000 names, about 6,000 were listed as victims of the Holocaust by Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust museum.
 Members of the committee called on Parliament to approve the report and pass legislation to put into effect the return of the assets to heirs, where they can be found, at a fair value.
 Where heirs cannot be found, the committee recommended using the money to benefit Holocaust survivors.
 The committee still intends to look into the real estate holdings in Israel of Holocaust survivors or victims. Some of the property, bought before the state was founded, would now be worth a great deal.
 The history of the Israeli assets is different from that of Switzerland, for example. Jews in Europe bought land and opened bank accounts in British Mandate Palestine from the 1920's on, to invest in the Zionist enterprise or to establish a nest egg for possible immigration by them or their children. The Anglo-Palestine Bank, for example, was founded in 1903 and later became Bank Leumi, which held by far the largest number of the accounts in question.
 After the outbreak of World War II, land and bank accounts held by Jews from countries under Nazi rule were seized by the British mandate government in Palestine as enemy property, and most of it was transferred to England and held by the British Custodian of Enemy Property. But the banks also hid some of their accounts, trying to protect their account holders.
 After the war and the establishment of the state of Israel, Britain paid back some $1.4 million in 1950 as compensation, and records of the accounts were turned over to the Israeli government, which set up its own custodian general's office.
 Some accounts were returned by the custodian, mostly at values that were not realistic. But many were not, and neither the custodian nor the banks, according to the committee, made serious efforts to find survivors or heirs. Nor did they manage the accounts properly, and their value eroded. According to the committee, the banks did not take sufficiently assiduous action to locate accounts even when asked to do so by Holocaust survivors or the heirs of Holocaust victims.
 The committee valued the accounts in two different ways: the initial assets indexed to inflation since World War II, plus either 3 percent interest or 4 percent interest through Sept. 30, 2004. With 3 percent interest, the committee found the state liable for $23 million in frozen accounts under its custodianship and the banks were responsible for a further $8.5 million. At 4 percent, the state's liability is about $133 million and the banks' liability is some $73 million. 
 Bank Leumi, Israel's second-largest bank, is responsible for about 95 percent of the banks' liabilities. Four other banks are responsible for the rest.
 Bank Leumi issued a statement saying that it had cooperated fully with the committee's efforts to trace the accounts. Yona Fogel, an executive vice president, told The Jerusalem Post that if the report was based ''on factual evidence, we will not fight it.'' 
 The bank has not held any such accounts for decades, Mr. Fogel said. ''We will cooperate with every legal process aimed at aiding Holocaust survivors,'' he said.
 Ms. Avital, the committee chairwoman, said: ''There was no intentional act to keep people from getting their money. But there was callousness and insensitivity.''
 Efraim Zuroff, the Israel director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, called the report ''a sad commentary on the inability or unwillingness of Israel to deal with these issues, while demanding that other countries do so.''
 He criticized the attitude of the state's business and political leaders. ''The powers that be have been stonewalling this again and again,'' Mr. Zuroff said. ''This is only a committee report, a revelation of the scope of the problem. This is not the Knesset passing a law forcing the banks and the custodian to return the money. For that, there has to be political will.''
 A copy of the report and a list of the account holders is online in English at: http//www.knesset.gov.il/committees/eng/docs/shoa--finalreport--eng.htm.

HEADLINE: The Japan-China Stew: Sweet and Sour

BYLINE: By Norimitsu Onishi

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 16 

 BODY:
Like many Japanese businessmen these days, but particularly as co-chairman of the 21st Century Committee for Japan-China Friendship, Yotaro Kobayashi is worried about the state of affairs between Asia's two most powerful nations.
 On one hand, since the committee was formed in October 2003 under an agreement between the countries, Mr. Kobayashi, 71, who is also chairman of Fuji Xerox, has watched political relations fall to their lowest point in years. On the other hand, economic ties have continued to deepen, and China's rise has kept buoying up the Japanese economy. 
 ''Japan Inc.,'' the voguish term of the 1980's that described an economic juggernaut in which politicians, businessmen and bureaucrats moved in balletic unison, may have never been completely accurate. But as Japan confronts two realities -- the rise of China's economy and its rise as a political and military power -- the term may become history once and for all. 
 In Japan today China has come to be regarded as a partner by the business class and a rival, if not outright adversary, by the political class. Indeed, the dichotomy in Japan's view toward China has widened to such an extent that, in recent months, leading businessmen have begun publicly expressing misgivings about Tokyo's policy toward Beijing: bad politics is hurting business.
 A flash point has been Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's continued visits to the Yasukuni Shrine here, where Japanese war dead are venerated along with Class A war criminals. Chinese leaders have demanded that he stop, essentially making that a condition for full-fledged Japanese participation in the world's most coveted market. For China, the visits symbolize Japan's lack of repentance over its militarist past, which includes the brutal colonization of Manchuria and the infamous ''Rape of Nanjing,'' in which between 100,000 and 300,000 Chinese were massacred.
 ''Prime Minister Koizumi's visits to the Yasukuni Shrine could spread negative views about Japan and cause adverse effects on Japanese companies' activities'' in China, Kakutaro Kitashiro, chief of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives and chairman of I.B.M. Japan, said at a recent news conference.
 After a meeting of his committee in September, Mr. Kobayashi, expressing a personal view, said the ''visits are rubbing against the grain of Chinese people's sentiments and are also preventing Japan and China from having a summit meeting.''
 After that comment, hard-line nationalist groups flooded Mr. Kobayashi's office with angry faxes and harassed his home with loudspeakers.
 The factors that are tearing apart Japan Inc. are only gathering strength, beginning with China's exploding economy. 
 Indeed, with Japanese exports to China growing at a 20 percent annual rate in recent months, China is set to replace the United States as Japan's largest trading partner. Companies ranging from Canon to Matsushita Electrical Industrial, the maker of Panasonic brand products, are building factories in China and posting an increasingly larger share of their Japanese employees there. The recent recovery of Japan's economy would have been impossible without growth in China, economists agree, and it could quickly deflate with a Chinese downturn.
 ''Rather than seeing China's economic growth simply as a threat, as it once was, the view to take it as a challenge and chance is emerging recently,'' Mr. Kobayashi said. ''In fact, this is one of the major elements that has been supporting the Japanese economy for the last few years.''
 In stark contrast, political ties are described as plumbing some of the lowest depths since relations were normalized in 1972. An unfortunate turning point was reached at last year's Asian Cup soccer final in Beijing when young Chinese fans -- emboldened by an anti-Japanese nationalism and angered by the Yasukuni visits -- aggressively harassed Japanese fans.
 A series of incidents followed, each making matters worse. In November, a Chinese Navy nuclear submarine intruded into Japanese waters. To the surprise and delight of Japanese conservatives, as well as United States officials who want Tokyo to act more assertively against Beijing, Japan chased the submarine and criticized China.
 At a meeting later in Santiago, Chile, President Hu Jintao urged Mr. Koizumi to stop visiting Yasukuni; so far, the Japanese leader has kept his intentions vague. Calls are also rising here for Tokyo to cut aid to China -- Mr. Koizumi said it was time for China to ''graduate'' from Japanese assistance -- drawing protests from Chinese officials, who have always considered the aid more like de facto war reparations.
 Last month, Tokyo took two steps that would have been unthinkable a few years ago. In a rare adjustment of its National Defense Program Outline, Japan described China as a potential threat, drawing condemnation from Beijing. Then the Japanese government capped the year by granting a visa to Lee Teng-hui, the former Taiwan president, for a private visit, a move that infuriated the Chinese.
 ''I wonder if it's Japan's strategy to worsen its relationship with China,'' Huang Xingyuan, a counselor at the Chinese Embassy here, said in a recent interview. What Japan may have intended as a new show of power, Mr. Huang said, would lead to both sides losing.
 In keeping with Beijing's strategy toward Tokyo, Mr. Huang quickly made the link between politics and business. In October, China closed a deal to buy $1.4 billion worth of trains. 
 ''For China, it was ideal to buy them all from Japan in terms of technology and maintenance,'' Mr. Huang said. ''But given Chinese political sentiment -- the people's opposition was too strong -- we could give only half of the project to Japan.''

HEADLINE: Empire State Building to Update Its Tourist Experience

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
It is not easy to change a building that is so famous that mail from around the world finds its way to ''the Empire State Building'' without a city or country in the address. 
 But the managers of the building have decided that, landmark or not, it is time to update some aspects of the building at 350 Fifth Avenue so that tourists have a better time when they visit. 
 The view, just about everyone agrees, is terrific from the 86th-floor observation deck. But visitors are often treated more like cattle than people, forced to wait in long lines in a hot basement to board the elevators to the top floor. 
 That will begin to change this spring. The waiting areas will be transformed with additional security checkpoints and ticket windows to minimize delays and add a dash of entertainment for those who wait. 
 The managers have hired BRC Imagination Arts which has extensive experience in theme park and museum design, to create tourist-friendly attractions within the building, and the two parties recently held a daylong meeting to produce specific plans.
 Among other things, it was decided that starting in the spring, visitors will not be sent to the basement but will instead go up an escalator to a waiting area on the air-conditioned second floor. Not much can be done about the carrying capacity of the elevators to the 80th floor, so the waiting will remain, but in an area that offers entertainment focusing on the building's history and its connections with celebrities. Technology that projects images on the floor in a darkened room will try to give visitors the illusion that they are standing on a girder 50 stories high during the construction of the building in the 1930's.
 The 80th floor is the upper limit of the building's high-speed elevators. There, visitors have to wait for slower elevators to complete the trip to the top, causing a buildup of people in the corridors.
 To break up the long lines, the waiting area will be divided into a series of connecting rooms where plasma screens and other visual devices will tell the story of the construction of the building and will show excerpts from films that use it as a backdrop. ''The different areas can change an hour wait into six different 10-minute waits,'' said Bob Rogers, the chairman of BRC. 
 In 2006, the 80th and 86th floors will also be remodeled, although not much will change on the famous open-air viewing area on the 86th floor. The paneled office of the building's first manager, Alfred E. Smith, the former governor of New York who was the Democratic candidate for president in 1928, is to be incorporated into the 80th-floor holding area, possibly with animated depictions of Mr. Smith. 
 A gift shop that now interferes with traffic flow on the 86th floor will be moved to the 80th floor as tenants are moved elsewhere and more tourist-oriented retailing is added.
 Bathrooms will also be added during the upper-floor renovations, which are planned for January through March, when there are fewer visitors. According to Mr. Rogers, whose company specializes in designing entertainment centers, when a tour bus pulls up to an attraction, finding a bathroom is the matter uppermost on the minds of at least 7 percent of passengers.
 Some 3.6 million people visited the Empire State Building last year, and the total has been rising in recent years. Although one visitor wrote on an Internet opinion site that the wait for elevators was equivalent to being in the ''seventh level of hell,'' surveys of visitors to the observatory, conducted last June, indicated that most were pleased with the experience. 
 ''In spite of the lines, 75 percent of visitors rate it as a positive experience,'' said Anthony E. Malkin, the president of Wien & Malkin, which has day-to-day control of the building. ''We want to improve on that.''
 The building is owned by partnerships led by Peter Malkin, the chairman of Wien & Malkin, who is Anthony's father, and is controlled by a lease held by Mr. Malkin and Leona Helmsley as a result of the role her husband, Harry Helmsley, had in purchasing the building.
 Mr. Malkin said the other managers deliberated seriously before deciding to change the building. ''We started thinking about this about five years ago, but it took a while to recapture the space on the second floor and to find a designer who could work with us,'' Mr. Malkin said. 
 BRC, which is based in Burbank, Calif., has done projects for Disney, General Motors and NASA and designed the Texas State History Museum in Austin and the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, Ill. 
 In addition to improving the tourist experience, Mr. Malkin said, the redesign is intended to separate tourists from the 15,000 people who work each day in the building, which has 2.7 million square feet of office space. 
 The building is one of the few prime tourist destinations that is a major business site, as well. ''It's like operating the Statue of Liberty on top of the MetLife Building,'' Mr. Malkin said. Having tourists in flip-flops and fussy children mixing in the lobby with tenants and their visitors can be a detriment to office leasing, real estate executives said.
 In spite of its importance as an office building, the Empire State Building has always been, above all, an attraction. It was for a long time the world's tallest building, built by John J. Raskob, a former executive of General Motors, specifically to be taller than Walter P. Chrysler's building on 42nd Street.
 It is 1,250 feet to the tip of the ''mooring mast,'' which was supposed to be an anchoring point for the dirigibles that were once seen as the future of air travel. In fact, updrafts caused by the artificial canyons of Manhattan made such dockings impossible.
 The building was constructed with astonishing speed in the early days of the Depression, when labor and materials were readily available, taking just one year and 45 days before the opening on May 1, 1931. During construction, rails were installed on 34th Street to move the steel columns and beams; according to legend, they arrived still warm from mills in Pittsburgh.
 Because it opened at a time the economy of the country was contracting, tenants were scarce in the early days and it was frequently referred to as the ''Empty State Building.'' That made the observation deck an important contributor to the building's finances, a situation that continues to this day. The funds go to operate and renovate the building. 
 In those early days, Mr. Smith used his connections to lure dignitaries, including Winston Churchill, Albert Einstein and aspiring movie actresses, to the observation deck, and photographs of them taking in the sights were widely circulated in newsreels, newspapers and magazines.
 Promotions on the observation deck have included mass weddings on Valentine's Day and overnight campouts by scout troops. Some of these have been de-emphasized as security concerns have heightened and tourist traffic increased, but the buildings colored lights have increasingly been used to support various causes. Building officials reported there were 140 special lightings last year, with green lights for St. Patrick's Day, for example, and blue and white for a day celebrating the United Nations.
 The building has also been a backdrop to dozens of movies. ''King Kong'' was the most famous, of course, but others include ''An Affair to Remember'' and ''Sleepless in Seattle.''
 If they succeed in improving the tourist experience with shorter lines and more entertainment, building officials are hoping to increase tour prices, currently $12 for adults, toward $20. Also under consideration is a V.I.P. tour that would bypass the waiting entirely and visit the currently unused observatory on the 102nd floor.

HEADLINE: Squeaky Wheels, Crying Out for a Smoother Ride

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: FAIRFIELD, Conn. 

 BODY:
CHANCES are that even if Jill Kelly hadn't charged into her bridge game 16 months ago complaining about a near-death experience on Interstate 95, the Connecticut General Assembly would still be forced to grapple this year with the royal mess that is Connecticut transportation.
 Still, given how far things have deteriorated, every bit helps. So when an agitated array of commuters and fellow travelers descend on Hartford today to plead for action on Connecticut's lousy trains and clotted roads, they can thank years of inaction and Mrs. Kelly's bad night out for playing a role in finally rousing them toward action. 
 Mrs. Kelly, a former selectwoman in this Fairfield County town, was driving on I-95 from Bridgeport to Fairfield around 5:30 on a rainy afternoon in September 2003 when she found herself in one of those exercises in trompe l'oeil driving, where the lines on the highway have been changed to the point you really can't tell which lane you're supposed to be in. Her Volvo was nearly forced off the road by a speeding bus in the next lane, leaving her both frightened and angry. ''It scared the heart out of me,'' she said. ''I just thought, 'This is not how I'm going to die.''' 
 When she vented about it at her bridge game the next night, Carol Leighton listened. The next day, Mrs. Leighton called and said, ''You know, Jill, we really ought to do something about this.''
 Thus was born the Connecticut Citizens Transportation Lobby, which soon expanded its purview from roads to rails, barges and whatever else can move people and freight efficiently. Today, the group and allies in the League of Women Voters, Sierra Club, a transit group called All Aboard! and others will bring a busload of people from Fairfield County. The group will include sympathetic legislators and officials.
 They plan a day of lobbying, speechmaking, petition waving and other tactics designed to make the argument that, whatever it takes to pay for it, Connecticut has let its transportation needs languish for long enough. 
 Not that it's a new message. Government panels, consultants' reports and other studies have trumpeted the same message for years without much action. A comprehensive study five years ago said Connecticut risked becoming ''an economic cul-de-sac'' if its transportation system wasn't revamped. It hasn't been yet. 
 Agenda Item No. 1, almost everyone agrees, is the perilous state of Metro-North's New Haven Line, where most of the cars are five years past their expected life span of 25 years. At about this time last year, 120 of the 343 cars were out of service. Replacing them all would cost about $2.5 billion, twice the state's projected deficit.
 Other needs include improving station parking and bus service to rail stations; somehow unclogging I-95, the Merritt Parkway and other state highways; creating a New Haven-Hartford-Springfield commuter rail line, updating barge operations to remove some of the highway freight; and replacing the outdated overhead wires on the New Haven Line. Good luck on finding the billions to deal with all that. 
 The heart of the transportation lobby group remains Mrs. Kelly, 73, who is Republican and detail-oriented, and Mrs. Leighton, 71, , who is Democratic and leans toward issues like gun control. They're a bit like the mouse that roared, but Jim Cameron of the Connecticut Metro-North Rail Commuter Council said sometimes the right roar can make all the difference.
 Mr. Cameron said, ''When they were starting this Carol said, 'There are lobbyists in Hartford looking out for their interests, whether it's asphalt or gasoline dealers, but who's looking out for commuters?' And I said, 'Unfortunately, nobody.'''
 He continued: ''We look out for the riders of Metro-North, but there is no group that has a voice in Hartford on a regular basis to represent the interests of commuters, rail or highway. And where we are now is that we've reached the point where government can't ignore the needs anymore. What we're looking for from the legislature is guts -- we all agree this is an issue we need to address, but no one has come forward and said how they will pay for it.''
 One source being eyed is the gasoline tax, which was reduced from 39 cents a gallon in 1997 to the present 25 cents under the former governor, John G. Rowland. Look for that to inch back up. It's likely some combination of a gas tax increase, tolls, fees, borrowing, and other taxes could come into play -- if the General Assembly approves them.
 Which means, of course, a rally is the easy part. Getting anything done is the hard part. Few expect a comprehensive solution this year, but whether the Metro-North problem, at least, gets solved will be a test of whether the new governor, M. Jodi Rell, will use her popularity to make some tough choices. 
 ''I'm open-minded,'' said State Senator Biagio Ciotto, chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee. ''I'm very anxiously waiting to see what the governor's going to say.''

HEADLINE: The Governor's Three-Pronged Plan to Meet His $105 Billion Budget

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
Faced with enormous bills coming due for health care, transportation and education, and limited resources even in a $105.5 billion budget, Gov. George E. Pataki hit on a trio of different strategies in the spending plan he unveiled on Tuesday: service cuts, heavy borrowing and playing for time. 
 The governor tried to meet the state's rising health care costs head-on, taking the politically risky step of calling for nearly $1 billion in Medicaid cuts and setting the stage for a battle royal with the state's powerful health care industry. By offering to cap local Medicaid costs, Mr. Pataki hopes to win county governments as allies in the fight. 
 To shore up the state's mass transit systems and roadways, Mr. Pataki proposed a $36.6 billion five-year plan that calls for borrowing billions, backed in part by higher fees on drivers and higher mortgage recording taxes. But the plan falls far short of providing the money that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority wants even for routine maintenance, not to mention some costly expansion projects.
 And with a politically explosive court order hanging over his head requiring the state to fix New York City's schools, the governor essentially stalled. He released a proposal that mirrored the one he made, and failed to win support for, last year. It calls for increasing aid to city schools by $280 million, a fraction of the $1.4 billion increase that a court-appointed panel recommended for each of the next four years.
 As lawmakers and lobbyists grasped in vain to read hints about the governor's political future into his spending plan -- some thought it sounded like the budget of a man who plans to step down in two years; others said it sounded like the plan of a man running again -- several said it could be his last chance to push big changes. Next year, they observed, Mr. Pataki will either be a lame duck or opening a re-election campaign.
 The proposed budget came after the State Legislature passed its latest budget in history last year as lawmakers fought over Mr. Pataki's education spending proposal. With the governor's new spending plan budging so little from last year's proposal, and with the Legislature's power to amend the budget sharply curtailed by the courts, some lawmakers grumbled privately that they could break the late budget record this year, too.
 As he tried to sell the plan to the Legislature -- standing before a backdrop of slide projections with messages like ''Ensuring Fiscal Integrity,'' ''Helping Local Governments'' and ''Advancing Economic Freedom'' -- Mr. Pataki urged lawmakers to ''build on our momentum by sticking to the proven formula of fiscal discipline and tax cuts.''
 But while the proposal does contain some tax cuts -- Mr. Pataki challenged the Legislature to speed the reduction of a $190 million income tax surcharge on the state's highest earners -- it also contains roughly $700 million in new taxes and fees. The governor wants the Legislature to extend a $455 million sales tax on clothing, which was supposed to end this May, as well as to raise the tax on wine. And he authorized higher camping fees and higher tuition fees at state and city university systems. 
 None of the proposals are likely to be adopted without a fight. Minutes after the governor left the theater where he outlined the spending plan, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, was attacking Mr. Pataki, saying he had included too little in his budget for New York City and complaining that the governor's tax proposals and higher fees would favor the wealthy at the expense of the poor and the working class. 
 Soon afterward, Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate's majority leader and a Republican, was complaining that the governor's education proposal did not raise enough money and sent too much of what it did raise to New York City. 
 But the rules of engagement this year are unclear. The state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, ruled last month that most of the budget-making power in New York State rests with the governor and that the Legislature is limited in how far it can go in changing his proposals. So lawmakers in both parties were unsure of their next step.
 The effect could be felt widely. For years Mr. Pataki's budgets have proposed withholding some financial aid from the state's poorest college students until they graduate, and for years the Legislature has killed the proposal, arguing that it would put another hurdle in front of poor New Yorkers. 
 But this year, Assembly Democrats said, the proposal was written into the bill that the governor plans to submit establishing the aid program, the Tuition Assistance Program. So lawmakers fear that unless they can negotiate with the governor and persuade him to abandon the proposal, they may be faced with a dilemma when it comes time to vote on the budget: accept his change in the program or cut the program altogether. 
 Mr. Silver, who unsuccessfully challenged the governor's budget-making powers in court, said Mr. Pataki was flexing his newly affirmed powers by trying to change state policy in budget bills that the Legislature has little leeway to change.
 "He uses and abuses it," Mr. Silver said.

HEADLINE: Fannie Mae Says It Will Halve Its Dividend for the 1st Quarter

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Fannie Mae, the nation's largest buyer of mortgages, said yesterday that it would cut in half the first-quarter dividend on its common shares as it scrambles to meet its regulator's minimum capital requirements.
 The dividend cut, its first since 1981, is the latest step by Fannie Mae to get its financial house in order after questions over its accounting led its regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, or Ofheo, to impose additional capital requirements. But the cut, which reduces the dividend to 26 cents a share, surprised many on Wall Street. 
 ''I think Fannie Mae would have resisted any type of cut in their dividend,'' said Paul J. Miller, an analyst with Friedman, Billings, Ramsey in Arlington, Va. ''They could have raised their capital internally, in four or five quarters, without cutting the dividend. They have a June 30 deadline. It looks like Ofheo is pushing the deadline harder than we originally thought.''
 Fannie Mae's shares rose 19 cents, to $69.70, on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. The company announced the dividend cut after the close of regular trading. In after-hours trading, its shares fell $1.44, or 2.1 percent, to $68.26. 
 The dividend cut will save Fannie Mae an estimated $250 million in the current quarter, and as much as $1 billion this year if the measure remains in effect. Fannie Mae's board has reached an agreement with Ofheo to raise its capital reserves by 30 percent, or about $9 billion, and the company said yesterday that it had submitted those plans for the regulator's approval and review. 
 ''This action demonstrates the board's commitment to taking necessary measures to increase the company's capital,'' Armando Falcon Jr., Ofheo's director, said in a statement.
 Stephen B. Ashley, Fannie Mae's interim chairman, called it a ''prudent and responsible action to take as the company moves expeditiously to increase its capital.'' He added that Fannie Mae's board would continue to assess dividend payments for each quarter.
 Fannie Mae is trying to regain the confidence of Ofheo, which has called for an overhaul of its management and practices. 
 ''The next step is to see what is going to happen if they start selling assets,'' Mr. Miller said, noting the company could reduce its mortgage-backed securities holdings. ''If they have to sell some of their portfolio, it could push interest rates up.''

HEADLINE: Businessman Pleads Guilty to Trying to Help Saddam Hussein

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
An Iraqi-American businessman who profited from the United Nations oil-for-food aid program with Iraq pleaded guilty Tuesday to four criminal counts. The case, against Samir A. Vincent, included charges that he had enlisted influential former American government officials, who were not identified, to discuss ways to help Saddam Hussein avoid international economic sanctions. 
 The plea will result in the first conviction in the multipronged investigation of the oil-for-food program. Attorney General John Ashcroft said Mr. Vincent was cooperating with the inquiry. 
 Mr. Vincent, a naturalized citizen who has long been involved in Iraqi-American affairs, pleaded guilty to secretly working on behalf of the Iraqi government to lobby American and United Nations officials about the sanctions program. In exchange, he received millions of dollars after being given the rights to sell millions of barrels of Iraqi oil, according to the charges.
 The criminal information, as the list of charges is known, said Mr. Vincent had ''lobbied former officials of the United States government who maintained close contacts to high-ranking members of both the Clinton and Bush administrations in an effort to convince the U.S. government to support of a repeal of sanctions against Iraq.'' 
 The document also said Mr. Vincent arranged a meeting in Manhattan in September 2000 between a high-ranking representative of the Iraqi government and a former American government official to discuss strategy to persuade policy makers to support the repeal of United Nations sanctions.
 In November 2001, the charge said, Mr. Vincent delivered a message from officials of the Iraqi Intelligence Service and the government of Iraq to a former American official on the issue of whether Baghdad would allow arms inspectors to return in exchange for the dropping of sanctions. It does not say if that was the same official involved in the September 2000 meeting.
 Neither the criminal information nor a statement on Tuesday by Mr. Ashcroft identified the former American officials who were said to have been involved. 
 Bryan Sierra, a Justice Department spokesman, declined to identify the former officials, but noted that the investigation was continuing.
 Mr. Vincent was charged with, among other things, acting as an unregistered agent of the Iraqi government. That charge raises the possibility that the former official or officials could be in similar jeopardy if they were involved in taking up the Iraqi government's case. 
 Mr. Vincent, who could face up to 28 years in prison, entered his plea on Tuesday in Federal District Court in Manhattan before Judge Denny Chin.
 In addition to the federal criminal inquiry, a three-member investigative commission has been appointed by Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations. It is led by Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve Chairman. The Volcker group, which may now have access to Mr. Vincent, is expected to issue an interim report in the next few weeks.
 The oil-for-food program was started in 1996 to help ease the effects on civilians of sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. Under the program, Iraq was permitted to sell its oil under the condition that the proceeds be put into a special account the government could use to buy relief supplies. 
 The program is now widely regarded as having provided a means by which Mr. Hussein was able to skim millions of dollars. 
 ''The Hussein regime corrupted the oil-for-food program,'' Mr. Ashcroft said, ''depriving the Iraqi people of food and medicine and undermining the sanctions.''
 He described Mr. Vincent as one of Mr. Hussein's accomplices in exploiting the program. The charging document asserts that, as a reward, Mr. Vincent was enabled to act as the broker for nine million barrels of oil. David Kelley, the United States attorney in Manhattan, estimated that Mr. Vincent accumulated between $3 million and $5 million in profits. 
 Mr. Vincent traveled to Baghdad in the early 1990's and drafted agreements with Iraqi officials that provided for payments to him of millions of dollars for his role in helping persuade the United Nations to put the oil-for-food program into effect. It is unclear whether that money was in addition to the fees from the oil sales.
 Mr. Vincent's name appeared on a list compiled by the C.I.A. and disclosed in October that identified people who had secretly benefited from the oil-for-food program.
 He operated a company called Phoenix International L.L.C. in suburban Virginia. 
 He worked for years to improve United States-Iraqi relations, including helping organize a tour of the United States in 1999 by Iraqi clerics who pressed for an end to sanctions during their meetings with American religious leaders, including the evangelist Billy Graham.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Asked To Increase Housing Aid

 BODY:
New York City officials say that their projected share of federal funds for low-income housing vouchers is more than $61 million short of what is needed because the federal government underestimated the inflation rate and the cost of living in the city.
 To make up the gap, housing officials have appealed to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and they expect an answer by Friday. And while they believe that their arguments are persuasive, they are also bracing for rejection, meaning that they may have to freeze or limit the number of Section 8 vouchers for families on waiting lists, or pay landlords in the program less money. Section 8 is the nation's primary vehicle for housing the poor. 
 Last week, Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat, wrote a letter to Alphonso Jackson, the housing secretary, requesting an increase. The letter said that Mr. Schumer encountered Mr. Jackson the previous Friday at the Fox News studios in Manhattan and secured a promise from the secretary that the department would consider the city's appeal.
 Similar problems have occurred in other cities with housing costs rising faster than the national average. In all, 492 out of an estimated 2,500 housing agencies that issue vouchers have asked for more money, said Donna White, a spokeswoman for the federal housing department. Ms. White said she could not discuss the city's chances for an appeal. 
 ''While we are still reviewing these adjustment requests,'' she said, ''the department would prefer not to talk about Section 8 until after we have completed our final numbers.''
 The situation is similar to one that city officials faced last spring, when Section 8 was scheduled for a $55 million cut because of a regulatory change. After the city and other local governments protested, HUD restored most of the proposed cuts, adding $156 million nationwide to almost 400 housing agencies.
 This time, Congress is clearly spelling out what the Section 8 subsidies are, as set in the recent omnibus budget. But Congress has given housing agencies less room for compromise or flexibility later in the year, Senator Schumer said.
 ''If there's no appeal, and no new money, Section 8 will wither away,'' he said in an interview.
 Officially called the Housing Choice Voucher Program, Section 8 enables poor, disabled or elderly tenants to receive rent vouchers from a local housing agency and redeem them with participating private landlords. 
 Tenants pay 30 percent of their income in rent, while the vouchers pay the balance, up to a limit set by the federal government, subject to local market conditions.
 In the past, the federal housing department provided agencies with financing for all the vouchers they were allowed to issue, based on actual costs. But last year, the Bush administration, concerned about the rising costs of Section 8, began to reduce the flexibility in the program and move toward fixed costs.
 For the 2005 fiscal year, Congress has set aside a total of $13.4 billion for voucher renewals, based on costs through July 2004, and is requiring housing agencies to stay within their respective allocations for the entire year, said Barbara Sard, director of housing for the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities, a liberal research group. 
 To HUD officials and some housing groups, that approach makes sense because it forces housing agencies to plan more effectively and contain costs. Some have already begun to do so; the New York City Housing Authority, for instance, projects that its costs will increase 6.5 percent this year, down from 10 percent last year.
 But the problem this year, some groups say, is that Congress allocated less money to adjust for possible needs after the July cutoff date. Whereas housing agencies had been able to tap into a reserve fund of up to two months' worth of subsidies a few years ago, and one month since 2001, that reserve is about to be reduced to one week. As a result, many agencies will probably offer fewer vouchers so as not to run out of money.
 ''It's like musical chairs,'' said Sunia Zaterman, executive director of the Council of Large Public Housing Authorities. ''In each of the last few years, more chairs keep being taken away in terms of resources.''
 New York City issues roughly 118,000 rent vouchers a year, far more than any other city, at a cost of roughly $1 billion. But this year, the agencies distributing vouchers -- the New York City Housing Authority, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development and the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal -- have calculated that they have been shortchanged by $33 million, $27 million and more than $1 million, respectively.
 According to a recent letter from Douglas Apple, the housing authority's general manager, HUD's cost-of-living increase for New York of 4.7 percent was too low. He said a figure of 6.5 percent was more accurate, because the city's ''growth rate for rental costs typically exceeds the national indicators.'' 
 City officials say they are hopeful that the department will respond favorably, as it has in previous years. But they also realize that President Bush's budget for 2006, expected early next month, will reportedly include cuts in Section 8 and other housing programs.

HEADLINE: Big Banks Report Strong Profits for the Quarter

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Several large banks, led by the Bank of America Corporation, reported strong quarterly profits yesterday as consumers and companies borrowed more and credit quality improved. 
 Bank of America said that its fourth-quarter net income rose 41 percent. Wells Fargo and Company reported a nearly 11 percent increase in the three months that ended Dec. 31, and the National City Corporation said it had a 76 percent jump in the same period. 
 U.S. Bancorp said its profit rose 8 percent.
 ''Loan growth looks good, and fee revenue is surpassing my expectations,'' said Hilary Hayes, a portfolio manager at Victory SBSF Capital Management in New York. ''The consumer is still doing O.K.''
 Consumers are taking on more debt as the economy expands, though borrowing growth is slowing. Banks are also benefiting from rising stocks and increased investment activity, and corporate customers are borrowing more to finance expansion. This helps offset the slowdown in demand for mortgage refinancing.
 Bank of America said that its profit rose to $3.85 billion, or 94 cents a share, from $2.73 billion, or 92 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 42 percent, to $13.9 billion.
 The chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, said the bank, based in Charlotte, N.C., remained ''on schedule'' in integrating FleetBoston Financial, which it bought for $48 billion last April.
 Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, said profit rose to $1.79 billion, or $1.04 a share, from $1.62 billion, or 95 cents a share, in year-earlier period.
 Profit rose 5 percent in retail banking to $1.24 billion, and 5 percent in wholesale business banking, to $403 million. In addition, profit at Wells Fargo Financial, including consumer finance and credit cards, rose 8 percent to $129 million, the bank said.
 The bank said mortgage originations fell 37 percent last year, to $298 billion.
 U.S. Bancorp said profit rose to $1.06 billion, or 56 cents a share, from $977 million, or 50 cents, in the year-earlier quarter, helped by fee income growth and fewer bad loans. Moody's Investors Service raised the bank's debt rating to Aa2, its third-highest grade, citing U.S. Bancorp's ''superior core profitability.''
 National City said yesterday that its profit rose to $960 million, or $1.46 a share, from $544 million, or 88 cents, in the same period a year earlier. Excluding a one-time gain, profit was 72 cents a share; analysts had expected 66 cents.

HEADLINE: Lawmaker Links Overhauls On Social Security and Taxes

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
In a sign of the battles that lie ahead on Social Security, the top Republican tax-writer in the House said Tuesday that President Bush's plan partly privatizing the old-age program ought to be the ''starting point'' in a broader debate.
 ''The president proposes and the Congress disposes,'' said the lawmaker, Representative Bill Thomas, the California Republican who heads the House Ways and Means Committee. ''I won't rule anything in. I won't rule anything out.'' 
 Speaking at a forum sponsored by The National Journal, Mr. Thomas suggested that Mr. Bush blend his plans for Social Security with his goal of overhauling the tax code.
 The congressman said he wanted to re-examine the 12.4 percent payroll tax that finances Social Security, noting that it tended to favor wealthier people while benefits, as a percentage of the wages the retiree once earned, tended to favor the poorer.
 Mr. Thomas broadly supported Mr. Bush's goal of letting younger workers divert some of their payroll taxes to private retirement accounts. But he said Congress was in danger of ''missing an opportunity'' by thinking too narrowly.
 Though Mr. Thomas declined to be specific about his own ideas, his remarks reinforced a view of other House Republican leaders that overhauling the tax code is a more compelling issue than Social Security. Many House Republicans are already worried about voting for a bill that could reduce benefits now promised to future retirees.
 White House officials concede that private savings accounts would not in themselves resolve the program's long-term problems and that their plan will call for changes that reduce the benefits currently promised to workers who retire in the future.
 N. Gregory Mankiw, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, said again on Tuesday that the current system of pegging a retiree's initial benefits to wages meant that benefits rose more rapidly than inflation and so became more generous, in real terms, with each new generation of retirees. 
 The most widely circulated plan for closing the long-term gap between the program's assets and its solvency would be to index initial benefits to increases in prices. The change would have little effect on people retiring over the next decade, analysts say, but could reduce benefits by about a third for people who retire 50 years from now.
 But Republicans are also circulating other ideas. Robert Pozen, an investment manager in Boston who was a member of Mr. Bush's advisory commission on Social Security in 2001, has proposed a system of ''progressive'' indexing that would peg benefits to wages for low-income retirees but peg them to price increases for high-income earners.
 Another idea, promoted by a handful of Republicans, is that the government raise the ceiling, now $90,000, on income subject to payroll taxes. Mr. Bush has repeatedly declared his opposition to an increase in payroll taxes, but White House officials have never entirely closed the door to an increase in that ceiling. Mr. Thomas said Congress would have to consider the possibility. 
 ''That's an issue I would hope people would present,'' he said Tuesday.
 He also suggested that there might be a middle ground in approaches to cutting future benefits.
 ''This black-and-white debate serves no purpose,'' he said. 
 Democrats have vowed to oppose almost any plan that calls for diverting payroll taxes to private investment accounts. They contend that any such plan would force the federal government to borrow as much as $2 trillion over the next decade or so to make up for lost revenue while paying full benefits to current retirees.
 But the Democrats are still uncertain about whether to offer a counterproposal to address the program's long-term financial problems.

HEADLINE: Airbus Unveils A380, a Giant Fit for 555

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: TOULOUSE, France, Jan. 18 

 BODY:
Europe heralded a new era in air travel here on Tuesday, christening the Airbus A380, a gargantuan double-deck plane dedicated to the principle that size matters.
 As a blue curtain rose in an assembly hall here to reveal the A380, the plane loomed like some kind of preternatural earthbound bird -- with a 262-foot wingspan, a 239-foot-long fuselage, a cabin that can comfortably seat 555 and a takeoff weight when fully loaded of 1.2 million pounds.
 It was welcomed by a retinue of European leaders, including President Jacques Chirac of France, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany, for whom the A380 represents not just an ambitious industrial project but a proud symbol of the economic integration of Europe.
 ''It is a technological feat and a great European success,'' Mr. Chirac declared to an audience of 5,000 officials, airline executives, suppliers and journalists. ''When it takes to the skies, it will carry the colors of our continent, and our technological ambitions, to even greater heights.'' 
 The A380's maiden flight is not scheduled until March. But the pomp and ceremony of Tuesday's unveiling underscored the critical importance of this plane to Airbus and its fierce battle with Boeing. Airbus, part of the European consortium EADS, surpassed Boeing in 2004 in the number of planes delivered to airlines for the second consecutive year. With the A380, the company, which is owned by Europe's aerospace industry, will dominate the lucrative segment of very large planes that Boeing pioneered in the 1970's with the 747.
 For Airbus, a once-balky assemblage of French, German and Spanish aerospace manufacturers that barely nipped at Boeing's heels, the completion of the A380 project is a remarkable coming of age. The attendance on Tuesday of four government leaders -- Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero of Spain was also there -- attested to the political significance of the project. The A380 could be a model for European collaboration in capital projects, though some economists warn that it may embolden politicians to meddle in ventures best left to private industry.
 Mr. Schroder gently lampooned the competition, recalling the doubts of non-Europeans in Airbus's early days, with remarks like, ''Well, if the Europeans ever get their act together,'' and then adding, ''Lord knows if they will ever do it.''
 His comments carried a hint of defiance. He urged the European Commission to negotiate aggressively with the United States in its continuing trade dispute over subsidies to Airbus. And he extolled Europe's cooperative style as a cornerstone of the A380 project.
 ''There is the tradition of good old Europe that has made this possible,'' Mr. Schroder said, alluding to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld's quip about ''old Europe'' before the Iraq war.
 Building the world's largest passenger plane, of course, is not the same thing as turning a profit on it. Airbus gathered the heads of the 14 carriers that have ordered the A380 to testify to its appeal. Several said they needed a larger plane to serve congested airports like Heathrow outside London.
 Air France, Lufthansa, Korean Air and Federal Express are among those that have ordered the A380. But no American passenger carrier has signed up, and two long-haul airlines, United and Northwest, are not likely to, according to Chris Avery, a J.P. Morgan analyst in London.
 Boeing ultimately decided against building a direct competitor to the A380, concluding that the market is moving away from jumbo jets that fly between hub airports. It is developing a fuel-efficient midsize plane, the 7E7 Dreamliner, to connect cities that do not generate the traffic to justify a 500-seat aircraft.
 Not surprisingly, Boeing and Airbus hold different views on the size of the market for such planes. Airbus estimates that over the next 20 years, there will be demand for 1,250 planes with at least 400 seats. 
 Boeing sees a market of 300 to 400 planes. It is thinking about building an expanded version of the 747, called the 747 Advanced, though its chairman, Harry C. Stonecipher, left the door open to developing a new aircraft if demand exceeds expectations.
 ''The question people are asking is, 'Is this another Concorde?''' a European spokesman for Boeing, Charles Miller, said. ''Has Airbus designed an aircraft for itself rather than for its customers?''
 The stakes for Airbus are enormous. The company, based here in Toulouse, recently said that the project was running nearly $2 billion over budget, putting it close to $16 billion. Airbus, which has orders or commitments for 149 planes, says it needs to sell 250 to break even. Its arithmetic does not include 3.3 billion euros ($4.3 billion) in subsidies from its European government backers to develop the A380. Those subsidies are at the heart of a simmering trade dispute between the United States and the European Union.
 The Bush administration filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization in October, saying that Airbus is unfairly subsidized. Airbus responds that Boeing is receiving aid from the Pentagon and Washington State to develop the 7E7. The two sides recently agreed to try to negotiate a settlement.
 Except for Chancellor Schroder, nobody raised such unpleasant matters on Tuesday. The unveiling, which had the grand and slightly goofy theatrics of an opening ceremony at the Olympics, was an exuberant celebration of technological prowess and European industrial cooperation. 
 ''It is simply stunning,'' said Mr. Blair, pointing out that the A380's wings, its most advanced components, were made in Wales, and adding, ''Well done to all of you who made it happen.''
 In fact, the A380's parts are produced in some 15 factories in Britain, Germany, Spain and France, as well as in the United States and other countries. In a daunting logistical exercise, they are transported by plane, train, barge and truck to this vast assembly hall in southwestern France.
 While some Europeans grumble that France has taken too strong a role in the running of Airbus, most say that the A380 project has generally avoided political turf battles or other national skirmishes.
 ''The success is that they overcame all that,'' said Daniel Gros, director of the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels. ''The danger is that politicians will see this as a European champion, and then go home and try to create national champions in their own countries.''
 Mr. Chirac said the project was an endorsement of Europe's industrial policy. The French government has intervened in the market several times in the last year to bolster French companies.
 The ultimate arbiters of the A380 will be the airlines and the passenger. Singapore Airlines will be the first to test the plane in the market, when it begins flying it to London and Sydney in mid-2006.
 Certainly, the A380 has the potential to be unlike anything now flying. Though it will have only 35 percent more seats than a 747, it will have 49 percent more usable passenger space. That leaves open possibilities like in-flight bars, lounges, shops and gyms.
 Skeptics say cost-conscious carriers will squeeze in more seats; the A380 is able to carry 800 people.

HEADLINE: Waiting, Waiting on a Plan for the Fulton Corridor

BYLINE: By David W. Dunlap

 BODY:
THE ''Fulton Corridor Action Plan'' -- a river-to-river redevelopment framework for Fulton Street and environs, with an emphasis on shopping, entertainment and the arts -- was initiated in 2002 by the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and the City Planning Department. They awarded the project to Robert A.M. Stern Architects, known for its work on the retail revitalization of 42nd Street.
 To date, there has been action on the Fulton corridor, but there is still no publicly articulated plan, though the need for one is growing more urgent.
 For instance, the landmark-quality former Keuffel & Esser headquarters at 127 Fulton Street is for sale, with no clear indication of how it might fit in with a market hall that is envisioned on the same block, at the northeast corner of Nassau Street. 
 And the greater Fulton Street plan, whatever it is, will have to compete with other projects for the diminishing federal grants available in Lower Manhattan. Gov. George E. Pataki has set a deadline of March for laying out spending priorities.
 ''We have reason to believe they're working on good stuff, but without seeing the plans, it's hard to know,'' said Petra Todorovich, an associate planner at the independent, nonprofit Regional Plan Association. 
 Two weeks ago, it appeared that the public would finally get a chance to glimpse a more detailed future of Fulton Street and lower Greenwich Street, where new parkland might be created on a deck over the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel entrance. A panel discussion with state and city officials was scheduled Jan. 11 at the Center for Architecture in Greenwich Village, but the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation declined to participate and the event was not held. 
 ''The frustration, very simply, is that we have been saying that it's not just about the World Trade Center site,'' said Fredric M. Bell, executive director of the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects, which runs the Center for Architecture.
 Given the extraordinary demands of ground zero, it is not hard to understand why planners sometimes seem to slight other areas downtown. Still, if Lower Manhattan is to rebound fully, its social, cultural and economic health will rest on more than the new World Trade Center alone, which is why it is so important to get a picture of what officials have in mind for Fulton Street, Greenwich Street and the East River waterfront.
 Kevin M. Rampe, the president of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, and Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding, said yesterday that the Fulton Street plan was near completion and that planning for Greenwich Street was under way. Both projects will come into sharper focus, they said, once spending priorities are set and it is known how much money remains for projects outside ground zero, after ensuring construction of a memorial and cultural buildings.
 In federally financed projects that involve the acquisition of real property, notices must be sent to all residents or businesses that may be displaced. The more refined and focused the plan, Mr. Rampe said, the fewer such disruptive notices need to be sent.
 On the other hand, the longer the wait for a plan, the more speculation is likely to occur. That is underscored by the uncertain fate of the Keuffel & Esser Building, an 8-story, 113-year-old structure that is on the market for $9.8 million.
 (If you are old enough to know what a slide rule is, you know K+E. If not, you can find a K+E Analon slide rule at the Smithsonian Institution. Keuffel & Esser donated it in the 1970's as the pocket calculator pushed the slide rule to near-extinction.)
 Keuffel & Esser was founded in 1867 -- a date memorialized on the facade at 127 Fulton Street -- and acquired 120 years later by Azon. Its name is still on the Fulton Street building, as are reliefs depicting precision tools and scientific instruments. The architects, De Lemos & Cordes, later designed the Macy's flagship at Herald Square.
 ''IT'S a critical building in that it raises the threshold of good architecture on the street,'' said Ken Lustbader of the Lower Manhattan Emergency Preservation Fund, a coalition of five preservation-minded groups.
 In 2002, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg offered his vision for the same block: Fulton Market Square, which he described as ''a great place to shop, see a movie, look at art or just people-watch.''
 Whether the old building fits into this vision at all is unclear. So is the future of the market hall itself, which might cost $30 million. ''Fulton Market Square is still a possibility, but it will be a function of available funds,'' Mr. Doctoroff said yesterday. ''And it's not an inconsequential project in terms of money.''
 Mr. Doctoroff said the city had not yet examined in detail whether the Keuffel & Esser Building and the market hall could coexist or be combined in some way.
 As a general principle, Mr. Rampe said, preservation is critical to economic redevelopment downtown. ''Historic structures in Lower Manhattan play an incredibly important role in making it the place it is,'' he said.
 That is why advocates like Mr. Lustbader are concerned about the planning limbo on Fulton and Greenwich Streets. ''It's unclear what is actually going to be implemented,'' he said. ''Will there be an official plan versus private-sector real estate speculation that can affect the redevelopment of Lower Manhattan at the expense of historic properties?''

HEADLINE: Food Prices in Biggest Jump in 14 Years

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
The Consumer Price Index for the New York region rose 3.8 percent as an overall average in 2004, the federal government said yesterday, as higher food prices and rising fuel costs drove the largest year-to-year increase in the index since 1990. 
 The figures showed that New Yorkers spent more money last year whipping together salads and slicing bananas into their cereal than the rest of the United States, as local prices for food showed the largest annual increase in 14 years, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Food prices, especially for products bought in grocery stores, rose more in the New York region than anywhere else in the country. 
 Since December 2003, the price for food in grocery stores in the New York metropolitan region rose 5.5 percent compared with 2.5 percent nationally. Total food costs, which includes restaurant meals, rose only 2.7 nationally but went up 4.4 percent in New York. 
 The index is a measure of consumer spending for a variety of goods and services. Nationally, it registered a 3.3 percent increase, the largest since 2000. [Business Day, Page C1.] 
 The rise in the region's food prices is particularly striking compared with Los Angeles, where the increase was 0.5 percent, and Chicago, where the increase was 1.6 percent.
 Energy costs in the region also increased last year -- 14 percent over 2003 -- but that was less than the 16.6 percent increase nationally. Rising gasoline prices continue to hurt the region; they rose 22.6 percent locally in 2004.
 ''The story nationally is energy,'' said Michael L. Dolfman, regional commissioner in the bureau. ''And the story in New York is food.'' 
 The rising costs of food around New York, when compared with other cities, suggest that there is more at work than hurricanes and other disasters that created a sharp increase in fruit and vegetable costs, or the explosion of milk prices in recent months. 
 ''As we all know, the cost factors of doing business in New York are much higher,'' said John Catsimatidis, chief executive of the Gristedes supermarket chain, which has about 50 stores in the city. 
 He said rising rent, utility and labor costs, combined with increased competition, are pushing prices upward. ''If you look at Northeast supermarkets, nobody is getting rich,'' Mr. Catsimatidis said. ''I would be better off getting rid of all of my stores based on the value of the real estate alone.'' 
 His complaint might not generate much sympathy from residents of the region, where supermarkets are known for their miniature aisles, poor selection and general lack of customer service.
 Restaurant prices in the region rose 3 percent last year, a relatively modest increase considering that restaurateurs have been complaining for the last year that higher rents, increased costs for ingredients and higher fines imposed by the city for myriad violations have pushed up costs. 
 The restaurant business was strong last year, in part because of increased tourism during the holiday season, said Chuck Hunt, executive vice president of the New York Restaurant Association. 
 But Mr. Catsimatidis of Gristedes said that the grocery industry has been suffering as delis, e-grocers, drugstores and other retailers that have begun offering food and nibbling at his business.
 While food prices are expected to rise over the next year nationally because of increased production costs and other factors, the increase is projected to be closer to 2.5 percent.
 Michael Mitchell, a spokesman for Chiquita Brands International, said that prices paid by retailers to his company in October and November fell 2 percent over the same period in 2003, and added that higher costs in the New York region may reflect how local grocers might simply be looking for higher profits rather than compensating for rising costs, as was the case with fruit affected by the Florida hurricanes.
 Economists said that there was a bright spot to yesterday's numbers in that the rising prices could suggest that the New York economy was rebounding. ''Economic theory would say that to the extent that the C.P.I. numbers tell us anything about the local economy, they suggest that it may be a bit stronger than the national economy,'' said Jason Bram, a regional economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
 ''I'm not sure how well that works in practice, though,'' he continued. ''Back in the 1980's, when the New York City economy was quite robust, inflation was running about a full point above the U.S. average. But it was also above average in 2002 and in the early 1970's, when the local economy was doing a lot worse that the nation.''

HEADLINE: Harvard President Apologizes Again for Remarks on Gender

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER

 BODY:
With the unabated furor over his recent remarks suggesting that women may not have the same innate abilities in math and science as men, Harvard's president, Lawrence H. Summers, issued a two-page apology to the Harvard community late last night.
 ''I was wrong to have spoken in a way that has resulted in an unintended signal of discouragement to talented girls and women,'' Mr. Summers said in a letter that was posted on his Harvard Web site. 
 ''Despite reports to the contrary, I did not say, and I do not believe, that girls are intellectually less able than boys, or that women lack the ability to succeed at the highest levels of science,'' Mr. Summers wrote. 
 It was his third public statement in three days about his remarks at a conference on women and minorities in science and engineering last Friday, with each statement becoming stronger and more apologetic. His remarks have dominated the discussion on the Harvard campus and beyond, with female academics, alumni and donors expressing concern over his leadership.
 Mr. Summers, an economist and a former treasury secretary, acknowledged that he had been hearing plenty of reaction himself. ''I have learned a great deal from all that I have heard in the last few days,'' he wrote in his statement. ''The many compelling e-mails and calls that I have received have made vivid the very real barriers faced by women in pursuing scientific and other academic careers.''
 He wrote in the letter that he had attended the conference, held by the National Bureau of Economics, ''with the intention of reinforcing my strong commitment to the advancement of women in science, and offering some informal observations on possibly fruitful avenues for further research.''
 However, he added: ''Ensuing media reports on my remarks appear to have had quite the opposite effect. I deeply regret the impact of my comments and apologize for not having weighed them more carefully.''
 Mr. Summers emphasized earlier this week that he had been deliberately provocative in his statements at the conference. 
 Cynthia Friend, the chairwoman of Harvard's department of chemistry and chemical biology, called Mr. Summers's apology ''important'' and ''welcome.''
 But Professor Friend, who was for about 20 years the only woman in her department at Harvard, said that the apology did not erase Mr. Summers's remarks at the conference. ''The problem is you can't take it back,'' she said.
 Nancy Hopkins, a biology professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was at the conference and was so upset by Mr. Summers's remarks that she walked out. ''I applaud what he is saying now,'' she said last night, responding to Mr. Summers's letter. ''But I still remain deeply concerned that someone could say the things he said last Friday.''

HEADLINE: Pataki Aims to Avoid Overhaul by Spreading Medicaid Cuts

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER and AL BAKER

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 19 

 BODY:
The big idea guiding Gov. George E. Pataki's plan this week to rein in Medicaid spending was his desire to steer the state's poor away from costly long-term care in hospitals and nursing homes and into home health care. Over the long term, his administration says, such a move could save huge amounts of money.
 So his budget calls for squeezing hospitals and nursing homes by cutting the reimbursement rates they receive, raising their taxes and creating a commission to recommend closing underused hospitals. At the same time, it calls for spending more on home health aides and other programs to help the elderly stay in their homes longer. 
 But the governor's plan to cut $1.1 billion in Medicaid spending is not the radical revision of the state's biggest and fastest-growing spending category that some legislators had hoped for and many health care providers had feared. While some governors around the nation are retooling their Medicaid programs by cutting their rolls by hundreds of thousands, imposing severe spending caps and drastically reducing benefits, Mr. Pataki's plan consists of a series of more pragmatic measures that his aides say would spread the pain and trim the $44.5 billion program without nearing the bone.
 While Mr. Pataki is proposing a preferred drug program that would limit the kinds of prescription drugs the program covers, along the lines of most private health insurance plans, he is not planning to have the state buy its drugs in bulk, for example. Even if these cuts go through, New York will still have the most expensive Medicaid program in the nation. And even if they are adopted after what will probably be the main legislative battle this year, they are only cuts in planned growth: New York will still spend more on Medicaid next year than this year. 
 Some of the governor's cost-cutting proposals would sharply reduce the benefits for poor and working-class New Yorkers. The state's insurance program for the working poor, Family Health Plus, would no longer pay for mental health services for adults, and its eligibility rules would be tightened. The 340,000 people in the program would be required to pay $250 for each hospital visit. Adults on Medicaid would no longer be able to visit dentists outside dental clinics, and they would lose their podiatry, clinical psychology and private nurse benefits. Co-payments for drugs would rise.
 But the broad outlines of the state's Medicaid program would remain intact, and the tentative nature of some of the governor's proposals may be a recognition of the difficulty Mr. Pataki faces in getting his plan through a skeptical Legislature that has deep political investments in the Medicaid status quo, one that has thwarted his proposed cuts to the program in the past.
 The governor himself said that he recognized the need to keep the health care industry, which is one of the state's biggest employers, strong in New York. Already, health care lobbies are gearing up for an effort to beat back the proposed cuts. 
 Edmund J. McMahon, a fiscal analyst with the Manhattan Institute, a conservative policy group, noted that Mr. Pataki's proposal still calls for overall Medicaid spending in New York -- which is divided among the federal, state and local governments -- to jump next year to $44.8 billion from $44.5 billion, a $353 million increase. 
 ''What Pataki did not do here is push the envelope,'' Mr. McMahon said. ''He's making incremental changes in the existing model. The question is: If you were going to start all over, is this the type of Medicaid program you would really want to have?''
 Still, health care advocates are already lining up against the proposals, which they say would have an impact of roughly $3 billion on the health care industry once the loss of matching federal and local Medicaid spending was factored in. The biggest lobbyist in the state in recent years -- a partnership of the hospital and health care workers' union and the Greater New York Hospital Association -- said in a statement that the cuts would have a ''catastrophic effect on the quality of health care.''
 Kenneth E. Raske, the head of the hospital association, said in the statement that ''the magnitude of these proposed cuts is unbearable, and if these cutbacks actually took place, the care of all hospital and nursing home patients would suffer.'' 
 Dennis Rivera, the president of 1199/S.E.I.U., the politically potent health care workers' union, made an argument that has carried the day in Albany before. ''Polls have shown time and time again that the overwhelming majority of New Yorkers are strongly opposed to cutting funding for health care workers,'' he said in a statement. 
 The last time the governor proposed large cuts to Medicaid, in 2003, the Republicans in the State Senate joined the Democrats in the Assembly to pass their own budget, over Mr. Pataki's vetoes, to restore the spending. 
 This year Mr. Pataki is trying to enlist the help of county officials, who have been complaining loudly of the strain of paying their share of rising Medicaid costs, which have forced them to raise local property taxes. The governor's budget calls for capping local Medicaid spending at the current levels, and allowing for a 3 to 3.5 percent increase each year for inflation. He made it clear in his budget presentation that there can be no local cap without significant cost reductions.
 But while some county officials were pleased by the proposed cap, they were noncommittal on the cuts, which could prove unpopular locally. The New York Association of Counties said it was ''cautiously pleased'' by the governor's budget. New York City officials noted that any savings it realized would be partly offset by the loss of revenue to the public hospitals that it operates. 
 One of the more politically sensitive aspects of the plan is Governor Pataki's decision to name a commission to identify hospitals to close. ''We cannot afford to invest more in underutilized facilities,'' the governor said in his budget address, and if he avoided words like ''close'' and ''downsize,'' he spoke several times at a budget news conference of the need to ''right-size'' the state's health care system.
 And he made a proposal that could end Medicaid's emergence as a middle-class entitlement, calling for the closing of a loophole that allows elderly people to give their assets to their relatives to qualify for Medicaid to pay for nursing home care. New York's Medicaid program spends $7.1 billion on nursing homes, which the Pataki administration notes is more than the combined spending of the next two highest states, California and Pennsylvania. 
 But hospital closings and a proposal that could impoverish middle-class families are not hugely popular in the Legislature. 
 Senator Kemp Hannon, a Republican from Long Island who is the chairman of the Health Committee, said: ''They are trying to make less hospitals stronger. I think it is up to the Legislature to review that kind of conclusion and see whether or not that is a viable course to take.''

HEADLINE: Talk of Changing Pension Math Raises Concern on Benefit Cuts

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
AT&T, the once-mighty phone giant, has a pension plan with obligations of about $10 billion, according to its annual report for 2003. Yet the company paints a somewhat rosier picture for employees: an extrapolation from workers' individual statements indicates that the plan owes them roughly $10.6 billion, or 6 percent more.
 There is nothing improper or unusual in AT&T's approach. Like many other companies, it uses two methods to calculate the value of its pensions: one to tell employees how much they have earned, the other to tell investors how large the company's pension liability is. 
 But that may soon change. The seeming discrepancy in accounting, which has been an accepted business practice for two decades, has begun to bother accounting rule makers, who say the practice allows companies to understate to investors the extent of their pension liabilities. 
 The panel that sets accounting standards is now preparing a proposal that would require many big American companies to give a more accurate financial picture of their pension plans. As a result, a number of them will have to increase the pension liabilities on their books, in essence telling investors that they owe their employees more than they have disclosed in the past.
 ''Depending on the company,'' said Gerard O'Callaghan, project manager for the pension review by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, ''it could be nothing; it could be $10 million; it could be $100 million; it could be a billion; it could be more.'' The board is a nongovernment body that establishes rules for American companies. 
 While the amounts paid to retiring workers would not change immediately, some companies would have to increase their reported pension liabilities as much as 30 percent. To bring things back into balance, some may contribute more money to their pension funds -- a boon to participants, but a jolt to shareholders, who may have thought that the money would be used for business operations. Other companies may delete attractive features from their plans, to bring the cost back down.
 There is precedent for such a cutback. When a change in accounting rules forced companies in 1990 to report the value of the health insurance they had promised to retirees, companies began to reduce the coverage.
 Indeed, the accounting board's proposal comes as the pension system itself is under pressure. Many companies, citing the burden of providing retirement benefits, have cut back, converted or closed their plans. At the same time, the Bush administration is proposing changes in both the way companies set aside money to pay for future benefits, and the way they pay to support the federal system of insuring traditional pensions. Business groups have warned that if companies are pushed too hard, they may stop offering pensions altogether.
 The looming changes in accounting rules are expected to be strongly opposed by companies. The staff of the Financial Accounting Standards Board hopes to present the draft of a proposal by the end of March.
 ''That's where a lot of people are going to be giving us a lot of pushback,'' Mr. O'Callaghan said.
 The accounting board is grappling with something of an open secret in American business: the current accounting rules for pensions allow companies to underestimate, if not conceal, their liabilities legally.
 The board's efforts to improve reporting mirror recent administration proposals to overhaul the rules that companies follow in funding their pension plans. Both sets of rules are now widely thought to obscure the economic reality of a pension plan, sometimes allowing insolvency to grow, undetected by all but the best-informed insiders.
 United Airlines, for example, was able to state that its pension funds were fully funded even after sharp declines in the stock market wiped out much of their value. It thus went for several years without making any contributions. Now, however, the company is arguing in bankruptcy court that it can no longer fund the plans and that the government must take them over.
 The particular issues that the accounting board is looking at represent only ''a sliver'' of the overall problem of pension accounting, Mr. O'Callaghan said.
 Other experts agreed. ''They're trying to repair a broken heating system in a house that's falling down,'' said Jeremy Gold, a consulting actuary to the Financial Accounting Standards Board and an economist who has criticized current pension accounting rules. ''They're headed in the right direction. They're sending some signals about what a rewrite of the pension rules is going to look like.''
 Even so, the board may have a fight on its hands. If it approves its staff's proposal, public comment will then be solicited. The board has set a year-end target to put the rule into effect, but issues raised in the comment period could take months to sort out, pushing that deadline back. 
 ''Nothing gets done here fast,'' Mr. O'Callaghan said, recalling that it took more than 10 years to complete a rule on accounting for stock options. In that case, Congress weighed in, threatening to reduce the board's funds. The board, based in Norwalk, Conn., also gets contributions from business and accounting firms.
 Its current project was initially supposed to change the way companies calculate the value of a kind of pension plan known as a cash-balance plan. But more recently, the board said it also wanted companies with conventional defined-benefit plans to adopt the new approach if they allowed retirees to take their entire benefit in a lump sum.
 Thousands of companies, employing millions of people, have one or the other of these two types of pension plans. Lucent Technologies, I.B.M., Avon Products, AT&T, Colgate-Palmolive, Hewlett-Packard, Toshiba America, Wells Fargo, Qwest Communications, Bank of America, Cummins and Delta Air Lines are among the hundreds of companies with cash-balance pension plans.
 Delphi and U.S. Steel are among many companies that have conventional pension plans, allowing departing workers to take lump sums. So do American Airlines and Delta with the pension plans for their pilots.
 A cash-balance plan is a hybrid design, combining features of a conventional defined-benefit pension plan with those of a 401(k) plan. The company sets aside money to pay the benefits in a pooled trust fund, as it would for a traditional pension plan. But it provides each worker with regular statements, reporting the amount of benefits as an individual account balance, like a 401(k) balance. There are, in fact, no individual accounts, but expressing the benefits this way is said to make employees understand and value them more.
 Each year, an employee's balance increases, as the sponsoring company credits the account with interest at some specified rate. Often, the rate is linked to a conservative market rate, like that for Treasury bills. At AT&T, for example, the cash-balance plan has recently been offering employees interest credits at 4 percent a year.
 The discrepancy in accounting arises when the company calculates the total value of these obligations for its annual report. It must again factor in an interest rate, because pension values vary inversely with interest rates, much as bond prices do. 
 But in this calculation, the crediting rate is not used. The current accounting standard for pensions lets companies use a high-quality bond rate instead. AT&T used 6 percent, according to its annual report for 2003.
 It is the difference between these rates that troubles the accounting rule makers. Because of the inverse relationship, using 6 percent produces a smaller pension value for the annual report than the one reported to workers in their statements.
 Actuaries say that correcting the reported value in AT&T's case would mean increasing it by about 24 percent, citing a rule of thumb that every percentage-point change in the interest rate causes about a 12 percent change in the value of the benefits.
 AT&T reported that its workers had earned about $10 billion of benefits at the end of 2003, but only about $2.5 billion of that was owed to active workers. Conforming to the accounting board's approach might require increasing the amount owed to active workers by 24 percent, or $614 million. That would increase AT&T's total pension debt to its work force to about $10.6 billion. 
 AT&T declined to comment for this article.
 These adjustments would vary at different companies, depending on the interest rates used and the ages of the work force.
 The accounting board's work on cash-balance plans showed that companies also use two interest rates when calculating lump-sum distributions, with the result that they have also been reporting smaller pension obligations to investors than the amounts workers are really allowed to take.
 About half of all workers at big companies are currently allowed to take lump sums, according to Mark G. Beilke, director of employee benefits research at Milliman USA. The practice is much more common among plans for salaried white-collar workers than those for union or hourly workers, he said.
 Among the companies affected because they offer cash-balance plans or pay lump sums, some, like Toshiba and Wells Fargo, have written letters to the accounting board expressing opposition to the accounting change.
 ''The board's tentative conclusions could result in large charges to earnings for many companies,'' wrote Richard D. Levy, the controller of Wells Fargo, in a letter sent in May 2004. ''These companies could conceivably implement changes to their pension plans to minimize the impact of the accounting changes on their financial results. These plan changes may ultimately result in reductions of pension benefits for employees.''
 Other companies like Avon, American Airlines, Hewlett-Packard and Delphi said that they did not want to comment because they were not yet sure what the new method would be. Some, including I.B.M., Qwest and Colgate-Palmolive, did not respond to requests for comment.
 A Lucent Technologies spokeswoman said the company's cash-balance plan accounted for a small part of the pension benefits it owes retirees, so the accounting change would have a minimal effect on its financial reports. Bank of America cited a lawsuit by its employees in connection with its cash-balance plan and declined to comment on possible accounting changes.
 Many actuaries find the accounting board's new approach disturbing, because it challenges core concepts of the actuarial approach to pensions. Years ago, cash-balance plans were marketed to companies on the very feature the accounting board now considers incorrect: the interest-rate differential that made them look cheaper than they turn out to be.
 ''There is substantial leverage in this assumption,'' said a 1985 promotional brochure on cash-balance plans by Kwasha Lipton, an actuarial firm that has become a part of Mellon Financial.
 ''A '5 percent of pay' plan might require a contribution of only 4 percent of pay, after a realistic investment differential is taken into account.''
 Mr. Gold, the pension-accounting critic, who worked at Kwasha Lipton before it began to promote cash-balance plans, said: ''Kwasha Lipton's actuaries didn't think that was misleading. When Kwasha Lipton was writing this, that's what all actuaries believed. We were taught this. We were tested on it. The right answer was to say that you could give $5 at the cost of $4.''

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a front-page article last Thursday about a proposal by the Financial Accounting Standards Board that would require many companies to give a more accurate financial picture of their pension plans misstated the source of the group's financing. Since the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002, the board has received funds through mandatory fees charged to many publicly traded companies; it no longer receives voluntary contributions from companies or accounting firms.

C8)Drawing (Illustration by Macaulay Campbell/The New York Times)(pg. C8)Chart: ''Different Calculations''A proposed change in accounting rules this year could alter the way many companies report the value of their pensions. The value of a company's pension, as told to an employee, may differ greatly from what the company tells its shareholders its pension liabilities are.THE EMPLOYEE -- At a company with a cash-balance pension plan, an employee gets regular statements, showing the benefit he is building up. The benefit grows each year, as the company contributes a percentage of his pay, plus interest. The ''interest crediting rate'' is typically a conservative one, like 4 percent.THE SHAREHOLDER -- A shareholder trying to learn the value of the pensions the same company has promised to its workers would look in the annual report. But the company does not use the ''interest crediting rate'' to calculate the pension value given there. Current accounting rules permit it to use a higher rate, like 6 percent. Because pension values move inversely with interest rates, the higher rate implies a lower pension value. This tells the shareholder that the obligation to the work force is smaller than it actually is.(pg. C8)
