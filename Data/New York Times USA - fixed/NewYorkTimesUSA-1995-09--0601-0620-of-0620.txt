HEADLINE: First-Time Jobless Claims at 7-Week Low

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 28

 BODY:
The number of American workers filing first-time claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly fell by 31,000 last week to the lowest level in seven weeks. It was the largest decline in two months.
The Labor Department said today that new applications for unemployment insurance totaled a seasonally adjusted 335,000, down from a revised 366,000 a week earlier and the smallest since 332,000 were filed in the week that ended on Aug. 5. The previous week's total was originally estimated at 365,000. 
 The 31,000 drop was the biggest since claims fell by 51,000 in the week ended July 29. Many analysts had expected a decline of only 5,000 in the latest week.
The four-week moving average of new weekly jobless claims also fell, down 3,250, to 351,750.

HEADLINE: Mean Season Starts With One-Upmanship

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
So now we are trapped in the Mean Season: Just when we want to be rooting for Don, Troy and Buster's kid, here come Steinbrenner, Jones and King to blot out the sun. It is the mean-spirited nature of sports entrepreneurs not only to exploit their boy toys, but also to snatch their glory.
Which is why, after months of welcome silence, George Steinbrenner is suddenly granting news media audiences to hear him rip his ballplayers, a typical ploy. If the Yankees ride the wild card into the playoffs, Steinbrenner will say he shook them into winning speed. If they don't make it, he will have set up his scapegoats. He is doing to individual players what he did to the entire South Bronx. 
 I am taking this personally, not only because this has been my Yankee fan year, but because I was finally getting aboard the float that proclaimed it Don Mattingly's season, the perfect farewell after all those years of honorable, even gallant, performances for teams that did not match his talents. Mattingly is a nice guy who gave us thrills he was well paid for, a guy who should never have shaved his beard, but didn't deserve to be trashed for considering Japan when Steinbrenner was considering New Jersey.
This will all be resolved in the next few weeks, when the Yankees win the World Series because Steinbrenner turned up the heat, or blow their chances because the closers didn't have the Boss's brass.
Meanwhile, the economic sandstorm that Jerry Jones is kicking up in Texas may have enormous impact on the future of major league sports, which has come to realize that players grow old and franchises shift, but logos are role models that never embarrass (you won't be catching a Mighty Duck with coke in its beak).
At first glance, Jones's side deals with Pepsi and Nike seemed like the smart moves of a maverick with a good case; the Dallas Cowboys generated 20 percent of the National Football League's tourist souvenirs, but, like every other franchise, got back only 3.3 percent of the pot. "Socialism," thundered Rush Limbaugh. But what would happen if the Socialist Football League expelled the Dallas cell, and let the Cowboys play pickup games among themselves, or with their cheerleaders? Once they were not part of the league's relentless crunch propaganda, no longer winners in a carefully orchestrated Wagnerian wide load, would anyone buy their caps and kitsch?
This Jerry Jones is another Steinbrenner, but twistier. He fired his last coach, Jimmy Johnson, for winning too much, two Super Bowls in a row, and then having the lack of humility to suggest it was his coaching, not Jones's owning, that won it. Maybe it was Troy Aikman's quarterbacking?
Aikman, after all, took the real hits, and as Larry Merchant pointed out last month in a smart and compassionate HBO magazine piece, is continuing to risk permanent brain damage because of his passion for the game. He can't quit. But eventually, he will be knocked out of the game. Jones, sneakers and soda pop, will live on.
Players need to play and owners need to win, and to get credit for that winning. Let psychologists tell us why. Do they need that credit because they failed to be players, because they unconsciously hate players? Too glib. And yet the sense that Don King hates fighters, or at least must dominate them in vicious, greedy ways is one of the threads in Jack Newfield's compelling "Only in America (Morrow).
King's fraud trial is getting under way in Federal court even as the promoter pummeled HBO into a corner by putting the Mike Tyson-Buster Mathis Jr. Nov. 4 fight on free Fox against its Riddick Bowe-Evander Holyfield pay-per-view bout. In what seemed like one-upmanship, HBO bought rights to the Newfield book and promised a hard-hitting Warner Brothers movie.
O.K., but that will make King an even bigger shot in jail. Better a warm and violent film about Buster Mathis Sr., a heavyweight contender ashamed of his fat body, who passes on his considerable skill to his son, but dies before he can see the boy whip Tyson and wrest boxing from King.
Yeah, sure. But then only wishful thinking can save you from the Mean Season.

 BODY:

The Getty Goes Shopping
The J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., is dipping into its notoriously deep pockets. But rather than buying Rembrandts, its latest multimillion-dollar shopping spree has been aimed at beefing up its holdings in 19th-century art, one of the weakest areas of the museum's collection.
Heading the shopping list is Monet's "Wheatstacks, Snow Effect, Morning," painted in Giverny in 1891. This is one of the earliest examples in the artist's famous Haystacks series. The Getty will not say what it paid for the sun-dappled landscape. The work was sold to the museum by an unidentified European collector who had paid $8.5 million for it in 1989, at a Sotheby's New York sale of works from the collection of John T. Dorrance, the Campbell Soup heir. The painting has been exhibited only twice, at the Galerie Paul Rosenberg in Paris in 1936 and at Acquavella Galleries in New York in 1976. The Monet, along with several other acquisitions, went on view at the Getty yesterday. 
 "Some things that come along shouldn't be missed," said John Walsh, the Getty's director. "While we've been putting an emphasis on buying Renaissance and Baroque works, there are some great rarities from the 19th century and they're not going to be around forever."
Besides the Monet, the museum also bought Millet's "Madame Felix-Bienaime Feuardent," from 1840-1842. It was sold by the London dealers Hazlitt Gooden & Fox, who were acting as agents for Joseph Goldyne, a reclusive San Francisco collector. It is believed that the Getty paid about $2 million for the portrait.
The other 19th-century purchases included a Degas self-portrait from 1857-1858 and Gericault's "Trio of Lovers" (1817-1820). The "Trio" had been bought at an auction in France about five years ago by two dealers, Guy Stair Sainty and Patrick Mathiessen; they are believed to have been the sellers. The painting, discovered in 1992, is of an interior, with a reclining nude observing a partially clothed couple embracing.
 
 
A Grant and a Web Site
 Eli Broad's high profile as a philanthropist and leading contemporary art collector is growing taller. This week, to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Eli Broad Family Foundation, Mr. Broad announced that he had given a $1 million grant to the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, where he was the founding chairman in 1979. The money is to help the museum exhibit works from its permanent collection.
And that's just the beginning. Mr. Broad, who is the chairman of SunAmerica and founder of the Kaufman & Broad Home Corporation, has built a collection of more than 500 works by 100 artists as an educational and lending resource. Now the foundation is extending its reach. "The severe decline in financial support to the arts by major corporations and the Government, combined with reductions in priorities at the Lannan Foundation here in Los Angeles, has seriously impacted the contemporary art scene," Mr. Broad said. "We have decided to reach out beyond the over 200 museums we have lent to worldwide."
On Wednesday the foundation unveiled its own Web site on the Internet (http://www.broadartfdn.org/), which will feature information on the foundation itself as well as many of the artworks in its collection. "By being on the Internet, professors and curators worldwide will get a better idea of what we have," Mr. Broad said. "And by the end of 1996 all California classrooms will have the Internet, so teachers will be able to use the information as an educational tool."
 
 
A Festival in SoHo
 What began as a small block party in SoHo two years ago has turned into a three-day arts festival that is expected to draw a crowd of about 250,000 this year. The purpose: To pack the art galleries, rather than the retail shops, on the weekend of Oct. 6, 7 and 8.
"I started organizing this the day after the last block party ended 54 weeks ago," said Simon Watson, director of the Contemporary Art Institute of New York, who has been the event's organizer. "We've gotten an amazing show of strength from everyone in the community."
The SoHo Arts Festival, as it is now called, has also got considerable financial support, about $25,000 from private sources and another $25,000 from corporations like Chase Manhattan Bank, Scholastic Inc. and Origins. In addition, participating galleries have given $250 each to advertise the event. A 32-page program will be distributed at every gallery and on every street corner ringing SoHo.
During the three days, there will be about 115 exhibitions at galleries and museums, as well as more than 50 performances by dance companies and theater groups, and a variety of special events.
CyberSoHo, a group of about 50 cultural and computer organizations that help artists become involved with the Internet, will give demonstrations at its temporary site at 66 Crosby Street, near Spring Street. Some artists, including Laurie Anderson, will give CD-ROM presentations in conjunction with Voyager, the CD-ROM manufacturer, on Oct. 7 at 1 P.M.
Every event sponsored by the SoHo Arts Festival is free and open to the public.
 
Boom Time in Chile
 While some Manhattan galleries like PaceWildenstein and Larry Gagosian are about to open in Los Angeles to tap into Hollywood money, the Marlborough Gallery is exploring a completely different part of the world. It is hoping to cash in on the economic boom in Chile, which has created new wealthy collectors, eager to buy.
But the gallery is not going alone. Marlborough has teamed up with the Chilean dealer Ana Maria Stagno to form A.M.S. Marlborough Galeria, a 4,500-square-foot gallery in Santiago opening in November.

German Reunification, 5 Years After the Fact

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
The strains of German unification five years after the twain met are the subject of "The Germans: Portrait of a New Nation" on PBS tonight. It appears that east is no longer east and west is not quite west.
Journalists, politicians, academics and just folks offer their feelings about the difficulties of reconciling a thriving, democratic West Germany with an East Germany that had been politically and economically polluted by decades of Communist rule. Although the hourlong report does not quite live up to its title, it does explore the divisions that remain even without a dividing wall. 
 An East German who fled to the West in 1987 complains that the same officials who once controlled their people's freedom now decide who will get the best jobs. Others in the west are displeased with having to subsidize the reconstruction of the east and assist its residents; the costs have already run to hundreds of billions of dollars for the west's taxpayers. Some in the east seem uncomfortable with the competitiveness of capitalism and express a fondness for the security of the Communist system, but this hour, produced in association with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, looks at matters mainly from a western perspective.
Also touched on is Germany's dominant place in a more or less united Europe and in the world. While memories of the Nazi past are evoked by skinheads campaigning against foreign laborers, especially the Turks, who have been welcomed to do low-paying jobs but are not accepted as citizens, the more democratically inclined Germans say they aspire to be good Europeans.
The somewhat sketchy hour ends with a cheerful Helmut Kohl, German Chancellor for more than a decade, waxing optimistic about developments in eastern Germany and sounding like an American politician as he calls for a crackdown on people who are exploiting his country's generous welfare system.
 
'The Visionaries'
PBS, tomorrow at 2 P.M.
(Channel 13 in New York)
This 13-part series of half-hour programs about individuals and organizations devoted to helping others begins tomorrow with a look at Thelma King Thiel, who founded the American Liver Foundation after the death of her son from liver disease. She is seen telling small school children about the workings of their liver and gigantic football Giants about the dangers of hepatitis. The half-hour ends with a newsmagaziney account, accompanied by some excruciating music, of the liver transplant for a little boy.
The second program, also tomorrow, celebrates Judy Mayotte, a former nun who lost a leg while working with Refugees International in Sudan. Not even the hardest-hearted reviewer would deny attention to the efforts of people like Ms. Mayotte, Ms. Thiel and others to come. But 13 inspiring stories may be an overdose, especially when the production is more ordinary than the subjects. The introductions delivered by Sam Waterston ("True understanding is obtained only through shared experience") are enough to inspire a person to find other things to do on Saturday afternoons.
 
'The American Promise'
PBS, Sunday at 8 P.M.
(Channel 13 in New York)
More inspiration is offered in this elaborate three-parter on big subjects like Freedom, Responsibility and Opportunity. Sunday's opening hour rushes from rock climbers in Yosemite Valley to Thomas Jefferson and friends creating the United States to an ambulance service in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn and more. The narrator breathes worthy sentiments in hushed tones. It's all evidently intended to encourage viewers to be better citizens, but the narration flies too high and the short reports do not go very deep.

HEADLINE: House Medicare Plan Will Hurt All of Us

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"House G.O.P. Plan Doubles Premiums of Medicare Users" (front page, Sept. 22) lacks a clear statement of the fundamental, widely held complaint associated with that plan.
Imposing price controls on just Medicare and Medicaid will result in increased cost-shifting from public to private health plans. 
 This will raise premium costs for those private plans, forcing more employers, particularly small-business owners, to raise costs to their employees or to drop coverage altogether.
Those who lose coverage will continue to get sick and require medical attention, but the medical care will be pursued later in the course of illnesses and will therefore be more costly.
These unreimbursed costs will be passed on to private plans, which will cause premiums to rise, causing more employers to drop coverage, causing more high-cost, unreimbursed medical services, with more cost shifting.
The only thing that economists cannot predict is where this spiral of cost shifting will end, and how many of us who are now privately insured will lose coverage in the process.
If the Republicans are permitted to continue railroading this legislation through Congress, the results will be catastrophic and will be felt by all of us, not just the elderly and the poor.

Stocks End Quarter Quietly; Treasury Yields Drop
The stock market ended the third quarter quietly, with the Dow industrials closing up 1.44 points, to 4,789.08. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed at 584.41, down 1.46 points, and the Nasdaq composite index closed at 1,043.54, down 3.51 points. For the week, the Dow rose 24.93.
The blue-chip indicator gained 0.52 percent for the week and 5.2 percent for the third quarter, compared with gains of 9.4 percent in the year's second quarter and 8.5 percent in the first quarter. [Page 37.]
 
Yields of Treasury securities hit a two-week low, with the 30-year bond falling to 6.50 percent, on weak economic data, raising expectations that the Fed may still reduce interest rates this year. [36.]
 
The dollar was higher against most leading currencies as traders sold the German mark and Swiss franc to book profits after a Swiss official called the franc overvalued. In late New York trading, the dollar was at 1.4270 German marks, up from 1.4200; at 1.1560 Swiss francs, up from 1.1465, and at 99.70 Japanese yen, up from 99.22. [32.]
 
G.D.P. Up a Revised 1.3%
Gross domestic product grew at a revised 1.3 percent in the second quarter, up from the previous estimate of 1.1 percent, bolstering the picture of a safe and steady expansion. Although the quarter was the weakest in more than two years, it kept alive an expansion that is four and a half years old. [34.]
 
Kerkorian Adds to His Team
Kirk Kerkorian has hired Ralph Whitworth, a Washington-based shareholder activist, to the team he is assembling to take on Chrysler. The hiring is further evidence that Mr. Kerkorian is planning a drawn-out campaign to change the way Chrysler is run. [35.]
 
Fed Rate Decision Was Unanimous
The Federal Open Market Committee voted 11-0 to hold the Federal funds rate for overnight bank loans at 5.75 percent at its Aug. 22 meeting, minutes showed. The committee last lowered rates at its July 6 session. [34.]
 
Change at Perot Systems
Industry sources said that James A. Cannavino, who was I.B.M.'s chief strategist, would become president and chief operating officer of Perot Systems on Monday. [35.]
 
Financier Accused of Stock Fraud
A New Jersey appeals court has unsealed stock-fraud charges against the censured financier Robert E. Brennan, accusing him and others of manipulating penny stocks from 1991 through December 1994. [35.]
 
Magazine Closer to Running Article
Business Week magazine appeared a step closer to publishing an article based on sealed court documents in a lawsuit between Procter & Gamble and Banker's Trust when a Federal judge indicated that he would allow Procter & Gamble to amend its suit in a way that would in effect open the documents. [6.]
 
Report Lifts Wheat Prices
December wheat jumped 8 cents, to $4.9225 a bushel, fueled by the quickening pace of wheat exports and low supplies. A report showed that leftover wheat supplies were below traders' expectations and that exports were nearly 9 percent ahead of last year's pace. [32.]
 
Near-record wheat prices and a sharp increase for lettuce raised the index of prices farmers received for their raw products by 2.9 percent from August to September. [34.]
 
For-Sale Signs Over Britain
Britain seems caught up in a free-market frenzy, with everything from banks, to public buildings, to a slice of British Rail all up for sale. The rush to the auction block began in the 1980's, when state-owned enterprises like airlines and telephone systems were for sale. Now, services once performed by the Government are being farmed out to private entrepreneurs. [2.]
 
Wall Street Raises Funds for Casino
The Mohegans, a Connecticut Indian tribe, announced that Bear, Stearns and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette had helped them raise funds to open a casino 10 miles from the successful Foxwoods Resort Casino in eastern Connecticut. The tribe expects to open a 150,000-square-foot casino with 3,000 slot machines and 180 table games. [26.]

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Barbarian Horses at the Gate;
Japan Is Opening Race Tracks to Foreign Imports

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: MOMETSU, Japan

 BODY:
The cool grass paddocks and tidy stables go on for mile after mile here on Japan's northern island of Hokkaido, home to this hyper-crowded country's most unlikely industry: horse breeding.
But the bucolic landscape masks a frantic economic struggle over foreign trade and Japan's national passion for horse racing. After decades of protectionism, Japan is cautiously opening its race tracks -- and a good chunk of the $1 billion in annual prize money they hand out -- to foreign thoroughbreds. 
 And the breeders at the region's 1,500 family farms, which produce about 10,000 horses a year, are panicking. They bluntly admit their horses are no match for the faster imports from the United States, Australia and Europe. "We just can't compete," complained Kazushi Takayame, owner of a tiny farm that breeds about six stallions and mares a year. "If foreign horses are allowed in too quickly, we will be swept out of all the top races and we won't be able to stay in business."
This might just be another tale of a once-coddled national industry's fight to survive in the global marketplace except for one thing: Japan is far and away the most horse-crazy country in the world and political loyalties are divided. Japanese placed $38 billion in bets last year, down from $40.8 billion in 1993, but still far more than any other country and four times the amount bet in the United States. Its $1 billion in total purse money exceeds that of any other country. When a typhoon brushed by Tokyo last month, 46,000 people still turned up at the track there
Japan is also the only country with a satellite television network devoted entirely to broadcasting horse races. The country has more than a dozen daily newspapers devoted to racing results.
Besides having access to hundreds of off-track betting parlors, Japanese can set up accounts over a telephone service called WINS and place bets by pressing buttons on the phone dial. Promoters are even experimenting with automated teller machines in convenience stores.
The upshot is that millions of people have an interest in the debate on foreign horses, and many people want to see more of them. Japan has a well-founded reputation for fighting imports of everything from rice to auto parts, but the real pressure to open up this market has not come from foreign governments as much as it has from racing promoters and horse owners within Japan.
"People say this is all because of foreign pressure, but it is really because we wanted to bring the level of Japanese horse racing up to world standards," said Norio Sakai, a spokesman for the Japan Racing Association, the agency that both regulates and promotes horse racing in Japan. "If we introduce foreign breeds, we can hold more exciting races for our fans. It doesn't make sense to keep the market closed forever while much faster horses are competing around the world."
Japanese racing fans have hardly been opposed to foreign horses either. "My feeling is that 70 to 80 percent of fans, especially young fans, are eager to have foreign horses because it will be more exciting," said Yasuhiko Amano, the horse-racing editor at Nikkan Sports, a newspaper in Tokyo.
Slowly but surely, Japanese horse buyers are abandoning the farms here in favor of the auction grounds of Kentucky and Ireland. As they do, the breeders here are scrambling to upgrade their stock with foreign bloodlines.
But the payoff could be a long time coming. Meantime, prices for Japanese thoroughbreds have plunged by almost half in three years. Making matters worse, many Japanese breeders are getting squeezed by loans they took against their property before land prices crashed.
It would be hard to find an industry more incongruous in Japan than thoroughbred farming. The soil is high in acid and low in calcium, making it difficult to grow the mineral-rich grasses that horses thrive on. The land is exorbitantly expensive. And the horses are slow by international standards.
But the breeders have prospered ever since World War II, largely because foreign horses were flatly excluded from about 85 percent of the 3,400 national races sponsored by the Japan Racing Association.
Then, three years ago, the association announced plans to let foreign horses that had not raced in other countries compete in 55 percent of races by 1996. It also called for opening 12 of the most prestigious races to horses that had competed overseas, a move that Japanese breeders vigrously oppose.
Though the original schedule has now been stretched out to 1999, about 47 percent of the 3,400 races have been opened up -- at least partly -- over the last three years.
Breeders say the mere threat of competition has already had a big impact. Takashi Sasaki, who produces about 16 horses a year, estimates that the top price for a stallion has dropped from more than $500,000 at the height of Japan's economic boom in 1991 to about $250,000 today. The average price for a solid mare, he figures, has declined from about $100,000 to $60,000.
Meanwhile, Japanese owners imported as many as 500 horses in 1995 -- the first trickle in what is expected to be an expanding flow from the United States and Europe. There are still a number of trade barriers, including a tariff on imported horses and restrictions in many races on the number of foreign-bred animals that can compete.
But buyers are clearly looking outward. "There's no animosity by the owners -- it's just a simple calculation of price," said Mr. Sasaki, an earthy man who chain-smokes Lark cigarettes as he talks. "We used to set up the price by figuring our costs and a profit and presenting it to the owners. But now people are saying they would rather go to the United States to buy."
Japanese breeders, fearful of being blown out of business, are themselves shopping overseas. Toshiyuki Shimokobe, who owns one of the largest breeding operations in the region, said he paid $4.5 million in 1994 for a horse called Afleet and would have bought another American stallion this year except the prices were too forbidding.
With sales of home-grown horses slumping, Mr. Shimokobe figures he has to take drastic action. "At the largest auction in Japan this year, they tried to sell 823 horses but only 202 of them were bought," he said. "The amount paid for those horses was about $11 million, which is just a little more than what Japanese buyers paid for 36 horses this year at the Keeneland auction in Kentucky. If those owners hadn't gone to Kentucky, they would have spent more here in Japan."
Mr. Sasaki, though he runs a much smaller operation, has also gone international. Six years ago, he bought a foal in England while it was still being carried by its mother. Now a mare called Sweet Marjorum, it went on to win four big races in Japan and recently gave birth to its first foal. Today, 8 of Mr. Sasaki's 16 mares are foreign-born.
Even the Japan Racing Association, in a bid to mollify breeders, has entered the import business. It paid $10 million last year in Kentucky for Forty-Niner, a 10-year-old stallion, which it gave as a gift to the breeders' cooperative here. But that only angered some of the breeders, who accused the association of overpaying and inadvertently kicking up the prices of American horses.
The United States, Australia and New Zealand have periodically complained that their breeders were being unfairly shut out. Though the issue is too small to have arisen as a major trade dispute, it has become a pet peeve for a handful of politicians like Kentucky's Republican Senator, Mitch McConnell.
The three countries complained last year that Japanese tracks were moving too slowly toward openness, but Japanese racing authorities said they could not move any faster than their existing plan.
The potential rewards for owners of foreign thoroughbreds are formidable. The Japan Cup, an invitation-only race that has always included big-name foreign stallions, paid about $1.5 million to the first-place winner this year -- more than double the Kentucky Derby's first-place purse last year and one of the top five purses in the world. Since the Japan Cup was started in 1981, foreign horses have captured first place 9 out of 14 times.
But the real allure is in the hundreds of second-tier races. Many pay first-place winners several hundred thousand dollars, with generous purses going to second- and third-place finishers as well. Given the large number of races each year, owners of strong horses can reap millions of dollars.
That prospect has split the industry between horse owners and breeders. Owners increasingly shop the world for animals that can open the treasure chest of prize money. Breeders, who generally do not race the horses they raise, see a threat to their existence.
"We admit it, the quality of our horses is lower," said Mr. Shimokobe, the breeder. "There is no way to change that unless you get better breeding from new stallions. We're trying to do that, but it takes an enormous amount of money."
The Shimokobe farm seems a picture of prosperity. The big main building sports a manicured garden outside and expensive sedans in the driveway. Mr. Shimokobe, dressed in a fresh yellow sport shirt, talks in an almost scholarly way about the declining market for Japanese-bred horses and the need to raise millions to improve his horses' gene pool.
But while his size gives him an edge, the vast majority of small breeders face a tougher future. It is more difficult for them to raise the cash to buy top-flight foreign horses. Indeed, says Mr. Takayame, who inherited his farm from his father, many of his friends are scrambling to pay back loans. "You are lucky if you have the freedom to get out of this business," he said.
Ranchers like Mr. Takayame say they want to stay in the horse business and match world standards. But for now, they say, that requires continued protection against foreign competition, even if that seems unfair to foreign breeders.
"Japanese horses are second class; that's just the way it is," said Mr. Takayame, sipping green tea in his parlor as rain clouds rolled in from the ocean. "If we don't make enough profit, we won't have the money to buy the stronger stallions we need to surpass the Americans."

HEADLINE: WILSON, TRAILING IN VOTERS' POLLS, DROPS 1996 QUEST

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr. 

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif., Sept. 29

 BODY:
His campaign coffers empty and his standing in the polls negligible, Gov. Pete Wilson withdrew today from the 1996 Presidential race, the first in the 10-man Republican field to quit.
"My conscience tells me to go on would be unfair to all whose higher hopes simply will not be met," the 62-year-old Governor said in a brief lunch-hour resignation speech here to several hundred cheering supporters and campaign workers. But come the year 2000, he added pointedly, he might try again. 
 Mr. Wilson's departure had seemed increasingly probable in recent weeks as he continued to lag in the polls and in fund raising, and will probably have little effect on the eventual outcome of the contest.
That, as much as anything, is the measure of how little was achieved by a candidate who only months ago was widely viewed as Senator Bob Dole's toughest rival for the nomination, and was regarded by the White House as President Clinton's most formidable Republican rival. The Wilson campaign, after all, was centered on the Governor of the nation's richest, most populous state, the one with the most electoral votes.
Mr. Wilson had hoped that his mostly moderate brand of Republicanism would position him as the alternative candidate if more conservative leaders like Senator Dole, begin to falter. He believed that once the faltering began, the party would conclude that a candidate closer to the political center would run best against Mr. Clinton, the presumed Democratic nominee.
But as Mr. Dole began to falter a bit, Mr. Wilson gained no strength in the polls, remaining below 5 percent in most of them even after he adopted hard conservative stands on some issues. The disenchanted drifted mainly into the "undecided" column, unpersuaded by the Governor's wooden, rather narrow calls from the stump for a total overhaul of welfare programs, a halt to Federal involvement in the abortion dispute and an end to illegal immigration and affirmative action.
With Colin L. Powell, the retired Army general and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, emerging on the political scene, as well as Ross Perot's move this week to form a third party, Mr. Wilson's strategy of presenting himself as the moderate alternative to Senator Dole seemed even more tenuous.
Still, the Governor's departure from the race is likely to bring little benefit to General Powell, should he decide to run. If anything, Mr. Wilson's experience in recent months suggests that a Republican candidate who holds moderate positions, as General Powell does, too, will find the going difficult.
As might be expected, the Republicans still in the race tried to portray Mr. Wilson's withdrawal as helping their candidacies. "Pete Wilson took a hard-nosed, disciplined run at Bob Dole," said the Kansas Senator's campaign manager, Scott Reed. "No candidate was more focused or more determined than Wilson, yet Dole was not dented. That shows deep depth of support for Bob Dole."
Former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who attacked Mr. Wilson at every turn, today portrayed himself as the only major candidate who is based outside Washington. "Governor Wilson's withdrawal makes this campaign a very clear choice between two respected Washington Senators," Mr. Alexander said, alluding to Senator Dole and Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, "and one Governor with executive experience from outside Washington, D.C."
Bay Buchanan, campaign manager for Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator, said Mr. Wilson's emphasis on illegal immigration and affirmative action were issues shared by Mr. Buchanan. "As difficult and painful as this decision must be for Pete Wilson," she said, "it is excellent news for the Buchanan campaign."
Mr. Wilson's departure from the ranks of 1996 Presidential contenders by no means eliminates him from consideration as a possible running mate for the eventual nominee. After all, he hails from California, and his moderate brand of Republicanism could provide an ideological balance if the 1996 ticket has a strong conservative at the top.
But in the meantime, the Governor must face defeat, at least short-term defeat.
"To go on would simply be to run up an unacceptable debt," Mr. Wilson said of his decision to withdraw. "All this takes money."
He was alluding to the fact that his campaign is already about $1 million in the red. But by getting out now before running up any more debt, he can pay off what he owes with the $1 million in matching Federal campaign funds that he has to his credit.
In explaining his shortage of money, Mr. Wilson said he was hobbled by the late start he got on the hustings because of a slow recovery from minor throat surgery.
What he did not say was that his brand of Republicanism ignited no real enthusiasm in a party whose nominating process is dominated by hard-line conservatives.
Nor did he mention that many of his critics contended that his ideology was so cynically fine-tuned to garner votes that some of his stands were 180 degrees from positions taken only a few years earlier.
And he did not say anything about how his entry into the race, however tardy, so infuriated California voters that he never could rely on the state as his main font for campaign funds. And, equally daunting, he could never be sure that he would carry the state in either the Republican primary next spring or the general election in the fall.
Almost from the moment Mr. Wilson hit the campaign trail, polls found that most Californians disapproved, preferring that he stay put in Sacramento, where the struggle continues over ways for the state to overcome the lingering effects of the economic recession.
And beyond California, Mr. Wilson made almost no political headway in his months of campaigning. Indeed, because his standing in the polls was so low and his money supply so meager, he recently pulled out of the campaign in Iowa, which will hold the first major round of caucuses next year.
When he announced his decision to skip the Iowa caucuses, Mr. Wilson said he would concentrate his main effort on the New England primaries, especially the one in New Hampshire, the first in the nation. But as it turns out, he made little headway in New Hampshire, either.
The most recent poll there, published on Thursday by The Concord Monitor, found that he had finally achieved high name recognition by spending the better part of two months running television advertisements and by personally working the cities, towns and crossroads of the state. But once voters knew who he was, fewer than one in 20 who are registered Republicans said they would support him.
Still, the Governor insisted today that he was "damn proud" of his brief run.
"There's one hell of a lot of fight left in this old marine," he said, recalling his early years of military service and promising to remain in the political pit. Then he raised the possibility that he might try again for the Presidency in 2000.
"The old saying is that old soldiers never die, they just fade away," he said, recalling Gen. Douglas MacArthur's address to Congress in 1951.
"A hell of a line -- but not for me," Mr. Wilson continued. "Now if we're not going to be permitted to serve as President -- at least this time around ----"
He went on to talk about his coming agenda for California. But the crowd of supporters and campaign workers around him picked up on the previous statement and erupted in chants of "Pete! Pete! Pete!"

HEADLINE: Surprise From the I.R.S.: Easier Business-Expense Filing

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
The Internal Revenue Service, after years of complaint from business, unexpectedly eased one of the most irksome paperwork burdens today and will no longer require receipts for business travel and entertainment unless the expense exceeds $75.
Since 1962, the threshold has been $25. 
 Commissioner Margaret Milner Richardson called the new rule, which takes effect on Sunday, "part of our ongoing efforts to make government work better and cost less."
At the same time, the I.R.S. said it was considering rule changes to facilitate electronic filing of expense accounts, among other things.
Tax lawyers and corporate executives greeted today's business receipts ruling with expressions of strong support to near ecstasy.
"I'm totally delighted," said Mary B. Hevener, a tax specialist in the Washington office of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, who represents numerous corporate clients and has long fretted personally about the need to obtain and keep track of receipts for relatively minor purchases. "You won't have to scrounge around for the little stuff," she said.
The I.R.S. said it had conducted no analysis of possible revenue loss and hoped there would be none since deduction amounts do not change, only the documentation requirements.
Nevertheless, today's move contrasts with a proposal Congress considered a decade ago -- cutting the receipt threshold to $15 on the assumption that it would generate additional revenue because people would have less chance to fudge unproven expenses.
Although today's action takes a large step toward adjusting the threshold for inflation, the $25 standard in place since 1962 would have to be raised to $126.16 for full compensation, according to a calculation by Todd Wilson, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Under the law, to claim deductions taxpayers must maintain adequate records of such expenses as travel, entertainment and gifts. Lodging for business travel requires a receipt regardless of the amount -- and will continue to do so -- while other expenses call for receipts when they reach the specified threshold, $75 starting Sunday.
The rules also govern reimbursement from employers, who must deduct taxes if they repay workers' expenses and the worker has not submitted the necessary receipts.
In addition to lightening the burden for tens of millions of individuals, the liberalized documentation is seen as a boon to corporations, which in various respects act as agents of the I.R.S.
"If you went to $75, you probably cut out 50 percent" of the receipts to be processed with expense accounts, said Jack R. Skinner, tax vice president of the Halliburton Company, the Dallas-based company best known for oilfield equipment. He said his company would probably move in lockstep with the I.R.S. In contrast, the I.R.S. and private specialists predicted that some companies would impose their own, less generous documentation standards.
And companies remain free, of course, to deny reimbursement for expenses above an amount they determine, independent of today's I.R.S. action.
Timothy McCormally, general counsel of the Tax Executives Institute, which represents corporations, noted that with fewer paper receipts needed, more employees could use modern technology instead of pen and paper to claim reimbursement.
"That's where I see the real benefit," he said. "It enables you to move to the electronic expense accounts" that can be submitted without appendages.
The second element in today's announcement -- I.R.S. review of its rules governing what documents for reimbursed expenses companies need to obtain and keep -- was also hailed by corporate officials.
They said they had long hoped for relief from what they called increasingly onerous requirements involving their ability to prove to the I.R.S. -- and account to the employee -- how reimbursements were properly left untaxed.
The agency said it was reviewing its rules "to determine whether changes should be made to provide alternative ways to satisfy these record-keeping requirements." Specialists said this no doubt implied greater use of electronic technology and less of such staples as microfiche.
More immediately, however, daily life will change in small ways for millions. There will be significantly fewer occasions, for example, when travelers need to ask for receipts from harried cab drivers, only to be tossed a blank one with its temptation to cheat.

HEADLINE: 2 Presidents and a King Talk About Peace Talks

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
A day after the signing of an agreement on Palestinian self-rule, President Clinton met today with King Hussein of Jordan and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt to try to advance the stalled peace efforts between Syria and Israel.
Despite the excitement over the Israeli-Palestinian agreement, no one was predicting that Syria would soon join the Middle East "circle of peace" that Mr. Clinton called for on Thursday, since the differences between Syria and Israel remain so wide. 
 The two countries differ over whether Israel should give back all of the Golan Heights, how long it should take Israel to withdraw, and what the security arrangements should be on that strategic plateau.
"The fact is an agreement will take time," a senior State Department official said. "We can see some openings on how to overcome or try to overcome the substantive differences."
American diplomats, who have mediated the Middle East talks, said they hoped to jump-start the near-moribund peace effort between Syria and Israel when Syria's Foreign Minister, Farouk al-Sharaa, meets with Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Washington next week. Several officials said Mr. Christopher might visit Syria in a month's time when he attends an economic conference in Jordan.
Today, in his meetings with King Hussein and Mr. Mubarak, Mr. Clinton discussed how to push Syria and Lebanon, which Syria largely controls, to make peace with Israel, White House officials said. While the two Middle East leaders said they would try to nudge President Hafez al-Assad of Syria forward, they agreed there was no magic formula.
After Syria and Israel made slow, fitful progress in the spring, their talks bogged down over the summer. The military chiefs of staff of the two longtime enemies met in Washington in June for what were hailed as successful talks, but then Mr. Assad called off a meeting he had previously agreed to between lower-level Israeli and Syrian military officials.
Since then, Syria has wanted to resume talks between its Ambassador in Washington and Israel's, but Israel has refused because it has not received the assurances it wanted that military-to-military talks would soon follow.
One stumbling block is that Syrian officials say they will not resume military talks until Israel agrees to drop its demand that it retain an early-warning station on the Golan Heights after its withdrawal.
For more than a year, the outline of an Israeli-Syrian peace has been clear: Israel would withdraw from most or all of the Golan Heights while Syria would recognize Israel and open its borders with Israel.
After proposing a withdrawal over five to eight years, Israel has now proposed three to five years. Mr. Assad is demanding withdrawal in 18 months, after having first sought immediate withdrawal.

HEADLINE: Fed Panel Unanimous in August for No Action

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers were unanimous in their decision to hold a crucial lending rate steady at their Aug. 22 meeting, according to minutes of the session released today.
The Federal Open Market Committee's 11-to-0 vote left the target for the Federal funds rate on overnight bank loans at 5.75 percent. By changing the interest rates it controls, the Fed can in effect lower or raise borrowing costs on everything from home mortgages to industrial loans. 
 The Fed committee normally meets eight times a year, at intervals of five to eight weeks. Deliberations are held in secret but the minutes are released several weeks later, after the subsequent committee session.
At the most recent meeting, on Tuesday, the panel again decided to leave the target for the Federal funds rate unchanged. The committee meets next on Nov. 15.
The minutes from Aug. 22 stated that "all the members indicated that they would vote for a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions."
"They also favored a directive that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustments during the inter-meeting period," the minutes stated.
The committee last lowered rates at its July 6 session, the first such action in three years. The quarter-point move, to 5.75 percent, was intended to bolster the economy so it would not fall into recession.
During 1994 and early 1995, the Fed increased rates seven times in an effort to slow the economy's growth rate to a noninflationary pace of about 2.5 percent a year, well below last year's 4.1 percent pace. In the first quarter of 1995, the economy grew at a 2.7 percent rate. In the second quarter, growth slipped to a 1.3 percent rate, according to revised figures released today by the Commerce Department.
For the first eight months of the year, producer price inflation was running at a 1.4 percent annual rate compared with 1.7 percent for all of last year, according to the Labor Department. Consumer price inflation, in the first eight months of the year, was running at a 2.9 percent yearly pace, compared with 2.7 percent for all of 1994.
When officials decide to lower the Federal funds rate, they direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to buy Treasury securities on the Fed's behalf in the markets. This tends to pump money into the banking system, pushing rates lower.

HEADLINE: 2d Quarter's Growth Rate Is Revised Upward Slightly

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
The spring slump in economic activity was not quite as severe as previously thought, the Commerce Department said today in a report that bolstered the picture of a steady expansion.
The Government said gross domestic product grew at a revised annual rate of 1.3 percent from April through June instead of the 1.1 percent rate previously estimated. 
 Although the quarter was the weakest in more than two years, it nonetheless kept alive an expansion that is four and a half years old, and the growth was accompanied by subdued price rises and by record corporate profits.
"The economy seems to be moving along a trend-like path of growth in the 2.5 percent range," said Allen Sinai, the economist at Lehman Brothers in New York. Federal Reserve policy makers have said that growth in that range will create jobs without a surge in inflation.
The Commerce Department also reported that sales of new homes dropped in August by 9.6 percent, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 710,000. But the decline followed two months of strong gains including a sharp upward revision that pushed July's sales rate to 785,000, its highest in a year and a half.
Mr. Sinai said conditions were favorable for a modest pickup in the pace of overall economic activity for the balance of the year with healthy housing markets and robust capital investment by companies.
"Residential construction will help lead the economy upward," he said. "This is a low-interest-rate environment, and it will remain so because of modest inflation and a friendly Fed."
The second-quarter G.D.P. report showed an even stronger pace of inventory-building than previously thought, as stocks of finished but unsold goods rose at an annual rate of $34.3 billion instead of $32.7 billion.
Furthermore, the decline in government spending was revised to $2.4 billion from $4.1 billion, exerting less of a drag on the economy.
The second-quarter growth rate for G.D.P. was well down from 2.7 percent in the first three months this year, and it was the weakest since 1.2 percent in the first quarter of 1993. G.D.P. measures the value of all goods and services produced by workers and capital.
Fed policy makers decided this week to hold interest rates steady, since the expansion was gathering steam on its own after the second quarter without the need for more stimulus from cheaper credit.
"On the whole, the near-term prospects for the economy have improved in recent months," the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, told Congress a week ago.
New claims for jobless pay fell sharply this week -- a sign of strength in labor markets -- and August sales of existing homes were the strongest in more than a year.
Though new-home sales went the other way, weakening in August, industry analysts said the overall trend remained healthy.
Michael Carliner, an economist with the National Association of Home Builders, noted that August new-home sales were still nearly 6 percent above the levels of a year ago, bolstered by relatively cheap mortgage rates.
"Except for a short period at the end of 1993, rates are about as low as we've had in a generation," Mr. Carliner said. "That's the basis for a sound housing market."
Rates for a 30-year loan were above 9 percent at the beginning of the year but had dropped to about 7.9 percent in August -- a significant saving on a mortgage payment.
And there is little upward pressure on rates, which are extremely sensitive to signs of rising inflation. Two inflation measures in today's G.D.P. report were unchanged. The implicit price deflator, measuring a changing basket of consumer goods, advanced at a 1.6 percent annual rate, compared with 2.2 percent in the first quarter. The fixed-weights measure, looking at a fixed basket of goods, rose 2.8 percent, down from 3.3 percent in the first quarter.
The Commerce Department also revised upward its chain-weighted measure of G.D.P. -- a new measurement method that is supposed to reflect more clearly how consumers react when prices change.
It showed a rate of second-quarter growth of seven-tenths of 1 percent instead of the five-tenths of 1 percent estimated a month ago. That was down from a 1.7 percent rate of expansion in the first quarter.
Corporate profits after taxes were running at a record annual rate of $353.6 billion in the second quarter, up from $350.7 billion in the first three months this year.

HEADLINE: CSX Will Pay Whistle-Blower $1.18 Million

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER 

 BODY:
When he told officials of the CSX Corporation's giant railroad subsidiary in 1991 about cost overruns on Government-financed programs, A. David Nelson said, he expected a pat on the back. Instead, Mr. Nelson contended last year in a Federal whistle-blower lawsuit, he was told by his bosses to keep his mouth shut or face being dismissed.
Yesterday, a Federal judge in Washington signed off on a settlement that would cost the company $5.9 million, of which about $1.18 million would go to Mr. Nelson. At issue were inflated labor and equipment charges for work done by CSX at highway railroad crossings in more than 10 states. 
 Under a little-known program administered by state governments, the Federal Department of Transportation supplies 90 percent of the funds used to pay railroads to maintain and repair highway crossings. The states pick up the rest of the costs.
According to Mr. Nelson's lawsuit, which was filed under the Federal False Claims Act, CSX regularly overbilled Federal and state governments for both labor and materials used at the crossings. He also contended that he had told more than 20 CSX employees, including several vice presidents, about the problem but that they had failed to take any action.
"My director told me to back off and said that I was beating a dead horse," Mr. Nelson said in an interview.
Marty Fiorentino, a spokesman for CSX Transportation in Jacksonville, Fla., said that the company had done nothing wrong and had settled the case to avoid the cost of litigation. He said that Mr. Nelson had first got in touch with CSX officials about the situation in 1993 and that the company had immediately begun an internal audit that uncovered the problem.
Mr. Fiorentino said the overcharges had occurred because CSX's billing system was based on the average time it took to complete a job 20 years ago. As soon as the problem was discovered, he said, CSX quickly refunded any overcharges to the affected states.
"Technology had changed and our billing process had failed to take that into account," he said.
But Steven H. Parton, chief of the economic crimes division of the Florida Attorney General's office, disputed that contention. He said that his office's inquiry determined that Mr. Nelson had first brought the billing problem to CSX's attention in 1991. CSX confirmed the overbilling in an audit undertaken that year, he said, but the company waited until 1993 before refunding any funds to state governments.
"Our biggest problem with them was that they were not remitting the money," Mr. Parton said.
Mr. Nelson said he had faced many problems common to whistle-blowers. In his lawsuit, Mr. Nelson asserted that he agreed to resign from CSX in 1991 because company officials had told him that he could use his exit interview as an opportunity to make higher-ups outside the purchasing department aware of the billing overcharges.
But when he agreed to resign his $40,000-a-year job, Mr. Nelson's lawsuit stated, he was denied an exit interview. Mr. Fiorentino, the CSX spokesman, said that Mr. Nelson had resigned on his own accord and no one suggested that he do so.
Whatever the case, Mr. Nelson first reported his concerns to Federal and state officials in 1992. He also said he and his family soon began a steady descent into poverty. "The only job I could get was for $5 to $7 an hour working for the telephone company," he said.
In April 1993, CSX, which is based in Jacksonville, refunded $2.1 million to 18 states as adjustments to amounts previously billed for the construction of signals at highway crossings. Earlier this year, the company also agreed to pay 12 of those states -- including Florida -- $1.4 million.
The Justice Department also charged that CSX had overbilled the Federal Government for parts used at railroad crossings by selling them at a profit to third-party vendors, then repurchasing the parts, and charging the Government the higher repurchase price.
In one case, according to Mr. Nelson's lawsuit, CSX manufactured shunt plates, which are used at crossings to signal a train's approach, for about $29 each. It then sold each plate to a third-party vendor for $68 and then later repurchased the part for $78, the price that the Government was charged.
Mr. Fiorentino said that he was unaware of any overcharges on parts. Mr. Parton, the Florida investigator, said his inquiry found no evidence of kickbacks between vendors and CSX in the billing arrangement.
Mr. Nelson, who said he came with a hair's breath of losing his home, said he now believed that he had been vindicated. But even with the handsome fee from the Federal Government for his efforts, it is time, he said, to move on.
"I can't remain in Jacksonville and start my life over again," he said.

HEADLINE: Weak Signs In Economy Help Bonds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Yields of Treasury securities hit a two-week low yesterday on weak economic data, which raised market expectations that the Fed might still have the opportunity to reduce interest rates this year.
The data released yesterday were August new-home sales, the final revision of second-quarter gross domestic product, the Chicago Purchasing Managers report and the University of Michigan sentiment survey. All showed weaknesses in the economy and thus were seen as helping to justify higher bond prices. 
 The 30-year bond rose 13/32 , to a price of 10428/32 to yield 6.50 percent, down from 6.59 percent on Thursday and the lowest since Sept. 20, when it was 6.46 percent. Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Bank of Pittsburgh, said data for the last two months painted a picture of uneven improvement in economic conditions with diminishing inflationary pressures. For example, he said, new-home sales dropped sharply in August after a large upward revision in July's sales.
In the Chicago Purchasing Managers survey, "manufacturing conditions in the key Chicago region held steady in September," Mr. Hoffman said, "in contrast to a big improvement in the Philadelphia area." He added, "Manufacturers in both areas reported fading price pressures."
The University of Michigan's survey of consumer sentiment sagged in September, he said, yet department store sales improved. And finally, he added, prices of imported goods dipped in August for the third straight month.
"Looking ahead, there are a number of preconditions for the Fed to lower the funds rate again," Mr. Hoffman said. "These include passage of a credible deficit reduction bill, good inflation data, mixed news on the economy and a stable dollar. I expect enough of these conditions will be met to pave the way for a funds rate reduction to 5.50 percent at the Nov. 15 Federal Open Market Committee meeting."
Mr. Hoffman said he expected the long bond to stay in the same range it has been since the central bank last reduced the Federal funds rate in July: somewhere between 6.50 and 6.75 percent.
Next week, the key number will be September's jobs report. "Anything under a 200,000 gain doesn't change much," he said. "But a strong number will give the Fed reason to pause, while a weaker report adds to the case that labor growth is still slow."
The data reported yesterday renewed hopes that another Fed easing was in the wings.
Early in the session, many investors set up short positions, thinking that the Chicago Purchasing Managers report would be very strong and would send bond prices down. Economists expected the index to register 53.6, but it actually dropped to 49 in September, compared with 49.3 in August. And the short-sellers were forced to cover their positions. The buying then accelerated when headlines reported that new-home sales had fallen 9.6 percent.
In bond futures trading, the December contract went as high as 11415/32 amid a rally late in the day.
Traders report that technical factors are bullish heading into the September National Purchasing Management report on Monday. The December contract closed off its high at 11411/32 , with the low around 11220/32 .

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Climbs as Traders Sell Marks and Swiss Francs

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar ended higher yesterday against most leading currencies after traders sold the German mark and Swiss franc to book profits.
In late New York trading, the dollar was at 1.4270 German marks, up from 1.4200 marks late Thursday. It rose to 1.1560 Swiss francs from 1.1465. 
 The rise of the dollar against the European currencies helped push it higher against the Japanese yen, traders said. It was at 99.70 Japanese yen in late New York trading, up from 99.22 yen late Thursday.
Traders said the move out of the mark and Swiss franc was prompted by comments from Markus Lusser, the president of the Swiss National Bank, Switzerland's central bank. Mr. Lusser told reporters in Lausanne that the Swiss franc was overvalued at current levels and posed risks for foreign investors in Swiss assets.
The mark and the Swiss franc, both viewed as safe havens in times of uncertainty in Europe, have surged in recent days amid concerns about the future of European economic and monetary union.
Some analysts said the dollar would probably remain vulnerable as nervous investors continued to move in and out of the Swiss franc and the mark because of growing uncertainty about a common European currency.
Many traders were reluctant to read too much into yesterday's trading, noting that it was light because it was the end of the third quarter.
"Whenever you get to the last trading day of the month most people have already pretty much finished up trading for that month," said Vicki Schmelzer Alicea, a dealer at Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale in New York. "So, you end up with very thin market conditions, and sometimes the moves are exaggerated."
Traders also noted that market players were generally cautious about buying or selling the dollar too aggressively ahead of next week's International Monetary Fund meeting, which will be attended by officials of the Group of Seven industrial nations.
The dollar is expected to remain well supported amid concern that the Group of Seven -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States -- will reinforce its April agreement to continue an "orderly reversal" of the dollar by agreeing on fresh central-bank intervention.
In other trading, the British pound was at $1.5845, up from $1.5792 on Thursday, while the dollar fell to $1.3419 (Canadian) from $1.3512 (Canadian).

HEADLINE: The Art of Jury Reading;
Lawyers in Terror Trial Study Every Tie

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Since Sunday morning, the jurors in the terrorism trial of Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman and nine others have been locked in a heavily guarded room, wrestling with the prosecutors' assertion that the defendants plotted to wage "a war of urban terrorism" against America.
During eight months of testimony, lawyers on both sides have made an art of trying to read the jurors, who have been kept anonymous for their own security. Like anthropologists studying a lost tribe, the lawyers have searched for clues to the jurors' thoughts in a roll of the eyes, a glassy stare, a wink, a sigh, an angry look. 
 For instance, Juror No. 2, a 59-year-old computer specialist from Manhattan, took copious notes, rolled her eyes at defense lawyers and beamed when the prosecutors made their closing arguments. "She's a queen for the prosecution," said one defense lawyer, requesting anonymity.
And Juror No. 7, a fresh-faced 35-year-old telecommunications worker from Mount Pleasant, N.Y., who was extremely attentive during the defense summations, objected to having his belongings searched during deliberations, a sign that he will question authority, lawyers said. "He's definitely got a heart," said another defense lawyer, who insisted on anonymity. "But we don't know how strong he is."
No one but District Judge Michael B. Mukasey and his clerk know the names and addresses of the 12 people who are deliberating a range of charges that include attempted bombing, murder, seditious conspiracy to overthrow the United States Government and conspiracy to bomb New York landmarks. But court documents reveal that they are an unusual group for a Federal jury in Manhattan, in that most of them are black or Hispanic, and most are from the Bronx.
Defense lawyers believe this will work against the prosecution. Conventional wisdom holds that poor people from minority neighborhoods are more likely to believe the authorities can make mistakes than more affluent jurors are.
"All other things being equal," said one of the defense lawyers, Wesley M. Serra, "people from the Bronx are so distrustful of authorities that they make good jurors."
The lawyers admit that reading a jury is not a science, but the best guess of the defense is that when deliberations began, at least two jurors appeared to be in the prosecution's camp while at least three seemed skeptical of the prosecution. The rest are either difficult to read or, in the view of the lawyers, likely to follow whatever the majority decides.
"I think there are matched some strong personalities on both sides," said Lynne F. Stewart, Mr. Abdel Rahman's lawyer. "But I still have to say it has more of a lean to the defense side. This is a jury that can hear arguments of outrageous government misconduct and believe them."
Prosecutors declined to comment about the jury."We just won't have any comment until the verdict is in," said Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for the United States Attorney's office.
The jurors have sat through often tedious testimony from 200 witnesses in the largest terrorism case ever tried in America, unable to say a word about what they think. In the last few days, they have given at least some clue as to what is on their minds.
First, they sent out several notes asking for testimony about two defendants who played peripheral roles in the bombing plot, Ibrahim A. Elgabrowny and Mohammad Saleh. Then, on Wednesday, their requests for testimony suggested that they had moved on to the murder charge against El Sayyid Nosair, the man accused of killing Rabbi Meir Kahane, a radical Zionist, in November 1991.
On Thursday, their focus seemed to shift back to Mr. Elgabrowny, as they asked the judge a legalistic question: Does a search warrant for Mr. Elgabrowny's house allow Federal agents to search his person as well? Later in the afternoon, they asked for testimony from a telephone call between Mr. Elgabrowny and an FBI informer, Emad A. Salem.
Entering a fourth day of deliberations yesterday, the jury began asking to review the testimony of another prosecution witness, Abdo Mohammed Aggag, who testified that Mr. Abdel Rahman had approved a plot to assassinate President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt in April 1993.
As a whole, they are a mature group; the youngest is 35. There are six men and six women. Six of the jurors are white, two of them Hispanic, and six are black. Seven are from the Bronx, three from Westchester County and two from Manhattan.
Four of the 12 jurors graduated from college. The rest have at least a high school education, many with some college credits. Their occupations are varied: mail carrier, accountant, transit worker, computer programmer, telecommunications worker, civil clerk, mental health worker, bank employee and hospital worker.
Juror No. 2, the computer specialist, who said she regularly reads The New York Times, Gourmet magazine and the Harvard Health Newsletter and watches the "MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour," has served on five previous juries. She rolled her eyes and sighed when Roger Stavis, the lawyer for Mr. Nosair, rose for cross-examinations and closing arguments. She worries the defense.
Juror No. 9 is also a concern. A 36-year-old medical technician and former marine, he went pale as linen when the prosecution played a tape of Mr. Abdel Rahman expressing approval after United States servicemen died in Somalia.
"That guy looked like somebody put a mask of ice on his face," Ms. Stewart said.
On the other side, the defense has high hopes for Juror No. 7, the telecommunications worker, who has two young children and has done volunteer work for the homeless in Manhattan. And they see Nos. 3 and 4 as possibly sympathetic.
Defense lawyers point out that Juror No. 3, a 61-year-old bank employee from the Bronx, rolled her eyes often during the testimony of Mr. Salem, the prosecution's main witness, whom they have tried to paint as a liar. She also laughed and smiled at the antics of two defense lawyers, John Jacobs and Valerie Amsterdam, who purposely bickered like an old married couple for the jury's amusement as they tried to cast doubt on F.B.I. agents who handled crucial tape recordings.
"She's the kind of African-American woman who doesn't mind telling white Americans that they are wrong," said Anthony Ricco, a lawyer for Mr. Elgabrowny who fought to keep No. 3 on the panel.
Juror No. 4, the foreman, a 39-year-old man with three children, seemed "very tuned in" during the entire trial and appeared to catch all the nuances of the testimony, Ms. Stewart said. He also shocked the court one day by arriving with a shaved head.
One day, however, he betrayed some hostility toward one defendant, Tarig Elhassan, giving him a murderous look after the prosecution ran a tape recording of Mr. Elhassan saying Americans should be killed. Nevertheless, the defense lawyers still believe he is open-minded and could argue for some acquittals.
"I don't think he's a man with an agenda," Mr. Ricco said.
Each of the other jurors has a distinct reputation. For instance, Juror No. 1, a 40-year-old letter carrier, wore sunglasses the entire trial and showed no emotion. Juror No. 6, a 50-year-old hospital worker from the Bronx and a native of Puerto Rico, took few notes and spent a lot of time smiling at people in the gallery. Some courtroom regulars nicknamed him "happy face."
"He's a follower," one defense lawyer said. "He's just along for the ride."
Juror No. 8, a 55-year-old transit worker who moved to New York from Alabama, was known as the sleepy juror, because she seemed to be napping through some of the boring testimony.
Juror No. 5, a 58-year-old management consultant from Scarsdale, gave up a trip to China to serve on the jury. She is well-traveled, and the defense took heart because she had visited Israel in April 1993 with her church group to speak to Palestinians about their problems.
But during summations, she avoided eye contact with the defense attorneys, which some said they took as a bad sign.
As the deliberations ground on, the defense lawyers lounged in rooms furnished with cast-off chairs and makeshift tables. Some played gin and backgammon, while others caught up on their pulp fiction.
"Tea leaves, tea leaves," said Steven M. Bernstein, a lawyer for Amir Abdelgani, as he slapped down his losing gin hand.
"It's not even tea leaves," responded Ms. Stewart. "It's Ouija boards and crystal balls."

HEADLINE: Charles Simon, 83, Investment Banker

 BODY:
Charles J. Simon, a retired general partner at Salomon Brothers investment bank and a philanthropist, died on Wednesday at home in Manhattan. He was 83.
He had been in failing health with varied ailments, said Steve Loeb, his lawyer. 
 Henry Kaufman, a former partner at Salomon, said Mr. Simon was a major contributor to the firm's growth. He specialized in promoting sales to banks and in giving investment advice. His career at Salomon started in the 1930's, and he rose to general partner in 1946. In 1976, he assumed a part-time role as a limited partner, which he continued until his death.
Mr. Simon, who had served as the treasurer of the Whitney Museum of American Art, was on the museum's board for 23 years. He was also a director of the 92d Street Y and a trustee of the Museum of the American Indian and the Animal Medical Center.
Born in Manhattan, he grew up in Long Beach, L.I., and graduated from the College of William and Mary and the New York University Graduate School of Business. In 1990, he endowed a chair at the N.Y.U. school in applied financial economics for the study of the financial service industry.
He is survived by a half-brother, Henry, of Sherman Oaks, Calif.; a daughter, Patricia Clerc, of Normandy, France; a granddaughter and a great-grandson.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Appellate Court Rules in Favor of Players

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
In a decision that was long expected, an appellate court yesterday upheld the Federal court ruling six months ago that saved the baseball season.
A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that Judge Sonia Sotomayor was correct when she ruled on March 31 that the owners acted improperly in unilaterally implementing new work rules last February. 
 In granting the National Labor Relations Board's request for a temporary injunction ordering the clubs to restore the previous rules, Sotomayor saved the season because the decision prompted the players to end their seven-and-a-half-month strike and return to work.
Commenting on the owners' action in eliminating free agency and salary arbitration, Judge Ralph Winter wrote that the clubs' labor relations committee "decided to settle the original unfair labor practice charges while embarking on a course of action based on a fallacious view of the duty to bargain." He added, "We see no reason to relieve it of the consequences of that course."
The clubs had argued that free agency and salary arbitration were permissive, not mandatory, subjects of bargaining, but Winter found otherwise. Saying that free agency was "nothing but the flip side" of baseball's reserve system, he wrote, "If free agency were a permissive subject of collective bargaining, then so would be the reserve system."
By upholding the lower court decision, the circuit court also reinforced Sotomayor's ruling that if the owners want to declare an impasse in negotiations and implement new terms and conditions, they would have to prove to her that an impasse exists.
The owners have not indicated whether they will try to change the economic system before the coming signing season, but they aren't close to being able to implement anything.
The owners and players have not conducted serious, full-scale negotiations since March 30, the day before Sotomayor's decision. Instead, committees populated mostly by lawyers have held "brainstorming" sessions in recent weeks.
The two sides reacted predictably to yesterday's decision.
"While we are disappointed with the result, it has little impact on what is happening now," Bud Selig, the acting commissioner, said. "We still believe the resolution of the entire matter will take place at the bargaining table."
The result pleased Donald Fehr, the union chief, who said: "The task remains to negotiate an overall long-term agreement. That's what the parties have to dedicate themselves to. Hopefully, the owners will be inclined to do that."
Daniel Silverman, director of the N.L.R.B.'s New York office, called it a "great victory for the board and collective bargaining," adding that he was pleased that the season was progressing.

HEADLINE: Not So Quick on This Budget Elixir

 BODY:
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York believes he has uncovered a politician's dream: huge spending cuts and tax hikes that are too technical to understand or much notice. Senator Moynihan proposes to adjust downward the Government's measure of inflation. In one stroke, he could save the Treasury about $300 billion in inflation-adjusted payments over seven years -- enough to replace the G.O.P.'s Medicaid cuts without breaking a sweat. The idea is promising, but Mr. Moynihan's rush to grab these potentially large savings is premature.
The Government measures inflation by calculating changes in the Consumer Price Index -- the cost of a fixed bundle of consumer goods. The inflation measure is used to adjust Government outlays and revenues. For example, Social Security benefits are raised so that beneficiaries are insulated from rising prices. Tax brackets are also raised so that taxpayers are not shoved into higher brackets merely because their incomes kept pace with prices. The seductiveness of Mr. Moynihan's suggestion is that few "victims" will know if a stealthy technical correction takes a bite out of money before it reaches their wallets. 
 A panel of distinguished economists, appointed by Mr. Moynihan's Finance Committee, testified this week that the C.P.I. overestimates inflation by around one percentage point, and perhaps as much as two points, a year. The inflation measure underestimates how much consumers substitute low-priced goods for goods whose price is rising, how much price hikes are due to increased quality of consumer items and the extent to which consumers shop at discount outlets.
Yet the staff at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which computes the C.P.I., already knows about the potential biases and is updating its procedures. There are serious disputes about how to correct the C.P.I., and many experts believe that measurement error is tiny, perhaps less than 0.2 percent.
Some in Congress want to leave the C.P.I. alone, but give retirees and taxpayers less than full adjustment for inflation. The danger is that poor families could find their pension benefits falling behind and their tax payments racing ahead of inflation.
Congress might find the prospect of saving hundreds of billions irresistible. But it would be better to let the bureau follow professional standards. That will not be the shortest route to deficit reduction, but it will avoid bending Government statistics to political whim.

HEADLINE: States Can Lead Way On the Environment

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Unfit Stewards" by Sam Schuchat (Op-Ed, Sept. 20) is a curious counterpoint to the growing trend of devolving authority for environmental programs to the states. The states have had and continue to have a particularly important role in our national environmental progress -- a role that should be expanded if the United States is to advance its international leadership role. 
 Modern environmental law has established a system of national minimum standards (like the amount of pollution to be reduced or reported) states are allowed -- indeed expected -- to surpass as they administer national programs. The majority of Americans live in the states, like California, that tend to exceed national norms. These states have been engines of technological innovation and legal reform.
Regrettably, reflecting bureaucratic intransigence in some cases and political calculation in others, the Federal Government has increasingly sought to impose a one-size-fits-all process that has the unavoidable effect of limiting innovation and adding unnecessary cost.
This is most dramatic in the one Environmental Protection Agency program not delegated to the states for administration, the Superfund toxic-waste cleanup. It is best known for its lack of progress, due in large part to the insulation of Federal bureaucracies from the incentives to perform, which are more keenly felt at the state and local levels.
Greater recognition of the role of the states is important -- and not only for reasons of achieving one or another theoretical ideal of federalism. It is essential for continued environmental progress.
At a time when environmental challenges are increasingly found in other nations, the American system of state innovation can be the key for environmental progress through exportable, economically beneficial solutions that are "made in the U.S.A."
