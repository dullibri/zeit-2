Concern is growing over people and companies that are stockpiling patents to be used as competitive weapons.

BYLINE: By Denise Caruso 

 BODY:
AS the industrial age gets creakier, the information age is lubricating a new economy with the flow of ideas.
Ideas are given their literal currency through patent and copyright laws, originally intended to stimulate innovation by protecting inventors from idea snatchers and allowing them to profit more easily from their talents. But some experts worry that an increasing number of individuals and companies are perverting that original purpose with increasingly specious claims to ownership, as well as by stockpiling patents into competitive arsenals. 
 Several examples of patent absurdity have been in the news lately. Relatively new on the scene are "method of doing business" patents, otherwise known as "soft" patents because they do not actually cover a physical invention. Such patents, which also included software, were rejected by the United States Patent and Trademark Office as a matter of course until very recently, when courts began overturning the patent office's refusals.
Soft patents are frowned on by many people involved with intellectual property because they often lay claim to some of the most mundane activities of daily life.
Earlier this month, for example, the Internet Patent News Service, an on-line newsletter, bestowed its "Worst Method of Doing Business Patent in 1998" award upon Patent No. 5,851,117, granted to a company for its blindingly original idea of using an illustrated book to teach janitors how to clean a building.
A patent for using a book as a teaching tool? "This claim should never have been written, let alone allowed," Gregory Aharonian, editor of the Internet Patent News Service, wrote in a recent issue of his newsletter.
A similar patent claim is being made against MP3.com (www.mp3.com), the Internet music seller. MP3 has the music industry in a panic because its World Wide Web site allows visitors to download audio files of thousands of copyrighted songs free; it also enables musicians to sell their CD's directly to customers, thus bypassing record labels and pocketing much more profit.
The challenger, Sightsound.com, claimed in a letter to Michael Robertson, president of MP3.com, that it holds patents that control "among other things, the sale of audio or video recordings in download fashion over the Internet."
The letter then asked Mr. Robertson to pay its licensing fee: 1 percent of all revenue that MP3 derives from the sale of downloaded audio files.
Nice work if you can get it. Mr. Robertson, however, who received the letter last week and has posted it on MP3's Web site, notes that MP3 does not sell the music it downloads, but gives it away.
More to the point: a patent for downloading files over the Internet for a fee? Given the fundamental capabilities of networked computers, this sounds remarkably like patenting the combination of a pencil, a piece of paper and a stamp as a method for writing a letter.
"I just have to wonder if the Patent Office has completely lost its mind," Mr. Robertson said.
Such sweeping "method of doing business" patents are only part of the problem. In a recent issue of the venerable high-technology trade journal, Electronic Engineering Times, one of its executive editors, Ron Wilson, wrote in an editorial that "U.S. intellectual property law is rapidly reducing itself to absurdity," adding that the patent process "has turned into a bludgeon to crush competition."
Mr. Wilson cites several examples of how various technology companies, including I.B.M, Intel and Hewlett-Packard, use their vast holdings of patents as competitive weaponry in seeking to disable each other with infringement charges.
In fact, just last week a new arms dealer opened its on-line doors: a company based in Pasadena, Calif., called the Patent and License Exchange (www.pl-x.com), promotes its site as offering an "easy-to-search patent inventory, on-line bid placement, secure chat room negotiation, closing services (escrow) and aftermarket license administration."
Today's relaxed rules for granting patents, and the greater ease with which arsenals can thus be amassed, gives a decided battle advantage to industry heavyweights.
"The big guys couldn't care less about the quality of their patents," Mr. Aharonian said. "They just want as many as possible because they trade them like baseball cards. When you have a thousand patents and your competition has 1,500, you don't care what they are, you just swap them."
It's far easier than hauling one another into court, he said. But small companies, even if they are defending good, solidly researched patents, are seldom taken seriously by big companies, Mr. Aharonian said. He added: "If you're a small company, have you got a million bucks to sue Microsoft over patent infringement? I don't know if these companies realize ahead of time what the game is. A patent is just the first step to spending a lot of money."
Of course, none of this money would be spent without expert counsel. Mr. Wilson recalls attending a conference a year or so ago given by a patent lawyer who was giving instructions on how to build competitive patent bludgeons. "He was describing the strategy they recommended to their clients," Mr. Wilson said, "which was basically a pyramid of patent protection."
Mr. Aharonian sees the wielding of patent portfolios as a form of class warfare, where the lines are drawn between big companies and small, with consolidation and mergers creating a constant tension between the two camps.
"Change is always good, and change usually comes from new people; and if those new start-ups can't get protection, you'll see less change, less innovation, less entrepreneurialism," Mr. Aharonian said. "That's why big companies don't want the system to change -- they'd get a lot less patents."
In today's business environment, in which a company's market value is measured with increasing frequency by the intellectual property it owns, arsenals of patents -- specious or not -- make an unfortunate kind of sense.
"If you're concerned about the planking," Mr. Wilson said, "you don't want someone rocking the boat."

HEADLINE: Last Holdouts Join Other Airlines in Raising Fares

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
United Airlines, Trans World Airlines and U S Airways joined the other large domestic airlines and raised their fares over the weekend, virtually assuring the success of the first industrywide fare increase in more than a year.
Several carriers had been pushing for an increase for months, but their efforts were thwarted by Northwest Airlines, which refused to go along. But on Friday, Northwest followed Delta Air Lines, raising prices 2 percent on last-minute, walk-up fares most often paid by business travelers and 4 percent on advance-purchase tickets aimed at vacationers. 
 Other airlines quickly raised prices, followed by the three holdouts: United, T.W.A. and U S Airways. While Northwest or another airline could still roll back prices, forcing others to follow suit, industry analysts say that is unlikely.
"I think it is safe to say that it will stick," Samuel C. Buttrick, an airline analyst with Paine Webber in New York, said yesterday.
While there has not been an across-the-board increase since 1997, fares have regularly risen on individual routes. Mr. Buttrick said the latest increase would have little effect on consumers who shop for discounts because the airlines would still run sales featuring ticket prices at the current levels or lower. Indeed, United announced a sale on Friday, hours before it adjusted its general fare structure to reflect the new increase.
However, corporations, which have seen business fares rise 34 percent over the last three years, according to the American Express Company, will see another increase. Many companies have started buying restricted leisure fares, preferring to pay the $75 penalty for changing flights because the total cost is still cheaper than the walk-up fare. Others are cutting travel or encouraging alternatives like video conferencing to save money.
Airline executives and industry analysts said that the increase was justified even though inflation was less than 1 percent last year because revenue has been declining. This year, the airlines plan to add about 5 percent more seats, putting further pressure on their profits.
Delta led the fare increase after it failed last week in an attempt to add a $1 surcharge on tickets not booked through its Internet site.
Consumer advocates, corporations and some vocal politicians have complained that air fares are already too high and threaten to strangle economic growth in regions not served by two or more carriers.
"Nobody is going to take away the expectation and the privilege for an industry to raise prices if it can," said Kevin Mitchell, chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, which lobbies on behalf of several large corporations. "The problem is if it is in the absence of competition."
Airline stocks soared on Friday after Northwest matched Delta's increase. But Mr. Buttrick said the price increase was not a panacea for the industry. He estimated that the fare increase would bolster industry revenue by 1.5 percent this year, significantly less than the 4 percent revenue growth he is forecasting.
"It is going to take more than this fare increase to get there, based on recent trends," he said.

HEADLINE: Too Involved In Kosovo

BYLINE: By Lee H. Hamilton; Lee H. Hamilton, the former Democratic chairman of the House International Relations Committee, is director of the Woodrow Wilson Center.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Deploying American and NATO troops in Kosovo may well be necessary in the short term to prevent the outbreak of wider violence and to help carry out a political settlement. Yet, the possibility of this additional obligation of manpower and resources in the former Yugoslavia raises the important question of whether we are overengaged in this relatively small region.
America and Americans are everywhere in the states of the former Yugoslavia. The United States and NATO already have about 800 monitors, of whom about 180 are Americans, on the ground in Kosovo. In addition, the alliance will soon have up to 3,000 troops in neighboring Macedonia. These troops will be deployed in addition to the 32,000 troops -- 6,900 of them Americans -- who remain in Bosnia. The Bosnia deployments, which began three years ago, have cost well over $20 billion. 
 We have not just supplied troops. The United States and its NATO allies have become deeply involved in nearly every aspect of the civilian and humanitarian problems in these regions. We are supplying billions of dollars more to promote reconstruction, political and economic reforms, and humanitarian aid, especially in Bosnia.
American officials are in leadership positions all over the region. We are practically the proconsul of the former Yugoslavia. Americans command the NATO-led peacekeeping force in Bosnia. We have the controlling voice in the fate of Brcko, a pivotal Bosnian town. We are arming and training the forces of the Muslim-Croat Federation. Another American Ambassador commands the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's unarmed monitoring force in Kosovo.
This is simply too much. It is time to take a step back and put this open-ended commitment into proper perspective. Each peacekeeping mission -- in Bosnia, Kosovo and Macedonia -- taken by itself has been defensible, helpful and important, and I have supported each one, and the Administration has done a good job in responding to these crises. But now it seems we're pushing our commitment too far.
Viewed from the wider perspective, this commitment of time, effort and expense that the United States and its allies have made and will still have to devote to the former Yugoslavia is greatly disproportionate to its relative importance to our national interest. For all their savagery, the conflicts there have been essentially local, the result of unresolved ethnic, religious and power disputes.
It is true that if we took our troops out of Bosnia or our monitors out of Kosovo, violence would break out almost immediately. There will be peace only as long as we stay. There is little chance for self-sustaining peace in either Bosnia or Kosovo in this generation.
So, we are mired. This will cost us many more billions.
It is not at all certain that Congress and the American people -- who have been lukewarm at best about our deep involvement in the Balkans -- will continue to support our enormous commitments indefinitely. We cannot just pull out of the region, but we must seriously begin to look at a gradual "de-Americanization" strategy that allows us to reduce our engagement over time, and not get more deeply involved, as we are doing now in Kosovo.
For this to work, our European allies must take over more responsibility. A good start was the willingness of the French to assume leadership of the NATO troops that protect the monitors in Kosovo. That force includes no American ground troops. The Europeans already have the lead in carrying out the civilian reconstruction in Bosnia. We should also continue to work closely with the Europeans on the future of Kosovo, so that this does not end up as an entirely American affair.
There are greater threats to our national interests than those posed by the problems of the former Yugoslavia. If we don't put the perpetual crisis there into proper perspective, we will be less able to respond to the real threats to our security and national interests.

HEADLINE: Malaysia's Leader Rattles Meeting of Financial Elite

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 31

 BODY:
The world's financial commanders have had no greater nemesis in recent years than Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia, who has banned the trading of his country's currency, denounced American economic imperialism and jailed his Finance Minister for daring to challenge his economic prescriptions and his iron-handed rule.
So it came as something of a jolt for the world's most dedicated capitalists, gathering for an annual retreat of financial elite in this Swiss resort, to discover Mr. Mahathir in their midst. 
 He has been everywhere, behind closed doors with bankers, dropping hints that he is thinking of cutting special deals for "responsible" investors who want to move money in and out of his country, declaiming on his theories about the role of Jews in starting the crisis that spread from Asia to Russia to Latin America.
True to form, Mr. Mahathir has been by turns charming and combative -- except on one subject, the ongoing corruption and sexual misconduct trial of his former hand-picked successor, Anwar Ibrahim.
"He thought he could unseat me through street demonstrations, the way Suharto was overthrown by street demonstrations," Mr. Mahathir said over dinner on Saturday night with a group of journalists, referring to the fate of the former President of Indonesia, the most prominent political casualty of the economic crisis. "There are other charges against him that have not yet been proffered," he warned darkly about his one-time protege. "Whether he is acquitted or not, he will have to face more."
In one sense, Mr. Mahathir is lost in the parade of luminaries here, from Nelson Mandela to Yevgeny Primakov to Kofi Annan to the huge delegation of American officials who sometimes cannot help sounding a bit like they are taking a victory lap.
They arrived here just as Washington was announcing another spectacular quarter of growth for the American economy -- 5.6 percent, exceeding all expectations -- that only underscored the sense among the crisis-wracked here that the global financial system is rigged for America's benefit.
And that makes Mr. Mahathir's theories sound a lot less wild to many now than they did 18 months ago. Back then, he was still debating George Soros -- the financier who is also here with a parcel of aides whispering into the tiniest of cell phones -- about the dangers of currency speculators.
In a bitter debate with Mr. Soros at the 1997 meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, Mr. Mahathir called for controls on the free flow of capital around the world, and Mr. Soros called the Prime Minister "a menace to his own country."
Now Mr. Mahathir's favorite hobbyhorse -- controlling capitalism's excesses, keeping small countries from being washed out to sea by the ebb and flow of billions of dollars -- is the subtext of half the seminars here in Davos.
While almost no one has endorsed the Malaysian solution, declaring a nation's currency valueless outside its borders, the 73-year-old Prime Minister has come to seek vindication, and to delight in the fact that the International Monetary Fund and the United States Treasury fear others could follow Mr. Mahathir's path.
"The U.S. must be more tolerant of the stupidity of Malaysia," he said. "Why not leave us to do the wrong things we want to do? What is this talk about freedom and independence if you say I have the power to stop you and I will stop you?"
Actually, the United States has not exactly said that. But Mr. Mahathir was directly challenged on his own turf in November by Vice President Al Gore, who at an Asian economic summit meeting in Kuala Lumpur took up the language of Mr. Anwar and other enemies of Mr. Mahathir's rule, openly calling for "reformasi," or reform.
Mr. Gore's aides are happy that it played well back home, that the Vice President, in the words of one of his advisers, "took on a tin-pot dictator."
Here in Davos, Mr. Mahathir and Mr. Gore steered clear of each other, no small trick in a town this small. But Mr. Mahathir spent a good deal of time repairing relations with investors, who have cut his country off ever since Malaysia declared that any money invested in the country must stay there for at least one year.
Asked over dinner about statements he made to largely Muslim audiences in Malaysia about the role of Jews in causing the global financial crisis, he readily admitted that his people "see a Jewish hand" in the chaos, and he did not appear prepared to challenge that perception.
"They see Mr. Soros, and he is a Jew," Mr. Mahathir said. "He will give the impression that this is a Jewish plot. This is the impression of ordinary people in Malaysia."
When a questioner asked whether Mr. Mahathir agreed with ordinary Malays that a Jewish plot exists, he hesitated a brief second and said, "I do not think there is."

HEADLINE: Americans at U.N. Seek Parity With Foreign Co-Workers

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Jan. 29

 BODY:
A group of American citizens working for the United Nations in professional-level jobs are preparing to step up a fight to receive the same education grants for their children that foreign officials get in New York.
Under an agreement more than 50 years old, foreign professionals working at the United Nations headquarters as specialists in a range of fields including economics, political affairs and technical or financial services receive more than $15,500 a year for each child in school in New York. 
 Americans do not get the grants, which were intended to allow foreign families to pay for a private education in the language or culture of their home countries, so that the children could return comfortably to those nations.
"It wouldn't be so bad if it were used for the purpose intended," an American working here said. The reality, this official and others from various countries said, is that the grant buys entry to the best private schools and colleges for children who may have been born in this country, have an American parent or be part of a family settled here. Since 1994, United Nations officials may apply for permanent residency after 15 years of work at the headquarters.
"What makes it so unjust is that many of these children are Americans like our children," an American parent said. The Americans -- about 108 officials with a total of more than 170 children -- want help from United States representatives on the United Nations committee that determines these grants, said Stephen Baldwin, who recently retired as an official in the Department of Economic and Social Affairs.
In 1995, Mr. Baldwin was among a group of Americans who petitioned the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, the organization's highest judicial panel, for equal treatment. They were turned down.
Mr. Baldwin suggested in an interview that the General Assembly, the group of 185 nations that formally sets the grant levels, could freeze increases until the Americans could be brought into the program. This would not add costs to the organization's already hamstrung budget.
The United States, unlike many other nations, is perennially reluctant to become involved in the cases of Americans working for the United Nations, officials say.
"It would be very helpful to us if our own representatives were to take up this case and say this isn't a level playing field," Mr. Baldwin said.
Another parent, who did not want to be identified, said the American Government's attitude "represents the low esteem with which the United Nations is held in Washington."
Some American officials have recommended abolishing the grant entirely, but Mr. Baldwin said that this would be politically unrealistic and "draconian," because many families are involved who do send their children to foreign-language schools and need financial help living in New York. Average salaries for these professional-level jobs hover around $75,000 to $80,000.
The education grant has become an untaxed windfall for foreigners, augmenting their salaries substantially, American professionals say.
The grants apply only to United Nations officials, whose salaries and benefits are set or reviewed by the General Assembly and the International Civil Service Commission. The supplements do not apply to diplomats based in foreign missions in New York, though they may qualify for other programs through their respective governments.
Americans in United Nations service are eligible for the grants when they are sent abroad. But many United Nations officials spend a large part of their careers at the headquarters in New York, where city neighborhood schools may have problems and private education is expensive.
The supplements were originally for children up to the age of 11, who would then return to their home countries for secondary and higher education. They are now being used up through university level.
The grants can easily be misused, United Nations employees say. A Canadian reported cases of children from extended families being brought to New York to raise the number of supplements added to an official salary.
Unmarried employees also say that they watch married colleagues increase their incomes substantially with the education grants as their families grow, while single officials live on flat salaries.

HEADLINE: Essay;
A Russian Feeler

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland

 BODY:
With Russian inflation running at 100 percent a year, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov told a little joke about being forced to accept demands to be disclosed next week by the International Monetary Fund.
"A man is handed a letter from his wife," he said at the World Economic Forum. "He opens it and the page is blank. 'How can that be?' he is asked. 'It's all right,' he replies. 'We don't talk.' " 
 He had begged Al Gore to lean on the I.M.F. for repayment delay and new loans, and was turned down for good reason: the former spymaster has no economic plan to deal with congenital corruption beyond "optimizing the prison population."
But if Russia goes under, 30,000 nuclear missiles and the scientists and engineers behind them go on sale. The nation is not "too big to fail" (its population is smaller than Indonesia's, and is slumping toward half that of the U.S.), but the fallout from its collapse could be dangerous.
The usual cast of pompous Russian reformers and Yeltsin bureaucrats who used to parade around this Alpine conclave is absent. Now, a skeleton crew of Primakov's bankers wring their hands about devaluation and default, in contrast to the single longtime voice of opposition with the plan and self-confidence to turn Russia around -- Grigory Yavlinsky.
The economist and former pugilist, 47, is the last democratic reformer left standing. That's because he ignored Boris Yeltsin's seductive revolving door and instead built a grassroots party. In December's parliamentary elections, his Yabloko Party will grow; and running for President in 2000, Yavlinsky will at least be kingmaker.
Western Kremlinologists no longer hoot in derision when I say that; they saw Yabloko make possible Primakov's temporary ascension. Yavlinsky insists it was the only way to insure free elections after Yeltsin, but power-hungry Primakov may have other ideas.
Yavlinsky preaches the need for "tough love" to top American officials, to get us to assume Russia's I.M.F. repayments without new I.M.F. cash infusions. To regain the confidence of investors, he seeks new ways to reinstill Russian self-confidence.
One way is to break the mold on missile defense. President Clinton, after six years of pooh-poohing a shield against rogue-state missiles, suddenly reversed field lest he be blamed for vulnerability to germ blackmail. But Russians do not want to change the old ABM treaty that kept each superpower defenseless against the other. When I asked Primakov about it, he stayed in the old Communist rut: touch ABM and Start II won't be ratified.
Yavlinsky comes at it creatively: "America has a right to missile defense against terrorism, as does Europe, of which Russia is a part." He proposes a non-strategic missile defense in cooperation with NATO, capable of shooting down fewer than 100 missiles, thereby providing an umbrella against terrorist attack without destabilizing the Russian-American standoff. That would finesse the impasse and ease ratification of Start II's reductions.
Russian pride would thus be salved and money saved, but I see other motives: it would provide paying work for thousands of talented Russian technologists now looking hungrily toward Iran and Iraq, and would lessen the pressure for sales of missile and nuclear plants to states already taking advantage of Russian desperation.
Does Russia have anything to offer in missile defense? Using a handy-dandy cell phone, I called Prof. Andrei Piontkovsky in Moscow, director of the Academy of Science's strategic studies, to ask what Russia had on the shelf to shoot down missiles.
"The S-300," he replied promptly, as if I were a customer, "two years more advanced than your Patriots." That's dubious; he could not point to a single successful test of that missile against missiles. Besides, the S-300 is the weapon Russia peddled to Greek Cypriots until the Turks warned they would take out any such missiles that were delivered.
Still, Russians have long been adept at making long-range nukes and might bring expertise to the anti-missile table. Rather than punish Russia for dealing with Iran, the West, Yavlinsky urges, should cooperate with Russia to keep its scientists, know-how and products at home.
Worth discussing. As Clinton belatedly dumps his resistance to missile defense, we can usefully explore with NATO and Russia ways to stop incoming terrorist missiles.

HEADLINE: Mirra Komarovsky, Authority on Women's Studies, Dies at 93

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Mirra Komarovsky, a sociologist who was an innovative authority on gender, family and education, died on Saturday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 93.
Professor Komarovsky retired in 1970 after 32 years on the faculty of Barnard College. But she returned to Barnard in 1978 and became the chairwoman of its women's studies program for a time. 
 She was an advocate for women who has been credited with having initiated the contemporary analysis of gender roles with her book "Women in the Modern World: Their Education and Their Dilemmas" (1953, Irvington).
In that work she wrote that by making the purposes of women's education clearer, barriers to the attainment of a good life could be removed. As to the respective merits of training for a career and of education meant only for a homemaker, she wrote: "To disagree with the antifeminist does not necessarily make one a feminist. We can reject the antifeminist program without having to embrace the old-fashioned feminism with its militant hostility towards, and its disparagement of, the homemaker."
In 1991, Ellen V. Futter, who was Barnard's president at the time, said Professor Komarovsky's "research has been crucial to our understanding of today's women and the choices they make."
In that year Professor Komarovsky received the Distinguished Career Award of the American Sociological Association. Earlier, in 1973 and 1974, she was the second female president of the association, which was founded in 1905.
In her book "Women in College: Shaping New Feminine Identities" (1985) she described changing views of work, family and men that were held by students in the class of 1983 at Barnard, a women's college.
Reviewing that book in The New York Times Book Review, Adele Simmons, then president of Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., wrote: "The impact of the women's movement on higher education becomes apparent to even the most skeptical reader." She noted that Professor Komarovsky observed bleakly that, as Dr. Simmons put it, "while attitudes have changed, institutions have not. The gains of the last decade, she warns, will only be secure when society develops permanent measures to support women in the workplace as well as in the home."
In researching the book, Professor Komarovsky used interviews, questionnaires and surveys to study the attitudes of more than 200 students in the Barnard class of 1983. Fully two-thirds of those young women were afflicted with what she called "culture shock" that differed from student to student. As Dr. Simmons put it, "Ideas about virginity, femininity, sexual preferences and study habits all came under scrutiny as students' friendships evolved and intellectual challenges arose."
Professor Komarovsky found that 76 percent of the female students planned, at the time they entered Barnard, on combining career, marriage and children in the coming years. And by the time the class graduated, fully 85 percent of its members had come to have that threefold ambition.
Two observations of Professors Komarovsky's that Dr. Simmons found intriguing were her finding that the most highly career-minded students had mothers who had not worked and regretted it -- or mothers who worked and enjoyed it; and her suggestion that the young women sought a mixture of sensitivity, self-awareness and masculinity in men.
Professor Komarovsky also found that most of the women she surveyed found it hard to attain relationships that they considered satisfactory with men, although those women had had chances to interact with men from a variety of backgrounds.
Rather similarly, Professor Komarovsky wrote, on the New York Times Op-Ed page in 1981: "Young women are becoming aware that the call to equal opportunities for women outside the home is an empty slogan as long as the society insists on traditional role segregation within the family. Some women react to this discovery with equanimity, others with frustration, resignation or indignation. But the real touchstone of their aspirations is the longing for a society in which the rhetoric of equality will be realized as fact. There is no denying that this would require major institutional changes."
What to do? "We have much to learn from Sweden," Professor Komarovsky wrote: "Modified work patterns for both sexes, housing patterns permitting more-cooperative ties among child-rearing families, accessible child-care centers of high quality for all economic classes."
Over the years, she also wrote about various aspects of sociology, including theory and methodology.
She was born in Baku, on the Caspian Sea, in what was then Russia, to Mendel Komarovsky and the former Anna Steinberg, and she was raised largely in Baku. When she was 17, she and her family emigrated to the United States. She attended a high school for a year in Wichita, Kan., where some members of her family lived, and went on to receive a bachelor's degree in 1926 from Barnard, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and was taught by the anthropologists Ruth Benedict and Franz Boas.
Nonetheless, as the book "Women in Sociology" (1991, Greenwood), edited by Mary Jo Deegan, reports: "Komarovsky was puzzled" by Barnard's "extolling intellectual excellence while discouraging women from pursuing careers."
She received a master's degree in 1927 and a doctorate in 1940, both in sociology, and both from Columbia. Her doctoral thesis was published as a book, "The Unemployed Man and His Family" (1940).
Earlier, she was a co-author of the book "Leisure: A Suburban Study" (1934). In addition, before joining the Barnard faculty as an instructor in 1938, she taught at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., and was a research assistant at the Yale University Institute of Human Relations, at Columbia, and at the International Institute of Social Research in New York.
She was chairman of the sociology department at Barnard from 1949 to 1968 and was president of the Eastern Sociological Society in 1955 and 1956.
But she recalled years later that in the 1940's and even later, choosing women's issues to do research on was at a cost to her. The field lacked academic glamor and was not likely to further a career.
An early marriage, in 1926, ended in divorce in 1928. In 1940, she married Marcus A. Heyman, who died in 1970.
Her survivors include a sister, Dolly Cheser of Rockville Centre, L.I., and five nieces and one nephew.

HEADLINE: Whitman Breaks Leg While Skiing on Swiss Slope

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

 BODY:
Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey broke her lower leg in two places yesterday when she fell while skiing in Davos, Switzerland, where she is attending the World Economic Forum.
"She was on an intermediate slope and took a turn and a twist and the rest was history," said Jayne O'Connor, a spokeswoman for the Governor. 
 Mrs. Whitman, 52, underwent surgery at a local hospital, Spital Davos, and is expected to remain there until midweek, Ms. O'Connor said. The Governor will probably have to cancel a trip to visit NATO troops in Stuttgart, Germany, tomorrow, another spokesman, Pete McDonough, told the Associated Press. She may delay her return to New Jersey, originally scheduled for Wednesday, Ms. O'Connor said.
Mrs. Whitman is expected to require a cast but not crutches, Mr. McDonough said. It was not clear last night which leg the Governor had broken.
The Governor, an avid skier, cyclist, horseback rider, canoeist and tennis player, was on an outing organized by the economic forum, an annual gathering of political, economic and cultural leaders from many countries. This was the second year that Mrs. Whitman attended the conference, Ms. O'Connor said.
While Mrs. Whitman is out of the country, the State Senate President, Donald T. DiFrancesco, Republican of Scotch Plains, is Acting Governor.
Ms. O'Connor said that she did not know if the Governor would miss any of her state duties when she returns to New Jersey, but she added that Mrs. Whitman has tremendous powers of recuperation.

HEADLINE: CLINTON TO UNVEIL $1.7 TRILLION PLAN FOR U.S. SPENDING

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
President Clinton will release a $1.766 trillion Federal budget blueprint for 2000 on Monday that proposes billions of dollars in new spending while preaching fiscal conservatism.
Mr. Clinton's budget plan will ask Congress for substantial new money for scores of domestic programs popular with liberal and middle-class constituencies, from urban housing vouchers to classroom construction. 
 But Mr. Clinton, taking advantage of surging Federal tax receipts, will also propose large spending increases for cherished Republican priorities: the military, local police and small business.
The President's plan envisions a budget surplus of at least $76 billion for the current fiscal year and much larger surpluses stretching as far into the future as Government forecasters can see.
The health of the American economy and overflowing Federal coffers allow Mr. Clinton the luxury of indulging in large new "investments" in politically popular labor, education, health care and environmental projects while cloaking himself in fiscal prudence by proposing to use budget surpluses to pay down the Federal debt.
But, as has happened so often in the past 12 months of scandal and impeachment, Mr. Clinton will dominate only half of the attention of official Washington and the media on Monday. At the very moment Mr. Clinton is unveiling his budget in an East Room ceremony, Monica S. Lewinsky will be sitting down with a roomful of lawyers, senators and House prosecutors in a hotel suite five blocks away to be deposed in the Senate impeachment trial.
And the prospects for Mr. Clinton's ambitious programs are uncertain given Republican majorities in both houses of Congress and the ill will on both sides as a result of the impeachment battle.
Mr. Clinton's proposal for increased defense spending is likely to win Republican support and in fact it may be increased. His plan to provide tax credits for long-term medical care also has bipartisan support. But many of the other spending programs are unlikely to win Republican backing at a time when limits on Federal spending imposed as a result of the Balanced Budget Agreement of 1997 remain in effect.
While Mr. Clinton proposes to increase overall Government spending by $39 billion over this year's level, Federal outlays as a proportion of the American economy will be at the lowest level since 1973, 19.4 percent.
The plan raises, but does not definitively answer, the overriding economic question now before the Congress and the White House -- how to adjust to a time of surplus after a generation of seemingly intractable Federal budget deficits. The plan, all of which is subject to Congressional approval, is in effect a holding action until a long-term plan is negotiated to shore up Social Security and Medicare, the crown jewels of Democratic progressivism that are projected to run out of money early in the next century.
"This year's budget is truly a historic document," Jack Lew, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, said. "The transition from an era of deficits to an era of surpluses has changed so many of the issues and poses basic, fundamental choices. What do you do in a time of fiscal well-being to insure that you'll have fiscal well-being far into the future?"
To that end, Mr. Clinton has announced a plan to insure the solvency of Social Security and Medicare well into the next century by reserving 77 percent of any budget surpluses to shore up the universal retirement and health care entitlements. An additional 12 percent of the projected surpluses is being set aside under the Administration's plan for a new form of retirement account designed to increase the nation's paltry personal savings rate.
In his State of the Union message, and now with his budget, Mr. Clinton has seized the fiscal and political high ground, moving into a policy vacuum created by a year of scandal and a Republican failure so far to offer a coherent and compelling blueprint for addressing the long-term problems of the nation's costliest domestic programs.
The President's budget -- bound in volumes with black covers symbolizing the ocean of black ink the Administration foresees -- attempts to do large things in relatively small steps. Social Security and Medicare will be rescued from future insolvency without pain to current taxpayers or future beneficiaries in the form of tax increases or reductions in benefits.
A senior Administration economic policymaker said that Mr. Clinton would have preferred much larger increases in programs to help America adapt to the high-technology future. But the fact of a Republican-controlled Congress hungry for tax cuts has limited the President's budgetary freedom of action.
"In a second-best world," said Gene Sperling, the President's chief economic adviser, "the reality of divided Government is that Clinton is able through a combination of hard negotiating and fiscal discipline to achieve targeted increases in these areas while proposing a fiscally disciplined budget."
Mr. Sperling continued, "We've learned there are two ways to score a touchdown -- by throwing the Hail Mary or by throwing six 15-yard passes to move the ball down the field. We've been successful in putting forward an investing-in-people agenda by going in and fighting for these programs one year at a time."
Schools, cities, displaced workers, the environment and the Pentagon will all receive sizable infusions of new money without any broad tax increases. The single largest proposal to raise revenue in the budget takes aim at Washington's favorite pair of deep pockets: cigarette smokers and tobacco companies.
Mr. Clinton is proposing a 55-cents-a-pack increase on cigarettes to raise $8 billion a year for the next five years. The tax increase will be described as an effort to reduce smoking by teen-agers by raising the price of cigarettes to almost $4 a pack, but the revenues are not earmarked for anti-smoking programs or to pay the health care costs of treating smoking-related illnesses.
That projected revenue will cover only a fraction of the $25.6 billion in new spending in the 2000 budget that Mr. Clinton has already announced -- from $12 billion for the Pentagon to $10 million to train Native American teachers to serve in predominantly Indian regions of the West.
Mr. Clinton is also proposing $20.6 billion in limited tax cuts over the next five years to subsidize long-term care for the elderly and disabled, build schoolrooms, develop fuel-efficient cars and promote adult literacy.
The public expresses broad support for such initiatives in White House and public polls, but there is no assurance that any of them will survive the Republican Congress, which is more interested in cutting tax rates across the board than embarking on a New Deal-style spending spree.
"The President has tried to satisfy every special-interest group except the middle-income taxpayer," said Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican who serves on the Senate Budget Committee. "When taxes are as high as they have ever been, it's time to let the taxpayers keep some more of their money."
Mr. Grassley said that initial reaction to the President's State of the Union message on Jan. 19 was favorable, even from many Republicans. But as more details of Mr. Clinton's spending plans have trickled out, a different picture emerges, he said.
"When he gave that speech on Jan. 19, it looked like a pretty middle-of-the-road position," Mr. Grassley said. "But upon reflection, what he's basically doing is just reverting to the classic Democratic policy. Three or four years ago he declared the era of Big Government is over. Well, the era of Big Government is back."

HEADLINE: Fed's Policy Is Sound;
What Academics Think

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In arguing that Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, should ignore inflation and lower interest rates to reduce unemployment, Robert B. Reich (Op-Ed, Jan. 26) assumes that there is a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment and that the Federal Reserve can choose how much of each it wants by setting interest rates. 
 This idea has been discredited by academic economists. The majority view is that if Mr. Reich's proposals were implemented, the drop in unemployment would be short-lived; lowering interest rates and increasing the money supply would cause a permanent inflation, reducing the efficiency of the economy until inflation was vanquished yet again. To accuse Mr. Greenspan of not caring about the unemployed is disingenuous given that he is doing what he believes is everything in his power to help them, especially since most economists agree with him.

A CROWNING PERFORMANCE

BYLINE: By DAVE ANDERSON 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Jan. 31

 BODY:
John Elway would not say it in so many words, but for the Broncos' quarterback, their 34-19 victory in Super Bowl XXXIII tonight was probably his last roundup.
And his best. 
 As the oldest quarterback, at age 38, to start a Super Bowl game, he completed 18 of 29 passes for 336 yards, including an 80-yard touchdown arrow to wide receiver Rod Smith that broke the Atlanta Falcons' wings.
Elway also scored a clinching touchdown on a 3-yard keeper as the Broncos joined the Packers, the Dolphins, the Steelers (twice), the 49ers and the Cowboys as the only teams to win two consecutive Super Bowls.
After being voted the game's most valuable player by a panel from the news media, Elway sidestepped questions about his future.
"I'll cross that bridge later," he said in the interview area. "I don't even want to talk about retirement now."
Mike Shanahan, the Broncos' coach, acknowledged that "there's a good chance" this was Elway's last game, but the coach added that the quarterback's teammates were "talking to him about a three-peat" in the Super Bowl next season. No team has won three straight Super Bowls.
"It throws a kink into my thinking," Elway said of the three-peat possibility.
But without him, the Broncos and even Denver itself would never be quite the same.
Few athletes have ever defined their city or their area the way John Elway has. Until he arrived, Denver was just a mile-high cow town with low esteem in sports. The 1977 Broncos had been to the Super Bowl with their Orange Crush defense, but were crushed. The basketball Nuggets were never much. The baseball Rockies and the hockey Avalanche weren't even there yet.
But almost as soon as Elway started throwing passes in 1983, he usurped Denver's identity. He was bigger than the city itself, bigger than the Rocky Mountains in the distance. Other players didn't talk about playing Denver, they talked about playing Elway.
Other celebrated quarterbacks never upstaged their cities. Joe Montana wasn't San Francisco, the Golden Gate Bridge was. Terry Bradshaw wasn't Pittsburgh, steel was. Bart Starr wasn't Green Bay, bratwurst was. Joe Namath wasn't New York, Broadway and Fifth Avenue were. Johnny Unitas wasn't Baltimore, crab cakes were.
But for 16 seasons, John Elway has been Denver, and Denver was happy to have him, even when the Broncos lost three Super Bowls with him.
He even looked like he belonged there: big shoulders, with a lariat for an arm. And he walked like a cowboy who just got off his horse.
Elway was even part of the Denver economy. His automobile dealerships were so successful, they were sold about a year ago for a reported $82.5 million. Pat Bowlen, the Broncos' owner, has indicated that Elway might even emerge as a part owner of the franchise if he decides not to be a quarterback anymore.
When Elway was told tonight that he would be awarded his choice of either a Ford Mustang or a Ford Expedition as the game's most valuable player, he laughed and said, "That's all I need is some more cars."
Two weeks ago, Elway acted as if he had played his last game in Mile High Stadium. After he rallied the Broncos over the Jets, 23-10, for the American Football Conference title, he stayed on the field and waved goodbye. He told the fans, "I love you." He took a victory lap to "look into" their eyes.
What Elway saw in those eyes was their affection for a quarterback whose numbers as a passer, as dazzling as they were, never were as important to him as the numbers on the scoreboard.
Of all the appreciations of Elway through the years, the Broncos' backup, Bubby Brister, perhaps explained better than anybody else what has made Elway tick since he arrived in Denver after he told the Baltimore Colts, who had drafted him, that he wouldn't play for them.
"All John ever wants to know," Brister said last week, "is what he needs to win, whether it's Ping-Pong, fishing, basketball."
Brister remembered a fishing trip during the off season when Elway asked him the weight of the biggest fish he had ever caught. Brister told him 8 pounds 8 ounces.
"The next day," Brister recalled, laughing, "John caught a 9-pounder."
Another time they were playing a video game. Brister put up 52 points.
"John made 54," Brister said. "He's the most competitive guy I've ever known. And that same attitude made him such a great quarterback. When he was behind in the fourth quarter, all he wanted to know was what he needed to win -- a touchdown or a field goal."
More often than not, Elway generated that winning touchdown or that winning field goal.
In his career as the National Football League's career winningest quarterback, Elway produced a record 47 game-saving drives, including six in the post-season. And when he was asked the other day to rate his best moments other than the Super Bowl upset of the Packers a year ago, he mentioned two drives.
"I think 'the Drive' in Cleveland is the first thing that pops into my mind," he said, referring to winning the 1986 A.F.C. title game. "That kind of put me on the map. And I went 98 yards to kick a field goal to beat Houston in the first round of the playoffs. 'The Drive' in Cleveland was 98 yards, too."
The only reason Elway and anybody else remembers those drives is because the Broncos won those games -- the barometer he used in rating his top three quarterbacks.
"Comparing quarterbacks is like comparing apples and oranges," he said, "because the circumstances that each quarterback has are so different. But I think the bottom line is the guys who can figure out ways to win, no matter what the circumstances or what position they are in.
"You have to look at Dan Marino as being up there with his numbers and what he has done; unfortunately, he never has had a good enough team to go all the way. I think Johnny Unitas kicked everything off, a guy that won championships, and Roger Staubach because he was my idol when I was young."
Now, surely, John Elway is an idol for so many others -- the young who wish they could do what he does and the old who wish they had.
"If there's anything that sums up John's career," Shanahan said Friday, "it's that he puts the team first -- one of the reasons he's not talking about retirement right now. He doesn't want to lose focus of this football game; the game is more important than him and his retirement. He's an unselfish guy that has meant everything to Denver."
Just rename it Elway, Colorado.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
The Cream Still Rises, Even From Barrel Bottom

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS 

 BODY:
David Greenspan isn't a mere actor. He's an appliance on the fritz. Plug him in and watch the mechanism go haywire: he shakes and rattles, swivels and squeaks so persuasively you half expect smoke to rise from a crack in his forehead.
Onstage, his stock in trade is the alien among us, but not in the vein of Mork from Ork. Mr. Greenspan, an Obie-winning performer and playwright, alights from somewhere beyond the outer limits. Whether he's intimidating the other guests as a particularly spooky Harold in "The Boys in the Band" or waxing oleaginous in an enigmatic Mac Wellman extravaganza, he is always strung out in one way or another, on a supercilious tear or on the brink of total neurological collapse. And that's why he is ideal for "High Life," Lee MacDougall's new lowlife comedy at Primary Stages about a cockeyed gang of junkie grifters who botch an A.T.M. heist and end up killing one of their own. 
 Any week in New York City, you can find two or three new Off Broadway plays that, like "High Life," ruminate about lowlifes. As the nation becomes ever more affluent, it seems, the theater becomes increasingly obsessed with the drunk, the disorderly, the dysfunctional. It's not a return to the 1960's and the theater of social awareness, however; few in this genre are intended as exercises in consciousness-raising.
Rather, many of these plays seek to capitalize on our insatiable need for the goriest details and on our appetite for reminders of what we all might easily become. They are, in their way, extreme reactions to the sanitized domains of television sitcoms, where the people and the apartments almost always are more attractive than the real world.
In "High Life," the diminutive Mr. Greenspan is eminently entertaining as Donnie, the most reptilian and tightly wound of a quartet of sociopathic drug addicts in this only slightly diverting, extended sketch of a play. Like the dramatic situation, Mr. Greenspan's performance ultimately trails off into irrelevance. But before that happens, the actor does something remarkable: he makes the burnt-out ends of drug-filled days seem, well, funny. It's an eccentrically winning embodiment of the effects of mind-altering chemicals, in the tradition of Richard E. Grant's bravura turn as a tanked-up, out-of-work actor in the cult film "Withnail and I."
Mr. Greenspan's impression of a human Osterizer is the best thing about "High Life," because it's so exhaustively resourceful in ways the script does not appear to call for; even in obvious bits, as when Donnie reports on his recent bout of pneumonia while sucking on a cigarette, his work is fresh. Yet despite other assets, including Casey Childs's crisp direction and Isiah Whitlock Jr.'s flash-fire portrayal of one of Donnie's homicidal partners in crime, "High Life" remains long on exposition and short on revelation. In fact, given the plethora of plays these days that sift society's dregs, the details of "High Life" are positively fungible.
Some of the best of these lowlife dramas, with their echoes of older playwrights like Sam Shepard, succeed because of self-consciously withering humor (as in "Killer Joe") or delicately textured atmosphere ("Ecstasy") or devastatingly real characters ("This Is Our Youth"). But many others are simply imitative of better plays. They are flawed works that walk on the dark side chiefly because that's where the theater crowd has taken them.
Three Off and Off Off Broadway productions that opened in recent weeks -- Mr. MacDougall's "High Life," Jessica Goldberg's "Stuck" and George F. Walker's "End of Civilization" -- fall into this latter category. All serve up crime and degradation, but little in the way of elucidation or even cheap thrills.
Ms. Goldberg's play, for instance, produced by Rattlestick Productions at the Theater Off Park, is a Gothic riff on "Thelma and Louise" with a bit of Mr. Shepard's "Buried Child" thrown in. Directed by Abby Epstein, it is the tale of two lost young women working in a video store in "Middletown, U.S.A.," and aching for an escape from a stultifying life of alcoholic parents, predatory men, tabloid-television culture and unwanted children.
The relentlessly depressing outlook of "Stuck" is the opposite of what we've come to accept as the American Dream, that children born into an environment that chokes off hope use the negative energy to their advantage. "Hi, stupid baby! Who's the stupidest baby?" one of the video store women, played by Jenny Maguire, coos nastily to the infant daughter she has carelessly brought into her deadwood world. Ms. Maguire's Margaritah is a former high school prom queen who falls in love with a right-wing Argentine businessman (Michael Irby) whose father has bought the town's pollution-spewing factory; her best friend, Lula (Jennifer Albano) hits the bars and winds up in bed with the father of one of her old school chums.
Playing soul mates in benumbed despair, Ms. Albano and particularly Ms. Maguire are heroically believable, and Ms. Goldberg is skillful at the portrait of rapport. Evidence of a sharp intellect is abundant, but as with "High Life," "Stuck" lacks the forward thrust of compelling theater. Until the horrifying final scene, which only reiterates rather than enlarges the play's themes, the drama lives up to its name. By the time "Stuck" ends, it feels as if the story has only just begun.
Mr. Walker's "End of Civilization" at Raw Space tries to add an air of mystery to the lowlife genre, but all it really adds is confusion. The play, which jumps around so arbitrarily that the only time you can be sure of is the one on your wrist, takes place in that lowlife staple, a tacky motel, where Henry and Lily, a despairing, unemployed man and his dutiful wife, have taken a room while he looks for work. During their short stay, a serial killer starts knocking off job seekers in all the employment offices Henry visits, while Lily takes up life as a hooker.
The play offers some real howlers: "I think Henry is going to kill a lot of people because Henry is feeling very demeaned," Lily helpfully informs the dimwitted detectives on the case. Of course, it all ends with a single gunshot. This production, directed by Randy White, inadvertently poses the question at the heart of all down-and-dirty drama: How low, really, can you go?
The answer is, when the theatrical experience is potent, there is no bottom to the barrel. As demonstrated by Mr. Greenspan's memorable work in "High Life," the creepiest stage behavior, leavened by wit, can make the heart soar.

The Invisible Men

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland

 BODY:
U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers joked the other day that he had a new idea for solving the problem of Brazil's collapsing currency, the real. He suggested the Brazilians rename their currency -- "real.com." Judging from U.S. stock markets, it would double in value every 90 days.
Mr. Summers' joke, though, actually captured the most interesting aspect of this year's Davos World Economic Forum, the annual gathering in the Swiss Alps of world leaders, business executives and bankers. Every year at Davos someone stands out as the trend-setter. This year the stars of Davos were invisible: one was Amazon.com and the others were the leaders from so many developing countries who used to come here regularly, but this year didn't show. And therein lies a story. 
 Every panel discussion here on the Internet economy was sold out, and the panel where experts discussed whether the Internet stocks were "a bubble" about to burst was standing room only. The Princeton University economist Alan Blinder kicked off that discussion by observing that there was probably some bubble quality to the Internet stock craze, or as he put it: "I have a general rule: Whenever something becomes worth more than the whole state of California, sell it."
Interestingly, though, the person who poured the coldest water on the Internet mania was Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, who said, "I find the valuations of high-tech stocks in general surprisingly high." Mr. Gates argued that the high-tech business today is so intense, and companies can be overtaken by competition from so many different directions, that making any assumptions about the future earnings of any high-tech company -- particularly one on the Wild West Internet -- is very risky.
But people are missing the most important point about the Internet stock boom, said Mr. Gates. Whether or not it's a bubble, it is attracting enormous amounts of new venture capital to every imaginable Internet-related company, and this influx of cash is going to drive "the pace of Internet innovation even faster."
For the global business leaders here, nothing could be more exciting. But for the other invisible party -- the leaders of developing countries -- nothing could be more depressing than the thought that the world will be getting faster. There was a time when the head of state of a developing country -- such as Thailand or Mexico -- wouldn't want to miss Davos and the chance to show off for the big multinationals. It was almost as if by simply coming here, you were automatically part of the global economy.
But in the wake of the meltdowns in Mexico, Russia, Southeast Asia and Brazil in recent years, a new sobriety is taking hold in many of these emerging markets. Their leaders are coming to realize that the answers to their problems are not here. They are at home. They are starting to realize that it makes no sense to come to Davos and show off your country if you do not have a financial, legal and regulatory structure able to handle the Electronic Herd of global investors. And the only way to get that structure is to build it yourself from the ground up.
"You cannot wait for Godot," remarked Noordin Sopiee, one of Malaysia's leading strategic thinkers. "We have to solve our problems at the national level. God help those who expect others to help them."
Emad el-Din Adeeb, editor of the Egyptian journal Al Alam Al Youm, concurred: "O.K.," he said to me, "I understand we need to get prepared for this globalization and that is partly our responsibility. There is a train that is leaving and we should have known this and done our homework. But now you should slow the train a bit and give us a chance to jump on."
And that's what is scary about this year's Davos: Just when the developing world is coming to really grasp that it has no choice but to get itself ready to climb aboard this train, Bill Gates is predicting that the train is going to get faster -- not slower -- as the developing world moves toward Internet-based commerce, communication and learning systems. What's worse, no one can slow the train down, because the world economy today is just like that Internet: everybody is connected but nobody is in charge.
As the Deutsche Bank economist Ken Courtis observed: "The developing world has decided to catch the train just as it's being dematerialized and turned into a virtual experience." That's not an easy train to catch.

Treasury PricesDrop Sharply After Positive Economic Reports

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices posted the biggest drop in almost three months as several economic reports pointed to resilience in the United States economy and Brazil's stocks and currency surged, leaving investors little incentive to buy bonds.
"Bonds have very limited upside," said David Jallits, who helps manage $5.5 billion at Strategic Fixed-Income in Arlington, Va. Last year's 3.9 percent growth in the economy, combined with signs the economy is not slowing as expected by many analysts, dims the chance for another Federal Reserve interest rate cut anytime soon, he said. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 18/32, to 101 1/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.18 percent, from 5.08 percent on Friday.
Bonds fell after reports on consumption, manufacturing and construction suggested the economy, which is in its eighth year of expansion, was not losing steam. That means the Federal Reserve will probably not trim its target for overnight lending between banks from the current 4.75 percent when it meets today and tomorrow, analysts said.
The decline in the dollar against the yen also hurt Treasuries, reducing the appeal of United States assets to international investors, traders said. Expected sales of at least $4 billion of new bonds by Pepsi Bottling Holdings and other corporate borrowers also weighed on bonds, as did gains in Brazil's currency, the real, and an 8.8 percent jump in its benchmark Bovespa index.
"There's a little pressure off emerging markets, and perhaps the flight to quality isn't as much of a driving factor," as it was after Brazil devalued its currency last month, said Alan Kral, who helps oversee $1 billion at Trevor Stewart Burton & Jacobsen Inc. in New York.
The National Association of Purchasing Management's index of manufacturing activity rose to 49.5 in January, from 45.3 in December, a sign that manufacturing activity did not slow as quickly in January as it did a month earlier.

Factory production rebounded last month after a four-month slump, and consumer spending and home building accelerated in December, fortifying an economic expansion that shows no signs of quitting.
The National Association of Purchasing Management's production index rose to 53.1 in January, from 46.8 in December, the first increase in four months and the highest level since May. Readings above 50 mean more manufacturers reported expanded production than those that said they were cutting back. 
 Consumer spending rose eight-tenths of a percent in December, fueled by higher auto purchases, after a two-tenths of a percent gain in November, the Commerce Department said. December's five-tenths of a percent rise in personal income also topped the previous month's rise of four-tenths of a percent. And construction spending registered its seventh straight monthly increase in December, paced by gains in home building.
"We have such a virtuous-circle dynamic right now," said John Ryding, a senior economist at Bear, Stearns & Company. "Tight labor markets force people to increase efficiencies, so they invest in these new technologies." Because much of that technology is produced in the United States, that in turn creates jobs, bolsters incomes and fuels consumer spending, he said.
The economy grew at a 5.6 percent annual rate in the final three months of 1998 -- the fastest quarterly pace in two years -- and 3.9 percent for the year, the Government reported on Friday. That growth came with only a 1.0 percent rise in inflation.
The separate construction report from the Commerce Department showed that overall spending rose 1.7 percent in December, topping the 1.0 percent increase a month earlier. All segments showed gains, with residential construction rising by the largest dollar amount.
"Right now, there's nothing in the cards to suggest that consumers won't continue to spend at the rate they have been," said Richard Yamarone, an economist at the Argus Research Corporation in New York. "A fully employed labor force, near-zero inflation and low interest rates have prompted great growth in housing and autos -- two large engines of the economy."
The rebound in the purchasing association's manufacturing report lends credence to analyst and investor expectations that the economic expansion will keep setting records. The current expansion entered its 95th month today, the longest in peacetime and closing in on the record of 106 months set in the 1960's during the Vietnam War.
The association's overall manufacturing activity index rose to 49.5 last month from 45.3 in December -- the first increase in four months and the highest reading since June. "It looks like the manufacturing recession is close to over," said Christopher Low, an economist at First Tennessee Capital Markets in New York.
While the closely watched gauge of United States manufacturing exceeded Wall Street expectations, January marked the eighth straight month the index was below 50, which means the number of manufacturers that said business deteriorated was greater than the number of those saying it improved.

HEADLINE: U.S.-India Talks Gain and Could Lead to Easing of Sanctions

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Feb. 1

 BODY:
American officials said today that momentum was building that could lead to a substantial easing of economic sanctions imposed on India after it conducted nuclear tests in May.
It could also lead to India's signing the test ban treaty, probably by mid-year. 
 The Indians were more cautious in their assessment of the outcome of three days of negotiations that ended Sunday -- the eighth round of talks since the tests. But both Indian and American diplomats were optimistic about resolving their differences.
Officials from both countries said they also hoped more broadly for an improvement in the prickly, mistrustful relations between the United States and India. An Indian official described the tone of conversations between Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh as "verging on bonhomie."
The United States took a step in this diplomatic tango today by inviting ambassadors from the major industrial democracies and Russia, known as the Group of Eight or G-8, to a luncheon in New Delhi, where Americans broached the resumption of World Bank lending to India for road, power and other development projects. Sanctions have thus far cost India about $1.2 billion in World Bank loans, bank officials say.
"The United States cannot act alone," said a senior Clinton Administration official, who, like all the officials interviewed, refused to be quoted by name. "It must move in tandem with the other G-8 partners."
An Indian official said a decision to allow World Bank lending to resume would be "a small step toward the creation of a positive atmosphere." Another Indian official said there was no explicit agreement that if the United States takes certain specific actions on sanctions, India will sign the test ban treaty.
"That's too mechanical a spin," he said.
In Washington, the State Department said it would soon decide whether and how to reward India for progress on nonproliferation -- specifically, on a decision by India to set a date to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
"There is encouragement on the part of our negotiators," said James P. Rubin, the department spokesman. "There are some indications that the Indians are going to move in a direction that will allow us to respond with moves of our own."
"We have said all along that our sanctions policy will be adjusted based on progress made in nonproliferation negotiations," he continued. "Progress has been made in these most recent negotiations, and we are consulting with Congress."
While both the Indians and Americans insisted that they have done nothing so crude as horse-trading during eight rounds of talks in eight months, it is clear that each side has certain conditions that must be met before relations improve. India's decision to conduct the underground nuclear tests, which Pakistan immediately followed with its own nuclear tests, brought the relationship to one of its lowest points ever.
The Indian Government, run by a seemingly ever-shakier coalition led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, needs something concrete it can claim to have gained for signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty by the September deadline for ratification set by a United Nations conference more than two years ago, party leaders have said. The Government cannot be seen as giving in to American pressure without opening itself up to attack from the opposition Congress Party.
The Government badly needs some victories. The Hindu nationalists were routed in state elections in November, in large part because of the rising prices of vegetables, and they have been under attack from some of their allies in recent days for raising the prices of subsidized rice, wheat, sugar and cooking oil to lower the budget deficit.
In a joint statement by India and the United States on Sunday, both said they would "endeavor to create a positive atmosphere for advancing their relations." Indian officials say they will work to build a consensus for signing the test ban treaty when Parliament reconvenes this month.
Mr. Talbott today visited the Congress Party leader, Sonia Gandhi, and has given interviews to Indian journalists in which he stresses his respect for India as a great secular democracy and speaks glowingly of the possibilities of a close relationship between India and the United States.
But Indian officials say the United States has taken steps recently that have soured the atmosphere, for instance backing a resumption of World Bank lending to Pakistan but not to India.
And they have complained frequently about what they see as the American Government's overly broad use of a law that generally bars American businesses from trading with Indian companies and Government agencies that are involved in developing India's nuclear and missile programs. India wants the list of more than 200 Indian institutions affected by the law to be pruned -- a step that the Americans described as being "in play."
The United States -- and President Clinton personally -- first and foremost want India to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The President called Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee on Friday for the first time since the tests to talk about the treaty and other goals of American policy.
While recognizing that India will not give up developing what it calls a "minimum, credible nuclear deterrent," American officials want it to limit its nuclear program and stop producing weapons-grade nuclear material. They also want it to keep up talks with Pakistan to reduce tensions between the countries.
American officials are to meet with Pakistani diplomats in Pakistan on Tuesday, but declined to discuss the agenda. Their next round of talks with India is expected to take place in the middle of the year.

HEADLINE: 'Question Mark' to Become Venezuela's President Today

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Feb. 1

 BODY:
Since his election seven weeks ago, "Hurricane Hugo," as President-elect Hugo Chavez is popularly called, has barnstormed Europe, Latin America and the United States sending mixed signals about how he will govern Venezuela.
On Tuesday he will put on the presidential sash at an inauguration that will launch what promises to be a presidency of surprises. 
 The 44-year-old former lieutenant colonel has promised a revolution to clean up the Government's chronic corruption. He also pledges to break the stranglehold of the two traditional political parties by holding a referendum that would lead to the drafting of a new constitution.
But on other matters, like how he will manage the ailing economy, deal with the United States and Cuba and recalibrate the flow of oil exports, analysts say he remains a question mark.
Mr. Chavez has been an international curiosity since he tried unsuccessfully to overthrow an elected civilian Government with a military coup in 1992. Afterward he was cashiered from the Venezuelan Army and spent two years in jail.
Despite his checkered relations with some in the military, he made the red beret worn by many army units the symbol of his election campaign and proclaimed his admiration for Fidel Castro and the Cuban Revolution.
Since his election he has been wearing well-tailored suits, but Mr. Chavez has basked in his bad-boy image. "I am being compared to Mussolini, Hitler or even the Devil," he told reporters in Paris last month with a characteristic guffaw. "But I am a social fighter and a democrat."
Mr. Chavez's globe-trotting was aimed at polishing his image and calming foreign investors who steadily withdrew money from Venezuela's stock market last year in anticipation of his election.
Here and abroad, he told investors that he would not impose exchange controls or default on the national debt. He said he would defend the Venezuelan currency, the bolivar, even though analysts say it is at least 25 percent overvalued. He also promised to slash the Government's bureaucracy, strengthen central bank automony, raise the sales tax and encourage foreign investment.
With oil prices at a 12-year low and the Government's interest payments on its debt expected to rise to 40 percent of the budget this year, analysts say Mr. Chavez will probably have little room to maneuver if he wishes to avert the kind of currency turbulence now unsettling the Brazilian economy.
On oil policy, Mr. Chavez's aides have said they would support efforts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to raise the price of crude. But they would not commit themselves to a production cut.
While campaigning Mr. Chavez promised to reverse Venezuela's practice of pumping more than its OPEC quota. Venezuela is the leading source of foreign oil to the United States and is the second-biggest petroleum exporter in the world.
"The cliche is that there are two Chavezes and we don't know which one will be inaugurated tomorrow," said Roberto Bottome, editor of a Venezuelan business journal. "He has moderated his message in tone if not in content."
Still, Mr. Chavez's oratory has remained hard to decipher in recent weeks as he has painted himself as both an economic realist and a left-leaning populist.
Two weeks ago Mr. Chavez told a group of businessmen that he wanted to install a system "where market forces truly work, where the state will be the engine of progress." In Washington last week, Mr. Chavez met with President Clinton for 20 minutes and pledged his commitment to democracy.
But on a visit to Cuba last month, Mr. Chavez embraced President Castro anew.

HEADLINE: Geneva Steel Seeks Bankruptcy Protection

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: VINEYARD, Utah, Feb. 1

 BODY:
The Geneva Steel Company, which had sales of $720 million in its latest fiscal year, sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code today in an effort to work out a plan to refinance its debt.
On Jan. 15 Geneva skipped a $9 million interest payment on its 9.5 percent senior notes, due in 2004, to conserve cash. Today the company said it was negotiating a loan of $125 million to stay in business. It did not name the lender. 
 Geneva Steel blamed "a dramatic surge" in imports for the filing. American steelmakers have been hurt by a record level of steel imports from Asia, Russia and other regions with slowing economies, which has caused a sharp drop in orders and weaker prices. Two United States producers, Acme Metals Inc. and the Laclede Steel Company, filed for Chapter 11 protection last year.
Geneva Steel, which is based in Vineyard, filed its petition in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Salt Lake City. Trading in shares of the company was halted. The shares, which have dropped 74 percent in the last year, rose 6.25 cents, to 56.25 cents, on Friday.

HEADLINE: Pepsico Says Its Earnings Were Higher Than Predicted

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
Pepsico Inc. announced its fourth-quarter earnings after the market closed yesterday, painting a picture that was largely positive for its soft drink, snack food and orange juice businesses. Earnings per diluted share came in at 24 cents for the quarter, a penny higher than analysts had expected.
The company credited momentum in its soft-drink business for much of its success, noting that its North American sales volume had grown 10 percent in the quarter and 6 percent for all of 1998. 
 "Pepsi One, our new one-calorie cola, led the growth in the fourth quarter," the chairman and chief executive of Pepsico, Roger A. Enrico, said in a statement.
Yet that growth may have come at a steep price. Pepsi-Cola's profits in North America fell 21 percent in the quarter, which was the result of intensive advertising and promotional spending, as well as "a very competitive pricing environment," said Richard M. Detwiler Jr., a Pepsico spokesman.
Pepsi and its chief rival, the Coca-Cola Company, have been engaged in a price battle at the supermarket and other retail outlets for most of the last two years.
Pepsico had announced last week that it was taking 17 cents in various one-time charges against earnings to cover losses in business areas like Russia, where the company had an unusual charge of $218 million, and to cover the costs of certain Frito-Lay plant closings in the United States.
Largely because of Russia, though Asia also played a role, international Pepsi-Cola sales fell 12 percent compared with the fourth quarter a year ago. Worldwide operating profits in the soft-drink division were down 33 percent, the company said, attributing that to competitive pricing, higher advertising and marketing expenses, and the unraveling of the Russian economy.
Other areas of concern include Brazil, where sales of Frito-Lay products fell 3 percent, according to the earnings statement. "That's a little disappointing," said Jennifer Solomon, an analyst for Salomon Smith Barney.
Over all, international profits from Frito-Lay, which makes up half of Pepsico's earnings, fell 6 percent in the quarter, while North American profits rose 3 percent. Worldwide, Frito-Lay posted a 1 percent gain in the quarter.
Pepsi reported fourth-quarter sales of $7.19 billion, up 15 percent from $6.26 billion in the fourth quarter of 1997. Net income declined 10 percent, to $361 million, from $401 million in the period a year earlier. The earnings announcement was made after the stock market closed. Earlier, shares of Pepsi fell 87.5 cents, to $38.125.
"One of the critical drivers in 1999 will be the strength in profit growth of the Frito-Lay business," said Andrew M. Conway, an analyst for Morgan Stanley, who estimates that growth at 9 percent.
Worldwide Pepsi-Cola volume grew 7 percent in the quarter, mostly driven by the 10 percent gain in North American volume, the company said.
Along with Pepsi One, the leading brands were Mountain Dew, Pepsi, Lipton Brisk iced tea and Pepsi's bottled water brand, Aquafina.

HEADLINE: Mills Godwin Jr., 84; Ruled Virginia as Democrat and Republican

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Former Gov. Mills Edwin Godwin Jr. of Virginia, who rose above his segregationist past to become one of his state's most effective chief executives, died on Saturday in Newport News, Va. He was 84 and lived in Suffolk, Va.
Governor Godwin had just been released from Riverside Hospital in Newport News, where he was treated for pneumonia, said the office of Gov. James S. Gilmore 3d in Richmond. 
 Mr. Godwin was the only two-term Governor for the Commonwealth of Virginia since the Civil War, and he served his terms eight years apart -- elected in 1965 as a Democrat and in 1973 as a Republican. He epitomized the end of an era dominated by the Democratic machine of Harry F. Byrd Sr., whose organization ran Virginia politics from the 1920's to the 1960's.
In his first term, Mr. Godwin broke with the policies of the Byrd machine and was able to piece together a mainline conservative coalition that attracted labor leaders and the rank and file, African-Americans and whites, liberals as well as conservatives.
With such broad support he was able to build roads, overhaul the state Constitution and tap a new source of revenue in the form of sales taxes. His legacy was a community college system that gave Virginia an educational basis for economic growth.
Born a farm boy in Chuckatuck, Va., Mills Godwin was a 1938 law graduate of the University of Virginia and practiced law in his home county, Nansemond, until 1960. He was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1947 and to the State Senate in 1952.
It was in the Senate that he became a pillar of his state's policy of "massive resistance" to the racial integration of schools. He vowed that there would be no compromise on the issue. But that intransigence shattered in the late 1950's, and he eventually argued that Virginia just needed time to adjust to the inevitable.
He was elected lieutenant governor in 1961 and governor four years later. He later left the splintering Democratic Party and was elected to a second four-year term as a Republican in 1973.
After his second term, he worked as a business consultant and corporate director.
Mr. Godwin is survived by his wife of 58 years, Katherine Beale Godwin, and a sister, Leah G. Keith of Chesapeake, Va.

GUINEA-BISSAU: THOUSANDS FLEE FIGHTING
Thousands of people scrambled to flee Bissau, the capital, as fighting intensified between loyalist and rebel forces, and the rebels announced "a final assault" on the city. At least 15 people were reported killed. The fighting appeared to signal the end of an accord in November that halted a five-month civil war in the former Portuguese colony. (AP) 

KENYA: STUDENTS PROTEST AGAIN
Clashes be- tween the police and university students continued for a third day in Nairobi over a plan to build luxury housing in a large forest at the edge of the city. The police fired tear gas at the students, who blocked traffic and harassed motorists. Dozens of students and several officers have been injured in the protests. Ian Fisher (NYT)
 
IVORY COAST: U.S. OFFICES CLOSED
The United States Embassy and other American Government offices in Abidjan, the commercial center, shut, reportedly for security reasons. An embassy official would not say what had led to the closings. A number of American embassies have briefly closed since the bombings of American embassies last year in Kenya and Tanzania. (AP)

HEADLINE: Rohm & Haas Plans to Buy Morton in $4.5 Billion Deal

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 1

 BODY:
The Rohm & Haas Company agreed today to buy the salt and chemical maker Morton International Inc. for $4.5 billion, a deal that would make the combined business the No. 2 maker of specialty chemicals.
Rohm & Haas, which manufactures chemicals used in products ranging from shampoos to computer equipment, will use cash and stock that values Morton shares at $37.125, a 43 percent premium to Friday's closing price. Rohm & Haas will also assume $268 million in debt from Morton, which makes specialty chemicals used in adhesives, electronics and other products. 
 The move will increase the Philadelphia-based Rohm & Haas's annual sales to $6.5 billion from $3.7 billion. The company expects to cut $200 million a year in costs, which would help it as the industry consolidates amid falling prices and lower demand from Asia.
The Chicago-based Morton is North America's largest maker of salt, and is best known for its Morton Salt girl trademark. The purchase would allow Rohm & Haas to surpass rivals like Rhodia, a subsidiary of Rhone-Poulenc S.A. of France, and Ciba Specialty Chemicals A.G. of Switzerland. Clariant A.G., also of Switzerland, is the biggest maker of specialty chemicals, with annual sales of about $6.8 billion.
Rohm & Haas shares rose 75 cents, to $31.75, while Morton jumped $9.75, to $35.625.
Specialty chemicals are typically added to other substances during manufacturing to improve characteristics such as durability, color and flexibility. They are scarcer and sold in smaller volumes than so-called commodity chemicals.
Declining chemical prices and the global expansion of many industrial customers have led to mergers by a number of specialty-chemical producers so they can exploit economies of scale, demand price concessions from suppliers and provide one-stop shopping for customers.
Last year chemical mergers included Hercules Inc.'s agreement to buy BetzDearborn Inc., creating one of the biggest makers of chemicals used in paper production, and PPG Industries' acquisition of an architectural coatings business from Dutch chemical maker Akzo Nobel.
Rohm & Haas expects to pare costs by reducing freight expenses and eliminating corporate and administrative overlap, with about half of the savings coming from job cuts. The combined companies will have about 23,000 employees, and Rohm & Haas said it expects to reduce that by about 5 percent in the next year.

HEADLINE: PC Component Shortages Are Seen in Asia

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland, Feb. 1

 BODY:
Asian companies that make computer components lag behind the United States and Europe on fixing problems related to the Year 2000, which could lead to supply shortages next year, Scott McNealy, chief executive of Sun Microsystems Inc., said today.
"We believe Asia is way, way behind," Mr. McNealy said at a news conference during the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum. "Intel, Sun and Hewlett-Packard have done quite similar surveys of their supply base," he said, adding that Asia was significantly behind in dealing with the problem. This might make it difficult to buy computer hardware in 2000. 
 Mr. McNealy said he thought the Asian financial crisis might have disrupted companies' efforts to update the programming of PC's that might otherwise crash or produce bad data because of Year 2000 problems.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: THE ASSESSMENT;
Seeking the High Ground On Spending Surpluses

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
It says "Budget of the United States Government" on the cover, but the document that President Clinton sent to Congress today is really a political agenda, in spreadsheet form, for a new fiscal era.
Presidents always use their budget proposals to lay out their wish lists, and Mr. Clinton has been particularly adept at using the annual budget cycle not just to win attention for new and recycled programs but, this year especially, to portray himself as active and engaged. 
 Yet Mr. Clinton also has a more sweeping goal. With Washington still in shock at the speed with which the Federal Government has left behind an era of huge budget deficits and diminished expectations, Mr. Clinton is trying to seize the high ground in a fast-developing and fundamental debate over how the nation should capitalize on its prosperity.
Should the country invest its anticipated fiscal windfall in preparing for the aging of the baby boom generation and the strains that will create on the foundations of the social welfare system, Social Security and Medicare? In Mr. Clinton's view that is the prudent course and one that, after accounting for new spending for the Pentagon and domestic priorities, leaves no money for the sweeping tax cuts that frustrated Republicans have been demanding for years.
"This is not just about saving Social Security and Medicare, although that is terribly important," Mr. Clinton said today.
Fiscal prudence now, he said, will allow succeeding generations to deal with the unforeseen and unknowable challenges of the next century "unburdened by the unfinished business of the 20th century, unshackled by our profligacy in the latter part of this century."
Despite Mr. Clinton's implications to the contrary, Republicans say, they are equally dedicated to shoring up Social Security, and they also believe there should be more money for education and the military. Showing remarkable unanimity for a party that has been riven for the last few years by internal dissent, Republicans are arguing that there is enough money to slash taxes as well, although the budgetary math that leads to such a conclusion is a bit murky.
"We can have it all," said Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the House Budget Committee.
The two parties are in at least tacit agreement on a few points. One is not to question too aggressively the assumption that the trillions of dollars in anticipated surpluses will actually materialize. Reaping the windfall requires that the economy and the stock market remain relatively healthy for years. And Republicans and Democrats alike are considering detailed policy proposals that presume long-term budget forecasts from the White House and Congress prove uncharacteristically accurate.
Moreover, the two parties are not far apart on the biggest question before them. Facing the insolvency of what is arguably the most popular and enduring of all Government programs, they agree in general terms that nearly two-thirds of the anticipated budget surpluses should go to dealing with Social Security.
There is little agreement, however, on the best way of using the surplus to shore up the retirement system. And even putting aside Social Security, there is a heated battle shaping up over how to use the money left over once Social Security's future is assured.
The Republican leadership in Congress and Mr. Clinton have powerful reasons to find some accommodation this year and enact legislation on Social Security and dividing up the surplus. But the stakes are so big and the atmosphere so poisonous that resolution of the big questions may have to wait for the 2000 elections.
And even as they debate each other, the two parties are being forced to rethink their own approaches to tax and spending policy as the old rules forged in the austerity of deficit politics give way to a presumed age of fiscal plenty. They even need a new language.
So murky are some of the concepts for using the surplus to shore up Social Security that neither side can fully understand what the other is proposing, leaving budget analysts from both parties scratching their heads. And what, after all, has happened to the deficit hawk now that the deficit is no more?
No longer able to use the specter of endless deficits to impose limits on the growth and power of the Federal Government, Republicans are returning to the approach championed by Ronald Reagan two decades ago: stimulate the economy through big tax cuts, an approach that has the corollary benefit of starving the bureaucracy.
"We count on the American people to handle their own money and solve many of their own problems around their kitchen tables and their front rooms and their businesses," said Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who is the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. "We don't want to invent programs to use the surplus on."
Having tried hard to refashion themselves as the party of fiscal responsibility, the Democrats now have to find a way to promote what Mr. Clinton called today a "prudent but progressive" approach to governing. In other words, can they use Government to address the country's problems without opening the floodgates to new spending?
"This is a budget and an agenda that will not do nearly enough to bridge the broad and growing chasm that divides the wealthy and prosperous from the majority of Americans," said Senator Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota, who said the country has "a great number of critical domestic programs that desperately require real budgetary commitment."
But it was a sign of the Democratic Party's move to center on fiscal issues that his critique was an isolated one and that the official party line of the day was that Democrats stood for a smaller, smarter Government.
"The cry has gone out across this country, 'The Democrats are at it again, the era of big government,' " said Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, the senior Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee. "The fact of the matter is that we will be spending less as a percentage of the American economy on Government than we have at any time since 1973, and that public debt, looking out 15 years from now, will be at its lowest point since 1917."

HEADLINE: 15 Hospitals Reach Tentative Accord With Nurses

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The union representing 4,300 registered nurses at 15 private hospitals announced a tentative agreement yesterday on a three-year contract that gives nurses a role in deciding patient care policy.
The contract establishes committees at each hospital of equal numbers of nurses and administrators to devise safe ratios between the number of nurses and patients, said Norma Amsterdam, executive vice president of 1199, National Health and Human Service Employees Union. 
 "For us, quality-of-care issues took precedence over economic issues," Ms. Amsterdam said.
Hospitals covered by the agreement include Beth Israel Medical Center and Catholic Medical Center. The contract, to be voted on over the next two weeks, calls for a 3 percent raise retroactive to Nov. 1, a $2,500 lump-sum bonus on July 1 and another 3 percent raise on Nov. 1, 2000.
The union's president, Dennis Rivera, said the agreement was "unique in the United States in addressing quality-of-care issues." He added, "And no other nurses in the country enjoy the employment security guarantees that 1199 R.N.'s have."
The contract guarantees employment for any nurse on the job since December 1994, or about 85 percent of the work force. Those hired after December 1994 who lose their jobs can receive up to 80 percent of their previous net income and full benefits for up to one year while undergoing retraining.
Bruce McIver, president of the League of Voluntary Hospitals, a group of 35 private, nonprofit institutions, said the hospitals involved were pleased with the agreement.

HEADLINE: Tony Blair Rides Triumphant, Either as a Visionary or as a Good Promoter

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE 

DATELINE: LONDON, Jan. 31

 BODY:
He is youthful, articulate and visionary, leader of a nation in dramatic transition, with a compassionate vision and a ruthless dedication to seeing it through. His name is Tony Blair.
He is all style and fluff, a spiffy promoter with a preachy speaking manner and a trendy tendency to put the possessive "people's"' before the mention of any British institution and the verb "modernize" in any sentence about his goals for the country. His name is also Tony Blair. 
 Twenty months after he led Britain's "new" Labor Party to power, it is the first image of Britain's attention-getting 45-year-old Prime Minister that is prevailing -- much to the consternation of his Conservative opponents, who have failed to put across the second.
But while he is the most popular Prime Minister in British history and no one questions his extraordinary public appeal, people are asking what is actually inside the enticingly wrapped package he is offering.
Mr. Blair says he is leading a "radical" 10-year project that will free Britain from the grip of class consciousness, energize the individual parts of the United Kingdom by yielding much of London's authority over them, liberate British business from restrictions that discourage enterprise and punish risk-taking, reduce the poor's dependency on the state and end Britain's estrangement from the Continent and make it a leader in Europe.
Still, the Blair Government's emphasis on presentation, or "spin," has left it vulnerable to criticism that all this may represent slick talk of accomplishment, and not solid accomplishment itself.
"A gravity-defying victory of style over substance," is the verdict of one critic, Boris Johnson, columnist for the conservative Daily Telegraph. Mr. Blair's Government, said Michael Gove, a columnist for The Times of London, "is about entrenching a clique's hold on power, not advancing policies for the nation."
The end-of-year list of achievements put out in December by 10 Downing Street included the peace settlement in Northern Ireland; decisions to move regional power out of the Parliament in London to newly created legislatures in Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast; reforming the House of Lords; setting a minimum wage; starting a welfare-to-work program; granting independence to the Bank of England in setting interest rates, and establishing Britain as a more positive presence in Europe while maintaining strong ties to the United States.
With a 179-seat majority in Parliament, ineffective opposition from the Conservatives and only rumblings of discontent from dissidents in his party, Mr. Blair has remarkable freedom of action, and his Presidentialstyle has become the most important factor in New Labor's performance.
As focus groups and opinion research become a growing force in Britain, political muscle is increasingly measured with the tape that shows the public popularity numbers. By this standard, Mr. Blair is an outstanding success: his approval ratings are persisting in mid-60's percentiles, the highest ever for a British Prime Minister and 15 points higher than the ratings for his Government. This is occurring in spite of Cabinet scandals and disarray -- including the resignation of his chief ally, Peter Mandelson -- of the kind that contributed to the overwhelming rejection of his predecessor, John Major, in the 1997 election.
He has the support of 87 percent of the fractious Labor Party, and recent polls indicate that even the Tory rank and file prefer him to their own leader, William Hague. Although Mr. Blair heads the country that Europeans most love to loathe for its reluctance to join in their grand ventures like monetary union, he often comes first even on the Continent in polls measuring the popularity of individual leaders.
He has gained favorable international notice for a formless and airily defined theory about the divisions between individual and state responsibilities called simply the Third Way. It seems to maintain a following chiefly because he is the one who is peddling it.
 
Reforming Labor Party For the Middle Class
At home, his Government's purpose, Mr. Blair said in a recent policy speech, is to serve a "new, larger, more meritocratic middle class." His congeniality goes down easily in today's Britain, where attitudes are shaped more by consumerism than by class.
He put the Labor Party through a force-fed reformation in the 1990's, aimed at shedding the socialist ideology, tax and spending habits and tribal in-fighting that had scared off middle-class voters in past elections and given the Tories their dominance of British politics.
Outwardly, Mr. Blair has a glad-handing appeal. He is a shirt-sleeves boss, trading jocular banter with his aides in his back office at 10 Downing Street. But he is said to be steely when it comes to internal discipline. During the push to transform the party, insiders called his methods "Stalinist."
"The odd thing about him is that no one thinks of him as Machiavellian," said Robert Harris, the novelist, who is a fan of the Government. "I suppose that is what is so Machiavellian about him."
With an information management policy keeping Government spokesmen resolutely "on message," Mr. Blair holds to simple definitions and repeated slogans. One of his favorites is that he is not just running a Government but heading up a "project."
Projects need more than five years to fulfill, he and his ministers stress, and it is an article of faith among the Blairites that this Government must overcome the curse of Labor's nearly 100-year-old history of never having run Britain for two successive full five-year terms. The week after Labor's rout of the Tories on May 1, 1997, members of the new Government were already talking about the urgency of winning the next election.
Labor's preoccupation with becoming consistently electable has led critics to fault the Blair Government for being overly cautious and vague, more eager not to disaffect than to engage and lead.
"This is the first unfrightening Labor administration," said Anthony King, professor of government at Essex University. Past Labor Governments are notorious in Britons' memories for economic mismanagement, convulsive social clashes and internal wrangling. A main reason for the Blair Government's success so far, Mr. King said, is "its conspicuous failure" to make mistakes.
Perhaps Mr. Blair's boldest move was to take on the intractable conflict in Northern Ireland. While Mr. Major lacked the political clout to make much tangible progress, Mr. Blair committed his carefully rationed personal prestige to a successful outcome of the rancorous negotiations by joining the talks himself and staying up all night with the haggling negotiators last April to nail down the final terms.
 
A 'New Deal' to Put Unemployed to Work
Mr. Blair has created a program for getting jobs for youths that has placed 50,000 unemployed in jobs in seven months. But in other areas welfare reform has stalled, and steps to cut benefits for single mothers have caused resentment in a country where "welfare state" is not a pejorative phrase.
In education, Mr. Blair is meeting targets for reducing the class sizes of primary schools, and in health he has succeeded in lowering waiting lines. But he must find money to give teachers and nurses needed raises, and he is continually embarrassed by disclosures of failing schools and shortages of hospital beds.
To keep his erstwhile trade union supporters on board, he pushed through a minimum wage and moved to restore organizing rights, though in both cases the terms were not as generous as the Labor traditionalists had wished. Old Labor stalwarts are constantly unhappy with Mr. Blair, but their power is greatly diminished, and they have no other welcome port on the current map of British politics.
His personal diplomacy has made relations with Europe less frosty, even though Mr. Blair kept Britain out of the introduction of the euro. The Prime Minister stresses at every opportunity that Britain is a European country and increasingly hints that its future destiny is in monetary union.
The delicate task of educating a majority of Britons out of their traditional hostility and suspicion toward Europe has been made easier for him by the absolutist position of the Conservative leader, Mr. Hague. He favors declaring now that Britain will not consider entry into monetary union for at least eight years, a view that Mr. Blair is able to mock without having to make a commitment of his own.
Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who steers the economy and is the second most powerful man in the Government, is charged with navigating Britain past what currently looks to be the only threat to Mr. Blair's hold on British affections -- a year of limited growth, or even mild recession.
The only bumps in the road that the purring New Labor machine has been gliding along have been in an area of potential vulnerability for this Government -- the ethical conduct of its ministers and the unity of their commitment to the Prime Minister's program. These were two of the principal counts in the electoral indictment of the Conservatives by Mr. Blair.
In the last three months, four principals in his Government have walked the forced resignation plank that was a permanent feature of the Major years. Among them was Mr. Mandelson, Mr. Blair's closest confidant and as central an architect of New Labor as the Prime Minister himself. He quit on Dec. 23 when he was found not to have declared a $625,000 home loan from a colleague who was under investigation by his trade and industry department.
 
Scandal Control: Quick Resignations
The departures and evidence that emerged of feuding within the Government posed a challenge to Mr. Blair's reputation for discipline and control, and the scandal-starved British press gave the subject ample coverage. But showing his bent for damage control, Mr. Blair obtained resignations rapidly, in marked contrast to Mr. Major's lingering response in similar situations.
Most of the criticisms directed at Mr. Blair have been accusations of lapses in style -- that he is a "control freak," that he is surrounded by "cronies," that he is creating a "nanny state." His Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, was portrayed recently as a womanizer and a heavy drinker in a vengeful book by the wife he left for a younger woman in 1997, and newspapers have also raised questions about the number of homosexuals in the Government.
"It's partly to ward off boredom of Labor's unbreakable domination that the politics of the personal holds such sway," commented Hugo Young, columnist for The Guardian.
A Gallup poll published in The Daily Telegraph this month showed what the consequences of personal politics were for Mr. Blair. His approval ratings went up a point to 66.

HEADLINE: It's All Too Few Hands on Deck for the Navy

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: ABOARD U.S.S. HARRY S. TRUMAN, off Florida, Jan. 29

 BODY:
The Navy spent $4.5 billion to build this, the nation's newest aircraft carrier. It has two nuclear reactors, the latest electronic, computer and navigational equipment, and, for the long "cruises" to come, amenities for the crew, like televisions in almost every berth.
What the Navy cannot put aboard the Truman is a full crew. 
 Almost every department on the carrier faces a shortage of sailors, from the engine room to the intelligence division to the mess. The air department should have more than 600 sailors to carry out the choreographic feat of launching and landing warplanes.
Today it mustered 448.
"The people aren't there," Capt. Thomas G. Otterbein said, sitting on the Truman's bridge as pilots practiced takeoffs and landings in roiling seas 100 miles out in the Atlantic Ocean.
The Truman, commissioned by President Clinton last July to join the nation's 11 other aircraft carriers, is not alone. Two weeks ago, the Navy disclosed that it has had as many as 22,000 empty positions, or billets, in an authorized force of about 375,000. The vast majority of those were aboard the Navy's 327 ships, rather than on shore.
The Navy's shortages have a variety of causes, not the least of which is a thriving economy that creates more enticing opportunities for young people than the prospect of long voyages at sea. And the Navy has responded with a variety of programs to counter that hard reality, offering bonuses and championing proposals now before Congress to increase pay and retirement benefits for all military personnel.
The Navy's commanders insist that, for now at least, the shortages have not hurt their primary mission, which is defending the United States. But they concede that the problem is taking a toll on ships like the Truman, where sailors and officers work longer hours to pick up the slack.
And that, in turn, is worsening the problems at the root of the shortages: recruiting new sailors and keeping those who have already joined.
"It sort of feeds on itself," Captain Otterbein said. "The workload still remains pretty high. Now you're laying it on the backs of fewer people."
In Norfolk, Va., home port of the Truman and fulcrum of the Atlantic Fleet, there are shortages on almost every warship, from the frigates to the attack submarines. The aircraft carrier Enterprise, whose warplanes provided much of the punch for the air raids against Iraq in December, left port last fall nearly 400 short of a full crew of more than 5,000.
"I don't have any command out there that isn't saying we're short in one way or another," said Master Chief Jesse J. Elliott, the senior noncommissioned officer for the Atlantic Fleet's carriers and air squadrons.
The Leyte Gulf, a guided-missile cruiser, is scheduled to deploy to the Mediterranean Sea in March but so far has a crew of only 338. It should have 410. Its commander, Capt. Raymond P. Donahue Jr., said he expected to fill at least some of the most important slots before the ship steamed for six months at sea, but only at the last minute and with junior sailors.
"Some of their replacements will walk up the brow a week before they deploy," Captain Donahue said, referring to the ship's gangway. "They haven't trained with us. The continuity isn't there."
The challenges with recruiting and retention have affected the entire military, but the Navy's difficulties have become particularly acute. The Navy, like the other services, has steadily reduced its size since the end of the cold war, but now is struggling to hold to the levels it needs to maintain even a smaller fleet. The Pentagon's most recent survey on attitudes about the military found that only 9 percent of young men between 16 and 21 were likely to consider joining the Navy, the lowest of the four services.
Last year, for the first time since the draft ended in 1973, the Navy fell 7,000 short of its annual recruiting goal. Since new recruits almost always go straight to sea after boot camp, that shortfall is now rippling through the fleet.
At the same time, the Navy is not retaining nearly enough enlisted personnel, particularly those with highly technical skills.
The Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Jay L. Johnson, said in an interview that the shortage was only partly a recruiting and retention problem. The Navy has thousands of unassigned sailors who could, with better management, be reassigned to fill the empty billets, Admiral Johnson said. The answer, he said, is "to put the right people in the right billets at the right time." He said he had set in motion plans to do that.
Even he conceded, however, that the Navy faces challenges far beyond the ability of better management: a declining willingness of young people to serve in the military and a thriving economy that entices those who would or do serve.
Petty Officer Second Class Melissa Teames, an air traffic controller aboard the Truman, plans to leave the Navy on April 7 after five years. Only 24, she is highly trained and disciplined.
But the Federal Aviation Administration is hiring again in the midst of a boom in commercial travel. And, as she explained, the F.A.A. does not send you to sea.
"We're doing the same job here," Ms. Teames said, standing inside the darkened control center beneath the Truman's flight deck, "but under more difficult conditions."
The Navy admits that life at sea is not for everybody, even aboard the big carriers. The Truman has a daily newspaper, a post office, a barber shop, a store and even automatic teller machines.
But as big as it is -- longer than five blocks of Manhattan and, from the waterline to its highest point, 20 stories tall -- the Truman is cramped and crowded. Except for the cavernous hangar bay, its passageways are narrow.
There is very little common space, and even less private. Enlisted sailors sleep in bunks, stacked three deep, a step away from three more. They call them "coffin racks." For those who work deep in the ship's hull, it is possible to pass days at a time without seeing daylight.
At today's muster, the Truman's "ship's crew" totaled 2,543, more than 13 percent below the 2,933 that the Navy considers the full number to operate the ship. The Truman does not yet have a full complement of aircraft squadrons on board, which would bring the total crew to more than 5,000. It is likely that when they do arrive, those units, which normally total 2,300 to 2,400, will also have shortages.
The Truman will not deploy overseas until next year. The ship spent six weeks at sea late last year and has another "cruise" planned in March. It steamed into the Atlantic this week to allow pilots based on shore to perform the takeoffs and landings they need to stay proficient.
While at sea, the shortages are felt in ways large and small. Sailors have to work longer, usually 12-hour shifts, and spend more days in "duty stations," handling watch or otherwise being on call. The ship's mess has half the cooks it needs, and so sailors from other departments also have to fill in.
The Navy is scrambling, on shore and at sea, to address the causes and effects of the personnel shortages.
On the Truman, Captain Otterbein has made an effort to improve the quality of life. While the ship was under construction, he ordered the shipbuilders to install an extra weight room to give sailors a diversion. The ship also has more televisions than the older carriers.
Chief Warrant Officer Leon A. Coles, who runs the mess, said he held the key to keeping sailors in the Navy: better chow. The Truman just won the Navy's award for food service. "It's going to have an impact on whether they stay in the Navy," Mr. Coles said.
On shore, the Navy has taken other more drastic, and controversial, steps. It is adding 700 new recruiters to the 3,800 it had last year and nearly doubling the advertising budget, to $70 million from $45 million. But it is also going to allow in more recruits who have failed to receive a high school diploma, despite experience that has shown they tend to drop out of boot camp more than high school graduates.
The Navy's commanders also hope that President Clinton's proposal to raise military salaries by as much as 9.9 percent and to improve retirement benefits will help. Republicans in Congress have responded by proposing even more, including raises of 10.8 percent.
Today, the lowest-ranking sailor, with less than two years of experience, earns $887 a month; near the top end of the enlisted scale, a master chief petty officer, with 20 years of experience, earns $3,207 a month.
There are also new bonuses for enlisting and bonuses for re-enlisting. In some specialized fields, sailors can receive up to $30,000 to stay.
Another of Admiral Johnson's efforts has been to cut by a quarter the number of inspections and administrative tasks that ships face while in port, burdening sailors with extra work during the time they should be enjoying time off.
A reduction in administrative work appeals to Daniel C. Appold, a machinist mate second class on the Truman. "You put a wrench in my hand and I'm happy," Mr. Appold said as he worked on one of the ship's two backup diesel engines. "Put all that paperwork in front of me . . . ," he started to say, then shrugged. "I'd rather have a wrench."
An 11-year veteran, he is not sure whether to stay when his enlistment comes up next summer, though he heartily welcomed the idea of a raise. He expressed frustration with the crew shortages, but also seemed pleased with the Truman's efforts to improve the amenities, especially the food, which he said far surpassed that aboard his last ship, the carrier Abraham Lincoln.
"Compared to the Lincoln," he said, sweat on his brow, deep inside the Truman's hull, "this is a little slice of paradise."

HEADLINE: Hard Line on Needle Exchanges;
Whitman Says AIDS Program Encourages Drug Use

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J.

 BODY:
Heroin addicts are, by definition, creatures of habit. So it seemed odd that the bedraggled young man who ambled up to the needle exchange in New Brunswick was uncertain about what kind of syringe he would prefer. 
 He closely examined several different types of needles. Finally, he selected one, abruptly announced that he was an undercover agent from the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office and arrested an AIDS-prevention advocate named Diana McCague for violating New Jersey's ban on possessing or distributing syringes.
"I should have known right away he was a cop," said Ms. McCague, who had been distributing clean needles to drug addicts since 1994 and has been arrested twice. "Users are very particular about the kind of works they use -- they don't need to compare them. He seemed a little too clean to be real, too."
Ms. McCague's arrest, in the fall of 1998, forced her organization, the Chai Project (chai is Hebrew for life), the last of New Jersey's organized needle exchange programs, to stop distributing syringes. Volunteers now set up their van twice each week outside a soup kitchen in New Brunswick, distributing condoms, H.I.V.-prevention pamphlets and bleach kits to sterilize needles, but no syringes.
The needle-less campaign, and the unusually aggressive tactic of using sting operations to snare advocates for AIDS victims, has made New Jersey the most active front in the nation's fierce political battle about the merit of needle exchanges. The state's unrelenting opposition to the programs also places Gov. Christine Todd Whitman in the uncharacteristic role of hard-liner.
With her centrist views on social issues like abortion, gay rights and gun control, the Governor has cultivated a national reputation as a leader of the Republican Party's moderate wing. But mention needle exchanges, and the fact that New Jersey has the nation's third-highest rate of intravenous H.I.V. infection, and Governor Whitman can grow heated.
Republican governors in New York, Connecticut and Pennsylvania use state money to pay for the programs, arguing that they save lives and spare taxpayers the high cost of treating AIDS victims, which can top $20,000 per patient per year. Mrs. Whitman lauds the county prosecutor who arrested Ms. McCague for "enforcing the law."
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health and the Surgeon General have all released studies concluding that needle exchanges significantly decrease the spread of H.I.V. without increasing drug use. Mrs. Whitman dismisses their research as "dubious, at best."
Her appointed Attorney General, Peter G. Verniero, released a study in 1998 that was critical of needle exchanges. The study cited as one of its sources an article by the right-wing Heritage Foundation, which also advocated conversion to Christianity as a cure for drug addiction.
And when Governor Whitman was asked recently to explain the factual basis for her unflinching belief that needle exchanges send the wrong message to children, she grew frustrated, as if the hypocrisy of the programs were so obvious it needed no explanation.
"As a mother, I know that it sets a bad example," she said during an interview last month. " 'Do as I say, not as I do' is a lousy way to lead, whether you're running a family or running a state."
The fight over needle exchanges began more than a decade ago, and today 113 programs exist in 30 states, and exchange 17.5 million syringes annually, according to a survey by the Centers for Disease Control. About half the programs operate legally, and 16 others are illegal, but tolerated by their local governments. The rest operate underground.
With a few notable exceptions, medical experts from the American Medical Association to the National Academy of Sciences to the United States Department of Health and Human Services view the needle exchanges as a matter of public health and say that the goal of decreasing H.I.V. infection rates far outweighs the drawbacks of providing syringes to drug addicts.
Some law enforcement officials, led by Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the White House director of drug policy, oppose the programs as a matter of principle: drugs are illegal, they maintain, and government sends the wrong message to children by providing addicts with the means to break the law.
In trying to balance the diametrically opposed priorities of AIDS prevention and substance abuse, some government officials have performed political contortions. New York State finances 14 programs, and in New York City, where Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani last year argued for the abolition of methadone, 12 needle exchanges are in operation.
But the needle programs in New York took hold only after years of debate and false starts. The first was begun under Mayor Edward I. Koch, but was scrapped by Mayor David N. Dinkins after he took office in 1990. Despite his concern that it would encourage drug use, Mr. Dinkins reversed his position a year later after studies found that the programs slowed the spread of AIDS among drug addicts and their sex partners.
President Clinton acknowledges that needle exchanges reduce H.I.V. infection without fostering drug use. But last year he gave in to pressure from Republicans in Congress and prohibited the use of Federal money to pay for them.
In fighting the needle exchanges, Governor Whitman has encountered an unlikely adversary, David W. Troast, whom she chose in 1996 to head the state's Advisory Commission on AIDS. As a wealthy businessman and an acquaintance in Mrs. Whitman's social circle in well-heeled Somerset County, Mr. Troast was hardly someone who would be expected to side with drug users and radicals.
After taking the job, however, Mr. Troast interviewed dozens of experts in public health, epidemiology and AIDS prevention, and was stunned by the magnitude and severity of New Jersey's AIDS problem.
New Jersey has 26,000 people with AIDS, and the nation's highest rate of H.I.V. infection among women and children. The state also has 9,100 orphans whose mothers have died of AIDS.
Mr. Troast said he was also struck by the overwhelming consensus among health experts that any serious attempt to slow the spread of H.I.V., which now infects 2,100 additional New Jersey residents each year, must include a needle exchange program.
Mrs. Whitman rejected the Commission's proposal, and when Mr. Troast pushed the idea again several months later, she rejected it again. As their wrangling became highly publicized, Mr. Troast began to notice a pattern.
"Whenever my council's actions got the attention of the media, the authorities cracked down on Project Chai, and Diana McCague got locked up," Mr. Troast said. "I feel personally responsible for her plight."
In the fall of 1998, Mrs. Whitman wrote a letter telling the Commission that she would never change her opposition to needle exchanges, and urging them to move on to more productive matters, like developing strategies to cut the infection rates among pregnant women and adolescents. Mr. Troast said the Commission did focus on those problems, but arrived at the same conclusion: that a small needle exchange program could cut the state's number of new H.I.V. infections by as much as 50 percent.
"How do pregnant women get infected with AIDS?" Mr. Troast said. "How do adolescents get it? It keeps coming back to dirty needles. "Two-thirds of the new infections come directly or indirectly from dirty needles, more than any other state in the country."
Governor Whitman appointed two new members to the Commission, both of whom oppose needle exchanges, in the fall of 1998.
Many AIDS prevention advocates, including Mr. Troast, suspect that Mrs. Whitman's intransigence on the issue is a political attempt to appease right-wing conservatives in the Republican party who disagree with her support of abortion rights.
Mrs. Whitman brushes aside those suggestions, and insists that her position is a deeply held conviction, based on common sense and firsthand experience with some of the seriously impaired children born to drug-addicted mothers.
Before her first run for governor in 1993, Mrs. Whitman visited a Newark hospital that treated children born addicted to cocaine, and held some of the children who had been born with profound developmental disabilities because of their mothers' drug use. The experience convinced her that it would be better for society to discourage drug use.
"When you have a newborn infant who is unable to bond, because it's constantly crying, it's in withdrawal, it's addicted to drugs, the psychological and emotional damage can be just devastating," Mrs. Whitman said. "If you get a mother with H.I.V. and convince her to take AZT, you can vastly reduce its chance of passing H.I.V. on to the child. But these low-birth-weight babies, there's almost nothing anyone can do. It's not an either-or situation, and these are terrible choices, but the child born addicted never really has a chance."
Convinced that Mrs. Whitman will not reverse her position, Ms. McCague and other advocates are now concentrating on protests calling for changes in the state's law after the Governor's term expires in 2001.
"It's unfortunate that the Government's own statistics show that four people will be infected by injection-related H.I.V. every day between now and then," Ms. McCague said. "That's 4,400 people between now and the end of her term."
In the meantime, there is one last advocate who is known to operate an underground needle exchange in New Jersey, a Hudson County man who would identify himself only as Frank.
Equipped with syringes donated by advocates in other states, and advice from the Chai Project on how to spot an undercover police officer, he travels quietly each week to street corners and shooting galleries to replace dirty needles with clean ones.
On a Friday night in January, rainy weather and a new shipment of heroin drove most of his usual clients indoors. The one man who showed up to exchange a handful of used syringes, an auto mechanic named Tony, said most users considered the new needles more a matter of convenience than of health. On the black market, new needles cost $5 -- about one-third the price of a bag of heroin -- so many addicts reuse them simply to economize, and are often too distracted or careless to sterilize their syringes with bleach.
With or without the clean needles, Tony said, he would continue shooting heroin twice a day, the same as he has for more than a decade.
"You'd like to have a new needle for every blast, because it gets dull and your arms get sore," he said. "But when you want to get high, that's all you think about. You're going to use whatever's there, clean or not -- whatever."

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: THE OVERVIEW;
Clinton Offers His Budget, and the Battle Begins

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
President Clinton, hailing a new era of fiscal abundance, today proposed a budget for 2000 that he called a "progressive but prudent path to our future," but Republicans immediately attacked it as a throwback to an earlier age of liberal largesse.
The President said his $1.77 trillion plan would insure the solvency of Social Security and Medicare for decades while paying for billions of dollars in programs for schools, cities, families, the environment and the military. 
 Before the black ink could dry on Mr. Clinton's budget submission, Republican leaders in Congress complained that the President was shortchanging taxpayers by devoting billions in surplus Government revenues to new programs rather than tax cuts.
Republican leaders signaled a willingness to work with Mr. Clinton to reserve nearly two-thirds of future surpluses to strengthen Social Security. But there agreement ends, as the budget debate in Washington shifts from dealing with deficits to allocating surpluses.
"The President's budget ambitiously spends almost every cent of the surplus not set aside for Social Security reform on more Washington-based programs," said the House Speaker, Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois. "Clearly, the President sees the surplus as an opportunity to expand the power, the influence and the size of the Federal Government."
The President and Republican leaders today staked out their opening positions for the budget process, with its public hearings and backroom deals. In recent years, budgets have been fashioned in a frenzy of last-minute bargaining in the fall that resulted in spending plans that bore little relationship to the proposals introduced nine months earlier.
For Mr. Clinton, the politicking began today in a triumphal East Room ceremony before an audience of White House officials, Cabinet officers and members of Congress. Unveiling his budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, the President painted a vision of a future in which the American economy is insulated against domestic recession or foreign shocks by setting aside a large portion of $4.47 trillion in projected surpluses over the next 15 years to reduce the Federal debt from the current level of 44 percent of gross domestic product to just 7 percent in 2014, the lowest level of public debt since 1917.
"We have a rare opportunity that comes along once in a blue moon to any group of Americans," Mr. Clinton said, a day after an unusual second full moon in the same month. "Fiscal discipline has transformed the vicious cycle of budget deficits and high interest rates into a virtuous cycle of budget surpluses and low interest rates."
The Administration spending plan is the first in more than a generation to be written from the comfort of a fiscal year that just ended in October with a surplus. The plan projects continued low inflation and moderate economic growth over the next five years. The unemployment rate is projected to rise slightly in 1999 and 2000 and remain at 5.3 percent over the following four years. The current jobless rate is 4.3 percent.
Mr. Clinton's budget plan projects Federal tax receipts of $1.88 trillion in 2000 and spending of $1.77 trillion, producing a projected surplus of $117 billion. All of that surplus would be reserved, pending a deal on saving Social Security. The President's plan assumes that a deal will be made in the next year and calls for Social Security to receive 62 percent of the surplus that is projected to steadily grow for 15 years.
The White House projects a surplus of $393 billion in 2009, a remarkable turnaround from the $290 billion deficit that Mr. Clinton inherited when he took office in 1993.
"Our economic house is in order and strong," Mr. Clinton said. "If we manage the surplus right we can uphold our responsibility to future generations. We can do so by dedicating the lion's share of the surplus to saving Social Security and Medicare and paying down the national debt.
"We can," Mr. Clinton continued, "and because we can, we must do it now."
Today's robust economy has brought a flood of tax revenue to Washington, but Mr. Clinton would use none of it in the 2000 fiscal year for new programs. He finds ways to pay for dozens of programs and tax breaks within the constraints of the 1997 Balanced Budget Agreement by proposing to raise billions of dollars through tax increases, mostly on business and tobacco companies.
The President has rejected Republican demands for an across-the-board income tax cut, proposing instead a series of narrowly drawn tax credits for specific policy purposes. Mr. Clinton proposes $4.1 billion in targeted tax relief for 2000 and $32.6 billion in tax reductions over the five years from 2000 to 2004. The proposed tax incentives include new credits for long-term health care, a new subsidy for stay-at-home parents of young children and expanded benefits for other child care expenses, tax breaks for a variety of environmental initiatives, incentives for school construction and new research and development programs.
The President also proposes significant spending increases on education, including $1.4 billion for hiring new teachers and $965 million for job retraining and adult literacy programs. He also calls for $1 billion to buy parkland and reduce traffic congestion and urban sprawl.
To pay for these proposals, Administration officials scoured the tax code to find $33.4 billion in new revenue over the next five years by closing corporate tax loopholes and disallowing various tax shelters, imposing environmental charges on oil and mining concerns, taxing certain life insurance transactions and rewriting sales-tax rules for exporters. Many of these revenue-raising proposals have been rejected by Congress several times.
The Administration also is counting on nearly $54 billion in revenue from smokers and tobacco companies. Part of the money will come from a new 55-cents-a-pack cigarette tax that is expected to raise $34.5 billion over the next five years. The rest will come from a plan to recover $18.9 billion in Medicaid reimbursements to states that are expected to be paid by tobacco companies under legal settlements with the states worth $246 billion.
From 2001 onward, Mr. Clinton would devote 62 percent of future surpluses for Social Security and 15 percent for Medicare. The rest would be used to help middle-income taxpayers save for retirement and to pay for increased spending on the Pentagon and social programs.
Representative Dick Armey, Republican of Texas, said that Mr. Clinton's budget squandered a historic opportunity to reduce taxes for all Americans, rather than for what Mr. Armey termed favored Democratic constituencies and special interests.
"Right now, the tax burden on the American people is at an all-time high -- higher than during World War II," said Mr. Armey, the House Majority Leader. "If we can't cut taxes now, when can we?"
Administration officials acknowledged that the President's budget proposals -- particularly the new spending and tax measures -- were unlikely to survive in anything like their current form.
They also said that Mr. Clinton's plan to reserve 77 percent of future surpluses to shore up Social Security and Medicare until 2055 was subject to negotiation with the Republican majority in Congress.
"First of all, the President has not said that this should be the end of the discussion. This is the beginning of the discussion," said Jack Lew, the White House budget director, offering a pointed challenge to Congress. "If there's an alternative to get to 2055 that is capable of reaching bipartisan support, we would like to see that alternative."
Republicans in Congress were unable to agree last year on competing tax-cut proposals, with the result that no major tax relief was approved. But, for now at least, Republicans in both houses appear united in their determination to pass a big tax-cut bill and send it to Mr. Clinton for his signature.
Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who is the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said he was willing to go along with Mr. Clinton's proposal to reserve 62 percent of future surpluses for Social Security. But while Mr. Clinton wants to use the remaining excess for Medicare, a new form of retirement account for middle-income taxpayers and additional social and military spending, Mr. Domenici wants to return the money to the public in the form of tax cuts.
Mr. Domenici said that he believed that Congress would approve a large, across-the-board tax cut and predicted that Mr. Clinton would sign it. "What's changed," he said, "is we have a bona fide surplus."
Representative John R. Kasich, Republican of Ohio, likened Mr. Clinton to Santa Claus, bringing gifts for every constituency. But Mr. Kasich, chairman of the House Budget Committee warned Mr. Clinton against surplus-generated generosity.
"We are not going to blow this by spending it on Big Government," Mr. Kasich said.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: THE TAXES;
$82 Billion in Increases and $36 Billion in Cuts (Do the Math?)

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 1

 BODY:
President Clinton's budget includes a grab bag of small tax cuts for some Americans and small tax increases for others. Many of these tax proposals seem unlikely to get far in the Republican-controlled Congress.
"I've never seen such a kitchen-sink approach to Government," said Representative Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which takes first crack at tax legislation. 
 Republicans like Mr. Archer prefer an across-the-board reduction in income tax rates for all taxpayers, but it is far from clear that such an approach can be enacted in the face of a likely Presidential veto.
As tallied by Congressional committee staff members, who added all the pluses and minuses in the budget's revenue tables, Mr. Clinton proposed 81 separate tax increases totaling $82 billion over the next five years and 37 tax cuts totaling $36 billion over the same period. By the Administration's calculations, the comparable figures are $87.4 billion in new revenue and $32.6 billion in tax reductions.
The largest amount of new revenue anticipated in the budget would be generated by the President's tobacco policy. Mr. Clinton would raise nearly $35 billion over five years by increasing the Federal tax on cigarettes, now 24 cents a pack, by an additional 55 cents. And he would raise an additional $19 billion by insisting that the Federal Government get a share of the money states will receive from their lawsuits against the cigarette manufacturers.
This revenue may not materialize. Last year, the Senate rejected a proposed increase in cigarette taxes, and the measure never got off the ground in the House. Furthermore, the states have resisted sharing with Washington the proceeds from their lawsuits, and measures are pending in Congress that would block attempts to recoup the money.
A few of the President's tax proposals do stand a fair chance of enactment. For example, Mr. Clinton proposed a tax cut of up to $1,000 to defray some of the cost of long-term care for elderly or disabled dependents. A similar proposal was part of the Contract With America, the platform on which Republicans ran when they won control of the House in 1994.
Under the Clinton proposal, taxpayers could claim this credit if they provided more than half the support of someone in a nursing home or otherwise requiring long-term care. The credit would be reduced for taxpayers with incomes above $75,000, or $110,000 for a couple filing a joint return.
The President's proposal for a tax credit to offset some of the cost of child care might stand a slightly better chance this year because, to appeal to Republicans, the Administration added a modest new benefit for parents who stay home to take care of their own children.
Mr. Clinton recommended increasing to 50 percent from 30 percent the proportion of child-care costs that could be written off by families with annual incomes below $30,000. The credit would be gradually reduced for families with incomes of $30,000 to $59,000 and would be 20 percent of allowable expenses for those with incomes above $59,000.
In addition, the President proposed an extra tax cut of up to $250 for families with infants who have not reached their first birthday. This credit would be available even if the family had no child-care expenses because a parent or unpaid relative watched the infant.
The tax credit for long-term care expenses would cost $5 billion over five years. The expanded child-care credit would cost slightly more than $6 billion over the same period.
Not counting the cigarette tax increase, these are among the largest of the President's tax proposal. In a budget with total five-year revenues of about $10 trillion, they are hardly more than asterisks.
Many of the President's tax proposals have been offered in the past and have been rejected out of hand by Congress. Among these are arcane proposals to change the way airline tickets are taxed, to alter the tax rules on exports by manufacturers and to raise taxes on certain life insurance transactions.
The House Ways and Means Committee staff experts calculated today that 35 of the 81 revenue increases in the budget are essentially repeats of measures that were rejected last year. Of the $82 billion in additional revenue proposed, more than $60 billion would be accounted for by these reprised offerings.
The budget describes many of these proposals as attempts to "eliminate unwarranted benefits." But the beneficiaries obviously do not view them that way, and the Republican Congress has been reluctant to end any but the most indefensible tax breaks.
As a political matter, the battle over taxes this year is not likely to be over whether these small tax breaks are justified, but rather over the broader question of whether part of the budget surplus should be used for an across-the-board tax cut.
Republicans argue that it is much more efficient economically to give everyone a tax reduction than to follow President Clinton's course and give small tax cuts for particular purposes like school construction or promotion of energy efficiency.
Mr. Clinton has threatened to veto an overall tax cut, saying wealthy people would be the big winners.

HEADLINE: Milosevic Advantage: In Talking Peace He Can Win Big

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, Feb. 1

 BODY:
As the deadline approaches for entering peace talks on Kosovo province, with threats of NATO bombs and sharp warnings from the West, Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav President, has much to gain.
The threats by the Clinton Administration and its NATO allies to bomb him into ceding effective control over the separatist province not only make it easier for Mr. Milosevic to justify eventual concessions but also make him indispensable to any settlement. 
 "As much as officials in Washington publicly revile Mr. Milosevic and call him the main problem in the Balkans, he is also the solution," a senior Western diplomat said. "The West needs Milosevic to settle Kosovo, and Milosevic needs the pressure of the West to be able to do it. All the rest is hypocrisy."
Given Kosovo's mythic importance as the birthplace of the Serbian nation, Serbian officials and senior diplomats here say, Mr. Milosevic is bound to take NATO to the brink before agreeing to any political settlement over Kosovo, where an ethnic Albanian majority is fighting for independence.
While the stick of NATO's bombs is a necessary condition for any deal, Mr. Milosevic will also require some "cake," as the new Deputy Prime Minister, Vuk Draskovic, put it -- a partial lifting of the harsh diplomatic and economic isolation that the West imposed on Serbia during the Bosnian war. Mr. Milosevic may also seek a quiet promise that he not be indicted for war crimes.
There is a wide assumption here, based on the tone of the state press, that Mr. Milosevic will send a delegation to the Western-sponsored talks that are scheduled to start on Saturday outside Paris. There has been no official announcement, however.
And there is also a wide expectation that Mr. Milosevic will eventually authorize an interim settlement that leaves Kosovo a vague but largely self-governing entity within the formal sovereignty of Yugoslavia, as the West is demanding.
As he was in Bosnia, Mr. Milosevic would again become a vital guarantor of any settlement, reinforcing his international and domestic stature.
Mr. Milosevic will be able to argue that even the introduction of Western troops into Kosovo will serve to repress the "terrorism" of the Kosovo Liberation Army, to protect Serbs and their holy places and to keep Kosovo from becoming independent.
Already, on state television, Mr. Milosevic is being hailed for demanding that Kosovo must remain "part of our country." While the name of that country -- Yugoslavia or Serbia -- is left deliberately vague, "one can already smell the way a settlement will be spun here," said Bratislav Grubacic, a well-connected editor.
The analytical cliche about Mr. Milosevic is that he survives by creating crises that require national unity and justify the stifling of dissent, and that he is a superb political tactician who does not have a larger strategic vision. But he is also considered a highly rational judge of his own interests, with little emotional attachment to the kind of Serbian nationalism he has manipulated for the last 10 years.
"He doesn't care himself about Kosovo," said Aleksa Djilas, a political scientist here who has written some of the best analyses of Mr. Milosevic. "His enemies are his best friends. He thrives when Serbs feel the world is being biased and unfair to them. At the same time, the West comes to his aid when it treats him respectfully, as someone who has all the cards in his hands."
The opposition has helped Mr. Milosevic, too, Mr. Djilas said. "There was a chance for the opposition to unite and put Milosevic and the Socialists out of power," he said. "But they never did, and now they're joining him."
In November, Mr. Milosevic fired key members of his inner circle, including the long-serving army Chief of Staff, Gen. Momcilo Perisic, and the director of intelligence, Jovica Stanisic, reportedly at the urging of his wife, Mirjana Markovic, whom many here compare to a socialist Lady Macbeth.
At the time, Washington officials saw the purge as an indication of Mr. Milosevic's weakness and the fragility of his rule. Some thought the effective loss of Kosovo would mean the quick downfall of Mr. Milosevic.
But Mr. Perisic has not attracted supporters and Mr. Milosevic's control over the apparatus of both the federal and Serbian authorities seems enhanced, said both Mr. Grubacic and Ljiljana Smajlovic, a Serbian journalist. Ms. Smajlovic said, "Milosevic is in great shape," having co-opted into the governing coalition both the nationalist leader of the Radical Party, Vojislav Sesejl, and the most charismatic leader of the former opposition coalition, Mr. Draskovic, who agreed to enter the federal Government two weeks ago.
"Milosevic can say with some legitimacy that he has a national unity Government, and politically, he controls every institution," Ms. Smajlovic said. "The only people outside his reach are those, like students, journalists and professors, who have no parliamentary seats or institutional authority."
And this more liberal group can hardly attack Mr. Milosevic from the right, for avoiding another war and making concessions on Kosovo.
"Officials here like to say that they don't have enough money to make everyone happy, but they have enough to bribe anyone they need," Mr. Grubacic said. "The country is poorer than before, but passive. Milosevic is the king, untouchable, and underneath him, the factions are fighting."
Even a prominent member of the opposition Democratic Party, its vice president, Slobodan Vuksanovic, says that Mr. Milosevic's position is unchallenged now, and that the opposition has damaged itself badly by its own mistakes and rivalries.
Only two years ago, 200,000 people turned out daily in Belgrade to demonstrate against Mr. Milosevic and in favor of democratic spokesmen like Mr. Draskovic, Zoran Djindjic and Vesna Pesic. Their coalition -- Zajedno, or unity -- won local elections in Belgrade, which represents almost a third of Serbia's population.
But their own disputes destroyed the coalition, and their decision to boycott parliamentary elections left them without any parliamentary votes or a clear program.
"Milosevic didn't do this to us," Mr. Vuksanovic said. "We did this to ourselves. He's still in power because opposition leaders missed so many opportunities."
The opposition could have won up to 100 of the 250 seats in the Serb parliament, Mr. Vuksanovic said, but "in the end we're left with nothing."
While Mr. Draskovic contended in an interview that he has kept his integrity and is fighting for the same democratic goals "from within," Mr. Vuksanovic says Mr. Draskovic is trying to benefit from the perks of power, including wide access to the state-controlled media.
At the same time, he notes, Mr. Draskovic's deal with Mr. Milosevic will deeply disappoint ordinary voters. "They will look at this opposition leader and say, 'He's just like all the rest of them,' " he said.
The ordinary voter is afraid of risk, Mr. Vuksanovic said. "They know Milosevic is a bad guy," he said, "but they see that he's stronger than all the other political leaders put together."
Of course the end will come for Mr. Milosevic, Mr. Grubacic said, but not now. "The challenge will be spontaneous," he said, "caused by a stupid mistake, like the last drop of water that overfills the glass."

HEADLINE: Explosion At Ford Plant Kills Worker

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., Feb. 1

 BODY:
A thunderous explosion, followed by a fire that burned for several hours, killed one worker and injured at least 30 today at the Ford Motor Company's River Rouge complex, long a symbol of American industrial strength that put the nation on wheels by building the Model T.
The explosion and fire heavily damaged the complex's power plant, which normally produces enough electricity to supply the residential needs of a city the size of Boston. Ford and Rouge Steel, a subsidiary here that Ford sold a decade ago, were forced to close all six factories in the 1,100-acre Rouge complex and send home almost all 10,000 workers until further notice. 
 Art Janes, the Ford site manager here, said late tonight that the company was bringing in generators to reopen a parts factory here quickly, adding that 16 of Ford's 20 North American assembly plants depended on parts from it. Later, a Ford spokesman said four assembly plants elsewhere were scheduled for half-shifts on Tuesday because of a shortage of parts.
The cause of the explosion, which occurred in the power plant at about 1 P.M., was not known.
Charles N. Jeffress, the Assistant Secretary of Labor for occupational safety and health in Washington, said that although industrial accidents involving similar numbers of injuries happen occasionally, it was extremely rare to have such a broad and immediate economic effect from an accident. Michigan is one of 23 states in which state officials instead of Federal ones investigate workplace mishaps, and these state investigators will start as soon as firefighters declare the site safe, Mr. Jeffress said in a telephone interview.
In addition to the dead and injured, one worker was missing tonight and might be the unidentified dead person, the police said. Many of the injured were severely burned and 12 were in critical condition.
Auto industry workers have a rate of injury and work-related illness that is two and a half times that of the average for workers in the private sector, according to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. But Ford has had a fairly good record until now, maintaining a large staff to investigate ways to improve workplace safety, Mr. Jeffress said.
William Clay Ford Jr., Ford Motor's chairman, arrived at the factory less than two hours after the explosion, as firefighters were still trying to put out the blaze, and said the loss of life and injuries made today "the worst day of my life." A great-grandson of Henry Ford, Mr. Ford, 44, emphasized safety and environmental issues as a member of Ford's board before reasserting the Ford family's control of the company last fall and becoming the chairman at the start of this year.
Ford Motor's headquarters is still situated about three miles from the Rouge complex here in this southwestern suburb of Detroit. Started in 1918, the factory complex employed nearly 100,000 workers at its peak in the late 1940's. The complex took iron ore, timber, rubber and other raw materials and turned them into cars. While Henry Ford perfected assembly-line production and built the first Model T's at another, smaller factory in nearby Highland Park, Mich., it was the Rouge complex that became a symbol of American mass production after World War I.
Subsequent factory complexes were less ambitious, buying more of their parts from outside suppliers. Ford now builds the Mustang and many auto parts here.
Ford officials declined to speculate tonight on when the aging factories here would reopen, saying their first concern was for their workers' safety. The unionized workers here will continue to be paid.
George McPartlin, a Ford employee who used to work inside the plant and stood outside it this afternoon, said the top floor, where the worst fires burned, was where coal dust was fed as fuel into the boilers. He raced to the factory this afternoon to make sure that his brother, Larry, a power plant electrician, was safe.
"He had soot all over his clothes and he was shaking" but was not injured, Mr. McPartlin said, adding that his brother had told him that the explosion occurred in a boiler that had just been repaired and only turned on again on Sunday night.

HEADLINE: THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET PROPOSAL: THE DETAILS -- Freeze on Medicare Money to Hospitals Would Pay for Health Care Initiatives;
Military Spending

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER 

 BODY:
The budget includes the largest increase in military spending since the cold war buildup under President Ronald Reagan and would give members of the military their biggest raise in a decade.
The President's budget of $267.2 billion includes a $12 billion increase, $4 billion of which is a straight increase and $8 billion of which is financed by savings earned from lower-than-budgeted fuel prices and inflation. 
 The President also asking for the authority to initiate two more rounds of base closings, which would eventually produce $2 billion in annual savings, although that is not reflected in this year's budget.
While Mr. Clinton appears to have included all the money requested by the military to improve pay, benefits and readiness -- including spare parts and training -- he held back on any sharp increase for modernizing the military's weaponry and equipment. He asked for $53 billion for procurements, only $1 billion less than in the earlier budget review. But it was not the larger increase requested by the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
That modernization includes money for a new Virginia-class attack submarine, Navy ships, aircraft for the Air Force and a national missile defense system that the Pentagon is trying to develop.
"This highlights the looming debate over modernization that will probably become part of next year's Presidential campaign," said Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution. "The question will be whether the cold-war-like agenda for modernization should be reassessed before all that money is spent."
In presenting the budget, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen emphasized the 4.4 percent increase in pay for the troops, the reinstatement of military retirement benefits to 50 percent of base pay after 20 years in service, from 40 percent, as well as special programs to encourage members of the military to stay in the service.
Congress agrees that the military deserves higher pay and, in what may become a bidding war, a Senate committee last week approved a bill that would give the military an even larger raise, 4.8 percent.
Mr. Cohen said today that while the Pentagon welcomed as much money as it could get "for our men and women in uniform," he was worried that the Senate would not be able to come up with the additional $7 billion that its pay proposal would require.
"We do not want to raise expectations and not be able to pay for it," he said.
Immediately, Senate Republicans, who plan to make increasing military pay a major theme of this Congressional session, complained that the Clinton budget for the military was not large enough.
"I am disappointed that the President did not fully heed the requests of his Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff for a significant defense budget increase," said Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona.
The military budget is aside from $13 billion for the nuclear weapons programs of the Energy Department.
About $29 billion of the Pentagon's budget is for the nation's 13 intelligence services, including the Central Intelligence Agency. The precise amount is classified. ELIZABETH BECKER

Backstage at the Opera With Cecilia Bartoli
By Manuela Hoelterhoff
Illustrated. 262 pages. Alfred. A. Knopf. $25.
 Manuela Hoelterhoff's backstage look at the Cecilia Bartoli phenomenon and the opera world in general is the most perceptive and hilariously honest book on the making and marketing of opera to come along in some time. 
 But it did not turn out quite the way Ms. Hoelterhoff, a Pulitzer Prize-winning former critic and editor at The Wall Street Journal, intended. The original idea was to provide a behind-the-scenes report on an indisputably excellent singer who had achieved sensational popularity before her 30th birthday. For two years, leading up to a new production of Ms. Bartoli's signature opera, Rossini's "Cenerentola" at the Met in 1997, Ms. Hoelterhoff had enviable access to the singer and her circle: her mother, a former chorus soprano and still Ms. Bartoli's most trusted vocal coach; her worldly Italian boyfriend; her savvy manager, Jack Mastroianni, and a whole cast of recording executives and attendant conductors who pass through the story like comprimario characters in an opera buffa.
 Yet, though Ms. Bartoli was quite cooperative, she proved an exasperating subject. Ultimately the reason this particular Italian mezzo-soprano, gifted as she is, has generated such tenacious loyalty, particularly among her American fans (the Italian public has never been quite as enthralled), is a bit inexplicable, and after a while you sense Ms. Hoelterhoff's frustration.
This is not a typical case of a biographer growing jaded the more she learns about her subject. From the first time Ms. Hoelterhoff encountered Ms. Bartoli's singing, on a recording of Rossini's "Barber of Seville," she was smitten. Here was "a smooth, glimmering truffle of a voice," she writes in "Cinderella & Company," "astonishing in its virtuosity and range."
Still, the Bartoli material must have seemed insufficient for an entire book. So, happily for readers, Ms. Hoelterhoff introduces us to just about everyone operatic she met during those two years, interspersed with collected bits of wisdom and gossip. We read about the great Renata Tebaldi's first visit to the United States in 20 years, opera's self-absorbed new love couple, Roberto Alagna and Angela Gheorghiu, the surreal planning meetings for James Levine's gargantuan 25th-anniversary celebration, Renee Fleming, the new generation and much more. The resulting book is a bit of this, a bit of that. But Ms. Hoelterhoff is such an interesting observer and beguiling writer that you eagerly follow her anywhere.
Her snappy sentences often end with surprise punches: she defines the period of bel canto as a tradition in which "embellishments, fluid scales, interpolations and good taste were expected even of tenors." She has a novelist's ability to capture a person in a few wry phrases. Here she is on Joseph Volpe, the general manager of the Met: "A blunt guy with an opera villain's chin beard and a healthy hunger for prestige, the 55-year-old Volpe had now muscled his way past Levine on the totem pole, acquiring excellent suits and independent taste along the way."
Some critics have found Ms. Hoelterhoff's irreverence overly harsh, as when she writes that the only singer of her knowledge who smokes is the Wagnerian tenor Siegfried Jerusalem, "who puffs like Fafner the dragon and sounds like it too." But, an enduring love for opera and compassion come through in her account. Yes, the coloratura June Anderson is described as "another singer tethered to the ground by a fraying silk thread." But later in the same paragraph, reflecting on why Ms. Anderson seems determined, despite her success, to be miserable, Ms. Hoelterhoff writes: "Of all the artists I have ever met, she made me most aware of how hard it can be for shy singers to come to terms with a mysterious gift that requires them to face several thousand strangers who do not necessarily wish them well."
Knowing of Ms. Hoelterhoff's reputation as an unsparing critic and reporter, it's amazing that so many people in the business talked with her so freely, notably the powerful manager and public relations maestro Herbert Breslin, whom Ms. Hoelterhoff calls a "motor-mouthed, bullet-headed, forever tan egomaniac." Mr. Breslin's soliloquy on how he and his prime client, Luciano Pavarotti, showed everyone how real money could be made in opera is breathtaking in its honesty and shamelessness.
The sections on Ms. Bartoli are the heart of the book. There is ample evidence of her superb musicianship, determination and unconventionally interesting career choices, like that of making her Met debut in Mozart's "Cosi Fan Tutte" in the relatively small role of Despina, the maid. "I want to have some pleasure out of my debut," Ms. Bartoli is quoted as saying, "and maybe change perceptions of what is a debut at the Met."
Fans will gain some perspective on Ms. Bartoli's penchant for missing performances. Several notable cancellations seem to have been genuinely precipitated by illness, travel snafus and even personal tragedy: during the years covered in the book, Ms. Bartoli's beloved younger brother died of a brain tumor.
But sometimes her cancellations are maddening to read about, as when a healthy Ms. Bartoli pulled out of a live Saturday broadcast of "Cosi" because two lead male singers were ill, and Mr. Levine, also ill, was stuck in another city. That millions in the international radio audience were counting on hearing her did not seem to matter. Ms. Hoelterhoff does not disguise her astonishment.
But never the most mellow bunch, opera singers have to put up with pushy managers, clueless directors and drafty rehearsal rooms and still exercise their unearthly voices in the most difficult vocal music ever conceived. If anything, with the current economic squeeze in the recording industry, not to mention instant worldwide communications, there is more pressure than ever.
Ms. Bartoli's career is a juggernaut, and one can only hope she keeps her balance. Ms. Hoelterhoff makes few predictions, either about Ms. Bartoli or the field in general. But it is immensely fun and informative to read her account of the problems.

HEADLINE: British Group Urges Freer Exchange of Actors With U.S.

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE 

 BODY:
A British arts group has strongly criticized a union agreement that governs the number of British and American theater actors working on opposite sides of the Atlantic, and its report is raising hopes that the restrictions can be ended or loosened.
Under the current rules, a producer who wants to bring a British actor to New York must seek the approval of Actors Equity, the American union, just as British Equity's approval is needed to bring an American actor to London. In theory the two unions try to balance the exchange. But over the years some Britons have charged that provisions for exchange have been unevenly and unfairly applied. 
 Some Americans have said that because so much British theater is Government-subsidized and costs are lower in London than New York, British producers and actors would reduce jobs for Americans in a more open marketplace. It costs roughly $500,000 to mount a play in London, compared with some $2.5 million in New York.
The report from the British Council, the country's main international cultural agency, argues that the current policies mean that audiences in both countries miss seeing a great deal of theater and that many actors lose opportunities to work.
"The importance of this report is that it provides a thorough and systematic analysis of a system that is failing actors on both sides of the Atlantic and ultimately the theatergoing public as well," said Jed Bernstein, executive director of The League of American Theaters and Producers, the national trade organization.
The report for the British Council charges that American Equity's influence in the international exchange of actors "is unquestionably operating in restraint of trade between the two countries." It adds that the American union's rationale for its approach is based on "short-term quasi-economic arguments for which there is little if any justification."
Alan Eisenberg, executive director of Actors Equity, said yesterday that the union was willing to sit down and talk with British Equity, which has requested a meeting because of the report. But he said the trade agreement was still needed to protect American jobs.
"The American actor is underemployed and underpaid," Mr. Eisenberg said. "Frequently, when a production comes in, it takes away a job and a career opportunity from an American actor.
"What we're trying to do in the exchange is deal with the artistic complaint of obstruction," Mr. Eisenberg continued. "Open borders, given the lack of subsidy and support, would work to the detriment of actors in this country."
There are three ways a British actor's move to New York can be approved: if he or she is deemed by Actors Equity to be a star; if the production is mounted by what the union considers a "unit company," one of long standing that performs in repertory, like the Royal Shakespeare Company; or if the actor provides "unique services," like those of the African chanters in "The Lion King."
Otherwise, the only way a British actor can be approved by Equity's Alien Committee is as part of an exchange in which the British producers put up a bond and guarantee that an equal number of American actors will be employed in Britain, at United States wage rates, in commensurate roles.
No equivalent provisions appear in formal agreements between British Equity and the Society of London Theater and Theatrical Management Association, but in practice the same categories of exemption are generally observed.
The curious calculus controlling exchanges, rather than providing clear guidelines, has prompted many emotional arguments about who is a star, what constitutes a unit company and the definition of unique services.
At the end of January, Actors Equity rejected a bid to bring to Broadway the entire British cast of the Royal National Theater's highly praised revival of "Oklahoma!," saying that American actors could fill the roles.
The actors' exchange is "the only situation of its kind in the world, and it's terribly close to artists' hearts," Sally Cowling, head of drama and dance for the British Council, said yesterday in a telephone interview from London. "We're just saying this is not in the artists' best interests.
"My first and most simple objective is to add my voice to the encouraging voices," she said. "There are still a lot of problems. Let's get around the table again. There were a lot of companies and individuals on both sides of the Atlantic who didn't know what the situation was."
The main argument running through the British report is that the two countries have a special relationship, culturally and historically, and that the pattern of cultural exchange generally operates freely in every realm except the theater.
"No one seeks to count Dame Janet Baker's appearances at Carnegie Hall and tally them against Jessye Norman's at the Royal Festival Hall or the Barbican," the report said. "There is no suggestion that because Andre Previn takes charge of the London Symphony Orchestra, a British conductor must be given a reciprocal opportunity in, say, Chicago or Cleveland."
The two actors' unions and the producers' groups from both countries all met for the first time in London in 1997 to hammer out some of the issues. At that time the producers proposed a temporary moratorium, perhaps lasting two or three years, on all union restrictions governing the actors' exchange.
Actors Equity rejected the idea at the time, saying that the flow would be in one direction, to the detriment of American actors. The producers then proposed the idea of some sort of subsidy package to underwrite American productions in London and guarantee some American jobs in Britain.
The issue has become more pressing in recent years as more plays have emigrated to New York from Britain and Ireland, among them "Art," "The Beauty Queen of Leenane" and "The Judas Kiss."
American actors on the London stage in recent months have included Kevin Spacey at the Old Vic as Hickey in a revival of "The Iceman Cometh" and David Dukes, Stacey Keach and George Wendt, who replaced the all-British cast of "Art." There is also an all-American cast in a revival of "Show Boat."
"We certainly hope we can get back round the table," said Rupert Rhymes, the chief executive of the London producers' group. "Obviously what we'd like to see happen, as far as our members are concerned, is there be a free exchange, at least for a trial period."

HEADLINE: THE NEW AMERICAN SERVICE;
Easygoing, Not French And Formal

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES 

 BODY:
IN one of world's most serious restaurant cities, Daniel Swee qualifies as a heroic diner. He can be found reading a menu up to five nights a week, sometimes for business, more often for pleasure. "I eat out far too often," he said. Over a decade, Mr. Swee, the casting director for Lincoln Center Theater, has felt a change in restaurant service that's a little like a change in the weather. It's nothing specific, it's hard to put your finger on, but it's there, and it has made him happy.
"There's a trend toward restaurants where the food is really fantastic, but the atmosphere is casual, and you are made to feel welcome," he said. "In the past, you felt that dining in a top restaurant was a rare privilege, and you'd better behave. Now, there's a warmth and an interaction that wasn't there before." 
 In a city where intimidation is nine points of the law and one-upmanship is the coin of the realm, pleasing the customer counts as a revolutionary idea. Mr. Swee is not alone in sensing a different tone in restaurant service these days, one that reflects a shift in the way restaurant service is thought of, invested in and delivered in New York and other large cities.
Over the last decade, a distinctly American style of service has been evolving, a relaxed yet professional approach that suits the national character better than the old, formal French-style service. This reinterpretation of restaurant protocol is radical enough to merit a name -- the new American service -- and at fine restaurants, owners and managers spend as much time thinking about it as they do about the food.
And plenty of diners would say it's about time. More than half those who responded in the 1999 Zagat Survey, which covers 45 cities, listed service as their top restaurant complaint, and for all restaurants, service ratings lagged 1.5 points behind food ratings on the survey's 30-point scale. In New York, the city with the highest restaurant prices in the country, 43 percent of respondents nevertheless listed service as their top complaint, and the average service rating was nearly 2 points lower than the average food rating.
The gap reflects a historical lag between food and service that makes perfect sense, given the evolution of American cuisine. In the 1970's and 80's, American restaurants, energized by a fresh American approach to cooking, threw all their energies into the kitchen. In the last decade, however, as food quality rose, and as competition between restaurants heated up, owners and managers began looking at service as a way to set themselves apart. Their efforts have begun to show.
"Service in fine dining is at an all-time high right now," said Elizabeth Ward, a vice president for marketing at Visa, who helps restaurants develop programs to improve service. "Fine-dining restaurants can get highly educated, skilled employees, who know they can make a lot of money serving. Also, the restaurants realize that to charge the prices they do, they have to nail it every time."
Karen MacNeil, a restaurant consultant who lectures on service at the Culinary Institute of America's campus in the Napa Valley in California, went even further. "American service is much better than European service right now," she said. "When I go to Europe, I am shocked, except at three-star restaurants, where it's like an elegant ballet, at how much more professional the American waiters are."
So why all the complaining? Although statistics on the restaurant industry tend to be scanty, the numbers that are out there paint a picture of an America that is rapidly developing two starkly divergent restaurant economies. The mass-taste establishments, which include chains, casual-dining restaurants and fast-food franchises, are indeed in the throes of a service crisis. Like their counterparts in the hotel and retail industries, they have been squeezed by a tight labor market, which has sent them scrambling for employees, who leave almost as soon as they are hired.
"Nationwide, many casual-dining restaurants have more jobs than people to fill them, which depresses standards a bit," said Art Siemering, the editor of Trend/ Wire, an industry newsletter. "Restaurants want to give good service, but the whole labor market works against it."
In an annual survey by the American Society for Quality and the University of Michigan, consumer satisfaction with fast-food restaurants, low to begin with, compared with other service industries, has declined markedly since 1994, the first year the survey was conducted.
"Expectations are higher," said Ron Zemke, the president of Performance Research Associates, a Minneapolis company that evaluates service and training for restaurants. "In part this is because of the better economy, but it's also because of an increased awareness of higher levels of service, much more than five years ago."
At fine restaurants, however, especially in New York, San Francisco and Chicago, where competition among top-dollar spots is ferocious, the picture looks very different. In the last five years, the gap between food and service ratings in the Zagat Survey has shrunk from 2 points to 1.5 points. "That's a significant change when you're talking about the whole range of restaurants covered by the survey," said Tim Zagat, who publishes the survey.
Over the same period, tips, ordinarily regarded as a reward for service, have risen across the country. According to survey data from NPD Group, a market research company in Rosemont, Ill., the average dinner tip nationwide rose from 14.9 percent in 1993 to 16.2 percent in 1997. In Manhattan, the standard tip at a good restaurant is close to 20 percent.
Somebody is doing something right.
The new style of service is still taking shape, the rules are in flux, but restaurant owners and their customers know it or feel it when they meet it.
What it is not is the old-fashioned European-style service, with tuxedoed captains, imposing maitre d'hotels, rigid rules of service and an air of hauteur and intimidation. For generations of American diners, this was the definition of fine dining -- the kind of snooty French joint where Lucy and Ethel made fools of themselves. It became an anachronism as a new generation of chefs and restauarant owners developed a fresh American approach to cuisine over the last 25 years.
At its best, new American service is professional, casual and democratic. It is democratic in two senses. First, diners get equal, or at least more nearly equal, consideration, rather than being divided into nobodies and friends of the house. Second, service duties are shared more equally among staff members, which translates into better, more informed service for diners and, not incidentally, good salaries for waiters at top restaurants. It is not uncommon to earn $50,000 a year waiting tables at a second-level restaurant in New York, while waiters at the city's top restaurants can bring home $80,000. The profession may not have the glamour that attaches to chefs, but the days of "My name is Jason, and I'll be your waiter," and snide remarks about out-of-work actors feel anachronistic these days.
"It's a little more conversational, rather than presentational," Mr. Swee said. "You can have a conversation with the servers and actually learn. At Babbo, one of my current favorites, if the wine steward comes over, it's not an intimidating experience. He's incredibly knowledgeable, but enthusiastic and willing to talk to you, to help."
In recent years, it has become standard practice at fine restaurants for waiters to know the menu from top to bottom, and to be able to answer questions about the ingredients in each dish. Waiters are expected to have a solid understanding of wine.
The new way takes a lot of time and a lot of money. When Picholine changed its format from casual bistro to fine dining, Terrance Brennan, the owner and chef, hired a sommelier and a fromageur, bumped up the number of waiters from five to eight, and added a second runner to carry food from the kitchen. He hired a silver polisher after upgrading from stainless steel. His linen costs doubled, partly because he started using finer cloth and partly because diners who get up from their seats to use the telephone, or to go to the restroom, return to find a new folded napkin at their places. Mr. Brennan hired an extra manager simply to oversee service. "Actually, I think service is a little more important than the food," he said.
The changes cost money. The number of employees rose from 25, when the restaurant opened, to 75 now. Over five years, Mr. Brennan raised prices about 25 percent.
Before Bayard's, a new restaurant on Hanover Square in Manhattan, opened its doors last month, it put the staff through a week of lectures and workshops organized by Eric Weiss, the president of Service Arts, which has worked with about 80 New York restaurants in the last six years.
In addition to hearing notables like Gray Kunz, the former chef at Lespinasse, and Karen Waltuck, an owner of Chanterelle, talk about the subject, staff members at Bayard's went through role-playing exercises. They learned that waiters who are asked where the bathrooms are must walk the customer at least halfway there, instead of pointing. Because many diners are unfamiliar with the Wall Street area, staff members carry a map with instructions on how to get to the restaurant by car, train or subway. The first-floor and second-floor hostesses must know the menu inside out, so that they can field questions about ingredients from callers or potential diners who stop in off the street.
Restaurant Associates, when training the staffs for Cafe Centro, Tropica and its other restaurants, schools them in a 10-part regimen called "Steps of Service." It begins with "First Approach" ("Greet guests with a smile, within two minutes of table being seated") and takes the servers through the entire meal in great detail. "Check Presentation" is divided into three parts.
Technique is only half the battle, and one of the main differences between the old style of service and the new is a characteristically American inclination to put practice ahead of theory. "To break up a conversation simply to be technically correct in serving from the left makes no sense," Mr. Brennan said. "We will bend that rule in the interest of unobtrusive service. We'll serve incorrectly rather than put an elbow in someone's face or intrude on someone's personal space."
In any case, technique is only half the battle. The art of waiting tables rests on intangibles. "The real difference between good service and great service is the ability to read the table," Mr. Weiss said. "You don't treat every table the same. You have to be sensitive to body language, to the things that people say, and serve them accordingly."
A good waiter can sense when diners want to be let alone and when they want attention. He or she can usually tell who is in a hurry and who wants to linger. An even better waiter can draw subtler inferences. Take the diner who asks for "a dry white wine." One who asks for a medium-bodied white wine needs a different response from one who wants to know whether a sauvignon blanc has an assertively grassy character.
A waiter at the top of his game, in Mr. Weiss's view, achieves near-psychoanalytic powers of analysis and receptivity. At any rate, Mr. Weiss spends a lot of time telling his workshop students that many diners they encounter will not be in the restaurant to eat at all, when you look deeply enough. "Many people are at a restaurant because they want recognition, attention or simply to belong to something," he said.
The demanding customer is often sending out a cry for help, in other words. It's not about the underdone fillet, which clearly isn't underdone at all. The perceptive server knows this and takes the appropriate therapeutic measures. The steak goes straight back to the kitchen, no questions asked, and the diner is soothed with apologies and cosseted.
Or not. Last November, when Richard Fischbein led a posse of his fellow lawyers and paralegals from the firm of Fischbein Badillo & Harding into Angelo & Maxie's, a Manhattan steakhouse, he simmered in silence at service that he later called "a disaster." Then he erupted, refusing to pay the mandatory 18 percent service charge levied on large parties.
Angelo & Maxie's, in a move straight out of the old school, detained Mr. Fischbein and summoned the police. The mess was sorted out before both sides got to court, but not before Mr. Fischbein became an instant culture hero.
In the city that invented service with a snarl, there may be a little work still left undone.
 
How Are You Being Served?
 
WHAT is good service? Many diners say they know it when they see it or feel it, but the rules are in flux. Although the new American service continues to evolve, it has its hallmarks -- things a restaurant will do to make customers feel comfortable and welcome. Here is a checklist of some things to look for, provided by restaurateurs and consultants who specialize in service.
Many diners think of service as a product delivered by the waiter. They're wrong. "It's everything that happens to you other than the calories that go into your body," said Karen MacNeil, a consultant. "It begins when you phone to make a reservation."
* Does the reservationist ask if you would mind holding, instead of cutting you off with a quick "Please hold"? Is there an apology when the reservationist gets back on the line? Is there some expression of regret if the restaurant does not have the desired opening?
* When you enter the restaurant, does the person at the reservation book look up and greet you? "The first thing I notice is whether the host seems perplexed by my name," Ms. MacNeil said. "There is no reason for anyone to stare for five minutes at the book. I mean, how many reservations can there be at 8 o'clock? Half a dozen? Part of the job is to memorize the book."
* How does the hostess escort you to the table? If you have to race to keep up, something's wrong. She should walk slightly ahead and slightly turned toward you. A waiter should establish contact almost immediately, diners should be presented with the menus hand to hand, and menus should be open.
* When taking drink orders, the waiter should read the table to determine what kind of interaction diners want and how quickly they want the meal to progress.
* In taking food orders, the waiter should describe, rather than recite, the specials and encourage questions about specials and menu items. In taking the wine order, the waiter should gauge the level of wine sophistication at the table, describe the wines accordingly and suggest pairings of wine and food.
* When serving and clearing, the servers should violate the protocol of serving from the left and clearing from the right if that is more unintrusive. When a problem arises, the waiter should apologize and correct it, without making excuses, challenging the diner or taking a defensive tone. WILLIAM GRIMES

HEADLINE: Home Sales Up by 10.4%, Setting Record During 1998

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Sales of new homes surged to a record last year, fueled by job gains, rising consumer confidence and low interest rates that should carry the economy well into a ninth year of expansion.
Sales totaled 888,000 in 1998, up 10.4 percent from a year earlier and well above the previous high of 819,000 set in 1977, Commerce Department figures showed. In December, new single-family homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 978,000 units, the second-highest monthly pace ever, eclipsed only by November's record of 1.015 million homes. The figure was down 3.6 percent in December. 
 In another report, the index of leading economic indicators, intended to project the economy's performance six months out, rose for a third consecutive month in December, the Conference Board said. December's gain of three-tenths of a percent followed increases of half a percent in November and one-tenth of a percent in October.
"If you look at the pillars of this economy, there's really nothing stopping it," Tim O'Neill, the chief economist for Harris Bank and Bank of Montreal in Toronto, said, referring to consumer and business spending, manufacturing and housing.
Sales of all homes, existing and new, rose 13 percent in 1998, to 5.673 million units, a third consecutive annual record, government and industry figures show. Thirty-year mortgage rates below 7 percent contributed to the strength, as did the addition of 2.9 million jobs in 1998 that helped push the unemployment rate to a 28-year low of 4.3 percent.
The figures were released as the Federal Reserve started a two-day policy meeting. With an economy this strong, the Federal Reserve policy makers are not likely to cut interest rates. A survey of 30 primary dealers in Treasury securities found that all expected the Fed's Open Market Committee to leave the overnight bank lending rate target unchanged at 4.75 percent.

HEADLINE: Editorial Observer;
Is That a Bubble, or Is the Outlook Fabulous?

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Bubble talk is back.
From Davos, where Microsoft's Bill Gates was expressing bewilderment as to why people would pay so much for Internet stocks, to Washington, where Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, questioned overall stock prices but said some Internet companies might be good investments even at current prices, people are talking about investment bubbles that might burst. 
 "Bubble" is a pejorative term for an investment whose price rises and rises, and then collapses. It is widely agreed that just such a thing happened to Japanese stock and real estate prices in the late 1980's, and that Japan has yet to recover.
Unfortunately, talking about bubbles is easier than spotting a real one, and it is even more difficult to know when one will burst.
Charles P. Kindleberger, the economist and author of "Manias, Panics and Crashes," the definitive academic study of such things, thought he saw a bubble in this country's stock market a few years back. "I agreed with Greenspan in 1996 when he talked about irrational exuberance, and the stock market is up 50 percent since then," said Mr. Kindleberger, now retired from M.I.T. "I'm still looking to see what would come up suddenly to keep the lemmings from running. Where is the cliff they will run over?"
Bubble talk now tends to deal with two related but separate phenomena. Has the overall level of American stock prices gotten away from economic reality? Is it possible that Internet companies will someday earn enough to justify the lofty peaks their stocks reached last month?
Some dismiss all such talk as nonsense. Markets are rational, they say, so bubbles cannot exist. Even the Dutch tulip-bulb boom now has academics who argue it was rational.
That argument, however, does not give sufficient weight to the role of psychology in investing. "There is nothing," Mr. Kindleberger has written, "so disturbing to one's well-being and judgment as to see a friend get rich." In any period of speculative excess, those who urge caution are discredited well before the bubble bursts. Many thought Yahoo, the Internet company, was overpriced a year ago. Now it is about 10 times as high as it was then.
In 1720 Sir Isaac Newton, a very smart person, invested in the South Sea Company, whose dreams of profiting from exploration made it into a classic bubble. Realizing prices had gone crazy, he sold at a profit, explaining, "I can calculate the motions of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people." But prices kept rising, and Newton bought again, at the top. He suffered huge losses.
Peter L. Bernstein, an economic historian and consultant to money managers, is one who thinks that the Internet stocks are in a bubble, but that while the stock market as a whole is overvalued it is well short of one. What's the difference? "A bubble is totally out of touch with reality, where the greater-fool theory is the dominant driving force, where you are totally confident that somebody will be willing to pay higher prices no matter what you pay," he said.
Nonetheless, said Mr. Bernstein, the most remarkable thing about this period is "the really broad acceptance of the idea that nothing bad is going to happen to the U.S. economy. I don't remember people feeling this way even in the late 1960's." The economic expansion that ended in 1969 lasted almost nine years, the only one in American history longer than this one, which began in 1991.
Mr. Greenspan warned last year that the United States could not long remain an island of prosperity, but it has. When he voices concern about stock prices now, there is little market reaction, in contrast to 1996.
If there is a bubble, what will happen when it is pricked? The histories of Japan in the 1990's and the United States in the 1930's argue that bursting bubbles devastate economies.
But it does not have to be that way, particularly if the bubble is confined to the Internet stocks. Mr. Bernstein compared this boom to 1961, when investors flocked to space technology companies amid expectations that space would bring untold riches. Those stocks collapsed with the overall market in 1962, but no recession ensued and most stocks recovered.

HEADLINE: Toy Shipments Unexpectedly Flat for Year

BYLINE: By DANA CANEDY 

 BODY:
True, youngsters sent parents scurrying to the malls last year in search of Rugrats, Blue's Clues and Teletubbies. And who can forget the Furby frenzy?
But even with a strong economy and such must-have hits, the toy industry turned in flat results last year and is projecting only modest gains this year. 
 The mediocre performance for 1998 and cautious forecast for this year reflect the continuing effects of changing consumer trends on the overall toy business. And the shifts -- everything from consumers abandoning traditional toy stores to shop at mass merchandise outlets to the effects of technology on child's play -- are being felt throughout the industry.
For 1998, wholesale shipments of toys were essentially flat, declining by $41 million, to $15.2 billion, according to the trade group Toy Manufacturers of America, which released the figures yesterday in advance of the 96th annual American International Toy Fair, which begins in New York on Monday.
"That's a little worse than I would have expected," said Thomas Graves, an analyst who follows the industry for Standard & Poor's Equity Group.
Of course, it did not help that youngsters yawned last year at some previous hot sellers. Remember Tickle Me Elmo and virtual pets?
Such once wildly popular playthings contributed to a robust 7 percent increase in toy shipments to retailers in 1997. As a result, 1998 "was a pretty tough comparison year," Mr. Graves said.
In fact, the Toy Manufacturers of America initially estimated that the industry would grow by as much as 4 percent in 1998, but later revised its forecast to growth of 2 percent to 3 percent. The industry, with retail sales of about $22 billion, missed even that conservative growth target as strong categories like stuffed animals and toy cars and trucks were offset by slower sellers like action figures and dolls.
Beyond that, the nation's largest toy retailer -- Toys "R" Us -- lost its footing last year, which caused manufacturers to stumble.
Toys "R" Us had a disastrous year, having reporting several quarters of disappointing earnings heading into the all important holiday selling season. For the first nine months of last year, Toys "R" Us lost $442 million. Then, during the holiday season, which should have been its strongest period, Toys "R" Us said sales at its stores open at least a year declined by 7 percent.
The company, after watching shoppers increasingly bypass its parking lots on their way to discount chains like Wal-Mart Stores and Kmart, has been drastically paring its inventory to cut costs and to clear its shelves for new toys it hopes will lure customers back. In doing so, however, Toys "R" Us slashed orders to manufacturers, which were unable to make up the volume elsewhere.
Indeed, Mattel Inc., the world's largest toy maker, said reduced orders for its Barbies, Power Wheels and other toys contributed greatly to its poor performance for the fourth quarter and year. Jill E. Barad, Mattel's chairman and chief executive, said in announcing the company's results yesterday that "unexpected cutbacks by retailers and our further adjustment to a just-in-time shipping pattern negatively impacted our results."
For the fourth quarter, Mattel's net income tumbled 69 percent, to $59.5 million, or 20 cents a diluted share, from $195.1 million, or 64 cents, the company said. Mattel also said it took two charges -- one for $27 million related to a recall of Power Wheels and the other $4 million to settle a lawsuit. Revenues declined to $1.54 billion from $1.61 billion.
For the year, the company earned $332.3 million, or $1.10 a diluted share, compared with $285 million, or 93 cents a diluted share, a year earlier. Revenues fell to $4.78 billion from $4.83 billion.
Despite the bad results, Mattel's stock rose 31.25 cents, to $25.375.
Investors, who had been warned to expect poor results, seem to be satisfied that retailers now have lean inventories and will soon increase orders from the larger manufacturers.
What is more, with its recent acquisition of the Learning Company, a leading software maker, Mattel is likely to benefit from a trend that is challenging many of its competitors -- how to appeal to children who are abandoning traditional toys for the Internet.
"The Internet impacts the toy industry in a number of significant ways," said Peter Eio, chairman of the Toy Manufacturers, who estimated that the toy industry would grow by 2 to 3 percent this year. "First and foremost, it occupies an increasing amount of children's time, and therefore, to a certain extent, displaces time that might otherwise be devoted to play."
To capitalize on the trend, the industry must meet consumers' increasing demand for entertaining and educational interactive play," Mr. Eio said, adding that "the real winners will be those companies who combine new technology with tried and trusted brands."

HEADLINE: The New Surplus Era

 BODY:
Of all the initiatives in President Clinton's proposed budget this week, the most politically significant may turn out to be a simple forecast. The United States, the Administration says, is on the threshold of an era of budget surpluses, nearly $4.5 trillion in the next 15 years. Far from calling for a major redirection of government, Mr. Clinton wants to set aside a mere 11 percent of the surpluses for new spending. Three-quarters would be used to shore up Medicare and Social Security. Embattled by impeachment but enjoying the highest approval ratings of his Presidency, Mr. Clinton has sketched a vision striking for its essential conservatism.
The approach is also sensible and farsighted. Social Security and Medicare face future deficits unless significant changes are made. Instead of proposing bold new programs to serve as his legacy, Mr. Clinton is calling for a major investment in the two programs that are the greatest legacies of the New Deal and the Great Society. Republicans have seized on the dozens of smaller spending and tax-break initiatives to paint Mr. Clinton as an old-style apostle of big government. But under the President's budget plan, overall spending is projected to shrink to 19.4 percent of the nation's economy, the smallest proportion in 25 years. The dreaded label of liberal does not fit. 
 The budget has clearly thrown Republicans onto the defensive. Every poll shows that Americans would rather preserve Social Security and Medicare than enjoy a big new tax cut, as Republican leaders want. It is also questionable how much political support there will be for a tax cut that disproportionately benefits the wealthiest Americans. On the other hand, Republicans are right to note that both Social Security and Medicare will need additional fixes beyond the proposed infusion of surplus money.
The extra attraction of Mr. Clinton's approach is that most of the surpluses would actually go to paying down the publicly held Federal debt, a step widely supported by many Americans and endorsed last month by Alan Greenspan. As the Federal Reserve chairman also warned, the surpluses are only a projection. They may diminish if the economy turns sour or plans for spending cuts do not materialize.
Policy makers in Washington are finding it hard to cope with the new political reality of surpluses. Only two years ago, every new proposal for spending increases or tax cuts was challenged as a threat to fiscal balance. Now the familiar budget debates can take place in a context of at least some extra money becoming available. The surpluses make it possible, at least theoretically, for Congress and the President to agree eventually to some kind of combination of tax cuts, money for Social Security and Medicare, spending increases and paying down of the debt. These issues are taking on greater immediacy as the Senate seems to be moving toward winding up the impeachment trial by the end of next week.

HEADLINE: Gephardt to Set His Sights on Speakership, Not Presidency

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri plans to take himself out of the running for President on Wednesday and devote himself full time to recapturing the House for Democrats in 2000 with the expectation that he will become Speaker.
Friends said Mr. Gephardt had recognized two strong political perceptions: that Vice President Al Gore had already laid a formidable claim to the Democratic Presidential nomination and that House Republicans were vulnerable to a takeover because their impeachment of President Clinton is so unpopular with the public. 
 An associate said Mr. Gephardt did not have the fire in the belly to run for President.
"It's not in his gut," this confidant said, adding that Mr. Gephardt was more drawn by the fight for the House. "We're tantalizingly close. He cares about the House, and he cares about the party."
Mr. Gephardt's departure from the field may entice at least one other Democrat, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, into the race. So far, only former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey has announced his challenge to Mr. Gore for the nomination. Two other Senators, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, have backed off.
Mr. Gephardt began telling his Democratic colleagues privately today of his decision, which he is to announce on Wednesday. Friends described him as wistful about forgoing a run for President but confident that he was making the right decision because of Democrats' success in the 1998 elections, when analysts' predictions of a dozen-seat loss turned into a five-seat gain. The party needs a net gain of six seats in 2000 to regain control of the House.
Colleagues said Mr. Gephardt's staying to oversee the House drive would be crucial to that effort, since he is one of the few House Democrats who has a national fund-raising base and who is familiar with almost every district.
"He's the one who delivers our message the best," said Representative Martin Frost, Democrat of Texas and the caucus chairman. "He's a good fund-raiser and a unifying force for the Democratic caucus. This is the best possible scenario for us for retaking the House."
Terry McAuliffe, a top Democratic fund-raiser who is close to both Mr. Gephardt and Mr. Gore, said of Mr. Gephardt's decision: "They are very close to getting the House back, and Dick is the guy to lead that. And he wants the party to be unified. A divisive primary would not be unity."
Recent polls suggest that the public is fed up with Republicans in Congress because it sees them as dragging out the impeachment process. Democrats are identifying Republicans whose pro-impeachment votes are seen as hurting them, and Democratic Party officials say impeachment has prompted bigger financial contributions and earlier interest from potential candidates.
The picture is cloudier for Democrats on the Presidential front. A national poll released on Monday by the Los Angeles Times showed Mr. Gore losing to two Republicans: Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, by 18 points, and Elizabeth Dole, former president of the American Red Cross, by 8 points.
One Democratic analyst said these numbers suggested that Mr. Gore was vulnerable, not that no Democratic candidate could win. Still, Mr. Gore's clear-cut advantages as Vice President in delivering Federal largesse and organizing the party apparatus to his liking have discouraged potential rivals.
The most recent polls show Mr. Gore way ahead of other Democrats. Last weekend's Marist College poll, for example, shows 44 percent of Democrats favoring Mr. Gore, 16 percent for Mr. Bradley and 11 percent for the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has not announced whether he is running. Mr. Gephardt had 7 percent and Mr. Kerry 3 percent.
Mr. Gephardt's supporters said he was fully prepared to challenge Mr. Gore and had built up a national network since his failed Presidential bid in 1988. But others suggested that it might have been hard for Mr. Gephardt to give voice to a positive message that was distinctive enough from Mr. Gore's to capture a national following. Mr. Gephardt's history as an economic populist and strong backer of labor might have cast him as a naysayer at a time when Mr. Gore could boast of a booming economy.
Mr. Gephardt's supporters said he had invested himself so much in the House that his decision was essentially made for him when the Democrats made such a strong comeback in November. Mr. Gephardt's stock rose in the House at the same time, and as he evolved into the role of Mr. Clinton's chief defender, he and Mr. Gore found themselves working toward a common goal that has left the Democrats uncharacteristically united.
Erik Smith, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said the party's prospects for recapturing the House appeared so strong that more potential candidates were expressing an interest in running for Congress than the Democrats had experienced since they lost the House in 1994.
"People don't want to give up a ranking position in a state legislature or a mayorship if they're going to be in the minority," Mr. Smith said. "We're seeing a lot of interest."

HEADLINE: White House Externs;
Two Turns of the Revolving Door

BYLINE: By LAURA M. HOLSON 

 BODY:
It is barely 8 in the morning, and Rahm I. Emanuel, until recently a top adviser to President Clinton, is already in high gear, barking at waiters and looking over his shoulder to inspect others having breakfast at the Royalton Hotel in midtown Manhattan.
"Don't be chintzy with the berries," he warns a waiter walking toward the kitchen to pick up his bowl of granola. Later, Mr. Emanuel groans when asked what five words best describe him. "Oh, please," he said, "I can't handle this much therapy in the morning." 
 In some ways, Mr. Emanuel acts as if he were still in the White House. (He mentions more than once how often he still talks with Mr. Clinton.) But Mr. Emanuel is now in a world outside Washington, one where egos, energy and politics are certainly as prominent, but where they are aimed at a different goal: making money. Last month, he joined the boutique investment banking firm Wasserstein Perella & Company to seek his fortune as a merchant banker and corporate financier in his hometown, Chicago.
For many decades, Washington insiders have been trading in their powerful contacts and considerable back-room negotiating skills for lucrative jobs on Wall Street. Mr. Clinton's team has been no different.
The departure of Mr. Emanuel last fall came at roughly the same time as that of an even bigger White House heavyweight, Erskine B. Bowles. And Mr. Bowles, a confidant of Mr. Clinton who served most recently as White House chief of staff, has just joined the New York buyout firm Forstmann Little & Company as a general partner.
The two Clinton allies are a study in contrasts, and they bring to Wall Street different strengths and personalities.
Mr. Bowles, 53, was already a wealthy and seasoned banker before going to Washington in 1993 to head the Small Business Administration. He had founded an investment bank in North Carolina that specializes in advising midsize companies. The transition to Forstmann Little, Wall Street executives say, should be easy.
Patience has never been his strong suit, Mr. Bowles said. But he is reserved, adept at melding differing viewpoints and, in keeping with his Southern roots, is courteous.
Mr. Emanuel, 39, is a corporate novice. A creature of politics, he is tireless yet brusque. Stories about antics during his younger years abound. He once delivered a rotting fish to a pollster who displeased him. And at a restaurant in Little Rock, Ark., soon after Mr. Clinton was first elected President, Mr. Emanuel, ticking off a list of what he thought were disloyal Democrats and other political enemies, stabbed the table with his knife and screamed, "Dead!" after each name. Mr. Emanuel does not deny that either incident took place, but he declines to discuss them.
Investment bankers, of course, are hardly shrinking violets. Yet rarely are they so theatrical -- at least not in public. Still, if anyone understands how to leverage a strong personality it is Bruce Wasserstein, the takeover strategist and chairman of Wasserstein Perella, who hired Mr. Emanuel after a literary agent suggested that the two men meet.
Mr. Emanuel said he called Mr. Wasserstein after talking to several large investment banks that wanted him to pick a specialty -- asset management or corporate finance -- and move to New York. Mr. Emanuel resisted. "I didn't have a sense that three months later they'd care," he said.
Mr. Emanuel is compact and wiry -- he started taking ballet lessons when he was 15 -- and is a 1981 graduate of Sarah Lawrence College, where he studied philosophy. He received a master's degree in speech and communications from Northwestern University in 1985, and has no formal background in finance.
After graduating, he worked on several election campaigns, taking time out in 1991 to volunteer at an Israeli Army supply base during the Persian Gulf war. That same year, Mr. Emanuel headed to Little Rock to raise money for Mr. Clinton's Presidential bid. After the election, he joined the White House as political director. He soon made powerful friends -- and enemies -- in the media as he championed Mr. Clinton's agenda on the talk show circuit.
Mr. Emanuel shudders at the thought that deal making is any different in Washington than in the corporate suite. He cited his involvement in helping to shuttle the North American Free Trade Agreement, the assault weapons ban and the balanced budget amendment through Congress.
"You ever try to get a Congressman to do what you want?" Mr. Emanuel asked. "I don't think the skill set is so different."
Good negotiating skills alone, however, do not necessarily guarantee a long and happy business career. Some former Washington insiders, like David A. Stockman, the former Reagan Administration budget director who is now a banker at the New York-based Blackstone Group, a buyout firm, mastered the transition and prospered.
For others, Wall Street is just a temporary stomping ground. Richard C. Holbrooke, who joined Credit Suisse First Boston as vice chairman in 1996, is now waiting for his nomination as the chief United States delegate to the United Nations to be sent to the Senate. (His appointment was held up by allegations that he violated Federal lobbying laws; he has agreed to settle the civil charges without admitting wrongdoing, Government officials said yesterday.) Credit Suisse is the second tour of duty on Wall Street for Mr. Holbrooke, the architect of the 1995 peace accord that ended the war in Bosnia. He was a managing director for Lehman Brothers from 1984 to 1993.
The sharpest blow for former Washington insiders is often a loss of prestige. "If you are powerful in government, people come to you," said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, who was an aide to former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and was Assistant Secretary of State for Economic and Business Affairs during the Reagan Administration. "Government contacts have a short shelf life. You have to nurture the old relationships and build the new."
And just knowing important people is not enough to merit applause on Wall Street.
"Closing a deal is everything," said Samuel Hayes, a finance professor at the Harvard Business School. "If you can close a deal you are great. If not, you are nothing."
Those who know Mr. Emanuel say he is a creative thinker and extremely loyal, with a keen ability to cut through any bureaucratic tangle. It was those qualities that swayed Mr. Wasserstein.
"To me, you take someone with a lot of intelligence, energy and integrity, and that's attractive to us," Mr. Wasserstein said. "I'm confident in my ability to teach people the technical parts of this business."
Besides, he noted, Mr. Emanuel learned a lesson in humility when he was replaced as White House political director in 1993 after his abrasiveness offended too many people. He was forced to move to the communications department, but he worked his way back into Mr. Clinton's graces and an office next to the President. "He fought, came back and learned to do it right," Mr. Wasserstein said. "I liked that tenacity, to see the iron hardened into steel."
Mr. Emanuel is not worried about his lack of experience in finance. He has been in his job only a month, but has been shuttling between New York and Chicago, meeting with chief executives and business leaders he encountered during his tenure at the White House as well as through personal contacts. He will be responsible in part for developing an investment banking practice in Chicago -- where he and his wife, Amy, and their two children live -- that will include advising companies on mergers and strategic planning.
Mr. Bowles, on the other hand, is an old pro at banking, having begun his career in 1969 at Morgan Stanley. In 1972, he moved to Charlotte, N.C., where he later started his own investment banking firm, Bowles Hollowell Conner & Company. There, he specialized in advising midsize firms on mergers and acquisitions.
Nearly 20 years ago, his firm arranged the sale of Kincaid Furniture, the first company acquired by Forstmann Little, which buys troubled companies, shores them up and then sells them. Since then, Bowles Hollowell has done 25 transactions with Forstmann. Mr. Bowles sold his share in the partnership when he moved to Washington in 1993.
"I like the marketing of a company and closing the transaction," he said. "And I like the money I make."
A graduate of the University of North Carolina with an M.B.A. from Columbia University's Graduate School of Business, Mr. Bowles will bring to Forstmann the same kind of organizational skills he used at the White House. Part of his charge is making sure that the buyout firm's in-house operations and investment evaluation process are more efficient, said Theodore J. Forstmann, the firm's chairman. "Plus, he will be helpful in our new-business effort," Mr. Forstmann said.
Mr. Bowles will also continue to be involved with Carousel Capital, the Charlotte-based merchant bank he helped start in 1996. Forstmann Little is investing $50 million in Carousel, Mr. Bowles said, but the two companies are not likely to compete because Carousel does not do transactions of more than $150 million and Forstmann rarely does a deal that small.
Mr. Bowles acknowledges that he, unlike Mr. Emanuel, never envisioned a life in politics. "People ask me all the time, why aren't you more political?" Mr. Bowles said. "I saw my career in politics as public service." In fact, he didn't know Mr. Clinton until 1992, when they were introduced by a mutual friend who asked Mr. Bowles to hold a fund-raiser in Charlotte for the candidate.
The two became fast friends, taking to golf outings and late-night telephone chats. In 1993, Mr. Clinton asked Mr. Bowles to be director of the Small Business Administration and then, in 1994, to work as deputy White House chief of staff.
After that stint, he returned to North Carolina to be with his wife, Crandall Close Bowles, who, as chief executive of the textile maker Spring Industries, is a powerful executive in her own right. He returned to Washington in 1996, when Mr. Clinton asked him to be chief of staff -- a job he accepted for $1 a year.
Mr. Bowles does not shy away from discussing Mr. Clinton's troubles, although it is clear by the way his relaxed mood turns frosty that he is tired of talking about it. "What he had was a relationship with Monica Lewinsky that was flat wrong," he said.
Mr. Bowles would rather talk about something he accomplished years before he joined the Clinton White House. What best defines him, he said, was finishing the Marine Corps marathon in 1982. "I wanted to prove to myself I could do it," he said.
When asked about their experience together in the White House, Mr. Bowles and Mr. Emanuel positively gush. "Did you tell him I said he had a soft side?" Mr. Bowles asked days after a reporter's breakfast meeting with Mr. Emanuel at the Royalton.
"I love that man," is what Mr. Emanuel said at the breakfast meeting. "Erskine is going to kill me for telling you this. We used to have a 7:30 A.M. meeting and Erskine would sit at one end of the conference table in his office and I would sit at the other. Every now and then, when things got a little tense, I would walk over and give him a little kiss on the forehead." He pointed to a space above his right eyebrow and laughed. "I promised him I'd never do that at the country club in Charlotte."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Brazil NamesA Soros Ally To Head Bank

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Ravaged by a deepening economic crisis, Brazil replaced its central bank president today for the second time in three weeks and surprised the financial markets with the choice: a disciple of George Soros, the billionaire speculator.
The appointment of Arminio Fraga Neto, who had managed one of Mr. Soros's biggest investment funds, coincided with urgent consultations between Brazilian finance officials and the International Monetary Fund on ways to combat the crisis dragging down Latin America's biggest economy. 
 Government leaders are hoping that the talks with an I.M.F. delegation led by Stanley Fischer, the fund's deputy managing director, will accelerate delivery of a second $9 billion installment of a $41.5 billion loan pledged to Brazil.
But the timing of the central bank shuffle also seemed to reflect the Government's desperation for solutions and left it open to opposition assertions that the I.M.F. had played a role.
Mr. Soros's investment decisions have moved markets and, some contend, played a role in the currency volatility that first dragged down the economies of Southeast Asia 19 months ago.
But the choice of Mr. Fraga to replace Francisco Lopes, who had been confirmed as central bank president only a week ago, drew praise from investors and economists. These people said he would provide practical experience and knowledge of how international investors operated.
The Brazilian currency, the real, rose for the second day, partly reversing a plunge that began on Jan. 13, when the Government allowed the currency, then valued at 1.21 to the dollar, to trade freely in the foreign-exchange markets. The real settled today at 1.80 to the dollar, down from 1.91 late Monday. The benchmark stock index fell 1.8 percent.
In the last month, Brazil has been hit full force by the economic turbulence that earlier shattered economies in Asia and Russia. The crisis exploded here after Itamar Franco, a former president and now governor of Minas Gerais state, declared a moratorium on his big state's debt to the national Government, fueling fears the country could not meet its debts.
The instability in Brazil is slowing economies through Latin America, a region that buys 20 percent of all United States exports. Brazil is also the home of more than $36 billion in accumulated direct foreign investment, much of it by American companies like Ford, General Motors, Whirlpool, Citigroup and Caterpillar.
The appointment of Mr. Fraga appeared to strengthen Finance Minister Pedro Malan, rumored to have been on his way out. In a television interview today, Mr. Malan said he and Mr. Lopes had offered their resignations to President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, but that only Mr. Lopes's was accepted.
"Fraga is the man of the hour to restore the confidence of investors because he's one of them," said David Fleischer, publisher of a Brasilia-based newsletter.
Paulo Ferraz of Banco Bozano Simonsen said Mr. Fraga's appointment was "a confirmation of the Government's willingness to go by the book."
With confidence in the Government at a low, however, many warned that credibility for the new central bank president would not come automatically. Paulo Rabello de Castro, a political consultant here, said Mr. Fraga must announce his stand on exchange- and interest-rate policies, as well as debt management "to build up this credibility."
An I.M.F. negotiating team has been discussing a range of issues with Brazilian officials, including the financial standing of Brazilian states, new rules for Government intervention in currency markets and new targets for inflation and interest rates. The fund has supported high rates, now at 39 percent, to control inflation and draw capital to Brazil, despite a recession that many economists expect will be severe.
Opposition leaders criticized the nomination. "Brazil has just delivered the central bank to one of the biggest speculators in the world," said Jose Dirceu, leader of the Workers Party, a leftist group.
Governor Franco, who has become Mr. Cardoso's adversary, was equally caustic. "Brazil has a new finance minister -- Fischer -- and a new central bank president -- Soros," he told a local news agency. "Now it will be much easier to renegotiate our foreign debt. The only thing left to do is perfect our English."
But a spokesman for Mr. Soros denied rumors that the financier had a role in the appointment. "It was as much of a surprise to Mr. Soros and Soros Fund Management as it was to the market," said Shawn Pattison, the spokesman.
A graduate of Princeton University, Mr. Fraga, 41, has been a manager of the Quantum Emerging Growth Fund since 1993, considered a top performer in its class. Before that, as chief of international operations for the Brazilian central bank, he negotiated with foreign banks to restructure Brazil's debt.
"He worked very effectively to bring Brazil back into contact with the international markets," Mr. Fleischer said.

HEADLINE: Car Makers Get Strong Start To 1999 Sales

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., Feb. 2

 BODY:
Ford, DaimlerChrysler, Toyota and other auto makers sold new family vehicles at a blistering pace in January, a sign that the American economy's torrid growth in the fourth quarter is carrying over into the new year.
With gasoline prices continuing to fall, sales of gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans soared in January, rising 19 percent at DaimlerChrysler A.G. from a year earlier, 20 percent at the Ford Motor Company and 32 percent at the Toyota Motor Corporation. But car sales were also brisk after months of weakness, with DaimlerChrysler and Toyota reporting large increases while Ford's car sales dropped only because of a reduction in unprofitable car sales to rental agencies. 
 Auto executives were pleased with the year's strong start. "The sales momentum that closed out 1998 carried over into January," said Robert L. Rewey, Ford's group vice president for marketing, sales and service, who attributed the robust sales to "innovative products and features, low interest rates and fuel prices, and growth in jobs and wages."
Ford could face some temporary difficulties in making enough cars and trucks to keep up with demand, following one of the worst industrial accidents in the auto industry's history. A fatal fire and explosion on Monday shut down production at the company's largest factory complex, which supplies parts to most of Ford's assembly plants in North America.
Nicholas Lobaccaro, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said that the continued rise in sport utility vehicle sales would help the industry's profits, while Ford's ability to reduce sales to rental car agencies was also good news. "You had a huge improvement in mix" of vehicles sold, Mr. Lobaccaro said.
George Pipas, a market analyst at Ford, said that car sales to rental agencies fell more than 30 percent last month while retail car sales rose 1 percent. That produced an overall drop in car sales of 9 percent last month; January is traditionally a big month for rental car sales, as the rental agencies start preparing for the summer season while family buyers stay home. Rental agency sales are seldom profitable because the agencies mainly buy vehicles that are in excess supply and available at deep discounts.
DaimlerChrysler's 18 percent jump in sales of Dodge, Plymouth and Chrysler cars reflected brisk sales of its new large cars, notably the Dodge Intrepid and Chrysler 300M, which were not yet widely available last year. But sales fell for smaller cars like the Dodge Neon, Dodge Stratus and Chrysler Cirrus.
Daimler-Benz A.G. and the Chrysler Corporation merged last November but continue to report their sales separately in the United States. Mercedes-Benz announced today that its car sales rose 6 percent while its sport utility vehicle sales were flat because its factory in Tuscaloosa, Ala., has been operating at full capacity for more than a year.
Volkswagen A.G. reported a 45 percent increase in sales last month from a year earlier, the best January performance for the company since 1986. The New Beetle, a nostalgic tribute to the 1960's, remains popular while customers have also been snapping up Passat sedans.
The General Motors Corporation is not scheduled to report its January sales until Wednesday. But auto analysts predicted that when the final figures are tallied, the industry's sales will be running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of close to 16 million new vehicles. Sales rates over 15 million vehicles are considered strong and usually profitable.
Ford's overall sales of cars and light trucks were up 8 percent. Toyota's car sales climbed 25 percent and overall sales rose 27 percent. Even struggling Nissan managed an overall sales gain of 4 percent.
John Casesa, an auto analyst at Schroder & Company, said that the vigorous sales reflected consumers' affluence and optimism about the future. "They feel rich and they have the confidence to spend money," he said. "It's remarkable at this stage in the economic cycle."

Technology Stocks Decline As Investors Take Profits
Technology stocks, whose valuations have been pushed into the stratosphere in recent weeks, led equity markets lower as investors and traders decided to take some profits. The selloff was most pronounced among the shares of such marquee names as Microsoft, Intel and Cisco Systems.
 The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index suffered the biggest setback, slumping 46.67 points, or 1.86 percent, to 2,463.42. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 71.58 points, to 9,274.12, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 11.01 points, to 1,261.99. In the bond market, Treasury prices fell sharply as the yield on the 30-year issue rose to 5.24 percent from 5.18 percent. Page C12. 

Goodyear Said to Be in Japan Deal
Goodyear Tire and Rubber is expected to announce today that it has signed a deal with Sumitomo Rubber Industries that will effectively give Goodyear control of most of the debt-laden Japanese company's tire operations. C2.
 
Budget Plan Attacks Tax Shelters
Buried in the budget proposal sent to Congress by President Clinton are dozens of provisions, including a sweeping crackdown on the use of tax shelters, that could have a substantial effect on Wall Street, big industries like insurance and even particular companies. C11.
 
PBS Loses Case Against Ex-Monkee
The Public Broadcasting Service must pay nearly $47 million to Michael Nesmith, a member of the 1960's rock group The Monkees, and his defunct company for defrauding him in a home video deal, a jury decided. C4.
 
Two to Leave Long-Term Capital
Myron S. Scholes and William Krasker, two top partners at Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund in Greenwich, Conn., will leave the fund, which was rescued by lenders in September after $4 billion of losses. C6.
 
Results Flat for Toy Industry
Even with a strong economy and must-have hits like Rugrats, Teletubbies and Furbys, the toy industry turned in flat results last year and is projecting only modest gains this year. C2.
 
Home Sales Rose 10.4% in 1998
Sales of new homes surged 10.4 percent last year, to 888,000. And the Conference Board said the index of leading economic indicators, which is intended to project the economy's performance six months out, rose three-tenths of a percent in December. C2.
 
Southwest Expands Into New York
Discount carrier Southwest Airlines is starting a airfare war on the East Coast. It will begin flying to MacArthur Airport on Long Island next month with fares as little as half of the lowest comparable rate. In the last five years, as Southwest has expanded into Baltimore; Providence, R.I.; Manchester, N.H., and several cities in Florida, it has caused fares at those airports and nearby ones to decline sharply. It is expected to do the same in the New York area. A1.

An Unlikely Fear for Japan: Stiflingly High Interest Rates

BYLINE: By SHERYL WuDUNN 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 2

 BODY:
As Japan struggles to revive its economy, concern is growing that market pressure to lift interest rates could choke off a recovery just as it is beginning.
Government officials are saying that Japan's economy could rebound this summer, but it is around that time that some private economists are saying long-term rates could spike and drain the energy from an incipient revival. 
 Government bond yields, which reflect interest-rate trends, remain low by world standards. But they have more than tripled in day-to-day bond trading since October, from slightly more than seven-tenths of 1 percent. In Tokyo on Wednesday, the benchmark 10-year bond yield reached 2.44 percent, the strongest since June 1997.
Japan is stuck in its worst postwar recession and has been trying to emerge from economic stagnation for eight years, so the pessimists have tended to have prominence. But as Japanese officials voice their views on the economy -- starting with their forecast that it will grow by half a percent in 1999 -- it sometimes seems as though they and private analysts are talking about two different countries.
For starters, some economists worry that with the economy's future uncertain, politicians seem to be sinking into a feeling of complacency, now that they have enacted a huge-scale bank bailout and a $200 billion package of lending and spending to stimulate the economy.
"In Japan, crisis is inevitable because without action, there will be crisis and without crisis, there can be no action," said Andrew Smithers, a longtime analyst of Japan who runs his own economic advisory business. "It's amazing how big a crisis it has to be in Japan."
Even with the bailout and the stimulus packages in place, Japan faces an array of formidable challenges, from a recently strengthened currency -- which makes its exports expensive abroad -- to the need to work off the consequences of an investment boom that has left the economy with far more productive capacity than it can easily use.
If the stronger yen does not stifle growth, then a rise in long-term interest rates, making borrowing more expensive, could. Some economists are forecasting a significant rise in long-term rates, to 3 percent or 4 percent by the end of this year.
Though the Government is beginning to spend its way out of its economic troubles, that comes at a cost. Japan's budget deficit for the next fiscal year is likely to reach 10 percent of output. And as tax revenue falls, the nation's accumulated debt is poised to exceed the size of the entire economy.
By comparison, the annual deficit in the United States reached 6.3 percent of the gross domestic product in 1983, the highest since shortly after the end of World War II. Apart from the war, accumulated Government debt reached a peak in the mid-90's at roughly 70 percent of output.
One problem in Japan is that to finance the huge debt burden, along with the stimulus packages, the Government will have to embark on a large program to raise revenue, about 60 trillion yen, or $535 billion at current exchange rates, in the fiscal year beginning on April 1.
The Government has also acknowledged that it will no longer use the shadow budget, a rich coffer of public funds, to absorb some of the bonds it is offering, meaning that investors will have to buy the bonds on the market. Japanese savers are known for their extraordinarily deep pockets. Still, with other government entities and localities forced to issue debt as well, competition for bond investors could push up long-term interest rates.
The Government must also prepare for the repayment of more than 100 trillion yen -- now almost $900 billion -- in 10-year postal savings deposits that come due in 2000 and 2001.
"To me, this is an onrushing truck," said William D. Campbell, fixed-income strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities Asia, adding that Japanese officials "are terrified they'll be unable to meet the capital outflow from the maturing postal savings."
The amount is far larger than repayment demands in other years. Officials here expect most depositors to roll over much of their money, but even if one-fifth of the funds are withdrawn, the Government will have to turn over nearly $180 billion to pay back depositors.
Mr. Campbell and other analysts say that the trust fund bureau, which manages Tokyo's accounts, would probably have to sell a portion of its holdings in Government bonds. And these actions, they say, could throw the bond market into distress, similar to the rout that occurred late last year when the Finance Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, said that the shadow coffers would no longer absorb Government bonds.
The risk to the economy is that if rates rise significantly, this may choke off economic growth.
But Xinyi Lu, fixed-income strategist at Paribas Capital Markets here, suggested that adverse economic consequences could be avoided if higher rates turned out to be only a temporary spike. If rates rose much higher than 3 percent, he said, investors would probably push them back down by pouring money into higher-yielding instruments.
"The yield would rise and then it would come down," he said. "There will be a shock, but it's not like they will keep rising. They will come down."
Government officials also play down the risks of a big oversupply of bonds. They argue that most Japanese investors do not like risk and will probably roll over their postal savings deposits.
Investors who parked money overseas, they say, were hurt as the yen strengthened, cutting into their returns. To avoid foreign-exchange risks, they should keep more money at home, in safe Government bonds.
Finally, they say, interest rates at 3 to 4 percent may not be so worrisome -- especially if the economy is growing.

HEADLINE: Nassau G.O.P. Sees Failed Deal On Insurance Become a Peril

BYLINE: By CHARLIE LeDUFF 

DATELINE: GARDEN CITY, N.Y., Feb. 2

 BODY:
From the outset the deal seemed like one of those win-win-win situations that politicians love. Nassau County would save millions in health care costs; a company whose officials were friendly with and supported Republican politicians would get the nearly half-billion-dollar contract, and some well-connected businessmen would profit, too.
Now that dream deal has morphed into a financial nightmare. The county comptroller has found that cost overruns in the health plan exceed $34 million and may reach $50 million by the time all claims are counted. 
 Although those figures are only a fraction of the county's $2 billion annual budget, the financial troubles of the health care plan seem likely to create further headaches in the months to come, possibly jeopardizing its bond rating and complicating negotiations with the New York Islanders over a new hockey arena.
But in the minds of some politicians, there may be a longer lasting consequence. Patronage and insider deals have long been a fixture of Nassau County politics, where Republicans outnumber Democrats 2 to 1. But few of the earlier scandals approach the magnitude of the health plan deal, leading even some Republicans to worry that this time voters may become fed up with the scratch-my-back approach in government.
"It's a disaster," said a ranking Long Island Republican who spoke on condition of anonymity. "Between what's happening in Washington, and the Suffolk County chairman under indictment and now the insurance scandal in Nassau, Long Island Republicans are heading for a meltdown in the 1999 local elections.
"Politicians are viewed as a step below used-car salesman as it stands," he continued. "And now the Republicans have left the door wide open for the Democrats."
Even though a booming stock market and a strong economy have created huge surpluses for governments elsewhere, Nassau County, one of the richest in the United States, with a tax base of more than $95 billion, is running a deficit. Two bond rating agencies are threatening to lower the county's bonds because of years of short-term borrowing and the use of "one shot" revenues like county land sales to balance the county's ledger.
The situation is so bad, said Legislator Lisanne G. Altmann, a Democrat from Great Neck, that the Nassau Legislature is considering asking the State Comptroller to administer the budget or perhaps take the extraordinary step of handing the county's fiscal reins to a control board, like the one that ran New York City's finances for several years in the 1970's.
"No one is taking glee in this whole thing, but it is a chance for the Democrats" to take control away from the Republicans, Ms. Altmann said. "The county is broke. Money has evaporated into someone's pockets."
According to testimony given to the Legislature, documents and officials close to the negotiations, here is how the health care deal happened.
The county decided it could save money if it dropped the health care provider for its 26,000 employees and retirees, which it had been paying $120 million a year in a lump sum, and instead insured the workers out of its own pocket. A Suffolk County company, Benefit Plan Administrators Inc., won the contract in September 1997 to manage the system based on its guarantee that it would save the county $15 million over a 39-month period ending Dec. 31, 2000.
The main architect of the switch was the deputy county executive, Robert J. McDonald, a Republican who headed the commission that recommended the changeover in 1997. Mr. McDonald, who retired from the county government shortly after the deal was signed, has acknowledged in testimony to the Legislature's Rules Committee that he had received $12,500 a month in consulting fees from William M. Blake, Suffolk County's former Republican Party chairman, whose insurance agency underwrote the deal.
Moreover, Albert E. Isernio, then the chairman of Benefit Plan Administrators, has testified that his company paid Mr. Blake a commission of $50,000 a month. Mr. Blake's commission was eventually rolled into a $100,000-a-month consulting fee to DJB Associates, a company run by Mr. Blake's son, David.
County officials could not say this week how much money the men had been paid since the deal was arranged or whether they were still receiving their consulting fees. But the officials said they would ask those questions and many others of Mr. Blake when he testifies on Wednesday in front of a special session of the Legislature.
Another party to the deal was Louis V. Tempera, a former Suffolk County labor commissioner who was convicted of perjury in 1982 for lying to a grand jury when he denied receiving more than $100,000 in kickbacks from companies that had contracts with his department. Mr. Tempera received $30,000 in fees from Benefit Plan Administrators, according to the company's documents.
During his testimony to the Rules Committee, Mr. McDonald said he did not view his dealings as a conflict of interest. Several telephone calls to the homes of Mr. McDonald, Mr. Blake and Mr. Tempera seeking comment have not been answered.
Joseph N. Mondello, the chairman of the Nassau County Republican Party, said the party was beginning to feel the fallout from the consulting payments and the subsequent cost overruns. "The whole thing is harmful to the Republican Party," he said. "This thing has not gone far enough to start criticizing the leadership yet. The problem here is to solve the problem."
Right now, the biggest potential consequence seems to be the effect the health care deal will have on the county's ability to borrow. If bond agencies lower the county's rating, the cost of borrowing money increases, raising the cost of building new roads and schools.
The fiscal disarray could also hurt the county's efforts to negotiate a deal to keep the Islanders hockey team. In recent weeks the on-again, off-again talks about building a new arena for the team have been delayed as team officials wait to see if Nassau will be able to borrow its share of the costs.
"The county promised $100 million toward a new stadium," said a New York Islanders team executive, speaking on condition of anonymity. If the county's credit rating suffers, he said, "I don't know what they are going to do."
Thomas S. Gulotta, the Nassau County Executive and the county's chief budget architect, said little about the health plan problems when they first arose. But he held a news conference on Jan. 25 to announce a lawsuit against Benefit Plan Administrators, charging that the company received kickbacks and misled the county about the true cost of the plan.
"I am the County Executive and ultimately I am responsible for what happens in this county," he said.
He also announced he was returning $20,600 in campaign contributions from Benefit Plan Administrators, Mr. Isernio, Mr. Blake and three agencies related to Mr. Blake.
The County Comptroller, Frederick E. Parola, also said that he had returned a total $6,675 in contributions from the William Blake Agency and Benefit Plan Administrators. "I am not involved directly with fund-raising," Mr. Parola said. "When we found out that there was something possibly inappropriate, we returned the money."
Mayor Thomas R. Suozzi of Glen Cove, a Democrat who is a lawyer and certified public accountant, ridiculed the health plan contract last week as "sickening" and "business as usual in Nassau County."
"These guys are giving contracts to their buddies and cutting deals when no one's looking," Mr. Suozzi said. "The worst part of it is that it's just a stupid contract and the taxpayers have to foot a bill for $50 million."
But officials point out that the contract is hardly the first questionable deal undertaken in Nassau County. For instance, one former Republican Party chairman, Joseph M. Margiotta, was convicted in 1981 of mail fraud and extortion for instructing an insurance broker who had received county contracts to split the commissions with Republicans.
During his 1985 trial, many government workers in Nassau County testified that they were forced to kick back 1 percent of their salaries to the Republican Party to keep their jobs or get promotions.
Even for a place with a long tradition of political scandals that includes sewer contract corruption, police misconduct and allegations of bribery, the last 12 months have been tumultuous.
Less than two weeks ago, John Powell, the Republican leader for Suffolk County and the Town of Brookhaven, resigned to prepare his defense against Federal criminal bribery and truck theft charges. That same day, the Nassau County Democratic leader, Stephen J. Sabbeth, went on trial in Federal District Court, accused of laundering money and using a secret brokerage account to hide $750,000 from creditors when his family lumber business went bankrupt 10 years ago.
Township and legislative elections are just months away, and although some Long Island Republicans said the situation has not yet hit critical mass, they worry that the wheels are starting to fall off their political organization.
"D'Amato's not around anymore," one Republican legislator said of the former United States Senator who began his political career on Long Island. "It's no secret that he was the guy who kept people talking, kept the glue together, and got the problems solved without it blowing up in public. We're lacking his leadership. There's a power vacuum."

HEADLINE: Business Travel;
DISCOUNTED FARES ARRIVING IN EAST

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Since discount airlines like People Express collapsed more than a decade ago, air fares on the East Coast have remained stubbornly high even as prices have fallen elsewhere in the country.
But new fare-cutting competition has begun to arrive in the East, led by Southwest Airlines, the country's biggest and most successful discount airline. Next month, Southwest will take on the toughest market in the region but the most lucrative in the nation when it comes to travel dollars: New York. Beginning with flights to four cities from MacArthur Airport on Long Island, Southwest will offer fares that are as little as half of the lowest comparable fares. 
 While some question whether Southwest can draw passengers to an airport 40 miles outside Manhattan, the airline's track record so far on the East Coast suggests that New York air travelers -- no matter which airport they use -- can expect some fares to fall sharply.
In the last five years, Southwest has expanded to Baltimore; Providence, R.I.; Manchester, N.H., and several cities in Florida. At each airport, air fares fell sharply -- even on routes not served by Southwest. Fares also fell at nearby airports.
U S Airways, the largest airline in the region, and Delta Air Lines have responded to the challenge by expanding their new discount subsidiaries, which match Southwest's fares. The airlines have also sought to ward off Southwest by offering cheaper fares in several markets the discounter has yet to enter. Even the nation's biggest airline, United, is considering expanding its own low-cost subsidiary to the East Coast.
"If you look at past history, when Southwest goes into secondary airports near a major metropolitan area the fares in the primary airports almost always go down," said Rono Dutta, the senior vice president for planning at United.
The airlines are eager to battle in the East because the region accounts for about 40 percent of the $52 billion spent on airline tickets annually in the continental United States.
"The East Coast is a very dense, very deep market," said Gary C. Kelly, Southwest's chief financial officer. "There is just a huge pool of customers to access."
And Eastern markets are among the few that are still not dominated by a single major carrier. Over the last five years, the big airlines have solidified their holds on so-called fortress hubs in cities like Denver and Detroit, where they face little or no major competition.
"There is not much left to fight for," Mr. Dutta of United said.
Even after recent across-the-board fare increases by the major airlines, the increased competition along the East Coast is expected to push down prices. That, in turn, will make the region more attractive to businesses and aid economic growth.
In Washington, where Southwest began its Eastern push at Baltimore-Washington International Airport in 1993, the average fares on all airlines were nearly 35 percent less at the end of June then they were before Southwest started flying there, according to BACK Associates, an aviation research firm in New Haven.
The average fare paid on U S Airways for a one-way flight between Providence and Baltimore was $184 before Southwest arrived. By June, that had fallen to $55.70 as U S Airways matched Southwest's prices.
New York in particular is ripe for low-fare competition. Except during the brief life of People Express, air fares on short routes have always been higher than the national average at the city's three airports since the airline industry was deregulated in 1978. But in recent years, as Southwest and other low-fare carriers have expanded in many parts of the country, the gap has widened.
Between 1980 and 1997, ticket prices in cities with low-fare airlines fell, when adjusted for inflation, by 41 percent for flights less than 750 miles, according to Roberts, Roach & Associates, another aviation consultant. But in New York they have risen slightly.
Even before its arrival in New York, Southwest has been a direct threat to both Delta, which has a strong presence in Florida, and U S Airways, which is the largest airline in the East. Both responded by persuading their pilots to accept wage concessions so the airlines could introduce low-cost subsidiaries to match Southwest's low fares and still make a profit.
The U S Airways subsidiary, Metrojet, started flying in June and has already carried more than one million passengers. By May, it will serve 22 cities from Florida to Boston, with 202 daily flights.
"Make no mistake, for the airline to exist over the next 20 years, we would become a shadow of what we are today if we didn't do something like Metrojet," Rakesh Gangwal, U S Airways' chief executive, has said.
Delta's answer to Southwest, Delta Express, grew 50 percent last year. It now serves 22 cities, flying mostly between the Northeast and Florida.
All this competition has prompted some surprising moves. Though Metrojet is taking Southwest head on in Baltimore, U S Airways more recently decided to expand its flights from Dulles International, outside Washington, to include hourly service to LaGuardia, in a move many analysts saw as a way to sidestep Southwest.
The expansion threatened United, which uses Dulles as its only East Coast hub. Rather than cede control of Dulles to U S Airways, United now plans to add 40 daily departures from Dulles to 13 cities, including 7 on the East Coast.
United is also considering bringing in its low-fare service, Shuttle by United, which it created in 1994 to compete with Southwest in California and neighboring states.
And American Airlines is beginning jet service between MacArthur and O'Hare International Airport in Chicago.
But Southwest alone cannot be credited with increasing competition in the region. Flush with cash after four years of robust profits, airlines have been buying new planes and seeking new routes to fly them.
American plans to spend $1 billion building a terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Continental Airlines is close to announcing a $1 billion expansion at Newark International Airport, where it is growing its international service.
Even entrepreneurs are showing more interest in the industry after a dearth of new airlines following the 1996 Valujet crash in Florida. For example, plans for a new, as yet unnamed, discount airline based at Kennedy are moving forward.
At MacArthur, Southwest will begin with 12 flights a day to four cities -- Baltimore, Chicago, Nashville and Tampa, Fla. While those are modest numbers, Southwest's strategy has been to start small and grow methodically.
MacArthur, now largely home to commuter airlines, is in Islip, on the South Shore of Long Island. It is a long drive from Manhattan even when there is no traffic.
But Southwest says that it does not need to draw passengers from the three big New York airports to succeed at Islip. In the beginning, at least, it will focus on wooing Long Island's more than 2.6 million residents. It has begun running ads in newspapers and has billboards at Long Island Rail Road stations.
New Yorkers will have to become accustomed to Southwest's unusual style. The airline flies only narrow-body Boeing 737's and there are no assigned seats. Passengers are given a number at the gate and then are boarded in groups of 30.
In the air, Southwest is famous for its lack of amenities -- "This is what our meals look like," one of its ads declares, showing a bag of peanuts -- as well as its wisecracking pilots and flight attendants. But the airline has one of the best safety records and is highly regarded by business travelers for its strong on-time record.
Southwest, which is based in Dallas, likes secondary airports such as MacArthur, because using them avoids the high fees and delays that are endemic to major gateways like Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark. Many believe that Southwest ultimately plans to add service from an airport north of New York City, perhaps Stewart International, near Newburgh, N.Y., much as it has bracketed Boston by flying from Rhode Island to the south and Manchester, N.H., to the north. The airline says it has no such plans but does not rule the idea out.
Drawing from large metropolitan areas, Southwest has been able to expand the air-travel market by attracting people who would never have thought of flying.
Consider what happened in the two years since Southwest began flying from T. F. Green Airport in Rhode Island, just south of Providence. Drawn by fares as low as $39 for a one-way ticket to Baltimore, travelers soon began driving to Rhode Island from Massachusetts and Connecticut -- even from as far away as New York and Vermont -- to fly Southwest. Rival airlines increased service and lowered their fares. In the last two years, the annual passenger traffic at the airport has nearly doubled, to 4.6 million people. And the same thing has happened in other cities Southwest serves.
"There are people who fly down to Baltimore and see a Red Sox game for cheaper than if they drove down to Boston," said Alfred Testa Jr., the director of Manchester Airport, which Southwest began serving last year. "It is no longer strange to see people downstairs in the terminal going to Florida for three days."
That kind of attitude is also found among business travelers.
"The joke we have at the office is that we have the Southwest route map, and that is our marketing plan," said Kelly Stewart, the director of sales at Healthstream, a small company based in Nashville that sells computer services to the health care industry.
While low-fare competition has been short-lived in the past as low-cost rivals were driven out of business, this time, some analysts say, there is enough room in the East for all the low-cost competitors.
"Fare wars happen when high-fare carriers try to cut each other's throats," said Kevin C. Murphy, an airline analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York. "What you have here is low-cost service that is good for everybody because it changes consumer behavior."

FIRSTPLUS SELLS FINANCE UNIT TO THAXTON FOR $51 MILLION

BYLINE: Dow Jones 

 BODY:
Firstplus Financial Group Inc., a financial services company struggling with liquidity problems, said yesterday that it had sold its Firstplus Consumer Finance Inc. unit to the Thaxton Investment Corporation for $51 million. The Dallas-based Firstplus is a subprime lender, making loans to consumers of up to 125 percent of their homes' value at high interest rates. The company was badly hurt by the late-summer global credit squeeze that dried up the market for loans it packaged and sold as securities. Thaxton, based in Lancaster, S.C., is an insurer and mortgage lender that had $1.5 million in profits in 1997. Firstplus said it planned to use the proceeds to repay liens encumbering the assets of Firstplus Consumer and to meet other obligations.

HEADLINE: Responding to Middle Class, Some Colleges Trim Tuition

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN 

 BODY:
Marlboro College, a small liberal arts campus in Vermont, has just announced an 8 percent cut in tuition and fees and no increase in room and board for freshmen who arrive next fall. The students will pay $26,410 instead of $27,810.
Muskingum College, in New Concord, Ohio, got fed up with doling out more financial aid every time the college raised tuition, and so it slashed tuition by $4,000, a 29 percent drop to $9,850, from $13,850. 
 And although Dartmouth College did not exactly eviscerate tuition, it held the line at an increase of only 3.9 percent for the current academic year, its smallest increase in 32 years.
No, this is not necessarily a trend. The great majority of colleges and universities have been raising their costs even faster than inflation for at least two decades. But a handful of schools say they feel the pain of middle-class and working-class parents and have responded. And some academic officials say it could be a stirring of significance.
Among the leaders of the movement are the state university systems in Massachusetts and California. Virginia is very likely to join them. For three consecutive years, the five-campus University of Massachusetts has scaled back tuition and fees for in-state students, from $4,969 in fiscal 1996 to $4,727 in fiscal 1999.
Since 1997 the nine-campus University of California system has reduced tuition and fees for in-state students to $3,609 from $3,700. Costs at the less expensive California State University were cut 5 percent.
And last December, Gov. Jim Gilmore of Virginia proposed an across-the-board cut of 20 percent in tuition and fees for all in-state students at public colleges and universities. Since the state's economy is booming, the chances of passage by the Virginia General Assembly this session are considered excellent.
"It's too early to say whether it's a trend," said Terry Hartle, a spokesman for the American Council on Education, the Washington lobbying organization. "But any time you get Massachusetts and California involved, you've got some very visible states."
These colleges and universities are reacting as they see some financially hard-pressed parents and their children increasingly shying away from relatively expensive private colleges and instead choosing less expensive public institutions or, in some cases, giving up on higher education altogether.
How do these campuses do it? Aren't they just as financially stressed as the others that keep raising their prices?
Paul LeBlanc, president of Marlboro College, said that two and a half years ago when he was given his job, the trustees instructed him to be "aggressively entrepreneurial," which meant finding things the college could do to generate new sources of revenue in order to hold down or even reduce what students were being charged.
"One of the business ventures we spun off, called the Design Center, which utilized both faculty and students," Mr. LeBlanc said, "won the contract to design the State of Vermont's new Web site for tourism, and that and other similar projects have generated more than $100,000.
"Educational institutions have to learn to do things outside their usual boundaries," Mr. LeBlanc continued. "That's what will enable them to reduce costs."
James Wright, the president of Dartmouth, said he had been able to resist runaway tuition with a series of efforts to "reallocate existing resources."
One of the most successful of these efforts, he said, has been to allow alumni donors to lend their names to scholarships of as little as $1,500.
"We're also using more of our unrestricted endowment for financial aid," he said. "That was one of my first priorities when I became president last August."
Not all of these well-intended efforts are successful. Last fall, Tuition Credit Exchange, a national organization that attempted to resist the relentless rise of college costs by "selling" tuition credits to the parents or friends of even very young college-bound children, closed its doors for lack of support.
Bill Higdon, a former president of Graceland College, in Lamoni, Iowa, who served as an executive of the credit exchange, said: "We stirred up a lot of interest, but ran up against the natural conservatism of people when faced with a totally new concept. But the idea of beginning the family effort to marshal resources for college costs over a period of years instead of in just four years is a good one and has a future."
In the 1970's there was little growth, if any, in college prices beyond the rate of inflation. Since 1980, however, college prices have been soaring at twice and sometimes three times the Consumer Price Index. Over the 10-year period ending in 1998-99, after adjusting for inflation, the average public tuition and fees went up 53 percent at public colleges and 35 percent at private four-year colleges.
Since the 1980-81 school year, both public and private four-year institutions increased at more than twice the rate of inflation, on average.
Private college tuition rose most sharply in the early and mid-1980's, while public tuition increased the most in the late 1980's and early 1990's.
And despite the efforts of places like Marlboro and Muskingum, the pressure to raise costs is still intense, said Jack Joyce, a spokesman for the College Board responsible for the organization's annual survey Trends in College Pricing.
Colleges are hard pressed to keep costs down, he said, because they are faced not only with constant needs, like raising faculty salaries and maintaining aging buildings, laboratories and libraries, but also in recent years have been pressed to meet "student demands and expectations for a wired campus that includes the new technology required for modern communication."

 CORRECTION:
An article on the Education page on Feb. 3 about colleges that are reducing tuition or holding it steady referred incorrectly to the Tuition Credit Exchange, a private organization that allows parents of young children to lock in current rates by prepaying. The exchange is still in business; it has not closed.

HEADLINE: THE ARTS IN: Fairbanks Alaska;
It Takes Creativity to Thaw the Soul

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER 

DATELINE: FAIRBANKS, Alaska, Feb. 1

 BODY:
The ice was too cold. When the temperature sank under 30 degrees below zero here last week and bottomed out at 47 below zero through the weekend, an icy fog swaddled this city in a glowing soup. And the local sculptors who have dotted the city with angels and polar bears and other crystalline icons had to put away their sanders and their chisels and the water -- "Arctic superglue" in local parlance -- they use to fuse ice limbs to ice torsos and to make repairs.
It was cold even for Fairbanks, where residents routinely use the frozen Chena River for a road; cold enough for a cup of coffee tossed in the air to freeze before the droplets hit the snow; cold enough for automobile tires to square against the ground, and cold enough for heating oil to begin thickening. At such temperatures, blocks of ice simply become too brittle and prone to shatter for the delicate shaving and whittling that a sculptor's work requires. 
 Still, Kathleen Carlo-Kendall gave it a shot. With Anita Tabor, a wood sculptor who moved here from Arkansas 13 years ago, Ms. Carlo-Kendall, an Athabascan Indian and mask maker, spent an hour or so on Saturday in front of the Westmark Hotel downtown, working on two large native-style masks, one traditional, one contemporary. They did not make much progress, but it was a good workout; the two women are half of the first all-female team to enter the International Ice Art Championships ("Frigid Women," they jokingly call themselves) held here each March.
And it was a good excuse to battle the cabin fever that many people say is a winter burden, brought on more by lingering darkness than by the cold. There are but seven hours of dim sunlight a day right now, up from little more than three hours at the winter solstice six weeks ago.
"It's nice to get out of the house," Ms. Carlo-Kendall said. "I haven't been out in three days."
The arts have a tough row to hoe in this part of the world, a place where man's creations pale beside Mother Nature's, and particularly at this time of year when the world is dark, and for many, the spirit is, too. Yet there may be no other place in the country where the arts serve such a practical function as they do in this surprisingly diverse (ethnically and artistically), brutally winterbound and isolated environment.
Even if this not a pretty town -- the blocky, economical architecture is often lamented, with good reason, by the locals -- Fairbanks manifests a persistent and enduring interest in the arts. They not only bring people out into the cold and cheer the bleak landscape, but they are cited by many here, not outlandishly, as a reason to live.
"Suicide during this time of year runs a little high, and the arts have been a comforter," said James C. Hayes, the Mayor. "Without them, I don't know what we'd be."
The state, with its notorious small-government bias, has cut back on arts subsidies in recent years; its support to the Fairbanks Arts Association diminished to just $11,000 this year from more than $65,000 in the early 90's. But the political isn't personal, says June Rogers, the executive director of the association, who notes that many of the budget-slashing legislators contribute generously to the arts from their own pockets. The city supports the arts with a hotel bed tax; its contribution to the association this year was $77,000, 90 percent of which was channeled to local nonprofit groups.
Fairbanks maintains two dance companies, two art galleries, two community theaters (one performs original work, the other Shakespeare), a chorale and a light opera company that often sells out a 1,400-seat hall. The city also has an ambitious amateur symphony whose co-principal violinist also plays the tuba. On Saturday night the symphony's Arctic Chamber Orchestra lured about 300 people out in 30-degrees-below-zero weather for a program that included Bartok's difficult "Divertimento for Strings" and the world premiere of "Sculptured Memories," a dissonant tone poem by Gregory Mertl, 29, of Rochester, his first commissioned work.
Fairbanks has a fair amount of public art, supported by a state levy on builders of 1 percent of the cost of all new buildings. And the city is rife with painters, musicians, writers and photographers, as well as decorative weavers like Marnie Cornwall, who specializes in the delicate wool of the qiviut, or Alaskan musk ox; artists using natural materials (aside from ice) like Penny Wakefield, who works in dried and painted fish skins, and Athabascan skin sewers and beadworkers like Dixie Alexander, whose variations on tribal clothing are in the collections of the Smithsonian Institution and other museums in "the lower 48."
There is a gem of a museum here, on the main campus of the University of Alaska, tiny and crammed with the natural history of the state, along with native artifacts and art objects ranging from 1,500-year-old Eskimo carvings of wood and ivory to contemporary paintings. The university is a focus for the regeneration of native arts, whose connection to tribal life had long been attenuated by the encroachment of modern times.
 
The Old Arts Lost to Television
Ms. Alexander (who also runs an annual fiddling festival where Athabascan elders gather to play the twangy, countrified music brought here by Scottish and French-Canadian traders in the 19th century) spends part of the year in villages around the state, reintroducing the traditional art forms.
"A lot of people still have their elders sewing for them," she said. "What happened to the younger generation? The Alaska Cable Network. Computers. Snowmobiles." She added, "We get a lot of our funding from suicide prevention groups."
On campus there are signs of renewal. Alvin Amanson, who directs the native arts program at the university, is an Aleut painter from Kodiak known for modern expressionist portraits of Alaskan wildlife. (De Kooning is his acknowledged influence.) He has been encouraged, he said, by the skill of his young students, who are beginning to meld the rhythms and skills of their villages with contemporary imagery. One young woodcarver, he said, a Yupik from southeastern Alaska, dazzled him with the masks he made for a university dance troupe.
"The first one was of Bart Simpson," he said, laughing uproariously.
Situated in a broad valley cut by the Tanana River, between the towering Alaska Range to the south and the Brooks Range to the north, Fairbanks is home to 31,000 people, with another 50,000 in the surrounding North Star Borough. It is a small place, but it is nonetheless the state's second-largest city (behind Anchorage, 400 miles south), and the only urban center serving Alaska's interior, a region the size of Texas.
It is a place that must be all things to many people. "We've got more variety of arts per capita than most places our size," said Matt Reckard, a retired civil engineer and part-time actor. "But I don't know that that makes us an arts town. We've got more car dealerships than you'd expect, too."
Founded in 1902, Fairbanks has been an important mining center through most of the century. In recent decades, however, its population and urbanity have been augmented by the presence of Air Force and Army bases and the growth of the state university, whose main campus serves 9,000 students. Construction of the Alaska pipeline brought thousands of laborers in the 1970's; many stayed on after the wild times of the period settled down.
In addition, the outdoors attracted individualists from all over the United States, many of whom decided that the glories of summer (not only hiking and rafting and midnight softball but a two-week summer arts festival) were worth enduring the hostile winters.
The outdoors is alluring to artists as well, of course. They include both lifelong Alaskans like Lisa Rogers, a self-taught painter, sculptor and crafts artist whose work includes imagery from her years of a subsistence life style in Lime Village, a remote northern town with a population of 40; and others, like David Mollett, a landscape painter who was born in Oregon but has lived most of his life here.
"For a landscape painter it's nice that nobody's painted it much," said Mr. Mollett, who has lived and exhibited in New York and Paris. He was among the very first painters to venture into the Brooks Range. In his studio, he keeps a canvas that was shredded by a bear on one of his sojourns there.
As a result of all these influences, the population of Fairbanks is idiosyncratic and tends to be self-selecting. By their own assessment, the city's residents tend to be curious people and readers, even though Alaska is, in the words of Greg Hill, the director of the local library, "book poor."
"All the libraries in the state put together don't have the volumes they have at the University of Washington," Mr. Hill said. "But Alaska has 10 percent higher usage rate than the rest of the country, and Fairbanks has a 10 percent higher rate than the rest of Alaska. We have our kooks and cranks, but they tend to be intelligent here."
The population is also increasingly diverse. This is a city whose best restaurant is arguably a Thai luncheonette, and where last week at the Arctic Bar, a local watering hole, Marc Brown, an Athabascan guitarist, introduced the members of his band, the Blues Crew, by saying, "You probably won't see another blues band with an Indian, an Eskimo, a black guy and a white guy."
 
Where Is It Warm? Inside a Church
And although country music is prevalent in most of the roadhouses, there are places that occasionally feature Celtic music, jazz and even rap. Fifteen percent of Fairbanks residents are black, including Mayor Hayes, who is also the pastor at the Lily of the Valley Church of God in Christ, one of several black churches in the city that nurture a tradition of gospel singing. On Sunday morning the church choir, 20 strong, accompanied by an organist and drummer and singing in a distinctively pop style, stirred a full house of congregants to the extent that the ushers were passing out fans, making it the only overheated place in the city.
The arts are warm, but in Fairbanks in winter, maybe a lonely flame. Drive a short way out of town, and the snowfields and snow-sugared black spruce seem to stretch on forever, an endless abstract in black and white.
"I look at all this grayness, and I think about depression and loneliness and all the things grayness can contribute to," said Ms. Rogers of the arts association. "But you know, it is beautiful. I don't find it depressing. And I think that's what art can do for people here, give them another way to look at things."

EUROPE
 
TURKEY: CRACKDOWN ON ISLAMISTS ORDERED -- Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, left, announced a nationwide crackdown on Islamist activity, saying he was instructing the police and judiciary to take legal action against any threats to the secular order. Past crackdowns in Turkey have led to prosecution of politicians and journalists deemed to have encouraged religious militancy.
 (Reuters)
 
RUSSIA: U.S. HELP SOUGHT ON 'YEAR 2000' -- Russia said it needs up to $3 billion to tackle the Year 2000 computer problem -- six times its original estimate -- and appealed to the United States and NATO to help fix computers that control its nuclear weapons. While an errant missile launch brought on by a computer failure is considered highly unlikely, such snags could sabotage radar and telecommunications networks. (AP) 

NORTHERN IRELAND: OBSERVERS INVITED -- Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have been invited to send observers to assess the paramilitary violence that is impeding the Ulster peace effort. The invitation, by David Trimble, the Protestant First Minister of the new Assembly, was welcomed by Roman Catholic leaders.

BRITAIN: PINOCHET'S IMMUNITY QUESTIONED -- An expert in international law said Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator, might not be able to claim immunity from prosecution for crimes committed by his forces outside Chile. The expert, David Lloyd Jones, was appearing as a neutral "friend of the court" before Britain's highest court on whether General Pinochet has immunity from arrest and extradition to Spain.

ITALY: FALLING SHORT OF EURO STANDARD -- In the first public admonition of its kind, the European Commission ordered Italy to revise its economic plans for the next three years because of concerns it will fail to meet its commitments as a member of the euro zone. Italy has acknowledged that growth this year will fall below its initial forecasts. (Agence France-Presse)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
MEXICO: EARLY PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN -- Manuel Bartlett Diaz, left, a conservative former Governor of Puebla state, opened his campaign to win nomination as the candidate of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party for elections next year. The announcement of his intent to succeed President Ernesto Zedillo broke taboos, because candidates have traditionally maintained a respectful silence until the sitting President designates his successor. Sam Dillon (NYT)
 
ASIA
 
NORTH KOREA: SEEKING TALKS WITH SOUTH -- For the first time in years, North Korea has proposed "high-level political talks" with South Korea. The proposal contained many conditions Seoul has rejected, and there was no immediate South Korean response. But officials noted privately that it was the first offer of talks with the Government of President Kim Dae Jung, who has pushed for dialogue with the North. (AP)
 
PAKISTAN: PRESS FREEDOM DEMONSTRATION -- About 3,000 journalists, lawyers and human rights and opposition political activists demonstrated in Lahore in support of press freedom. They condemned what they said were attempts by the Government to intimidate Pakistan's largest newspaper group, the Jang Group.
 (Agence France-Presse)
 
PHILIPPINES: TRIAL FOR IMELDA MARCOS -- The Supreme Court ordered a lower court to try Imelda Marcos, widow of the late dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos, on 24 counts of illegally maintaining overseas bank accounts. The deposits, in Swiss banks, are valued at $570 million, and Mrs. Marcos faces up to 120 years in prison if convicted. (AP)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
JORDAN: ISRAELIS TO MEET CROWN PRINCE -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon will visit Amman on Sunday to meet Crown Prince Abdullah, recently named King Hussein's heir, Israeli officials said. Jordanian officials said Mr. Netanyahu, who last visited Jordan in 1997, had requested the meeting. (Agence France-Presse)
 
ALGERIA: FUNDAMENTALISTS KILLED -- Algerian security forces killed 40 Muslim fundamentalists, arrested 5 and freed 7 kidnapped girls in a 10-day sweep in eastern Algeria, the daily El Acil reported. The operation also resulted in the seizure of 17 homemade mortars and the destruction of several arms caches, the paper said.
 (Agence France-Presse)
 
YEMEN: PROTECTION FOR FOREIGNERS -- Yemen has decided to take "firm measures" to combat the wave of kidnappings of foreigners and bombings that are threatening to wreck its economy, the official news agency said. The measures, which were not disclosed, were agreed on at meeting led by President Ali Abdallah Saleh. (Agence France-Presse)
 
EGYPT: HABASH PLANS VISIT -- The leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, George Habash, will visit Egypt for the first time since relations between Cairo and the radical group broke down 30 years ago. Mr. Habash, 74, will take part in a conference Feb. 21 to 23 titled "Zionism and Arab Resistance," said Helmi Shaarawi, director of the Arab Research Center, which is organizing the meeting. (Agence France-Presse)
 
AFRICA
 
GUINEA-BISSAU: CEASE-FIRE REACHED -- The President of Guinea-Bissau and the rebel leader seeking to oust him have agreed to a cease-fire, halting the nation's renewed civil war, the Foreign Ministry in Portugal, the former colonial power, announced. The foreign and defense ministers of Togo brokered the truce between President Joao Bernardo Vieira and the rebel chief, Brig. Ansumane Mane, the Portuguese ministry said. (AP)

Sometimes Folding Is the Better Part of Valor

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS 

 BODY:
Good legislators generally make bad Presidential candidates, and politicians who try to ignore this rule have a way of winding up unemployed. Yesterday the House minority leader, Richard Gephardt, officially came to grips with both realities by dropping out of contention for the Democratic nomination. That leaves Bill Bradley with the responsibility of giving Democrats someone to turn to in desperation when they experience inevitability panic over the ascendancy of Al Gore.
It may be a sad moment for Mr. Gephardt, one of the many 50-something members of Congress whose political clocks are starting to tick alarmingly. But it made a lot of other people happy. Mr. Gore, who has been relentlessly placating the minority leader for more than a year, was of course relieved. The House Democrats, who are just six seats short of a majority, are delighted that Mr. Gephardt is going to lead their campaign effort in 2000. But Mr. Gephardt's friends and family must be happy as well. You don't want to see a loved one wandering around New Hampshire shopping malls and morphing into Lamar Alexander. 
 Lately, Mr. Gephardt has shown every sign of becoming very good at his current job. During the impeachment debate he rounded up all but five of the Democrats for Bill Clinton, a man who enjoys the personal loyalty of approximately half a dozen members of his party. The recent example of Newt Gingrich has taught Congress that a party is better off if its top Congressional leader does not have a whole lot of personality, and on that count Mr. Gephardt certainly fits the bill.
American history is full of stories about legislative leaders who set their sights on the White House and came to grief, from Henry Clay to Bob Dole. The qualities necessary to pass bills -- attention to detail, love of the artful compromise, the inclination to keep promises -- get in the way during a Presidential campaign. The characteristics that are important in a run for President -- star quality, willingness to abdicate control of your life to handlers, an agile attitude toward facts -- are not much use in Congress.
Given that Al Gore is absorbing campaign contributions the way the Titanic took on water, the news that Mr. Gephardt had decided to pass up the chance to challenge him was not exactly earth-shaking. Still, Mr. Gephardt got a few days' mileage out of the announcement, which proceeded from probably-not to aides-say-not to a speech in the Capitol where he conclusively demonstrated that he had made the right career move. It was a stately march of non-candidacy, much like Colin Powell's, except Mr. Gephardt lacked a book to flog.
There is not much of a history of great declarations of non-candidacy, mainly because the population of people who might conceivably be asked to run consists almost entirely of men and women who have been dying to be President since they were elected to student council in junior high. The big decliners have almost all been generals. William Tecumseh Sherman gave his name to the ultimate refusal when he telegraphed the Republican nominators in 1884 that if nominated he would not run, and if elected he would not serve. (The Republicans went instead with Senator James Blaine, a legislative guy, and lived to regret it.) Until we have another hero-producing war, Colin Powell will probably be the last of the general refusers.
It took a very bad campaign to convince Ted Kennedy that he was actually a legislative guy at heart. The most colorful non-candidate was Mario Cuomo, who let the national press corps sit waiting on the floors of New York State's Capitol as planes revved on the runway to fly him to New Hampshire on the last day of filing. Mr. Cuomo finally emerged from the governor's mansion to announce that he couldn't run for the White House because State Senator Ralph Marino of Muttontown had refused to approve a state budget. It was a psychodrama to remember, but one Mr. Gephardt wisely declined to imitate.

Tire Makers Combine as Mergers Rise in Japan

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 3

 BODY:
The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company's deal for control of most operations of Sumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd. echoes faintly an earlier American-Japanese marriage in tires. In 1988, amid a wave of high-profile Japanese acquisitions in the United States, Bridgestone bought Firestone of Ohio for $2.6 billion.
Today's agreement comes as Japan undergoes a surge of mergers and acquisitions -- including some involving American companies. But a reversal of the 1980's trend is unlikely, and few here expect the Goodyear deal to herald a new flood of foreign takeovers. 
 "I just can't see it," said Clifford J. Shaw, head of Merrill Lynch Mercury Asset Management Japan Ltd. "I don't think this is the beginning of a major trend."
For one, investment bankers said, the Goodyear-Sumitomo deal was spurred by competitive pressures specific to the tire industry.
More important, the fact that a lingering recession is forcing Japanese companies to seek out deals also means that many assets up for sale may not be at the top of international shopping lists. How many auto companies want to buy a plant and increase capacity? How many foreign companies want to pay for expensive headquarters here? Or the real estate under a department store when renting is markedly cheaper?
Recent purchases by foreigners have largely been in financial services -- deals that are also being driven by the deregulation of Japanese markets. "It's reactive M & A rather than pro-active on the part of the Japanese companies," Craig Chudler, a strategist with Salomon Smith Barney in Tokyo, said.
Still, deals between Japanese companies are breaking fast and furiously. The Toshiba Corporation has been paring its exposure to affiliates and subsidiaries, as has its rival, Hitachi Ltd. The Nippon Oil Company, Japan's largest refiner, is buying the Mitsubishi Oil Company in an effort to consolidate, and the Asahi Chemical Industry Company has agreed to sell its processed foods subsidiary to Japan Tobacco Inc.
Over all, the number of mergers and acquisitions involving Japanese companies rose 35 percent last year, to 908 deals, according to the Nikko Securities Company. Foreign buyers were responsible for 121 deals.
More foreign deals may soon be on the way. The Nissan Motor Company has been talking with foreign auto makers about buying a stake.
In the case of Sumitomo, it is a second-tier tire company staring rapid consolidation in the auto industry in the face and contemplating its prospects, one of its bankers said.
With $2.76 billion of debt, more than three times its equity, striking a deal with Goodyear -- with which is already had a substantial relationship -- was a stroke of good fortune. Goodyear is providing nearly $1 billion in cash, which will help clean up Sumitomo's balance sheet.
Indeed, today's deal is merely part of a global consolidation sweeping the auto business. Japan can produce four million more cars than it can sell, so it is a natural market for such consolidation. Nissan is seeking the same sort of deal that Sumitomo made with Goodyear, and the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation is shopping bits of itself around.
Furthermore, the deal with Goodyear is not a straightforward merger or acquisition. Japanese companies prefer the safety of a joint venture, capital participation or other types of corporate links that allow them to hold hands without quite getting into bed. The six ventures between Goodyear and Sumitomo let Sumitomo maintain a vestige of control and independence, which its bankers say was critical.
"That's the kind of M & A you're most likely to see here," an investment banker said.

HEADLINE: Fed Decides To Maintain Interest Rates

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
Trapped between conflicting pressures at home and abroad, the Federal Reserve voted today to leave interest rates unchanged, keeping its hands off an economy that is either gratifyingly robust or too strong for its own good.
The decision, almost universally expected by economists and investors, caused barely a ripple on Wall Street. But it highlighted the dilemma facing the central bank just months after it cut rates three times to insure that financial turmoil in much of the rest of the world would not derail the long American expansion. 
 Rather than slowing, the economy grew at a torrid 5.6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, putting back on the agenda the possibility that inflation, long dormant, could reappear. One faction within the Federal Reserve is also concerned about rapid growth in the money supply, a cause or signal of inflation.
As a result, analysts said, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and his colleagues on the central bank are almost certainly considering whether they will need to reverse course and raise rates later this year if growth does not slow markedly on its own.
Yet the continued fragility of global financial markets, a rapidly expanding trade deficit, concern about causing a big selloff on Wall Street and the almost total absence of any hard evidence of inflation have combined to create a strong case for leaving rates alone or even cutting them further.
"The Fed cannot lower interest rates because of eye-popping economic strength," said Sung Won Sohn, an economist at Wells Fargo in Minneapolis.
"They cannot raise rates because of the stock market bubble and what's going on overseas and because politically it's impossible to raise rates given the very low inflation rate right now," he said. "So the best course for them is to stand pat and see how the U.S. and the global economies unfold."
Today's decision left the benchmark Federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks at 4.75 percent and the discount rate on loans from the Federal Reserve system at 4.5 percent.
The central bank's usual terse announcement this afternoon that the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee had adjourned with nothing to report belied the fundamental nature of the debate that has reemerged within the institution in the last few months: Has the economy entered a new era in which heavy investments in technology allow rapid growth to coexist with low inflation? Or is the United States merely enjoying a remarkable but temporary string of good economic luck that will end with inflationary forces reasserting themselves?
The evidence in favor of a fundamental change includes some of the most recent economic statistics. The fourth-quarter growth rate of 5.6 percent brought growth for all of 1998 to 3.9 percent, the third consecutive year in which the economy has expanded at nearly a 4 percent rate.
Traditional economic theory holds that the economy cannot grow more than about 2.5 percent a year over the long run without igniting inflation. But the broadest measures of price changes suggest that inflation last year was 1 percent or less.
Moreover, the absence of meaningful inflation came despite falling unemployment, which has left the jobless rate, currently 4.3 percent, hovering near 30-year lows. And heavy investments in computers and other cost-saving technology has allowed many companies to improve productivity, setting off a debate about whether the United States has reversed a two-decade-long slide in productivity growth.
"Members of the Fed wake up every morning and look out at a booming economy and ask themselves whether it's a result of computers or of interest rates being low," said Brian S. Wesbury, an economist at Griffin, Kubik, Stephens & Thompson, a Chicago investment firm.
Mr. Wesbury comes down on the side of those who think technology has increased the economy's capacity for noninflationary growth. He said that relative to inflation, the short-term interest rates controlled by the Fed are still high and could be cut to further stimulate growth without any danger of overheating.
Mr. Greenspan has been sympathetic to the argument that productivity growth is accelerating, but he has also warned, as recently as last month, that the recent pace of growth is unsustainable.
Economists who think growth is flirting with danger levels said part of the reason is that the Fed cut rates one too many times last fall in reaction to the global financial turmoil. In their view, inflation could accelerate this year, especially because some factors that tamped it down last year -- particularly falling oil and food prices -- are unlikely to be replicated this year. If money supply growth continues at double-digit rates, they said, the danger will be compounded.
Wherever they come down in the debate, though, most economists think the Fed will hold steady for months unless there is some clear change in the economy's course.
"The Fed's policy debate is rich with crosscurrents and is characterized by uncertainties," said Mickey D. Levy, an economist at Bank of America. "They will remain on hold until something breaks."

HEADLINE: Legislators In Brazil Are Leaving Ruling Party

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

 BODY:
BRASILIA, Feb. 3
A raft of newly elected members of Congress switched parties just before taking office here this week, in a move that appears to signal a more fractious second term for President Fernando Henrique Cardoso as he forges ahead with unfinished changes.
Some deputies who belonged to the evangelical Christian movement dropped the powerful conservative party, which had delivered the votes for their elections, and joined a smaller party in which they could hold more sway. They promised a more critical stance toward Mr. Cardoso's proposals. 
 "What's against the people and against the nation, we're going to fight head on," vowed Marcos Jesus. As did many candidates who ran on evangelical platforms, he switched from the small Liberal Party.
Several legislators from Minas Gerais left Mr. Cardoso's party for the party of Itamar Franco, Governor of their state. Mr. Franco is in the middle of a battle of nerves with Mr. Cardoso: Mr. Franco declared a moratorium on his state's debt to the Federal Government, shattering Brazil's already fragile credibility in world markets and unleashing the latest round of economic turbulence.
Mr. Cardoso is waging an all-out campaign to restore the faltering economy, bolstered by a $41.5 billion standby loan from the United States, the Group of 7 industrialized nations, the International Monetary Fund and others.
Having experienced 39 percent annual interest rates, unemployment at a 15-year high and soaring, and a currency that has been devalued more than 30 percent in the last month, Mr. Cardoso's popularity has fallen to an all-time low, with only 27 percent of 2,000 Brazilians questioned in a survey saying they supported him.
The first deputy managing director of the I.M.F., Stanley Fischer, postponed his return to the United States tonight. Mr. Fischer, along with technical and negotiating teams from the fund, have been combing through accounts and reworking the targets and conditions for aid.
Brazil is eager to speed delivery of the second part of $9 billion in aid.
Although Mr. Cardoso's six-party coalition enjoys a comfortable majority of 380 among the 513 deputies in the House, some important parties in the coalition have disparate factions.
The Brazilian Democratic Movement Party of Mr. Franco, for example, is split between those who support him and those who back Mr. Cardoso. Because of defections this week, Mr. Franco's party swelled, from 83 to 95 seats, the total that Mr. Cardoso's party has in the lower chamber. Mr. Franco is widely seen as a highly likely Presidential contender in four years.
Even Mr. Cardoso's party shows signs that the ready Congressional support for most of his proposals would not last into his next term. The leader of his Brazilian Social Democracy Party in the House, Aecio Neves, told a newspaper that the party "had to act with more liberty, without making so many concessions."
Bishop Carlos Rodrigues of Rio de Janeiro, another member of the evangelical bloc, dropped the Government-allied conservative party that helped him win office in October to switch to an opposition party.
Bishop Rodrigues criticized the Government for raising taxes, saying spending had to be cut. But he said laying off public workers and cutting pension benefits were not the answers. "That doesn't solve anything," the bishop said. "It's only a palliative."
To balance its books, he added, the Government ought to simplify taxes to reduce opportunities for evasion and corruption.
In part, Bishop Rodrigues said he switched parties because of an administration plan to push for laws that would require members of Congress to vote along party lines.
"The President wants party loyalty not for political reasons, but to put a muzzle on the deputies, and I won't accept that," Bishop Rodrigues said. "For that, you don't even need to be here. You could just sit in your house and have the party leader vote for you. Why even be a deputy at all?"
The administration sees a loyalty law as a way to cut pork barrel projects and other concessions that each victory in Congress demands.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Clinton's budget plan on social needs will barely make a dent.

BYLINE: By Michael M. Weinstein 

 BODY:
PRESIDENT CLINTON'S budget includes dozens of new spending programs. It also includes dozens of new tax credits and other subsidies. Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, mockingly declares "the era of Big Government is back" three years after Mr. Clinton declared it over.
But charges of extravagance are unconvincing. Even if Congress passed Mr. Clinton's entire plan, the relative size of the Federal Government would continue to shrink, budget analysts point out. Robert Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal research organization, estimates Government spending, while continuing to grow modestly in absolute dollars, will fall by 2004 to about 18.5 percent of total economic output. That level, down from 19.7 percent today, would be the lowest in 34 years. 
 Nonmilitary discretionary spending -- the part of the budget that excludes Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security but includes nearly everything else outside the Pentagon, from the F.B.I. to basic research -- would fall by 2004 to 3.1 percent of economic output, the lowest level in at least four decades. Besides, the fundamental feature of this budget is its fiscal prudence; it uses trillions of dollars of surplus revenue to drive down Federal debt rather than spend it immediately or give it away in across-the-board tax cuts.
Still, simply because overall spending levels would hardly budge does not mean that Mr. Clinton can so easily escape the serious charge that his shotgun approach to spending and tax incentives is missing the target. The proposed budget sprinkles new spending across a huge array of programs, hardly missing a constituency or Congressional district. Rather than concentrating the scarce funds and doing a few things well, the Administration has chosen instead to do dozens of things on a small scale, says C. Eugene Steuerle of the Urban Institute, in a way that amounts to "budget patches."
Mr. Clinton proposes to spend about $17 billion more next year on discretionary programs than current budget rules anticipate. The litter of initiatives is breathtaking: $600 million on community learning centers and after-school programs here, about $600 million to integrate technology into classrooms there, $2 billion for states to protect water quality, $50 million to demolish blighted buildings, and on and on with a host of undoubtedly worthy projects.
Indeed, some of the initiatives, such as reinstating food-stamp and Medicaid benefits to recent immigrants, are widely praised, especially by Democrats. The National Science Foundation gets a sizable boost, as does an effective tax credit for building housing for low-income families. But Rudolph Penner of the Urban Institute takes a look at the panoply of new spending programs and asks, "Where's the theme?"
Gary Bass of O.M.B. Watch, a liberal advocacy group, would have preferred that Mr. Clinton focus the $17 billion of extra spending on a few programs aimed at the needy. Research shows that the most effective way to prepare workers for the future is to educate them when they are young. Mr. Clinton's Administration understands this, and his budget would put $600 million more into Head Start, the effective preschool program, and other education and training initiatives. But the investments fall far short of enrolling every eligible child.
Imagine a budget that used the $17 billion to tackle two or three pressing needs. For example, there are millions of families qualifying for subsidized rental housing, but there are no vouchers for them. The White House proposes to create another 100,000 vouchers, a large increase by historical standards but not nearly enough to meet the need. Robert Reischauer, former director of the Congressional Budget Office, supports the fiscal prudence of the overall budget, but would prefer piling up more of the available money for training elementary and secondary teachers.
Critics also accuse the Administration of cluttering the tax code with dozens of new credits and subsidies, declaring an end, if not to Big Government, at least to an era of tax simplification that culminated in the estimable Tax Reform Act of 1986. The White House proposes, among pages upon pages, a $1,000 long-term-care tax credit, a $1,000 credit to offset expenses of disabled workers, a credit for small businesses that join coalitions to purchase health insurance and a credit for parents who stay home to care for a newborn.
Most of these tax credits are too small to do much good. Take the credit for caring for the chronically ill. It almost entirely excludes the poor, who do not pay taxes and cannot take advantage of a tax credit. It provides, compared with the annual costs of $60,000 or more, small relief to middle-class families. Is this the most effective use of the limited money Mr. Clinton carves out for new initiatives?
Besides making the tax code bewilderingly complex, the layering of credits creates other problems. Each credit, to avoid unduly running up costs and benefiting the rich, must be phased out as family incomes rise. So each credit that is phased out amounts to a tax on work.
There are reasons the Administration backed into nit-picking tactics. Congress has imposed tight caps on discretionary spending, virtually forcing Mr. Clinton to tackle problems with tax subsidies. Lacking the will to go after waste that riddles discretionary spending and the political muscle to eliminate the caps and start fresh, Mr. Clinton resorted to doling out spoonfuls of money where shovels were needed.

HEADLINE: U.N. Pulling Its American Employees Out of Iraq

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 3

 BODY:
The United Nations ordered its remaining American staff members in Iraq to leave today after Baghdad warned that it could not guarantee their safety.
The order, in practice, affects only two Americans among 420 non-Iraqis working in the country to provide food and medicines. Another 12 to 15 British and American employees working for the program are affected in principle but are already out of the country. 
 Fred Eckhard, the United Nations spokesman, said he could recall no precedent for such a move in the relief program. He said the decision was made by Benon Sevan, the United Nations Under Secretary General who oversees security and coordinates the Iraq "oil for food" program.
The decision came after sustained American air strikes on Iraq and after a monthlong effort by United Nations officials failed to elicit a pledge from Baghdad to honor its obligation to protect all United Nations personnel, irrespective of nationality. Mr. Sevan recommended the move to Kofi Annan, the Secretary General.
Mr. Sevan's decision contrasts with that of Richard Butler, the beleaguered chairman of the United Nations Special Commission charged with disarming Iraq of weapons of mass destruction. When Iraq threatened to bar entry to American members of inspection teams in 1997, Mr. Butler decided to stop inspections rather than permit Iraq to dictate the composition of the teams. Ultimately Iraq relented until the latest confrontation this year when it refused to accept any inspectors.
The restrictions signal a reluctance by Washington and the United Nations to provoke a confrontation with Iraq on this issue while the United Nations is struggling to achieve a consensus on policy.
Asked why Mr. Sevan did not make a similar decision, Mr. Eckhard said, "I don't want to compare Benon Sevan's judgment with Richard Butler's judgment."
Several United Nations officials, said that the organization sometimes informally refrained from sending staff members of certain nationalities to places where they might in particular be in harm's way, but that they were unhappy about Mr. Sevan's decision, calling it troubling.
At the same time, they added, Mr. Sevan was primarily motivated to help the people of Iraq, one million of whom are said to be suffering from the effects of food shortages and other results of economic sanctions and President Saddam Hussein's reluctance to buy the vital food and medicine he is permitted to import through oil sales.
The two Americans who have been ordered to leave Iraq are the secretary to Prakash Shah, Secretary General Annan's special envoy in Iraq, and the deputy director of the World Food Program, which announced today a $21 million appeal to help the hungry in Iraq.
Iraq had offered to make an exemption for these two Americans, plus a third who was working in Baghdad, but Mr. Sevan did not think that any Americans and British should be singled out to stay.
Both the British Foreign Office and American officials in Washington expressed "regret" about the decision, but added that the safety and security of their citizens required such a move. They blamed the Government of Iraq, saying that its unwillingness to guarantee the employees' safety had "forced" the United Nations to make the decision.
Most of the United Nations employees in the "oil for food" program are in northern Iraq, in three Kurdish provinces not directly under Baghdad's control.
The United Nations distributes food in the north and monitors its distribution by the Iraqi Government in the rest of the country. The program permits Iraq to sell almost $5.3 billion worth of oil every six months to buy food, medicine and basic goods.
The issue has been slowly building. Iraq warned in early January that it might expel American and British relief workers, saying in an unsigned diplomatic note that their safety could not be assured given public anger over air strikes that, Iraq charged and the United States and Britain denied, had "schools, universities, hospitals, grain depots, means of communications and factories" as their targets.
Since then, United Nations officials have tried unsuccessfully to obtain safety guarantees from Baghdad. While all United Nations members are required to assure such protection, there is no automatic penalty in the organization's charter for failing to do so.
But the issue is likely to be raised when the Security Council, deeply divided over the eight-year old economic sanctions against Iraq, discusses policy toward Iraq at future meetings.

HEADLINE: Suha Arafat: A Militant in a Blue BMW

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SONTAG 

DATELINE: GAZA, Feb. 2

 BODY:
Suha Arafat, the First Lady of the Palestinian territories, maneuvered her blue BMW through the chaotic streets of Gaza City, blond hair flying as she dodged donkeys and peddlers.
Behind and beside her, security cars struggled to keep her covered as Palestinians stopped on the street to stare: a woman driver is a strange enough sight in this poor, Islamic society, but Madame Arafat chauffeuring herself? 
 Sitting in a bodyguard's lap, her daughter, Zahwa, bilingual in French and Arabic, chattered away until they rounded a corner under a giant billboard of Yasir Arafat. "Papa!" she said merrily, looking herself like the image of the Palestinian leader -- if he could be reimagined as a 3-year-old girl with a blue hair ribbon. "She is totally her father," Mrs. Arafat said. "A real authoritarian."
Mrs. Arafat, 35, would seem an unlikely partner for the 69-year-old Palestinian revolutionary, who remains forever wedded to his cause.
She was raised in a well-off home in the West Bank, educated by nuns and refined at the Sorbonne. Her black patent leather high heels clash with his combat boots. And her deep-seated Christian faith and Western assertiveness seem at odds with his world: desperate Gaza with its veiled Muslim women.
But in ideology Mrs. Arafat, whose husband is to meet with President Clinton on Thursday in Washington, is every bit the fiery Palestinian freedom fighter. And if there is such a thing as pillow talk in their modest residence, where the spartan first floor is his and the stately second-floor extension belongs to her, Mr. Arafat surely gets an earful.
Mrs. Arafat is a merciless critic not of her husband but of his government, willing to do battle on Palestinian television with advisers she believes are dragging down Mr. Arafat and the Palestinian people.
"Every beautiful flower ends up surrounded by weeds," she said. "I'm fed up with criticizing them. It doesn't do any good. History will be their judge."
Nonetheless, during a long afternoon in the living room of their home, Mrs. Arafat -- surrounded by images of Jesus Christ, Pope John Paul II and a young Mr. Arafat with lantern and gun -- was scathingly critical of many key ventures of the Palestinian Authority.
She dismissed the new Yasir Arafat International Airport, which operates under strict Israeli security supervision, as "a branch of Ben-Gurion in Gaza," referring to the airport outside Tel Aviv. She ridiculed the thriving Palestinian-run casino in Jericho as "a disgrace."
"I hate it," she said. "It's the most shameful act that the economic counselors of the Palestinian Authority did. Right across from a refugee camp, no less. We have no hospitals, no sewage, sick children, a whole sick society. But, oh, we have gambling. Great."
And she mocked the American-brokered peace agreement signed by her husband and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel in October. She did not attend the signing ceremony in Washington, and since the agreement's fulfillment has been frozen for two months, she feels justified.
"Each time we're going to get how many new inches of land, we have to make a celebration?" she said. "It turns out it was only a photo opportunity."
For years after they were secretly married in Tunis almost a decade ago, Mrs. Arafat was dismissed as a "decoration" for the longtime bachelor, particularly by the inner circle of the Palestine Liberation Organization, who could not bear the sight of their fearless leader making goo-goo eyes.
"It was not easy to enter into their world," she said. "It is a man's world, and very closed -- like a family with a lot of intermarriages, and, well, you know the result of that."
But by speaking her mind and by establishing humanitarian institutions in Gaza, Mrs. Arafat has earned a place for herself as a Palestinian leader in her own right.
"She is like a big mother for the people," said Randa Bamia, the director general for international relations at the Palestinian tourism ministry. "She feels a lot for their miseries, and she's very popular because of it. At first they wanted to make her out to be frivolous, but really she lives much more modestly than the wife of most any minister in her husband's government."
In "Arafat, From Defender to Dictator," a new biography of Mr. Arafat published in London by Bloomsbury, Said K. Aburish, a Palestinian-born journalist, said he had tried to but could not find any basis to rumors that Mrs. Arafat took advantage of her role by making business deals.
As she did this past autumn, Mrs. Arafat often spends months at a time abroad, usually in Paris, where her parents keep an apartment. That has fueled other rumors, that she was away on shopping sprees, but she said she spent most of her time there fund-raising for her relief organizations. In her Gaza life style, there is no obvious bounty of any mad spending.
Compared with the villas of some Palestinian officials and business executives, the simple house rented by the Arafats is humdrum and middle-class. Mrs. Arafat said she had to beg her husband for the second-floor addition so she and Zahwa would not have to share the lower floor's two rooms with his security entourage.
When she finally unveiled the tasteful but hardly lavish second floor, Mr. Arafat told her it looked like a cabaret and returned to his monk's quarters downstairs, she said.
When Mrs. Arafat is in town, she visits Gaza's refugee camps regularly, soaking up their tales of hardship and also their complaints about her husband's government, many of which she can't help agreeing with.
Mrs. Arafat endeared herself to many in the camps when she refused on principle to accept a VIP pass from the Israelis that would have allowed her to cross Israeli roadblocks without the hassle that most Palestinians face.
Mrs. Arafat keeps a small office at one of her relief organizations, a foundation for physically disabled children. The center is a bright and modern place, filled with the latest developmental toys, and Mrs. Arafat seems to have a personal relationship with the children.
They stroke her hair, and she hands out chocolates and quizzes the teachers about their progress. Presented with a problem by her staff, she wonders aloud if she can find a donor to solve it, remarking that a French delegation is visiting on Wednesday.
"Some people in the Authority are not very helpful," she said. "They want to talk politics but not humanitarian things. But people are fed up with politics. So what if Netanyahu gives up 30, 40, 60 percent of our land? The people want food on their table, and decent health care."
"The President is doing a lot," she continued, referring to her husband. "Sometimes he screams at me when he comes home. 'Can you imagine today you cost me $100,000, Suha?' But he is very kind this way."
Sipping black coffee spiced with cardamom, Mrs. Arafat spoke of intense pressures on her husband to put off the declaration of a Palestinian state on May 4, the date that the Oslo peace accord set for the conclusion of a final agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
"I think, as Suha and not as the wife of Arafat, that this date is sacred," she said, "and nobody in the world has the right to make us bargain it away. We can't go on and on in this ambiguous condition."
Depressed about what sees as a failing peace effort and corruption within the Palestinian Authority, Mrs. Arafat said her vision of the future was "black."
Born in Jerusalem, Mrs. Arafat grew up in an affluent and political household, first in Nablus, then Ramallah. Her father was a banker and her mother, Raymonda Tawil, a well-known and provocative journalist who was frequently placed under house arrest by the Israelis. When she met the Palestinian leader, during a trip to Amman, Mrs. Arafat was working as a freelance journalist based in Paris.
Smitten, he hired her to do public relations for the P.L.O. in Tunis, where she nominally converted to Islam before they married.
"I married a myth," she said. "But the marriage helped him step down from his pedestal and become a human being."
More tender than the old guerrilla leader, her husband still lives in a kind of bubble, focused on the struggle, she said. Once he sat next to Catherine Deneuve at a dinner without seeming to notice, and Mrs. Arafat had to educate him about the French actress by using her Paris Match magazines, she said.
But the real instruction comes from Zahwa, who was named for the Palestinian leader's mother. An irrepressible and commanding little girl with a mop of curly hair, she stormed and complained when she did not see her father enough.
Now, when he is in Gaza, his bodyguards pick her up from school and take her to his seaside office. A veteran watcher of CNN on the lap of her mother, Zahwa tells her father about Bill Clinton and Kofi Annan and Monica Lewinsky, all the important TV characters.
"Zahwa softens Arafat," Mrs. Arafat said.

Irish Struggling With Big Ten Decision

BYLINE: By JOE DRAPE 

 BODY:
Notre Dame Coach Bob Davie knows he has a reliable spiel when he sits in living rooms across the nation with potential recruits and their parents. He tells them about his program's national television contract and how, through 111 years of winning football, the Catholic university has been one of the few and certainly the most famous independent team in the nation.
But on Friday, Davie, along with the rest of the Notre Dame community, will find out how much longer that might be true. The university president, the Rev. Edward A. Malloy, will present a recommendation to the board of trustees on whether Notre Dame should seek an affiliation with the Big Ten Conference. 
 "It's a win-win situation, though I'm glad I'm not making the decision," Davie said. "There is a concern about the unknown. Would Notre Dame remain as unique as Notre Dame is, if it were aligned with a conference? We're in an enviable position as an independent."
The decision to join Penn State, Michigan, Ohio State and eight other Midwest institutions, is as much about academics and the fate of its less-famous sports teams, which are now affiliated with the Big East, as it is about football. The Big Ten has not invited Notre Dame to join, but the conference has engaged in months of what its commissioner, Jim Delany, calls "comprehensive information exchange."
"We think that they would be a great addition to our conference," Delany said, acknowledging that the Big Ten had previously approached the Fighting Irish. "But that's far short of offering an invitation or coming to a membership agreement. We have some heavy lifting to do if they are interested in moving forward."
The Notre Dame community appears split on the decision. Its faculty senate has endorsed the alliance because it would allow Notre Dame to share information and research materials with conference schools, and the University of Chicago.
But students appear less eager, as demonstrated by the chants of "No Big Ten" at basketball games as the board of trustees' meeting draws near. Alumni are concerned that the university might lose its identity as an independent Catholic university.
Currently, Notre Dame keeps its gate receipts from football, its bowl payouts and the $7 million a year from its television contract with NBC, a contract that will reap $8 million annually in the years 2000 to 2005.
If it joined the Big Ten, however, Notre Dame would have to share its gate receipts, television revenue and other earnings with member schools.
This past bowl season, according to Delany, the conference grossed about $25 million, with $19 million divided among 11 members.The other $6 million was shared by the five schools that played in bowl games.
"Our revenues have grown from $18 million 10 years ago to over $70 million today," said Delany, who expects to reach $100 million in the next two years.
Notre Dame's biggest concession would be giving up the independent television contract that has helped spread its mystique and has aided Davie's recruiting pitch. Instead, the team would be included in the Big Ten contract with ABC.
Mike Wadsworth, the Notre Dame athletic director, has said a deal with the Big Ten would be a wash economically because of factors such as reduced travel time. The nearest rival for its teams playing in the Big East Conference is more than 350 miles away.
Michael A. Tranghese, the Big East commissioner, said his office has not been privy to Notre Dame's negotiations, but says his conference would survive if the Fighting Irish defected. "If they think they should go, then they should go," he said.
Davie said talk of joining the Big Ten did not come up among players in the recently concluded recruiting period, but it wasn't far from his mind.
"You like to sit in a young man's home and sell them on the uniqueness we have," he said. "But I understand, it's just not a football question."

HEADLINE: Final Arguments in Gun Suit Turn on Question of Negligence

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
Lawyers for relatives of six people killed with illegally obtained handguns presented closing arguments yesterday in a lawsuit in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, saying that 25 gun manufacturers were liable for the slayings because "negligent marketing" practices "put the guns into the hands of the shooters."
The lawyers held that it did not matter which of the companies actually made the guns used in the killings, because the distribution practices of all the companies fostered widespread illegal trafficking in their products, creating a "toxic waste flow" of illicitly available weapons. 
 But lawyers for the manufacturers presented a sharply different view of the month's worth of testimony in the trial.
"Trying to hold manufacturers of legitimately produced products responsible for the acts of these outlaws" -- those who trafficked illegally in guns and those who pulled the triggers -- is "simply wrong," one of the industry lawyers said.
Contending that the plaintiffs' case was built on "smoke and generalities," the lawyer, James P. Dorr, told the jury that the plaintiffs in the suit had presented "no evidence that negligence by any manufacturer was the proximate cause of these shootings."
He also asserted that their collective liability theory was the equivalent of holding all car makers liable for an injury caused by a drunken driver in one car.
The lawsuit was brought by the slaying victims' relatives and a seventh person who was severely wounded by an illegally obtained handgun.
Legal experts say it is the first suit to come to trial that charged that industrywide negligent distribution by the nation's gun producers made them collectively liable for shootings with guns that they had legally made and sold but that ended up in the hands of criminals, youths and others not authorized to have them.
The jury is expected to begin deliberating today.
The trial is being watched across the country because the plaintiffs' argument is similar to contentions in lawsuits that Chicago and other cities have recently filed, or plan to file, against the gun industry, much as states have sued the tobacco industry.
The seven shootings at issue in the Brooklyn trial took place in the New York City area in 1993 and 1994 and involved robberies, disputes and apparently one accident. A lawyer for the plaintiffs, Denise Dunleavy, suggested varying amounts of damages for the plaintiffs, should the jury find the companies liable. The suggestions ranged from several hundred thousand dollars for the mother of one victim to as much as "7, 8, 10 million" for Steven Fox, a Queens teen-ager who survived the apparently accidental shooting with a bullet still in his brain.
In only one of the seven shootings was a gun recovered, but another plaintiffs' lawyer, Elisa Barnes, told the jurors that "it simply doesn't matter because in this illegal market, all the guns are the same."
She recalled that economic and statistical consultants for her side had testified that 90 percent of handguns used in crimes in New York State in recent years had originally been sold in other states, often Southern states with weaker gun control laws. She held that the manufacturers had regularly oversupplied dealers in the states with weak gun laws and that many of the excess guns ended up in the hands of illegal traffickers, who resold them in states with strong laws, like New York.
In his remarks, Mr. Dorr, the defense lawyer, recalled testimony in which an economist had charged that the oversupply argument was based on flawed statistics. He told the jurors that "there is no oversupply" of guns to various states and that the criminal trafficking across state lines "is not connected to anything in the lawful marketing" by the gun makers.
The companies, he said, cooperate as much as they can with law enforcement agencies in fighting illegal trafficking.
As the lawyers clashed, one of the plaintiffs watching in the gallery, Freddie Hamilton -- whose son, Njuzi Ray, 17, was killed in one of the shootings -- expressed optimism that the jury would see the case the plaintiffs' way. And, alluding to the four years since the suit was filed, the 55-year-old woman said: "I'm glad it's almost over. It's very draining."

HEADLINE: Pataki Retreats on Paying For Early Schooling Plans

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 3

 BODY:
In his State of the State Message a year ago, Gov. George E. Pataki said it was time to "declare, once and for all, what we all know to be the case" -- that prekindergarten programs work. And he promised to increase spending on such programs tenfold by 2001.
But in his budget message last week, the Governor appeared to make a sharp turn in the opposite direction, proposing to eliminate some early-childhood programs and cut back spending on others, including the prekindergarten programs he praised so warmly last year. 
 The new plan has left school districts perplexed and furious, with some scrambling to come up with money they thought had been promised and others wondering whether to abandon the effort entirely.
In New York City, for example, Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew today warned that thousands of children might lose out on prekindergarten as a result of the Governor's proposed cuts. Dr. Crew said the city wants to offer the program to 29,000 children next year, up from 14,000 this year, and to all 112,000 of the city's 4-year-olds in four years.
"As far as I am concerned, they are at risk," Dr. Crew said of the universal prekindergarten classes. "They are unfunded mandates at this juncture."
The districts, from New York City to Syracuse to Buffalo, had been counting on hundreds of millions of dollars in additional state aid, based on an agreement that Mr. Pataki and the Legislature reached in 1997 to phase in programs for very young students over the next few years.
The money, which would have totaled about $1.5 billion in the school year beginning in 2001, was intended to help the districts provide prekindergarten classes for all 4-year-olds, smaller class sizes in the early grades and all-day kindergarten for districts that now have either no kindergarten, or only half-day sessions. Some of the money was also earmarked for school construction, textbooks and computers.
But in his budget proposal, Mr. Pataki sought to back away from that agreement. He delivered the promised construction money, but proposed eliminating allocations for prekindergarten, kindergarten, and smaller classes, offering instead to provide school districts with a more modest cash grant that could be used for programs of their choosing.
His aides say that that approach would give districts greater flexibility. But it has also stirred confusion and uncertainty among school districts, particularly those that are already making plans to hire additional teachers and find new classroom space to carry out the programs next year.
Mr. Pataki's proposal would have the greatest impact on New York City, which would receive a $77 million state educational grant in lieu of the $150 million it would have otherwise received for early-childhood programs. The money from the original deal, school officials said, would have enabled the city to hire 600 additional teachers to reduce class size in the first, second and third grades, as well as add 4,000 full-day prekindergarten slots.
But now, those plans are on hold. "We have no rational basis for talking about the next school year," said Steven K. Allinger, a lobbyist for the New York City Board of Education. "We hope we can convince the Governor to restore the funding to these initiatives."
New York City is by no means the only district that has been caught by surprise. In Rochester and Buffalo, for example, school officials had planned to add a combined 1,536 prekindergarten slots for the coming school year. But those plans are suddenly up in the air as a result of Mr. Pataki's proposal, according to the officials.
"You can't wait until August to decide that you're going to expand the program by several hundred slots, particularly in large city schools that have critical classroom space problems," said Georgia M. Asciutto, the executive director for the Conference of Big Five School Districts, which represents the state's five largest urban school districts, including Rochester and Buffalo. "That process has to start much earlier than that."
Over all, the agreement Mr. Pataki reached with the Legislature in 1997 would have provided school districts around the state with $100 million in 1999-2000 for prekindergarten classes, $75 million for class size reduction, $10 million for full-day kindergarten, $50 million for school maintenance, along with several smaller allocations.
The Governor would replace all of those programs, totaling $270 million, with a grant of $200 million. The administration contends that the 1997 deal placed too many restrictions on school districts in return for the financing. Mr. Pataki himself noted that of the 120 school districts that qualified for the additional money last year, only half applied.
But education advocates and school officials say abrogating the 1997 deal would almost certainly mean that districts would abandon the prekindergarten, kindergarten and class size initiatives. If districts are free to spend the proposed grant as they please, officials said, they would have little incentive to use the money for the ambitious programs for young students, particularly if the Governor has his way in giving districts an increase in state aid that is below the rate of inflation.
Beyond that, Mr. Pataki's critics say that the $200 million grant he is proposing is far less money than the state would have spent under the 1997 deal. Mr. Pataki's aides do not dispute that, but note that he intends to supplement the state grant with $100 million in Federal money that has been allocated to help schools reduce class size in the early grades. But his critics maintain that the state should not be reneging on its financial commitment to early-childhood programs just because the Federal Government is now providing money for the same purpose.
The reaction to Mr. Pataki's plan is almost certain to make it the focus of sharp debate in the Legislature, where members of both parties are already under intense pressure from their constituents to preserve financing for the relatively popular early-childhood programs.

HEADLINE: John Service, a Purged 'China Hand,' Dies at 89

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER 

 BODY:
John S. Service, the first of the "old China hands" purged from the State Department in the McCarthy era, died yesterday in Oakland, Calif. He was 89.
As a young Foreign Service officer in World War II, he filed prescient reports on the rival forces battling the occupying Japanese -- Chiang Kai-shek's nationalists and Mao Zedong's Communists -- and observed the corruption and weakness of the former. 
 But after the war, as what became known as the China Lobby swung American policy strongly behind the failing Chiang Government -- the Communists gained full control of the mainland in 1949, driving the Nationalists to Taiwan -- much of the blame fell on what was said at the time to be a pro-Soviet conspiracy in the State Department.
"Who lost China?" became a major election slogan that shaped American political life for many years. It helped make the careers of Joseph R. McCarthy and Richard M. Nixon and, according to some historians, helped shape American involvement in the Korean and Vietnam wars.
Mr. Service once predicted wryly that although he never used his middle name, only the initial, his obituary would identify him not only as an official once accused of espionage, but as "John Stewart Service."
The accusers of those men spelled out their full names, and so they went down in history: John Stewart Service, John Carter Vincent, John Paton Davies, Oliver Edmund Clubb. All were forced out of the Foreign Service. All were eventually vindicated, but neither they nor, some thought, the Foreign Service itself ever fully recovered.
Their ordeal actually began during World War II in the efforts of an American mission led by Gen. Joseph W. (Vinegar Joe) Stilwell to expand the Chinese war effort against Japan. The China experts, traveling through the areas controlled by various warlords, reported that Chiang's Nationalist Party, the Kuomintang, was dragging its feet, reserving its American-supplied arms for an eventual showdown with the Communists.
The old China hands predicted that in such a fight, the Communists would win. They called instead for American pressure on Chiang to reform his Government and direct his forces against the Japanese, in cooperation with the Communists.
"Selfish and corrupt, incapable and obstructive," were a few of the words Mr. Service used to describe the Chiang Government in a 1944 memo to General Stilwell.
Like many of his generation of China hands, Mr. Service was born in China of missionary parents, on Aug. 8, 1909, in Chengdu, where his parents had founded a branch of the Y.M.C.A.
He grew up in Sichuan province, attended high school in Shanghai and studied art history at Oberlin College in Ohio, where he also was captain of the track team. Returning to China in 1932, he married an Oberlin classmate, Caroline Schulz, the daughter of an Army officer.
After a brief stint in a bank, he joined the Foreign Service, and when the Japanese entered Beijing, he escorted American refugees through the lines to safety.
He was assigned to the new Nationalist capital at Chongqing as a political officer in 1941. His job was to gather information from all factions and parties, including the Communists. As political officers do today, he gave briefings to visiting American journalists, including Theodore H. White and Eric Sevareid. Those activities were later cast in a controversial light.
A lifelong amateur runner, Mr. Service hiked around China with a sleeping bag, eating as well as he could off the land. E. J. Kahn Jr., in his book "The China Hands," quotes a State Department colleague as saying: "Jack had uncanny instincts. He could walk along a Chinese street and by the kind of matches sold or the clothing worn or the food being cooked, could analyze the structure of the local society."
As the war progressed, Mr. Service warned that a civil war was widely regarded as inevitable, under conditions that would lead to an undemocratic, probably pro-Soviet Communist government.
In July 1944, he finally managed to get to Mao's headquarters in Yanan. He wrote that he felt he had "come into a different country," one marked by hard work, cooperation and "the absence of banditry."
Recording his first impressions, he wrote: "There is an absence of show and formality, both in speech and action. Relations of the officials and people toward us, and of the Chinese themselves, are open, direct and friendly. Mao Zedong and other leaders are universally spoken of with respect (amounting in the case of Mao to a kind of veneration)."
This was in sharp contrast to the "crisis" of the Chiang Government he described in a crucial memo to General Stilwell that Oct. 11. "Recent defeats have exposed its military ineffectiveness and will hasten the approaching economic disaster," he wrote.
But the memo was reportedly leaked to the Nationalist Government. The powerful China Lobby back home was furious, and both General Stilwell and Mr. Service were recalled to Washington. President Roosevelt replaced General Stilwell as his personal envoy with Gen. Patrick J. Hurley.
Mr. Service got back to China as an Army adviser, visiting both sides, but was soon in trouble again. He drafted a letter, signed by the rest of the diplomatic staff in the Nationalist capital, Chongqing, urging that the United States provide aid to the Communists in order to reduce casualties in an expected Allied invasion from the sea. General Hurley charged betrayal and got him recalled, this time for good.
Waiting for reassignment in Washington in April 1945, Mr. Service received a phone call from Mark Gayn, a freelance journalist who was at the time working for Amerasia, a tiny left-wing magazine with strong views on China similar to Mr. Service's own.
Mr. Service met several times with Mr. Gayn and Amerasia's editor-publisher, Philip Jaffe, and lent them copies of some of his reports, a few of which he himself had classified as secret. He later agreed with his accusers that this was an indiscretion, but contended that it was common procedure.
Amerasia was under surveillance by the F.B.I., and agents had repeatedly entered its offices and several apartments, and had taken or photographed documents, including those provided by Mr. Service.
A grand jury looking into the question of whether documents had been illegally obtained voted unanimously against indicting Mr. Service. Others were indicted, and as the result of a plea bargain some were fined and one case was dismissed.
The effects of the case endured, however. The Chinese Communists treated it as proof of American hostility. To American supporters of Chiang, it was proof of an anti-Nationalist conspiracy in the State Department. And in the ensuing years, the right would charge that there was a cover-up in the case.
In 1996, a book based on recently released F.B.I. files suggested there had indeed been a fix in the case, but not the kind the right had charged. In "The Amerasia Spy Case" (University of North Carolina Press), Harvey Klehr and Ronald Radosh wrote that Thomas Corcoran, the prominent former New Dealer turned Washington fixer, had a hand in the case, lobbying the Justice Department to go easy on Mr. Service.
One of Mr. Corcoran's clients was Chiang's Government, and he feared that if the Foreign Service officer went on trial, Mr. Service, like-minded State Department advisers and above all General Stilwell -- who was under a Presidential gag order -- would testify about corruption and other failures of the Nationalists.
Cleared by a State Department loyalty board -- by his count he would eventually pass nine such inquiries -- Mr. Service was to go to Gen. Douglas A. MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo. But as the cold war sharpened and the Chiang Government disintegrated, the search for culprits intensified. Other espionage cases, the Alger Hiss affair, the Soviet explosion of an atom bomb and the Korean war further embittered the dispute.
On the night of Feb. 9, 1950, Senator McCarthy held up a sheaf of paper during a speech in Wheeling, W. Va., and declared, "I have here in my hands a list of 205, known to the Secretary of State as being members of the Communist Party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping the policy of the State Department."
Pressed in Congress, Mr. McCarthy eventually produced 14 names, among them that of Mr. Service, who he charged was a "a known associate and collaborator with Communists."
He was cleared by a Senate committee, which declared that he should not be penalized "by destroying his career and branding him as disloyal for writing what appears to have been the true facts as he saw them."
But on Dec. 13, 1951, a Loyalty Review Board named by President Truman ruled there was "reasonable doubt as to his loyalty." Secretary of State Dean Acheson dismissed him the same day.
He fought the ruling, and in 1956 the Supreme Court ruled 8 to 0 that the Presidential board had no right to review the State Department's findings and that Mr. Acheson had no right to dismiss him. To the surprise of many, he rejoined the State Department and retired from an obscure post in the Liverpool consulate in 1962.
At 53, Mr. Service enrolled in the University of California at Berkeley, received a master's degree and became library curator of its Center for Chinese Studies. With the thaw in Chinese-American relations in the early 1970's, he was able to revisit China several times.
He published several books on China, including a volume of his wartime dispatches, "Last Chance in China" (Random House, 1974).
He is survived by three children, Victoria McCormick of Chevy Chase, Md., Robert Service of Washington, D.C., and Philip Service of Flagstaff, Ariz.; seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

Miffed Models: Quit Pouting And Organize

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
NEW YORK fashion models are hurting, and no one feels their pain.
The rage in fashion magazines is for covers featuring actresses and celebrities like Courteney Cox, Michelle Pfeiffer, Oprah Winfrey and Hillary Rodham Clinton. Editors find that these covers sell better than ones featuring models' faces. They also find celebrities, even movie stars, easier to work with than models. 
 So there's mewling on Seventh Avenue ("The Models Are Angry" was one recent headline) as the industry ponders the awful question raised last week by Conor Kennedy, a booker at Company Models: "If magazines are making such an effort to feature Gwyneth Paltrow over and over again, well, what happens to the next generation of Linda Evangelistas?"
The public's answer thus far has been a resounding: Who cares? As victims, miffed supermodels rank on the sympathy scale just above Arab princes whining over low oil prices. Most Americans rejoice at the thought of models forced to wipe the sullen looks off their faces and look for a job.
But with a little effort, the models might be able to win sympathy here on their home turf as they struggle against the competition from Hollywood. Cover girls, after all, are one of New York's major businesses, and the city's politicians have traditionally provided help to any local industry that complains loud enough.
If millionaire stockbrokers and athletes and taxicab-fleet owners are entitled to special treatment, why not supermodels? Workers of Seventh Avenue, unite! You have nothing to lose but your pouts!
Start by forming the S.O.S (Save Our Supermodels) Committee and make enough campaign contributions to get a public hearing in the City Council. Then tearfully tell of your shattered dreams ("I, like, had to finish high school!") and economic hardships ("You know, I had to pay for this dress").
Give testimony about "totally unfair competition" from celebrities, but avoid lines like "Excuse me, Oprah is such a whale" and "That Hillary cover -- hello, total airbrush!" Also to be avoided: "I mean, Courteney Cox, she's got to be 30." While testifying, try not to fling your hair back while staring blankly into the distance.
Hire a consultant to calculate the tens of billions of dollars generated by models for the New York economy. Count not merely the revenues of the modeling agencies but also the money spent on flowers, dinner, nightclubs, jewelry and cars by men pursuing models. Include a generous "multiplier effect" in the calculations -- say, two investment bankers and one real estate developer per model.
DON'T forget to include the revenues of the garment industry, which stands to lose sales because of the ineptness of amateur models. Stress the endless hours of training to acquire the skills needed for a grueling cover shoot. Demonstrate how a veteran runway model can increase sales by knowing how to "work a dress."
Stress the safety risks of using celebrity models. Illustrate how easily an amateur can start a fire by knocking over a photographer's light. Point out that runways are not designed to support the weight of modern-day celebrities (again, do not mention Oprah by name). Sound bite: "Celebrity models are a tragedy waiting to happen."
Demand tax breaks for models, such as exemptions from sales taxes on cigarettes and other professional supplies. Urge the Mayor to reserve curb space downtown for models' Town Cars and to include a fashion stadium in his West Side sports complex. Above all, advocate a new city agency: the Fashion Models Commission.
Like the Taxi and Limousine Commission, the F.M.C. would license all working models and require them to display a special medallion during any photo shoot. The courts might not allow the F.M.C. to ban celebrities from modeling, but it could achieve the same effect by mandating a long apprenticeship and test. (Sample questions: What is the private line for reservations at Balthazar? How often do you need a glycolic facial peel?)
If all this seems too complicated, there is a simpler solution that requires no legislation: join the teamsters. The union could easily negotiate contracts that prevent celebrities from ever posing again, and there would be one fringe benefit. Once New York's fashion editors tried conducting a photo shoot while a veteran shop steward enforced the teamsters' work rules, no one would ever complain again about models being difficult.

HEADLINE: Record for Women in Washington Legislature

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: OLYMPIA, Wash.

 BODY:
In the Democratic Caucus of the Washington State Senate, male legislators, already outnumbered by their female counterparts 18 to 9, have formed a Last Man's Club, betting among themselves, with a touch of nervous bonhomie, on who will be the final one left before all the caucus members are women.
The men also shrug good-naturedly when asked whatever happened to their posh, marble-lined bathroom in the State Capitol. The women took it over last year, and the men were re-assigned to a decidedly less ornate lavatory, with fewer stalls, that had been the ladies' room. 
 "Democracy in action," explained State Senator Harriet Spanel, smiling sweetly.
Truth be told, women have not yet taken over the Legislature here, but they do constitute 40.8 percent of the membership, the highest percentage of women in any state legislature in the nation's history. The women of Olympia are among the more potent symbols of an electoral tide that has brought record numbers of women into public office this year, notably in the increasingly important state legislatures.
Washington is hardly alone. Women make up 36.5 percent of the Nevada Legislature; 35.6 percent of Arizona's; 33 percent of Colorado's and 32.7 percent of Kansas'.
No legislature anywhere mirrors the proportion of women in the general population, 51 percent. And wide disparities exist among the states. Washington's percentage of women in its legislature is far above the national average of 22.3 percent, and much greater than that of the state at the other end of the spectrum, Alabama, where 7.9 percent of state lawmakers are women.
But enough states have a critical mass of women that an old debate has fresh currency: What difference does it make when women are in charge? And that debate has added meaning as states assume power in areas like welfare and health care.
Some academic studies indicate that legislatures with greater numbers of women are more favorably inclined toward measures involving care for children and the elderly and women's health issues, a view with which many lawmakers here and elsewhere heartily concur.
"I think, generally, men like tax-type issues, they like criminal-justice issues," said State Senator Shirley Winsley, a Republican from the Tacoma area, who has served in the Legislature for 22 of the last 26 years. "When you get down to the nitty-gritty issues of dealing with children, aging, long-term care, all those are things that are a natural for women. They're wives, they're mothers, they've been much more active in the schools."
But even many female legislators, noting that women are hardly monolithic in their views, question whether there is a women's agenda to be advanced with their rising numbers.
"I personally sometimes kind of bristle at the idea that there are 'women's issues' for us to carry," said Representative Cheryl Pflug, a Republican in a district outside Seattle who ran on a platform of lowering taxes and tackling traffic congestion and suburban sprawl.
As for the mechanics of political power, some experts note that women have not yet captured their share of the most powerful positions in the legislatures, like House speaker.
Here in Washington, for instance, the picture is mixed. Women do hold 12 of the 15 standing committee chairmanships in the Senate, and 5 of the top 6 Democratic leadership positions in the Senate. On the other hand, the four top leadership positions in the Senate and the House are held by men, and no woman has ever served as speaker.
Still, the raw numbers are striking. In 1969, women held just 4 percent of all state legislative seats in the country, according to statistics compiled by the Center for the American Woman and Politics at the Eagleton Institute at Rutgers University. In every two-year election cycle since then, that percentage has risen -- to 10.3 percent in 1979, 20.5 percent in 1993, and 22.3 percent today.
By comparison, in the United States Congress, 9 women serve in the 100-member Senate and 56 in the House (12.9 percent of the membership there); both numbers are all-time highs, according to the Rutgers institute. The number of women in statewide elective posts is 89, also a record, representing 27.6 percent of the available positions. Female legislators are disproportionately Democratic, while women in executive positions are more evenly divided between the two major parties.
Washington State has long drawn attention for the high numbers of women who hold public office. Even so, the inroads in the Legislature stand out. Twenty-three of the 49 state senators are women, as are 37 of the 98 state representatives.
"I've traveled around the country and spoken with a lot of lawmakers in other states," said State Senator Pat Thibaudeau, a Seattle Democrat. "And I've never seen a woman yet, be she Republican or Democrat, who doesn't get this big smile on her face when I tell her that we're almost half the Legislature."
One question that has been widely explored is just why women seem to hold much larger percentages of legislative seats in Western states than they do in many other parts of the country, especially the South. (By comparison, New York's Legislature is 20.9 percent female, Connecticut's 29.4 percent, and New Jersey's 16.7 percent.) The most widely advanced theory seems to be that the Western states' pioneering traditions created a culture in which it was acceptable and even necessary for women to exert strong leadership roles. Many of these states were also among the first to give women the right to vote.
"A woman had to be able to shoot dinner, chop the wood, harness the horses," said State Senator Valoria Loveland, a Democrat from southeastern Washington. "And I think that's carried over in our history. I was basically raised never to use the word 'can't.' "
But other factors play a role in women's political participation, experts say; for example, women sometimes do better in states with weaker party structures, which tend to be more open to candidates entering politics by untraditional routes.
A larger question is just what difference women make in how government functions and in what kinds of bills get passed. Debbie Walsh, associate director of the Center for the American Woman and Politics, has studied that issue. In particular, Ms. Walsh said, women are generally more likely than men to cite child care (especially as a component of job-training programs), affordable health insurance and long-term care for the elderly as their priority issues, as well as a range of issues dealing with women's rights, including divorce and spousal-abuse laws.
A study by political scientists at the University of Florida, "Impacts of Female Legislators on Policy Making," based on surveys of legislators around the country and released last summer, also found an interesting difference between the sexes: Although Republican women in office express more conservative views than male Democrats on several issues dealing with taxes, finance and business matters, they are still more likely than those Democratic men to sponsor bills in those "women's-policy" areas, even ones that require additional government or industry financing.
And although lawmakers of both sexes listed education as their top priority, they split on their second issue. Women listed health care; men chose taxes.
Among the female legislators here, many seemed leery of the notion that their priorities might be different from men's, a view echoed by Gov. Gary Locke, a Democrat.
"When I was in the Legislature, we had women who were heads of the environment committee, economic development, education, natural resources, the budget, local government," Governor Locke said in an interview. "They were experts in a wide variety of issues."
But many other female lawmakers said it was natural for their priorities to be somewhat different.
"When more women come into the process," said Senator Pat Hale, a Republican from eastern Washington, "I think the debate changes, and that's healthy."

HEADLINE: Museum-Financing Dispute Underscores Giuliani-Pataki Rift

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY 

 BODY:
Plans to announce a long-awaited expansion of New York's Holocaust museum at a ceremony today have been postponed because of a heated dispute over its financing between Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki, whose rift appears to widen by the day.
Aides to Mayor Giuliani said yesterday that the city and the state had agreed to chip in $11 million each to help pay for the proposed expansion but that the state had recently reneged on its verbal commitment. 
 The Giuliani administration is determined to come up with more money to cover the state's share, city officials said, but would need the support of Peter F. Vallone, the City Council Speaker, who is out of town this week. Therefore, they decided to postpone the announcement until at least next week.
This version of events was described as approaching fiction by various members of the Pataki administration.
Brad Race, Governor Pataki's chief of staff, denied yesterday that the state had agreed to contribute the $11 million; in fact, he said, the state had never even been asked to make such a commitment.
And James F. Gill, whom the Governor appointed as chairman of the Battery Park City Authority -- a state-run agency that controls the land on which the museum sits -- approached apoplexy in disputing the Giuliani administration's version of events.
He said that the agreement had always called for the city to contribute $22 million, while the authority would cede the land on which to build the expansion. "It was always the deal -- it was the deal at the get-go," he insisted. The city's contention, he said, "is made out of whole cloth. It's nonsense. It's garbage. And frankly, I resent it."
To which Randy Levine, the city's Deputy Mayor of Economic Development, said: "If the state had kept its $11 million in, we could have gone forward. I'm telling you, they made the commitment."
Whatever the truth regarding the museum issue, it seemed clear from the nasty charges and countercharges that the awkward detente between the state's two Republican leaders is no more.
It was particularly remarkable that their feud should touch an issue as politically delicate as the Holocaust museum, given that both men will no doubt continue to court Jewish voters and contributors as they pursue possible national ambitions.
Those ambitions could well collide in a party that may be able to handle only one New York Republican at a time. And the men harbor a mutual distrust that dates back to Mr. Giuliani's decision to back Mr. Pataki's opponent and eventual victim, Mario M. Cuomo, in 1994.
Since then, the Governor and the Mayor have professed to enjoy a fruitful relationship, with Mr. Giuliani endorsing Mr. Pataki's re-election last fall.
But in recent weeks, the two camps have appeared to go out of their way to antagonize each other.
Mr. Giuliani, for example, did not check with Mr. Pataki last month before proposing a plan to build a domed football stadium on Manhattan's West Side, even though the Governor controls the land on which it would be built.
And Mr. Pataki surprised Mr. Giuliani by recently announcing plans to investigate the School Construction Authority, even though the Governor's appointee to the authority was at the center of recent charges of mismanagement.
All this behind-the-scenes tension sets the stage for a potential spectacle whenever the two men are expected to appear at the same function, as they were for the planned announcement of the expansion of the Museum of Jewish Heritage -- A Living Memorial to the Holocaust, which opened in 1997 on land at the southern tip of Manhattan.
Two men who were integral in establishing the museum, Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan District Attorney, and Howard Rubenstein, the public relations consultant, said yesterday that both Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Pataki have long been supportive of the endeavor to memorialize, through exhibits and recorded testimony, the Holocaust. And they both tried to play down a political fight that threatened to overshadow a proposed expansion that took months of negotiations to put together.
"Our feeling is that both sides have done wonderful things for our museum and we will not get embroiled with any dispute," Mr. Rubenstein said.
A dispute has blossomed nevertheless. City officials said that officials from the Pataki administration committed to providing $11 million shortly before Election Day. When they saw no mention of that commitment in the budget plan that Mr. Pataki presented last week, they called to complain.
But Mr. Race had a somewhat different recollection. "I had a conversation last week with City Hall in which the question was raised with me for the very first time," he said. "I responded that that was never a commitment that was ever requested or agreed to by the state. Nobody ever requested the state to put in capital money into this project. Their response was, 'I guess we'll pick it all up."'
Neither Mr. Morgenthau nor Mr. Rubenstein recalled an arrangement in which the state would provide $11 million to the expansion. And Mr. Gill said that he recalled the only question being whether the city would pay its $22 million contribution from the city treasury, or have it deducted from the surplus that it was entitled to from the rents paid at Battery Park City. He said the answer he received was that the city would cover its obligation with money from the treasury.
The final details centered on the press conference to announce the expansion, with the city bragging about its financial contribution and the state boasting of having provided the land (which the Giuliani administration maintains belongs to the city anyway). "It was going to be a wonderful event," Mr. Gill said. "And now at the 12th hour there's this nonsense."
As the dispute emerged, city officials first said they would move the announcement from the neutral ground of the museum to City Hall, the Mayor's turf -- before finally postponing it altogether.
Mr. Morgenthau said that Mr. Levine called him on Tuesday evening to notify him of the postponement. State officials, meanwhile, learned of the change in plans yesterday afternoon. A high-ranking official in the Giuliani administration justified the postponement this way: "What are we going to have an announcement about? The project's not right."
But it soon will be, according to city officials. Colleen Roche, the Mayor's press secretary, said that Mr. Giuliani had reached Mr. Vallone last night, and that Mr. Vallone's recollection of the agreement with the state was the same as those of the Mayor's aides. She said -- and Carolyn Daly, a spokeswoman for the City Council agreed --- that the city could come up with the $22 million total.
Of course, there still remains the vexing question of how to announce the expansion. Said Mr. Rubenstein, "We're hopeful that the two governmental sides will sit down and work it out."

HEADLINE: The Long-Elusive Lynx Is Returned to Colorado

BYLINE: By MINDY SINK 

DATELINE: SOUTH FORK, Colo., Feb. 3

 BODY:
After a few minutes of terrified hesitation, a lynx, a wildcat not seen in Colorado in more than 25 years, was reintroduced here today.
The wildcat, an 18-pound, 3-year-old female, was the first of two lynxes released in the Weminuche Wilderness area of the San Juan Mountains and the first of about 50 lynxes to be reintroduced this year. 
 "They're back!" hollered Gene Byrne, a wildlife biologist with the Colorado Division of Wildlife, as a second cat darted across the sunlit snow here, 45 miles north of the New Mexico border.
"Never left," another wildlife official, Bill Andree, said quietly.
Whether these elusive wildcats were ever really gone from Colorado has been a subject of much speculation in recent years.
But present or not, the lynx has proven divisive. Last October the Earth Liberation Front, an animal rights group, claimed responsibility for a major fire at a ski resort that the group believed was threatening the animals' habitat.
The last known sighting of a lynx in Colorado was near Vail in 1973. Twenty-two have been reported seen in the last 100 years. But there is no doubt that the animal once roamed this state freely.
"This was a relatively common species in Colorado before the 20th century," said Todd Malmsbury, a spokesman for the Colorado Division of Wildlife. "We can't say if their decline was caused by human settlement and all its impacts -- mining, pollution, agriculture, recreation -- or something else."
The lynx's disappearance may have also been a result of a decline in their primary prey, the snowshoe hare, or of trapping.
The spread of development in the Vail area prevented officials from releasing the wildcats there. Instead, they settled on this site next to the San Juan-Rio Grande National Forest, about 200 miles from the popular ski resort area.
"There are too many people, too many dogs, too many everything up there," Mr. Malmsbury said. "It doesn't mean they can't repopulate there though."
Cal Joyner, a supervisor for the United States Forest Service, said: "This is their entryway into 6,500 square miles of wilderness. We don't anticipate them staying anywhere near where we drop them off."
The lynxes released today, which were brought 1,700 miles from British Columbia last week, are part of a $2 million, five-year program by the Colorado Division of Wildlife.
"The American people expect native species present on their national forest lands," Mr. Joyner said.
The reintroduction provoked an unsuccessful lawsuit by local cattlemen and tour groups anticipating that the animal's presence would bring about restrictions on land use.
Their primary concern is not the lynx, which is not a natural predator of livestock, but the restrictions that may result if the Government decides that the cats are a "threatened" or "endangered" species.
"Once the lynx is here, the Federal Government can impose restrictions on the land, and that may hurt the outfitters and ranchers economically," said William Perry Pendley, president of the Mountain States Legal Foundation, which represented the Cattlemen's Association in the lawsuit.
A decision on whether to include the lynx on the endangered species list is expected by summer. Several states -- Montana, Idaho, Maine and Washington -- are believed to have lynx populations. It is on Colorado's endangered species list.
"We just assumed they were here before, but once they're legally listed, we don't know what falls after that," said Freeman Lester, a 63-year-old rancher and president of the Colorado Cattlemen's Association.

HEADLINE: Rise in Number of Children Born Into Poverty in New York City

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
Despite an improving economy in New York, more than half of the city's children are born into poverty, a report released yesterday by a children's advocacy group says.
More than 66,000 of the nearly 127,000 children born in New York City in 1996, or about 52.2 percent, were born to families with incomes under the Federal poverty level of $23,000 a year for a family of three, the 216-page report said. The percentage of children born into poverty was the highest ever, surpassing 51.7 percent in 1994 and 39 percent in 1990, according to the report, which was prepared by the Citizens' Committee for Children of New York. 
 The reasons for the rise were not clear, the group said. But the report noted that there were worsening situations in related areas, which include an increase in the number of homeless children and a decline in the number of children reading at grade level, which point to cutbacks at city agencies like the Department of Homeless Services and the Administration for Children's Services.
"The data paint a very alarming picture," said Gail Nayowith, executive director of the Citizens' Committee. "There's a relationship between government spending and outcomes, whether it's the number of children living in poverty or reading at grade level. You get what you pay for."
The group said that there have been spending cuts in 4 out of 19 city agencies that serve children, including a 16.7 percent drop in spending at the homeless-services department from fiscal 1994 to 1998, to $378 million from $454 million.
Samantha I. Lugo, a spokeswoman for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, declined to comment on specific points in the Citizens' Committee report. In a prepared statement, she said: "This administration is proud of its record in regard to children. In funds combined, we have spent more money on children than any other administration in the history of the city." She cited such programs as day care financing and Project Read, an after-school program to improve the reading skills of elementary-school children.
Ms. Nayowith said the rise in the percentage of children born into poverty stemmed mainly from increases among white and Asian families. The percentage of black and Hispanic babies born into poverty stayed roughly the same: about 60 percent of black infants and 75 percent of Hispanic babies. But the percentage of white children born into poverty rose in 1996 to 21.6 percent from 12.8 percent in 1990, and among Asians the percentage went up to 47.7 percent in 1996 from 21.9 in 1990.
"We don't know why this is the case," Ms. Nayowith said, "but it may have something to do with increased immigration and perhaps a mismatch in skills between those in poverty and what the economy demands."
The report cited a large number of what it called "risks to child well-being," including poverty, unemployment, teen-age pregnancies, low birth weight, juvenile arrests, and high-school-dropout rates. The group cited scores of city, state and Federal sources of information.
But the group acknowledged conflicts within the data, including different definitions of poverty in different reports.

Credit Card Survey Finds Climbing Fees

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
With holiday shopping bills coming due, city officials warned yesterday that although interest rates on credit cards have declined slightly since last year, customers who do not pay their bills on time are facing skyrocketing late fees.
In its second annual survey of credit card interest rates and fees, the Department of Consumer Affairs found that for 21 cards with a fixed average annual percentage rate, the interest rate dropped an average of 1 percentage point, from 16.05 percent last year to 14.98 percent this year. For 41 cards with variable rates, the rate dropped from 14.58 percent to 13.91 percent. 
 At the same time, the survey found, monthly late charges -- a recent innovation in the credit card business -- increased 19 percent, to an average of $22. More than half the cards in the survey carried higher late fees this year than last year.
Comparing these late charges to the surcharges on transactions at automatic teller machines, the Consumer Affairs Commissioner, Jules Polonetsky, accused the credit card issuers of "double-dipping" because consumers already pay interest on their credit card balance.
"We found that the exorbitant late charges, which are a relatively new phenomenon, are becoming a new profit center for banks that issue credit cards," Mr. Polonetsky said yesterday at a news conference at the department's offices. Someone who is a day late with a small minimum payment may spend more on a late fee than the amount owed.
A banking industry spokesman acknowledged that credit card issuers were seeking new ways to charge for services, but said late fees were also intended as a protection against bankruptcies. "The first thing to go south in a bankruptcy is the credit card," said Joe D. Belew, a spokesman for the Consumer Bankers Association, which represents 150 large banks. "We need to get the message across that you need to pay on time."

HEADLINE: Nerds In Gilded Cubicles

BYLINE: By GARY ANDREW POOLE 

 BODY:
WHEN Eric Schmidt, chief executive of Novell, joined the company nearly two years ago, he would meet a smart employee and wonder why the person still worked there. Not only had Novell, the world's fifth-largest software maker, missed the Internet phenomenon and been hampered by product delays, but it also had some of the ugliest offices in the area.
In Silicon Valley, where many corporate "campuses" resemble destination resorts, Novell looked like an hourly motel. It was hampering Mr. Schmidt's ability to attract and retain the brightest programmers. Salespeople were embarrassed to bring customers to the office. 
 Mr. Schmidt made the decision to go ahead with a new $130 million campus in San Jose, Calif., with tennis, volleyball and basketball courts, a restaurant, a gym and an espresso bar. "To compete in an extremely tight labor market, our campus had to have at least the quality of our competitors'," Mr. Schmidt said recently as he admired his complex, which opened in December. He is particularly proud of the look of the campus, which was inspired by a trip to Venice. Many of the buildings are made of Olympia cream limestone, a light-colored stone imported from Tunisia, because Mr. Schmidt was awed by the colors of St. Mark's Square.
To lure talent in an industry desperate for it, Mr. Schmidt and other Silicon Valley chief executives have become part-time architects, restaurateurs, fitness gurus and concert promoters. Companies are trying to out-perk one another. Some of the best gyms and restaurants here are not open to the public. As the saying goes: Want a good meal? Go to work.
In Silicon Valley, surly servers in hairnets do not dish out mushy mystery meat. The best meals are served at corporate cafeterias where technology workers choose their own pieces of fish or meat and have the chefs grill them to order. Like hoteliers, chief executives brag to other chief executives about their chefs.
Cooks like Lucent Technology's executive chef, Ronald Sullivan, can write their own meal ticket. "I come in early, I leave early, and I don't work weekends," Mr. Sullivan said, taking a break from preparing a basmati rice salad with currants and mixed nuts, to be sold at the highly subsidized price of $4.35, for employees at Lucent's Coyote Creek Cafe.
Why are technology companies, especially large ones, so enraptured with creating fine eateries and other perks?
"We are living in an economy that is driven by skills, and the skills bucket is close to empty," said Thornton May, vice president for research and education at Cambridge Technology Partners, a consulting firm. "Companies are desperate for skilled workers. They'll do anything to recruit and keep you."
This flies in the face of Silicon Valley's tradition of frugality. After all, this is the business that popularized the cubicle, stock options in lieu of salary, casual Fridays and tilt-ups (a Valley term for cheap office buildings). But as the industry has grown, a quiet revolution has taken place. Companies flush with money are investing not only in in-house restaurants but also in gyms with tae kwan do; spinning and yoga classes; pool and Ping-Pong tables; free soda, juice and fresh popcorn; massage therapists; dry-cleaning services; car detailers; dog walkers, and roving ergonomics experts.
It also doesn't hurt to present Bob Dylan and his son Jakob -- both Grammy winners. Applied Materials paid $500,000 so the Dylans would help the company celebrate its 30th birthday.
Bob Dylan had never played a public show with Jakob Dylan, who headlines the Wallflowers, which meant that the 12,000 people attending the Applied Materials private celebration had a "once in a lifetime experience," said Richard Garwacki, vice president of Bill Graham Special Events, which organized 60 shows last year for companies, most of them in Silicon Valley. He said that "there's a lot of ego involved" as companies tried to outdo one another.
"Silicon Valley companies have sophisticated, young employees," Mr. Garwacki said. Presenting corporate-party regulars like the Temptations, Chicago or the Beach Boys just won't cut it. Young, hip and perhaps spoiled, geeks want bands with current hits. "We get more requests for new bands like the Barenaked Ladies, Matchbox 20, Smashmouth, No Doubt and the Smashing Pumpkins," Mr. Garwacki added.
One of the Valley's largest growth industries is perk subcontractors. Bay Sport, a manager of corporate fitness centers, was co-founded by Linda and Doug Emery in 1984. Today they have 200 employees and 100 corporate clients. Although it costs $940,000 to build an average 7,500-square-foot club and $200,000 to stock it with the latest exercise gadgetry, Mr. Emery said he could barely keep up with demand.
On Sand Hill Road, a thoroughfare famous for its collection of venture capitalists, Fedele R. Bauccio runs Bon Appetit Management Company, one of the largest catering companies in Silicon Valley. Starting in 1986 with a single executive dining room, Mr. Bauccio now has 140 locations, 50 in the Bay Area. Last year his company generated $200 million in revenue.
"We do not use the term cafeteria at this company," Mr. Bauccio said. "Green beans do not sit in water for hours at one of our restaurants. We provide fresh food rivaling any fine restaurant." Every in-company restaurant worth its paprika prepares food reflecting the work force's ethnic diversity, he said, with Indian, Japanese and Chinese foods as musts. The Oracle Corporation, based in Redwood Shores, is a Bon Appetit client that is known to have one of the Valley's best Japanese noodle bars, complete with a baby grand piano.
It is not likely that a genius programmer will go to a company just because of its tasty crab cakes, step-class guru or cool hip-hop concerts, but if a company does not provide the standard perks, it will not get on the brightest recruits' short lists.
Of course, at Sun Microsystems' stately Menlo Park campus, the 4,000 workers can eat at several restaurants, including the upscale Java Java, where you can have a generous portion of porcini mushroom and cheese ravioli for $8.25. Sun's fitness center, Fit@Sun, has the latest crazes in fitness classes, including kick-box aerobics. And to keep employees in good humor, Sun brought in the comedian Dana Carvey to perform at a state-of-the-company meeting.
To set itself apart in the perks war, however, Sun has an on-call lactation consultant. Furthermore, it actively helps people interested in adoption. With a $2,500 adoption stipend, Vicky Yee, Sun's corporate diversity manager, went to Guangzhou, China, to adopt her daughter.
Visit Autodesk's headquarters in San Rafael and you will find dogs -- lots of dogs. Kathy Tom-Engle, a spokeswoman, estimated that 100 people had their pooches sleeping in their cubicles. "On occasion you'll hear a growl when you walk around here, but for the most part, the dogs are lazy," she said.
Another popular, and unusual, perk at Autodesk is prepared dinners. An employee can call Rick Gernetti, a chef lured from the film director George Lucas, and he will prepare a gourmet meal that employees can take home and reheat. The company encourages the practice because it keeps employees at work late. A recent dinner selection: blackened salmon with mango salsa, wild rice and vegetables for $6.25 per person. Mr. Gernetti and his staff bake cookies every day, too.
Despite these inducements, established companies are still at a recruitment disadvantage. Since the biggest perk in Silicon Valley continues to be stock options, start ups have the hiring edge. Having a steady but anonymous job at a stable company is not as valued as getting in on the ground floor of a startup where a person has the chance to become a multimillionaire, even the next Bill Gates.
"The greatest difficulties faced by larger companies include a perceived, and often real, lack of willingness to offer equity options or profit sharing," said Michael R. Forrest, president of Job Options, an on-line recruiting company. "As the employment market continues to tighten, they are faced with having to offer salaries and perks to new hires that exceed what the existing work force receives."
Mr. Schmidt said Novell's new 536,000-square-foot campus had already bolstered morale and given him confidence that he would be able to hire hot recruits. Almost every employee has an office because "programmers hate cubicles," he said. Mr. Schmidt encouraged his architect, Hellmuth, Obata & Kassabaum, to create spaces throughout the building where people could gather and talk -- while not creating so much space that people would never meet.
"The density of space in relationship to people is very important in creating a buzz," said Mr. Schmidt, 43, who was an architecture student in college before realizing that he was "truly terrible" at it.
During the building of Novell's campus, Mr. Schmidt was known to say, "Make it so no one has a reason to leave." That mantra seems to be fulfilled. Eat a plate of pasta with salmon, pesto cream and fresh tomatoes ($4.95) at Novell's @cafe.com, ride a stationary bike, sit in one of the Herman Miller Aeron chairs and have a latte at Java City, Novell's coffee bar, and Mr. Schmidt's intended effect seems plausible. "I wouldn't mind if they were working 24 hours a day, seven days a week," Mr. Schmidt said, half-jokingly.

HEADLINE: Marion Boyars, Publisher Of Eclectic Books, Dies at 71

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL 

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 3

 BODY:
Marion Boyars, an independent publisher whose eclectic and internationally minded list of authors included at least four Nobel Prize winners, died on Monday at her home in London. She was 71.
The cause was pancreatic cancer, her family said. 
 In an industry increasingly populated by conglomerates with deep pockets and a penchant for books that appeal to as wide an audience as possible, Mrs. Boyars was rare in her insistence on publishing only what she liked, whether the book was likely to sell or not. "Most of my publishing is out of enthusiasm," she told The New York Times in 1995.
Over the years, often working on a shoestring and struggling to stay afloat, she published some 500 books by such writers as Eudora Welty, Julio Cortazar, Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Georges Bataille, Tim O'Brien, Pauline Kael and Ingmar Bergman, works translated from more than 20 languages. Among the Nobel Prize winners on her list were Heinrich Boll, Elias Canetti, Kenzaburo Oe and Eugenio Montale.
She was born Marion Asmus in New York, and grew up there and in Switzerland. After graduating from Keele University in Staffordshire with a degree in politics, philosophy and economics, she married George Lobbenburg, an American who ran a successful clothing company in Britain. The couple had two daughters.
Divorced in her early 30's, she answered an advertisement in The Bookseller, a London trade magazine, and ended up buying a 50 percent stake in a firm run by the independent publisher John Calder. The two set up business in London under the name Calder & Boyars, publishing works by such authors as Samuel Beckett, Marguerite Duras, Henry Miller, Eugene Ionesco and William S. Burroughs. They also specialized in the writings of modern composers, publishing works by Cage, Ives and Stravinsky, and social commentators including Ivan Illich and Robert Heilbroner.
In an international cause celebre, the company was brought to court here and charged with obscenity in 1966 after publishing "Last Exit to Brooklyn" by Hubert Selby Jr. It lost the original case in the Old Bailey but won on appeal two years later after a successful argument by a young John Mortimer.
But Mrs. Boyars, who by then had married her second husband, Arthur Boyars, fell out with her business partner. Taking along the firm's big money-maker, Ken Kesey's "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," among other things, she eventually set up Marion Boyars Publishers, with offices in London and on East 39th Street in Manhattan.
She published about 25 new books a year, becoming a fixture at the annual Frankfurt Book Fair and mining world literature for anything worthy of publication in English.
Mrs. Boyars formed close friendships with many of her authors. When Michael Ondaatje -- who by then was published by another company -- won the Booker Prize for "The English Patient" in 1992, he publicly thanked her for helping to start his career.
She is survived by Mr. Boyars and her two daughters, Susan Quateman of Beverly, Mass., and Catheryn Kilgarriss of London, who is now managing her publishing house.

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE

 BODY:

Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on page 10.
 
Now Playing
* "AFFLICTION," starring Nick Nolte, James Coburn, Willem Dafoe, Sissy Spacek and Mary Beth Hurt. Directed by Paul Schrader (R, 114 minutes). Mr. Nolte is devastating in the performance of his career, as Wade Whitehouse, a New Hampshire loner fighting a losing battle with demons from his past. Foremost among them: Mr. Coburn, terrifyingly authentic as the drunken, abusive father who long ago cowed his sons into submission. As directed by Mr. Schrader, this pure, unfettered adaptation of Russell Banks's novel starts on a deceptively ordinary note, then escalates into inexorable fury. Every little detail matters. Ms. Spacek and Ms. Hurt expertly play the women who trigger Wade's crisis (Janet Maslin). 

* "ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE," starring James Woods and Melanie Griffith. Directed by Larry Clark (R, 101 minutes). From the director of the bruising and ominous "Kids," this vibrant, unapologetically seedy road movie is a virtual day at the beach. Mr. Clark's second feature may not have the sting of his first, but it comes closer to establishing him as William S. Burroughs with a swooping, pivoting movie camera, bringing bizarrely innocent enthusiasm to material that might otherwise ooze druggy shock value, and making decadence as basic as the weather. Mr. Woods, as a junkie, thief and absurdly unlikely father figure, revels in this full-throttle role (Maslin).
 
"AT FIRST SIGHT," starring Val Kilmer and Mira Sorvino. Directed by Irwin Winkler (PG-13, 128 minutes). In this overlong and often desperately banal version of a case study reported by Dr. Oliver Sacks, Mr. Kilmer plays a man whose nearly lifelong blindness was suddenly alleviated by surgery. Ms. Sorvino plays the bright-eyed New York career woman who falls in love with him, then urges him to change his once-peaceful life. But the film brings little more than case-study data to communicating how this man's restored sight affected him, or what made it a mixed blessing. Sample dialogue: "Have you ever listened to the rain? I mean, really listened?" (Maslin).
 
* "CENTRAL STATION," starring Fernanda Montenegro, Vinicius de Oliveira and Marilia Pera. Directed by Walter Salles (R, 115 minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian gem, a joyless older woman crosses paths with an orphaned young boy. There's plenty of room for sentimentality here, but the wonder of Mr. Salles's film is all in the telling. As these characters develop a fractious bond, then embark on a road trip that takes them vividly to Brazil's hinterlands in search of the boy's father, Mr. Salles brings great tenderness and surprise to the events that punctuate their journey. Ms. Montenegro's tough bravura performance was one of last year's very best (Maslin).
 
* "A CIVIL ACTION," starring John Travolta, Robert Duvall and William H. Macy. Directed by Steven Zaillian (PG-13, 120 minutes). This story of a David-Goliath lawsuit against industrial polluters, with Mr. Travolta first-rate as an ambulance chaser who develops a conscience, could have been business as usual in the legal thriller genre. But Mr. Zaillian's keenly observed, beautifully acted film, based on Jonathan Harr's nonfiction best seller about a case in Woburn, Mass., doesn't follow familiar formulas. It follows all the surprises and frustrations of a story that was never black and white and is all the better for its shades of gray. Mr. Duvall is outstanding as a corporate lawyer full of wily tricks (Maslin).
 
* "THE GENERAL," starring Brendan Gleeson and Jon Voight. Directed by John Boorman (not rated, 125 minutes). Mr. Boorman's best and most stylish film in years is the deftly told story of Martin Cahill. Nicknamed the General for his crime-plotting strategies, this Irish gang leader and master thief is played with splendid brio by Mr. Gleeson. Photographed gorgeously in black and white, the film tells of his elaborate art and jewel heists, his unusual domestic arrangement with his wife's sister and his singular difficulties with the I.R.A. and the law. Mr. Voight is outstandingly good as the police detective who knows all of Cahill's tricks (Maslin).
 
* "HILARY AND JACKIE," starring Emily Watson and Rachel Griffiths. Directed by Anand Tucker (R, 121 minutes). The parallel biographies of the brilliant cellist Jacqueline du Pre (Ms. Watson), who contracted multiple sclerosis at the height of her career, and her slightly older sister, Hilary (Ms. Griffiths), a talented flutist who gave up a professional career to marry and be "ordinary," is one of the most insightful studies of sibling rivalry ever filmed. Jacqueline may have won fame and glory, the movie says, but she remained a desperately needy emotional child who had to have everything Hilary had (including Hilary's husband). The film is structured like a concerto, in three movements, the last of which ends with Jackie's harrowing death in her sister's arms. The drama is deepened by a soundtrack that makes expert use of Jacqueline's signature piece, the Elgar Cello Concerto in E minor. Ms. Watson's Jacqueline flames with an almost scary intensity (Stephen Holden).
 
* "MY NAME IS JOE," starring Peter Mullan and Louise Goodall. Directed by Ken Loach (R, 92 minutes). A splendid, feisty performance by Mr. Mullan energizes this film about a recovering alcoholic trying to rebuild his life. With humor and scrappy intensity, Joe throws himself into coaching young athletes and embarking tenuously on a love affair, only to find the expected challenges to his new sobriety everywhere. Mr. Loach's commitment to delineating social issues is accentuated by the way his star breathes life into Joe and makes viewers root for his success. Special bonus: this film breaks the brogue-and-burr barrier by including helpful subtitles for the overlapping, heavily Scottish-accented dialogue (Maslin).
 
"PATCH ADAMS," starring Robin Williams and Monica Potter. Directed by Tom Shadyac (PG-13, 110 minutes). As a maverick doctor intent on making terminal patients laugh, Mr. Williams delivers a little clowning and a lot of maudlin feel-good sentiment, along with vulgarity left over from the filmmaker's "Ace Ventura" days. He also spends a lot of time being congratulated for his good works, as the film's minor players are kept busy marveling at his antics. The real-life story of this doctor may sound like a fine excuse for Mr. Williams to cut loose, but the film version proves narrow and predictable. Ms. Potter, with a nostrilly resemblance to Julia Roberts, figures in a romantic subplot with a bizarre twist (Maslin).
 
* "THE PRINCE OF EGYPT," starring the voices of Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Sandra Bullock and Michelle Pfeiffer. Directed by Brenda Chapman, Steve Hickner and Simon Wells (PG, 93 minutes). First came the great expectations for this animated magnum opus from Dreamworks. Then came reality, in a film struggling mightily to balance animated whimsy and biblical stature. The upshot is an admirably worthy rendering of the Exodus story, even if Moses must initially be seen as a playful young scamp. Biblical plagues and miracles serve as special inspiration for the animators' reality-bending ingenuity (Maslin).
 
* "RUSHMORE," starring Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray and Olivia Williams. Directed by Wes Anderson (R, 93 minutes). A dryly hilarious portrait of the mogul as a young man, with Mr. Schwartzman a real find as its perfectly horrid little hero, Max Fischer. Max's prep school, Rushmore Academy, does have a faculty, but none of the grown-ups have anything like Max's natural authority. Mr. Murray is sneakily fine as the steel tycoon and Rushmore benefactor who happens to be on Max's own wavelength as they vie for the same beautiful teacher. A particular treat for its skewed, outrageously funny memories of a cutthroat boyhood (Maslin).
 
* "SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE," starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow, Geoffrey Rush, Ben Affleck and Judi Dench. Directed by John Madden (R, 113 minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily literate delight, with an exhilaratingly clever premise that only gets better as the film unfolds. The screenplay, originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm and turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of his "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead," dares to imagine whatever it likes about the link between Shakespeare's artistic passions and his mad yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty. Meanwhile, this tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting and conniving we enjoy today, and has great fun presenting the creation of "Romeo and Juliet," glitches and all. Mr. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow make a fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the first great, fully realized starring performance of her career (Maslin).
 
* "A SIMPLE PLAN," starring Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton and Bridget Fonda. Directed by Sam Raimi (R, 120 minutes). This onetime cult horror director makes a flawless transition to mainstream storytelling with a quietly devastating thriller. And its fine cast plays out the consequences of a harmless-sounding error in judgment that winds up leveling everything in its path. The catalyst is $4.4 million that literally falls out of the sky, and Scott Smith's story proves how deadly the morality of expediency can become. When you get the shivers watching this wintry tale, which features an especially memorable performance from Mr. Thornton, it won't be from the cold (Maslin).
 
"STEPMOM," starring Susan Sarandon, Julia Roberts and Ed Harris. Directed by Chris Columbus (PG-13, 120 minutes). A man's ex-wife and new girlfriend lock horns over who can be nicer to his two children, in a sudsy story made livelier by its two female stars, both in appealingly high gear. Ms. Roberts plays the nicest person ever to wear black to a downtown photo shoot, while the especially fiery Ms. Sarandon plays the suburban mother as mama lion. Even when the prospect of mortality looms, the story manages to maintain its big, lavish look and peculiar (under the circumstances) sense of fun. As in "Home Alone," Mr. Columbus directs with sunny indifference to reality, medical, economic or otherwise (Maslin).
 
"STILL CRAZY," starring Stephen Rea, Billy Connolly, Bill Nighy, Helena Bergstrom, Juliet Aubrey and Jimmy Nail. Directed by Brian Gibson (R, 96 minutes). Twenty years after they last dropped acid in a Druid circle, the members of an over-the-hill English rock band try to reunite, and the results are meant to be both funny and heartwarming. Not an easy mix, unless Spinal Tap really is your idea of a band that needs a second chance. Despite an extremely likable cast that fits right into the spirit of things, the director of "What's Love Got to Do With It" and the writers of "The Commitments" don't drum up enough drama or sustained humor to make the most of their premise. The cast is cheery and game, the material hit-or-miss (Maslin).
 
"THE THIN RED LINE," starring Jim Caviezel, Ben Chaplin, Nick Nolte, Sean Penn and Woody Harrelson. Directed by Terrence Malick (R, 166 minutes). From the first frame of this huge, drifting war epic loosely derived from James Jones's Guadalcanal novel, it's viscerally clear that Mr. Malick is back. The exquisite, oddly detached visual style that made "Badlands" and "Days of Heaven" the most beautiful films of the 1970's is instantly apparent here, even if the narrative vagueness and brooding voice-overs are also familiar. The film sprawls, gets lost and occasionally delivers visual poetry, the kind that could have been greatly helped by tighter editing. Bottom line: no one who admired Mr. Malick's early work should miss this. But those expecting anything simple will not find it here (Maslin).

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Climbed 2.3% in December

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
New orders to American factories rebounded in December but the gain was not enough to prevent 1998 from ending as the weakest year for manufacturing since the recession of 1991.
Orders jumped 2.3 percent, to a seasonally adjusted $343.5 billion in December, the Commerce Department said today. It was the biggest increase in 13 months. 
 Orders for industrial machinery and equipment rose 7.4 percent; for electronic and electrical equipment, 3.6 percent, and for transportation equipment, 1.8 percent.
New orders to factories for all of 1998 -- $4.03 trillion -- were just 2.1 percent higher than the year before. That compared with a healthy 5.4 percent gain in 1997 and was the weakest year since orders declined 2.3 percent seven years earlier.
But orders for computers and office equipment surged 19.4 percent, the biggest gain in 14 years. And orders for communications equipment jumped 12.1 percent.
Orders for durable goods -- big-ticket items expected to last three or more years -- rose 3.6 percent and orders for nondurable goods rose just two-tenths of 1 percent.
The big increase, over all, for orders in December suggests that the economy carried considerable momentum as it moved into 1999.
In another sign of that, the Labor Department said today that the number of Americans filing first-time applications for unemployment benefits fell by 9,000, to 292,000 last week. The decline, the fourth in five weeks, cut the seasonally adjusted number of jobless claims in the week ended last Saturday to the lowest level since the week ended Dec. 19.

HEADLINE: Fed Takes Steps to Make Its Activities More Open

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve disclosed today that it would be somewhat more open about its secretive policy deliberations, saying it would signal more clearly whether it was leaning toward higher or lower interest rates.
Continuing a glacial drift toward greater disclosure, the central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee said it had made two changes to the way it announced and described actions. 
 The committee decided to drop oblique wording in the policy statement adopted at each meeting about the likelihood of future rate increases or decreases and replace it with a more direct statement.
Instead of forcing readers to discern its leanings from the juxtaposition of the words "would" and "might" in describing the possible course of rate changes -- a code long familiar to Fed watchers -- the central bank today released its policy statement from December, proclaiming its neutrality on future rate changes in something approaching plain English.
"In view of the evidence currently available, the committee believes that prospective developments are equally likely to warrant an increase or decrease" in the Fed's key interest rate, the policy statement said.
The committee also decided that it would from time to time accelerate disclosure of any change in its assessment of the likely direction of rate changes. Rather than disclosing any change in its "bias" toward higher or lower rates only after the following meeting, as is the practice now, the Fed would make the change public immediately on those occasions when it wanted its intentions made clear to the public and the financial markets right away.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has been wrestling for years with questions about the institution's traditional secrecy. He has been seeking to protect the confidentiality of the central bank's policy debates.
Yet he also wants to assuage critics in Congress who feel the Fed should be more accountable and might push for more sweeping changes if the Fed does not act on its own to become more open. And most of all Mr. Greenspan wants to avoid surprising the financial markets, whose ups and downs can have a pronounced effect on the economy.
The last major change in the Fed's disclosure practices was in February 1995, when the central bank began issuing a statement after each policy meeting, indicating whether the committee had made any change in monetary policy. Before that, changes only became apparent as the Fed moved to carry them out the next day by buying or selling Government securities to move rates up or down.
Eager to avoid destabilizing policy surprises, Mr. Greenspan has taken to giving the markets relatively clear warnings of changes in the direction of interest rates. Last September, he first hinted at and then almost flatly promised rate reductions in the weeks before the Fed embarked on three rate cuts.
The latest changes were adopted at the Fed's Dec. 22 meeting and disclosed today in the minutes of that session. The Fed met again on Tuesday and Wednesday but did not announce a change in rates or bias.
The Fed voted unanimously to hold rates steady and maintain a neutral outlook in December, seeing equal possibilities that rates might need to rise or fall in coming months, the minutes showed. Speculation among economists has been that the Fed might have considered adopting a bias toward higher rates this week, given the robust growth of the economy and rising risk of inflation.
That the Fed remained silent this week about its policy bias suggested that it had decided to remain in neutral. But because of the wiggle room the new policy leaves -- it explicitly states that not every change in the bias will be made public -- the markets remained almost as much in the dark as they would have if the new policy had not been adopted.

HEADLINE: 'Tobacco Bonds' for Schools

 BODY:
In a city of crumbling bridges, aging water pipes and antique computer systems, there is no more urgent capital priority than building and repairing schools. Last week Mayor Rudolph Giuliani proposed a novel way of tapping an additional $2.5 billion for New York City schools in the next five years. He wants to create an agency that would issue bonds for school construction, paying them off with revenues expected from the settlement of New York State's lawsuit against tobacco companies. Although we were initially skeptical, the idea is worth pursuing if its problems can be resolved.
The need for school expansion and repairs is beyond doubt. The Board of Education has proposed a five-year, $11 billion program to create room for a flood of new students and to upgrade existing facilities. In his latest budget, Mr. Giuliani said the city would supply $6 billion of the funds, with the rest coming from Federal and state sources. But the city faces a problem in finding the money, as it is at the limits of its borrowing capacity. The State Constitution limits debt to a fixed percentage of the value of the city's real property, a ceiling reached a couple of years ago. The State Legislature in 1997 created a new city agency with borrowing authority, but now even this agency is close to its cap. 
 Rather than ask the Legislature to increase the cap for this agency, Mr. Giuliani wants the city to create another new corporation to issue $2.5 billion in bonds, secured by $6.7 billion in revenue from the tobacco settlement over the next two decades. Both the Mayor and the City Comptroller, Alan Hevesi, must investigate potential legal problems, including the current dispute over whether any of the tobacco money might have to be shared with the Federal and state governments. In addition, there is some skepticism in Albany that the city can create a new debt-incurring agency without legislative approval.
Ideally, Mr. Giuliani should have used the city's multibillion-dollar surpluses to pay down debt or pay for capital projects. Some worry that too much of the budget is being siphoned off for debt service. Still, if the legal and financial problems can be cleared up, tapping the tobacco funds seems a prudent step to rebuilding the city's deteriorating school system.

As Euro Falls, Key Interest Rate Doesn't

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Hurt by fears of an economic slowdown across Europe in the face of expansive growth in the United States, the month-old European single currency touched record lows against the dollar today as a series of interest-rate decisions reinforced forecasts that European rates would keep falling.
Resisting political pressures to lower rates, the European Central Bank, custodian of the monetary policy of all 11 member nations in the euro zone, left its key interest rate unchanged today at 3 percent. But there was still widespread expectation that the rate could be lowered a few times in coming months, said Michael Saunders, an economist with Salomon Smith Barney. The anticipation of lower rates was one reason the euro declined against the dollar in European dealings. 
 Outside the euro zone, the Bank of England surprised the markets with a bigger-than-expected cut of half a percentage point in its key short-term lending rate, bringing it to 5.5 percent, the lowest in almost five years. Dealers had expected a quarter-point reduction. The bank's monetary policy committee, which is trying to keep British inflation from exceeding 2.5 percent, said the reduction in the securities repurchase had been dictated by "the prospects for international activity and prices, domestic costs and consumer demand." It was the fifth consecutive reduction, reflecting concerns that Britain's slowing economy could be headed toward recession.
British rates have now fallen by two percentage points since October. The country's economic slowdown has been caused in part by a strong pound, which has diminished exports and reduced consumer spending.
Denmark, another euro outsider, also reduced its discount and repurchase rates by a quarter-point today, though for different reasons.
The Danish currency, the krone, is linked to the euro in an exchange-rate mechanism that is supposed to limit the currency's fluctuations. The Danish central bank said its rate cuts, the seventh round since October, were made because of the krone's growing strength against the euro. The move had been expected.
The European decisions came a day after the Federal Reserve decided to leave rates in the United States unchanged, with data last week showing the strongest American economic growth in two years. By contrast, the European Commission said last month that its earlier forecast of 2.4 percent growth in Continental Europe this year would have to be trimmed back. The commission, the day-to-day executive arm of the European Union, has not yet published a new forecast.
The interest-rate decisions illuminated not just the disparities between American and European growth, but also the distinctions between Britain and Continental Europe that, British officials maintain, preclude participation in the euro currency system for the time being.
While the euro zone's benchmark interest rate remained at 3 percent, British rates are still the highest among the Group of Seven industrial nations. At its trading debut on Jan. 4, the euro sold above $1.18, but today it was driven down in European markets to lows near $1.125 -- a fall around 5 percent from the euphoric first days, when investors seeking to build up euro positions sold dollars to buy the new currency. In New York later today, the euro improved somewhat, settling at $1.1328.
The fall in its exchange value reflected a turnaround from the earlier bets by currency traders that the single currency would strengthen against the dollar.
"Sentiment on the euro has turned very gloomy," said Kit Juckes of NatWest Global Financial Markets.
Despite the drop, traders said there was no indication that the European Central Bank intervened to support the currency by purchasing it, and some analysts suggested that the European monetary authority saw a weaker euro as likely to strengthen economic growth as European exports became less expensive abroad.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasuries Falter, Then Recover a Bit on Fed's Announcement

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Bond prices fell sharply early yesterday and then cut their losses as investors tried to sort out several rumors, deal with new data showing that the economy is still strong and confront growing fears that the next move by the Federal Reserve will be to raise interest rates.
All these concerns mean that today's employment report could have a significant effect on bond trading. If job growth in January turns out to have been a lot stronger than expected, more investors will be convinced that interest rates, despite low inflation, are headed higher. That would touch off further bond selling and probably help push stocks lower. 
 "We are facing a situation where the Fed has threatened to tighten if the economy does not slow down," said Louis Crandall, chief economist at R. H. Wrightson & Associates.
In late trading yesterday, the price of the 30-year bond fell 17/32 , to 99 15/32 . The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 5.29 percent, from 5.25 percent on Wednesday. In the morning session, the bond was off as much as 1 12/32 , and the yield was up to 5.34 percent.
One reason for the rebound appeared to be the indication that Federal Reserve policy makers, who left interest rates unchanged after their meeting on Wednesday, also did not alter their stance on prospects for future rate moves.
Some analysts had feared that the Fed's stance, which has been neutral, was shifted to suggest that policy makers thought their next move on rates was likely to be an increase.
But the Fed said yesterday that it would announce any important change in the stance right after policy meetings rather than waiting until the release of that meeting's minutes, which are published about six weeks later.
One rumor that set off selling yesterday concerned today's employment report. Traders said the morning featured talk that the Bureau of Labor Statistics had mistakenly printed January's jobs data on its Internet site ahead of today's scheduled release and that the report showed nonfarm payroll jobs jumped by 350,000, well above the 138,000 that Bloomberg News said was the consensus forecast.
A bureau spokeswoman said there had been no premature release of data. In November, the October jobs data were put out a day early on the bureau's Internet site. And last month, the Producer Price Index for December was released a day early.
Another rumor was that Japanese investors were selling Treasury securities, in part to make up for recent losses in Japan's bond market.
A more concrete influence on the market was the economic data, which were all strong and are forcing Wall Street economists to revise their growth forecasts upward for the first half of this year.
Factory orders jumped 2.3 percent in December, to $343.5 billion, a record. Also, retailers reported that sales at chain stores open at least a year climbed 8.3 percent in January, surpassing forecasts by as much as two percentage points.

HEADLINE: Besieged U.N. Commission Chief Will Not Seek Another Term

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Richard Butler, the embattled chairman of the commission charged with disarming Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, said today that he did not expect to seek another term as chairman but that he would strongly resist any effort to oust him.
In an interview today, Mr. Butler coupled his intention to leave when his contract expires in June with strong criticism of Russia, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council. 
 Sergey Lavrov, Russia's representative, has led a fierce campaign against Mr. Butler and his commission, calling almost daily for his resignation or dismissal, saying he is unprofessional, untrustworthy, biased and impolite.
When asked about Russia's attacks on his integrity, Mr. Butler grew combative. Moscow, he said, was trying to divert attention from Iraq's violations of its disarmament commitments and repeated efforts to conceal information and material from weapons inspectors.
"Senior diplomats are asking: What is going on here?" Mr. Butler said. "Are the Russians really asking us to believe that if Richard Butler went under the guillotine tomorrow, that everything would be hunky-dory in Baghdad and Iraq? Are the Russians really asking serious women and men to believe that?"
Mr. Butler stressed that the true issue was whether Iraq would comply with United Nations resolutions and the pledges it made as a condition of the gulf war cease-fire in 1991. He is primarily concerned, he said, that Unscom, as the United Nations commission is known, return to Iraq to judge whether Iraq is developing nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.
Tension within the Security Council over both Mr. Butler's and the commission's fate has been building since Mr. Butler filed a report in December concluding that Iraq was violating its pledge to Secretary General Kofi Annan to permit unrestricted inspections. The report set off American and British air strikes and inspections were suspended.
At the same time, Russia, France and China, all permanent Security Council members, have been lobbying to remove economic sanctions on Iraq. The United States has become increasingly isolated both in its support for Mr. Butler and in its main priority, the insistence that sanctions be maintained until the Special Commission certifies that Iraq has disarmed.
The Security Council agreed Saturday to set up three panels to evaluate its relationship with Iraq. The United States, Britain and Mr. Butler have insisted that commission experts be part of the panel on disarmament. But Russia and Iraq have refused to work with Mr. Butler, or to accept commission documents as long as he is chairman.
United States officials today seemed intent on countering a growing impression among diplomats here that American support for Mr. Butler and the commission is weakening. James B. Foley, the State Department's deputy spokesman, said that Washington "supports Butler fully and thinks he's done a splendid job as chairman." The decision about his future, Mr. Foley added, "is his, and his alone to make."
Mr. Foley stressed that Washington would continue its air strikes against Iraq rather than permit Mr. Butler's many critics to dilute the commission's authority and create what he called a Potemkin Unscom.
Peter Burleigh, the United States representative, called Mr. Butler and his commission "heroes," adding that Washington is "very glad that Unscom will be actively participating in the disarmament panel."
Mr. Butler said it would be tragic if any future disarmament system failed to use the expertise of the Special Commission's inspectors on Iraq's nuclear, germ and chemical weapons. The commission, established by the Security Council in 1991, has a core group of experts who have been studying Baghdad's weapons programs for the past eight years.
Celso L. N. Amorim, the Brazilian representative on the Council, who will lead all three panels, has not yet selected the members. But diplomats here said they understand that while neither Mr. Butler nor the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, a United Nations agency monitoring Iraqi compliance on nuclear weapons, would be panel members, the group would include experts and commissioners from the Special Commission.
Mr. Butler said he had informed Secretary General Annan yesterday at a meeting at his request that "my present intention is not to ask for an extension." But he also rejected the criticism of his performance and Russian calls for his resignation or dismissal, saying his removal would imply that he or the Special Commission had "done something wrong, which is absolute nonsense."
"If there were some move to arbitrarily dismiss me, I would be very resistant to this," he declared.
At the same time Mr. Butler, an Australian, said that after 30 years in arms control, his main concern was the disarming of Iraq, and that if new management would help accomplish this when his term ends, he would leave with pride in what he and the commission have accomplished. "No one is indispensable," he said.

Rubin's Remarks Help Lift Japanese Bonds

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Japanese bonds posted their biggest rally in almost five months today, snapping a six-day slide as the highest yields in more than 18 months lured investors.
Bonds gained after United States Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin urged Japan to "look at monetary policy as one of the key tools available" to bolster the faltering economy. His comments spurred speculation that the United States would put pressure on Japan to act to curb the recent rise in long-term interest rates. 
 If not for Mr. Rubin's comments, "bonds could have fallen," said Masahiro Kami, a chief fund manager at SB Investment Management, which oversees 650 billion yen ($5.7 billion) in assets. "We'll keep a stance to buy bonds on dips."
The benchmark No. 203 bond maturing in 2008 rose 1.342, or 671 yen per 50,000-yen bond, to 97.121, the biggest gain since Sept. 10. The yield fell 18 one-hundredths of a percentage point, to 2.17 percent.
Mr. Rubin's remarks followed a jump in the No. 203 bond's yield to 2.44 percent today, highest for any benchmark issue since June 1997.
Mr. Kami, who bought long-term bonds maturing in about seven years over the last two days, said he expected the benchmark yield to range from 1.78 percent to 3 percent through March, when investors report profits and losses.
With the economy mired in its worst recession in more than 50 years and inflation absent, yields greater than 2 percent, about triple what they were just four months ago, could increase demand from investors like life insurance companies. They have to provide a guaranteed return of at least 2.5 percent to their policyholders.
"For us, an institutional investor, higher yields are attractive," said Naoki Matsuyama, a manager in the fixed-income securities investment department at Meiji Life Insurance, which holds 3.5 trillion yen ($30.9 billion) of yen bonds.
Adding to optimism were remarks by Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and the governor of the Bank of Japan, Masaru Hayami, that the central bank would not underwrite new government bonds.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Drop in Computer Issues Hammers Nasdaq for 83.34 Fall

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Computer-related shares fell sharply yesterday, dragging the Nasdaq composite index down 3.3 percent, its biggest loss in more than five months, as Merrill Lynch cut its estimate on Intel's profits for 1999.
The skid in high-technology stocks reverberated elsewhere, but less severely, in a session also marked by frantic activity in the stocks of on-line brokerage houses amid temporary shutdowns for a second day in the processing system at E*Trade, the No. 3 Internet broker. 
 The Nasdaq composite fell 83.34 points, its third-biggest point drop ever, to 2,410.07. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 23.58, or 1.85 percent, to 1,248.49. The Dow Jones industrial average held up relatively better and even nosed briefly into positive ground in the afternoon before slipping 62.31, nearly 0.7 percent, to 9,304.50.
One measure of the wild swings in technology shares was Siebert Financial, a minor player in the on-line brokerage industry, which soared as high as 70 5/8 from Wednesday's close of 49 1/2 and then dived after the Attorney General of New York said he was investigating the ability of on-line brokers to process large numbers of trades. The stock ended with a loss of 6 1/4 at 43 1/4.
Other factors weighed on the market as well. Saying stocks had simply become too expensive, Douglas R. Cliggott, the top United States equity strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities, recommended lowering holdings in stocks to 50 percent from 60 percent, putting 25 percent in cash and keeping bonds at 25 percent.
"Based on current 30-year Treasury yields and our guess at first-quarter corporate earnings, the S.& P. 500 is now 16 percent rich relative to our fair value measure," Mr. Cliggott said. To justify today's prices, he added, profits would have to rise 12 percent this year and bond yields would need to drift back toward 5 percent. He said such an outcome was not very likely.
Considerable money was also shifting yesterday from technology and other highflying issues into economically sensitive areas like the paper industry. Union Camp rose 3 7/16 , to 67 5/8; Georgia-Pacific was up 3 3/16 , to 69 15/16 , and International Paper, the second-best performer among the Dow industrials, climbed 2 5/8, to 44 3/16 . The best performer was another such stock, Alcoa, which jumped 3 5/8, to 86 11/16 .
"You see profit taking in the recently strong tech stocks, and some money flowing into cyclicals," said Robert H. Stovall, president of Stovall/21st Advisers.
Microsoft was the biggest drag on the S.& P. 500, falling 7 3/4, to 159 1/16 . Intel was right behind, falling 8 9/16 , to 130 1/8; followed by Lucent Technologies, down 7 1/8, to 102 7/8; Cisco Systems, off 5 7/8, to 105 1/4; General Electric, down 2 3/4, to 100 1/8, and Dell Computer, off 5 1/2, to 102 3/8.
Internet shares other than brokers were also pummeled, with Ebay slumping 39 1/4, to to 239; Yahoo falling 2 11/16 , to 337, and Amazon.com declining 7 3/4, to 118. "It was a pretty bleak day," said Neil T. Eigen, a managing director at J.& W. Seligman. "A lot of these Internet stocks have paused."
Advanced Micro Devices, Intel's biggest rival in chips, announced that it might report an operating loss for the first quarter after having been expected by Wall Street to earn 13 cents a diluted share. Trading was halted, and the stock fell 2 1/16 , to 18 7/8.
The biggest drag on the Dow, accounting for almost 40 percent of its decline, was I.B.M., which fell 5 11/16 , to 169 9/16 . AT&T lost 3 9/16 , to 91 7/16 , and J. P. Morgan fell 3 3/8, to 100 7/8. Morgan was one of several weak bank issues.

Malaysia Eases Some Foreign Investment Controls

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Feb. 4

 BODY:
In its first tentative step back into the global economy, Malaysia announced today that it would relax some of the sweeping controls on foreign investment that it imposed in September.
Finance Minister Daim Zainuddin said the Government would lift a 12-month moratorium on the withdrawal of foreign capital from the country. But to prevent an outbreak of capital flight, it introduced an exit tax that discourages investors from pulling their money out immediately. 
 The exchange controls on Malaysia's currency, the ringgit, remain in force. The currency cannot be traded outside the country, and its value has been pegged at 3.8 ringgit to the United States dollar. The Government will continue to strictly limit the amount of the currency that residents or visitors can take out.
Still, if Malaysia dug a moat around its economy in September by imposing capital controls, today's action was the equivalent of throwing a drawbridge to investors -- at least those with the right intentions.
"These new measures are aimed to encourage existing portfolio investors to take a longer-term view of their investments in Malaysia and to attract new funds into the country, while at the same time discouraging destabilizing short-term flows," Mr. Daim said in a statement.
Fund managers and analysts greeted the announcement, which had been widely expected, with guarded optimism.
"This is a positive thing, and they should be applauded for it," said Mac Overton, a manager at the MBF Unit Trust in Hong Kong. "But I'm a little skeptical. What's to keep them from doing it again if things don't go their way?"
Malaysia, which had been a magnet for foreign investment, became a pariah in the world economy when it unexpectedly cordoned off its currency and capital markets. Most disturbing to investors was the 12-month ban on withdrawing foreign capital. That decision locked in $3.5 billion to $4 billion in capital held by foreign portfolio investors.
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said he wanted to curb sudden large flows of capital, which he said had destabilized Malaysia's currency and thrown the country into a recession. Dr. Mahathir cited Western currency traders like George Soros as the primary culprits.
Under the new regulations, investors will be allowed to withdraw money from Malaysia immediately. But they will be taxed according to how quickly they act. Those who withdraw capital that had been in the country for less than seven months will pay a 30 percent tax. The rate gradually drops to zero for investors who leave their money in the country for more than a year.
"When the Government first imposed the controls, everyone was afraid there would be capital flight after one year," said Razak Baginda, executive director of the Malaysian Strategic Research Center in Kuala Lumpur. "This is a mechanism to soften the blow of that one-year milestone."
Analysts said the plan had a good chance of working. P. K. Basu, a senior regional economist with Credit Suisse First Boston in Singapore, estimated that $500 million to $1 billion in foreign capital would be taken out of Malaysia in the next two weeks. But he predicted that it would be more than replaced by fresh capital from investors who had been avoiding Malaysia because of the controls.
Other experts are not so sure. Under the new rules, investors can move money in and out of the country without restrictions, starting on Feb. 15. But the Government will tax investors who withdraw profits. Like the exit tax, it is intended to penalize short-term investors.
"I'm sympathetic to a hot-money tax," Mr. Overton said. "But it still seems like the Government is going to have control over my money."
Malaysian officials have been laying the groundwork for these changes over the last several weeks. Dr. Mahathir met with a group of portfolio managers in Kuala Lumpur two weeks ago to gauge their sentiment about Malaysia. And he assiduously courted world leaders, bankers and journalists at the recent World Economic Forum conference in Davos, Switzerland.
Among the principal arguments Dr. Mahathir made is that the controls had stabilized the economy. By shielding Malaysia from the vagaries of the global market, the Government said, it was able to lower interest rates and revive commercial activity. Indeed, its central bank said today that the official forecast of 1 percent economic growth this year might be exceeded.
Prominent Malaysians acknowledge, however, that the controls hurt the nation's reputation and left it isolated. In part this was because they were imposed at the same time that Dr. Mahathir dismissed his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim. Mr. Anwar is now on trial on corruption charges; he may take the stand next week.
"There was a huge misunderstanding about capital controls," said Francis Yeoh, one of the nation's business magnates. "Investors didn't understand that this was supposed to control currency speculators, not long-term investors."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Mercedes-Benz executives express 'concern' with a longtime agency, Lowe & Partners/SMS.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
THE once-strong ties between Mercedes-Benz of North America and its agency of more than five years, Lowe & Partners/SMS in New York, appear to be fraying after an unusual meeting at which Mercedes-Benz executives were described as having expressed "concern" over "serious" issues affecting their relationship.
The situation is emblematic of the increasingly fragile and volatile nature of agency-client relations as well as the importance of personal relationships between marketers and their agency counterparts. 
 The Mercedes-Benz account, with billings estimated at $125 million, is one of the most prestigious in the competitive North American automotive industry. After suffering declines during the recession of the early 1990's, Mercedes-Benz has bounced back, setting a sales record in 1998. Among Lowe's contributions has been the creation of award-winning campaigns that included an acclaimed commercial featuring the Marlene Dietrich recording of "Falling in Love Again."
But it seems that the client and agency may be falling out of love after a meeting that took place on Wednesday between top executives of Mercedes-Benz, a unit of DaimlerChrysler A.G., and Lowe, part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies. The meeting was disclosed yesterday in response to inquiries by a reporter checking a tip that Mercedes-Benz had dismissed Lowe, which has handled the account since November 1993.
"We have not dismissed the agency," said Donna Boland, a spokeswoman for Mercedes-Benz in Montvale, N.J.
Rather, she added, Michael Jackson, president and chief executive, and Joe Eberhardt, vice president for marketing, met with Lowe executives on Wednesday to "discuss the seriousness of the situation and express concern about two issues."
"We opened the door to these discussions yesterday," Ms. Boland said, "and there will be further discussions with Lowe next week.
"At that point in time, we probably will have something to tell you one way or the other."
Lee Garfinkel, chairman and chief creative officer at Lowe, confirmed yesterday that a meeting took place at the agency on Wednesday with the Mercedes-Benz executives, but he declined to discuss details.
One issue brought up at the Wednesday meeting, Ms. Boland said, was "whether there is a conflict with the Interpublic global alliance with General Motors after the creation of DaimlerChrysler." Her reference was to the fact that agencies like Ammirati Puris Lintas, Campbell-Ewald and McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising -- which like Lowe are owned by Interpublic -- handle G.M. brands like GMC trucks, Chevrolet and Buick.
The General Motors Corporation is of course a longtime competitor of the Chrysler Corporation, which merged with Daimler-Benz A.G. last year to form DaimlerChrysler. Chrysler agencies include the BBDO Worldwide unit of Omnicom Group and the Bozell Worldwide unit of True North Communications.
The other issue discussed at the Wednesday meeting, Ms. Boland said, was "the current management situation at Lowe," including "attrition" -- a reference to the abrupt departure last month of Robert A. Kantor, president for United States operations -- and "the absence of Marvin, certainly."
That reference was to Marvin Sloves, who retired on Dec. 31 as co-chairman of Lowe after serving in that post for four years and as a vice chairman for a year before that. Mr. Sloves retired with the expiration of a two-year extension of what had been a three-year contract.
"The bottom line," Ms. Boland said, "is we are concerned about the current management situation" at Lowe.
Speculation about the state of relations between Mercedes-Benz and Lowe intensified with the retirement of Mr. Sloves because he had been particularly close to executives at Mercedes-Benz since his previous agency, Scali, McCabe, Sloves in New York, landed the auto marketer's account in 1992. The account came to Lowe along with Mr. Sloves when Scali, McCabe was acquired and merged into Lowe in 1993.
There has also been speculation in trade publications like The Delaney Report that Mr. Sloves, a hale man who still relishes the business, had sought to stay on beyond Dec. 31. Asked about that in an interview on Dec. 8, Mr. Sloves replied: "No, no, no, I never really thought about it. It was the end of my contract."
Mr. Garfinkel and Mr. Sloves had been co-chairmen at Lowe; with Mr. Sloves's retirement, Mr. Garfinkel became the sole chairman.
Mr. Garfinkel concurred with Ms. Boland about the subjects discussed at the meeting. One was "potential conflicts" related to G.M. and Interpublic, he said, and the other was what he called "management issues at the agency that existed in 1998."
In articles that appeared on Jan. 25, the advertising trade publications Frohlinger's Marketing Report and Adweek reported that Mr. Sloves was discussing with executives at other agencies joining them and bringing the Mercedes-Benz account with him.
"My understanding is that Marvin is not out there on our behalf," Ms. Boland said, adding: "We do not have a contract with him. Our contract is with the agency."
Among the agencies mentioned by Frohlinger's as possible new homes for the Mercedes-Benz account was BBDO New York, a unit of BBDO Worldwide. The trade publication Advertising Age reported this week that Pentacom in Troy, Mich., a unit of BBDO Worldwide, had been named to handle media services for Mercedes-Benz in North America on an interim basis as DaimlerChrysler examines a permanent realignment of media duties after the merger.
Another possible new home for the account cited by Frohlinger's was Foote, Cone & Belding Worldwide, another True North agency.
Asked on Dec. 8 whether the Mercedes-Benz links with Lowe were jeopardized because of his retirement, Mr. Sloves demurred.
"I don't think it's here because of me," he said then.
But now the account, with billings that represent up to 20 percent of Lowe's total of $750 million, may be departing.
The turmoil on the account comes despite the fact that Mercedes-Benz sold a record number of vehicles in the United States in 1998. Sales of cars and sport utility vehicles totaled 213,379, up 55.9 percent from 1997; car sales climbed 39.2 percent, and its sport utility vehicle sales rose 196.1 percent.
Last month, car sales increased 6 percent from January 1998, while factory capacity kept sales of sport utility vehicles even with the month a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Dipping Into the Social Security Bank

BYLINE: By Ernest F. Hollings; Ernest F. Hollings is a Democratic Senator from South Carolina.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Everyone in Washington has been arguing over what to do with the supposed budget surplus. President Clinton is calling for saving Social Security; the Republicans are pushing for a tax cut. Unfortunately, the surplus is a hoax.
The last time the Federal Government had a surplus was under Lyndon Johnson. President Clinton's proposed budget calls for spending $100 billion more than we take in. 
 How can that be? The answer is that the surplus everyone talks about belongs to Social Security already. In 1983 the Greenspan commission (named after its chairman, who is now the Fed chairman) proposed a payroll tax to build up a reserve to take care of the baby boomers when they retired. To make certain this reserve would not be spent, the commission recommended that Social Security be accounted for outside of the annual budget.
Despite current law, Congress has already spent the Social Security reserves for other things. As a result, the Social Security account is $730 billion in the red.
According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Social Security trust fund will grow each year by these amounts:

1999	$126 billion	2000	$137 billion	2001	$144 billion	2002	$153 billion	2003	$161 billion	2004	$171 billion	2005	$183 billion	2006	$193 billion	2007	$204 billion	2008	$212 billion	2009	$217 billion	
We should have a $3.2 trillion reserve in 2012, when payments to retiring baby boomers will start to exceed revenue. But because we will have already spent the money for other things, we will have to raise taxes or cut benefits to pay Social Security recipients.
To save Social Security, we must first stop looting it for spending programs or tax cuts. Last week Alan Greenspan suggested that the "surpluses" should be used to pay down the Federal debt.
The first debt paid should be that of Social Security. Once that is done, then we can legitimately debate the relative merits of keeping a reserve or cutting the payroll tax and putting Social Security on a pay-as-you-go basis.
We should freeze the budget and leave the "surplus" where it belongs. That in itself would help to pay down the debt, which would lower pressure on interest rates, stabilize the capital markets, add to the nation's savings and promote economic growth.

HEADLINE: Strip Club Open to Minors Loses in Reversal by Court

BYLINE: By DAVID ROHDE 

 BODY:
In a victory for the Giuliani administration, the appellate division of the State Supreme Court yesterday overturned a judge's ruling that exempted a Manhattan strip club from the city's new sex-shop zoning law because it admitted minors.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani hailed the ruling yesterday, and the strip club, Ten's World Class Cabaret, at 35 East 21st Street in the Flatiron district, was padlocked by city officials last night. Lawyers for the city said they would go to court within days to close a second strip club, the VIP Club on West 20th Street, which had also stayed open by admitting minors. 
 Mr. Giuliani said yesterday's rulings would bolster the city's efforts to close strip clubs and adult video shops under the new law, which bars sex shops in residential areas or within 500 feet of churches, schools and other sex shops.
In a second ruling, the appellate division upheld the closing of an adult bookstore, Les Hommes, on West 80th Street, whose limited effort to feature pornographic fare in only 40 percent of its store was dismissed as a "superficial" attempt to skirt the new law.
"Both of these decisions are very valuable," the Mayor said. "They should give a lot of momentum to other cases that are going forward."
As the city has gone to court to try to close the adult video stores or strip clubs, lawyers for the sex shops have found legal loopholes that make them exempt from the new law.
But yesterday's rulings were a second day of setbacks for sex-related businesses. On Wednesday, a State Supreme Court Justice in Queens rejected a legal argument that lawyers for strip clubs had hoped would allow clubs with liquor licenses to avoid being closed under the law. Justice Arthur W. Lonschein ruled that state liquor law, which allows topless dancing, does not supersede the new law that regulates the sex shops.
The rulings means that strip clubs in residential areas are left with essentially one survival tactic. Following in the footsteps of adult video stores, they may be able to remain open if they restrict adult entertainment to less than 40 percent of their floor space. Whether the clubs can strictly divide their "adult" and "nonadult" business to the satisfaction of judges, as well as survive the drop in profits that would come with the strategy, remains to be seen.
That tactic is proving problematic for some. Two strip clubs in Rego Park, Queens, have been ordered closed after a judge ruled that they were not strictly abiding by the 40 percent rule. Wiggles, at 96-24 Queens Boulevard, was ordered closed last November after a woman performed a nude dance for an undercover police officer in the "nonadult" portion of the club. Goldfingers, at 92-77 Queens Boulevard, was ordered closed Wednesday in part because its "nonadult" game room was found to be regularly locked and not open to the public.
Some sex shops might also be seeing their profitability suffer.
A lawyer for Show World, the landmark strip club on Eighth Avenue near 42d Street, confirmed yesterday that the club has applied to the city to become a "virtual reality" center that will feature no adult entertainment. Show World has avoided being closed under the law by restricting adult merchandise to only 40 percent of its floor space.
Herald Price Fahringer, Show World's lawyer, said economic pressure was playing a role in the store's decision to change its business.
"The problem with Show World is that it's such a large enterprise that it's more likely to try to find something like that rather than continue operating at 60-40," he said.
Mark J. Alonso, the lawyer for Ten's, said the club would try to reopen by featuring topless dancing on less than 40 percent of its floor space.
Mr. Fahringer, who represents the majority of the 144 sex shops affected by the law, said several of the clubs are successfully operating under the 40 percent rule. "Other clients are surviving," he said.

HEADLINE: As Aid Is Cut, Hospitals Prepare for a Tough Year

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
After two years of cuts in government aid, a sharp increase in uninsured patients and the growing dominance of managed care, hospitals in the New York region are bracing for what many people believe will be one of the most difficult fiscal years ever.
And with recent proposals from Albany and the White House that would squeeze hundreds of millions of dollars more from local medical centers, hospital executives and many health care experts are predicting significant budget cuts and warning of possible hospital closings and an erosion in patient care. 
 Most likely to be hit hard, of course, are the city's public hospitals and others that serve the poor and are most dependent on income from the government health insurance programs, Medicaid and Medicare. Last year, amid rising fiscal problems, the public hospital system laid off more than 900 workers. And the system's president says as many as 1,000 more jobs are likely to be lost in the coming months, at least half to layoffs.
But New York's prestigious private medical centers seem deeply worried as well. Among the many that have already started to make reductions in their new budgets is New York Presbyterian Hospital, where every department has been asked to cut spending by 5 percent.
"I would say without the state cuts we would have had a difficult but manageable year," said Dr. David B. Skinner, the hospital's chief executive. "But with state cuts, there is a serious chance we will have major disruptions in patient care."
Those cuts, proposed last week in Gov. George E. Pataki's budget, would amount to $727 million to $850 million in Medicaid spending in the state. And this week, President Clinton said he wanted to squeeze $400 million more out of the state's share of Medicare.
So far, the dire prognostications from the hospitals are largely lacking in specifics. No hospital administrator who was interviewed was able to cite specific areas of care that would have to be cut, or areas of services that would certainly fall under the ax this year. That may be in part because it is too early to tell, and partly because administrators do not want to scare patients -- much-needed sources of revenues -- away.
In fact, the Pataki administration argues that, in decrying the cuts, the hospitals are once again crying wolf, and that they should be able to weather the latest round of reductions.
"To speculate on what will happen moving forward is difficult," said John Signor, a State Health Department spokesman. "But a lot of what the hospital industry is saying now they have been saying for the past four years."
But an examination of new hospital financial records shows that 1998 left many hospitals in the red or just breaking even. And the likely government cuts and other economic pressures strongly suggest that 1999 is not going to look any better.
While the hospitals are not yet required to close their books on 1998, the Healthcare Association of New York State, a trade group representing hospitals, recently surveyed more than a dozen hospitals and found that for the first nine months of the year, profits for the sample group fell an average of 1.8 percent -- from 2.24 percent of revenues to a razor-thin four-tenths of 1 percent.
Even before Mr. Pataki issued his budget, his administration was arguing that the hospitals were in far better fiscal shape. On Jan. 26, the Health Department issued a report -- based on data from 1997 -- that showed hospitals recording a whopping 42 percent gain in net profits over the previous year. But the report became embroiled in the subsequent, increasingly bitter debate over the Governor's health care plans, with opponents arguing that it was leaked to the press to provide political cover.
But it seems a technical accounting change in the way hospitals recorded income boosted the numbers significantly.
In a nutshell, hospitals were told to include nonoperating cash, which made revenues look fatter than they actually were. For example, it looked as if New York Hospital earned $82.6 million in 1997, but $65 million of that consisted of investment income and contributions from private donors to use for building, and not for use in an operating budget.
"The state used the wrong measure for looking at net income," said William O. Cleverley, president of the Center for Healthcare Industry Performance Studies, a health care data organization in Columbus, Ohio. "They should have looked at revenues made from patients, less expenses."
The hospitals are also at the mercy of large economic forces that go far beyond fine points of accounting.
The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 decreased Medicare revenues for hospitals nationally by $44 billion, or $3 billion for hospitals in New York City. This reduction alone peeled about 4 percent off net profit margins.
Further, New York has a high rate of uninsured patients. The number of uninsured under the age of 65 rose to 19.1 percent in 1997, versus the national average of 17.6 percent, draining many hospitals' profits. What is more, the city has a high percentage of Medicaid recipients, who have never been a great source of profits.
At the same time, managed care has taken over a significantly higher portion of the hospitals' business in the last two years, and many hospitals have seen reimbursement rates come down greatly. And they owe a lot of money -- 37 percent of the money invested in New York hospitals comes from debt, compared with the national average of 27 percent.
There are fears of further bad news from Albany: the Governor has said he wants to use only 30 percent of the state's share of the tobacco settlement for health care. And this spring, legislators will debate the state's continued financial commitment to graduate medical education and the charity pools used to help hospitals deal with the uninsured.
"The key picture was that the 1997 numbers were modestly better but still way below national norms, and secondly, there has been an increasing deterioration in 1998 and so far in 1999," said James R. Tallon Jr., president of the United Hospital Fund, a health care philanthropic group.
Mr. Cleverley's independent report ranked the financial condition of hospitals in New York state the second worst in the nation. And the bond-rating agencies that monitor hospital bonds have offered poor outlooks on several local hospitals in recent months.
Many hospital executives are feeling grim about 1999.
"In 1997, we lost $4 million and in 1998, we will have a loss of at least twice that," said Frank J. Maddalena, the chief executive officer of Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center in Brooklyn. He asked doctors to take a 15 percent pay cut this year, and trimmed staff.
At the Health and Hospitals Corporation, which runs the city's public hospitals, a variety of administrative cuts are under way, said Dr. Luis Marcos, the agency's president. Of the jobs expected to be lost this year -- none of which will involve doctors or nurses -- about 500 will involve layoffs and 300 will come from attrition.
Hospitals serving a more affluent base have similar predictions. At Long Island Jewish Medical Center, "The situation is not good," said Dr. David R. Dantzker, the hospital's chief executive, adding that a reduced budget will probably result in less investment in the latest medical technology.
At New York Presbyterian Hospital, where $30 million worth of budget-cutting is now under way, profit margins fell from six-tenths of 1 percent of revenues in 1997 to one tenth of 1 percent in 1998, Dr. Skinner said.
But experts say there is a limit to how many administrative cuts hospitals can make and still stay in the black. "I think the evidence of the last couple of years is that hospitals have taken significant steps to cut costs," Mr. Tallon said. "But at some point there is a loss of services to people."

HEADLINE: Audit Faults Forest Service on Logging Damage in U.S. Forests

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 4

 BODY:
Federal auditors have found that the Forest Service frequently fails to assess, prevent or correct environmental damage from logging on the national forests.
After inspecting 12 timber projects in the field from 1995 to 1998, the Agriculture Department's inspector general found that all were deficient and that "immediate corrective action is needed." 
 A new report on the audits found that the environmental studies required before logging was approved were poorly done, the rules to protect streams and wildlife habitat from undue damage during logging were not followed, and the steps planned to repair some of the harm after logging were not carried out.
The inspector general, Roger C. Viadero, reported on Jan. 15 to Mike Dombeck, chief of the Forest Service, that the review had found "numerous serious deficiencies." Agency officials generally agreed with the report's conclusions and recommendations.
The problems not only cause lasting harm to publicly owned natural resources, the report emphasized, but also cost the taxpayers money because many timber sales are canceled for environmental reasons, and the Government must then pay penalties to the timber companies for breach of contract.
The report put an official imprimatur on the kind of complaints that environmental advocates have lodged with the agency for years, and it was welcomed by groups that are suing the agency in Federal court seeking a complete halt to logging on Federal lands on the ground that it does more environmental harm than economic good.
"This is an extremely damaging report to the Forest Service's case because it shows that Forest Service decisions can be based on inadequate and incomplete research and analysis," said Brian Dunkiel, a lawyer for Friends of the Earth, one of the groups suing the agency.
The Forest Service said it was already moving to correct the problems, ordering every regional forester to send special teams into the woods to make sure its rules were being enforced
"This audit is healthy and it is representative of folks' growing concern about how their forests are managed," said Christopher Wood, the senior policy aide to Mr. Dombeck. "We are stewards of the public's trust as well as their resources, and it is unacceptable when we don't comply with our own environmental regulations."
The audit uncovered many problems in the complex paperwork that accompanies the agency's sales of timber on publicly owned land to private logging companies. The Forest Service prepares at least 2,000 environmental assessments each year, in which it is required to document in detail virtually every possible environmental consequence of each sale. In 1997, the Forest Service sold more than three billion board feet of timber for nearly $500 million.
The report also disclosed problems in how the logging was actually carried out. It documented instances of logging too close to streams, and other cases in which too many trees were felled or proper steps were not taken to prevent soil erosion.
Even as the audit was under way, local officials moved to correct some of the problems the inspectors found, halting several timber sales because surveys of endangered species had not been done and because too many trees were being cut.
That proved costly for the Forest Service, which in one such case had to pay $650,000 to logging companies for breach of contract. Over the years, cancellations due to improper environmental planning have cost the agency tens of millions of dollars.
The report had several examples.
In the Clinch Ranger District in Virginia, where clearcutting was usually prohibited within 50 feet of a stream, agency biologists doubled the buffer strip at one site to protect water quality because there were many species of endangered mussels downstream. But inspectors found a clearcut within 15 feet of a stream, and a survey found that in six of nine spots examined the buffer strips ranged from 13 feet to 85 feet. One result was excessive sediment.
In the Laurentian Ranger District in Minnesota, the agency permitted a 50-acre clearcut even though 30 additional acres were clearcut on adjacent county land. That oversight meant that the assessment of cumulative environmental harm was flawed. Similar flaws were found repeatedly at other locations.

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS;
How Utah Committee Tried to Pull Job Strings

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN and JO THOMAS 

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY, Feb. 4

 BODY:
For the past two months, senior officials of the Salt Lake City Olympic organizing committee have insisted they knew few details of the assistance and payments provided to International Olympic Committee members and their families. But now documents have come to light that show that two key officials were directly involved in at least one effort to find a job for the husband of a Finnish delegate.
Frank Joklik and James C. Beardall, both members of the board of trustees of the Salt Lake City bid committee, separately wrote letters to the Weyerhaeuser Company in Tacoma, Wash., seeking a forestry job for Bjarne Haeggman. The letters, sent in the summer of 1993 as Salt Lake City was attempting to win the 2002 Winter Games, were retained by the bid committee and made available to The New York Times. 
 In one letter, Beardall wrote that it would be "helpful to our Olympic bid effort" if the company would provide a job to Haeggman.
Joklik and other board members have insisted that they knew nothing about Salt Lake City's aggressive campaign to provide jobs, cash payments, tuition aid and lavish gifts to delegates of the International Olympic Committee whose votes determined where the Games would be played.
Joklik declined to respond when reached by telephone, citing the continuing investigation into the Salt Lake committee bid practices. Beardall, who is president of an Ogden, Utah, lumber company, did not respond to telephone calls seeking comment.
A Weyerhaeuser spokeswoman confirmed that the letters the company sent in return to Joklik and Beardall were authentic, and that Weyerhaeuser records did not show that Haeggman had ever been hired.
"It's extremely disappointing," said Ken Bullock, a member of the board of trustees of the Salt Lake City organizing committee who has been critical of its business practices. "If you have correspondence, clearly you are a participant in it."
Federal authorities are now investigating whether the Salt Lake City effort violated any laws. No one has been accused of wrongdoing. The correspondence between Weyerhaeuser and the committee begins in the summer of 1993.
In a letter dated June 29, Joklik wrote to George Weyerhaeuser, chairman of the board of the Weyerhaeuser Company, saying that he had met Pirjo Haeggman, an I.O.C. member from Finland, while on a visit to the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland.
Joklik described Pirjo Haeggman's husband, Bjarne, as an "outstanding forester," and added that he "was wondering whether Weyerhaeuser might have any position for which to consider him." The letter is signed "Frank." It was written on the personal letterhead of Joklik, who was chairman of the board of trustees of the Salt Lake City bid committee.
In a response bearing a Weyerhaeuser letterhead, and dated Aug. 12, 1993, a company official informed Joklik that officials had explored employment opportunities in Russia but that it could not find "an appropriate match" for Bjarne Haeggman's abilities.
Two weeks later, on Aug. 26, 1993, Beardall wrote to Edward P. Rogel, Weyerhaeuser's vice president for human resources, asking whether a job could be found for Haeggman in western Canada. Beardall noted that Finland had 20 percent unemployment, and that "it would be very helpful to our Olympic bid effort if we could help Mr. Haeggman find employment."
After Salt Lake City won the bid, Beardall was appointed to oversee internal auditing for the Olympic organizing committee.
A way was eventually found to help Bjarne Haeggman. Beginning in May 1994, the committee began paying him $3,000 a month, with total payments reaching $30,000 to $35,000, a bid committee official said.
According to an organizing committee official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the bid committee's files contain a document saying that Haeggman was working for Great Basin Engineering, a company based in Salt Lake City and Ogden.
Jay R. Anderson, president and owner of Great Basin, said he never employed Haeggman. Anderson said he did recall a conversation in 1993 with Thomas K. Welch, the bid committee president and a close friend, who asked if Haeggman could undertake an 18-month study of reforestation in Finland through his company.
Anderson said he sent a memo that same day to David Johnson, the bid committee vice president, setting out what he understood about the proposal, but heard nothing more of Haeggman.
Pirjo Haeggman resigned from the I.O.C. last month after it was revealed that her husband had worked for the Salt Lake City committee and that he had also been hired in a forestry job in Canada, while having his rent paid by the Toronto committee that unsuccessfully bid on the 1996 Summer Games. Attempts to reach the Haeggmans today were unsuccessful.
Joklik, who resigned on Jan. 8 as president of the Salt Lake City committee, has said that he knew nothing of the assistance provided to I.O.C. members and their families.
Previously, Joklik has said through his lawyer that the "details" of the bid work were handled by Welch and Johnson.
Details continued to emerge today that appear to show that gift-giving to I.O.C. members was frequent and out in the open. In July 1990, for instance, while Salt Lake City was unsuccessfully pursuing the 1998 Winter Games, the Mormon capital's first official visit by an I.O.C. member was made by Slobodan Filipovic of Yugoslavia.
The former Utah Lieut. Gov. W. Val Oveson presented a Winchester .30-.30, the rifle that won the West, to Filipovic, who died of cancer on June 15, 1995, a day before Salt Lake City won the right to play host to the 2002 Games.
Oveson said he recalled giving Filipovic a gun, but had no idea what it was worth and had no part in planning the presentation of the gift. During his eight years as Lieutenant Governor, he said, he frequently was the host for Olympic-related events and that gift-giving was part of his duties.
"I never felt anything was excessive," said Oveson, who is now national taxpayer advocate for the Internal Revenue Service.
Gov. Mike Leavitt of Utah, who has been critical of scholarships and cash payments made to I.O.C. members, proposed today a nearly 50 percent expansion in the number of board members on the Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the 2002 Games, saying that the board must be "democratized," by bringing in greater representation from the community.
 Meanwhile, Leavitt said in an interview that he was frequently called upon in Salt Lake City and abroad to present gifts to I.O.C. delegates. Often, he said, he did not know what the gifts were beforehand and was not told what they cost. A Salt Lake City bid official said the Governor gave such gifts as clocks and expensive luggage. I.O.C. members are prohibited from receiving gifts with a value greater than $200. It could not be learned whether the price of the gifts exceeded this amount.
"It's not inconceivable that I gave away luggage," Leavitt said. "I did whatever I was asked to do at the time I was asked to do it. I had no idea what the rules of the I.O.C. were. If there were in fact gifts given in violation of I.O.C. protocol, I would have had no context to know that."
He said he had not personally seen anything involving gifts that appeared to him to be unreasonable.
"I don't see that as being the problem here," Leavitt said. The problem, he said, "are these so-called scholarships and cash payments."
In a trip that was emblematic of the complex mix of interests in Salt Lake City's bid effort, the Governor and his mother, Anne Leavitt, traveled with six other passengers to the 1994 Winter Games in Lillehammer, Norway, on a private jet that the Governor said was owned by Leucadia, a corporation that owns one of the resorts that will be used for Olympic skiing and snowboarding in Park City.
On board the same plane, arranged by the Salt Lake City bid committee, was a cargo of $21,000 in used medical equipment intended for the son of an I.O.C. delegate from Algeria. Leavitt said he knew nothing of the cargo.
A member of the Salt Lake City contingent in Norway said that Leavitt's plane arrived at a small airport 90 minutes from Lillehammer at noon on Feb. 11, 1994, and that the medical equipment was unloaded from the plane in duffel bags.
An invoice included in Salt Lake City bid documents shows that medical instruments valued at $21,725 were transferred from Thomas D. Rosenberg, a prominent Salt Lake City orthopedic surgeon, to the bid committee on Dec. 23, 1993. A flight manifest detailed the same items.
Dr. Rosenberg was a close friend of Welch, the bid committee president.
The Salt Lake City committee files include a letter from Rosenberg to Yacine Zerguini, a surgeon from Algeria, about a possible visit to Utah. Yacine Zerguini is the son of Mohamed Zerguini, an I.O.C. member.
Also today, a Salt Lake City businessman, David Simmons, said he had hired the son of a prominent I.O.C. member from South Korea, Kim Un Yong, in the early 1990's at the behest of the bid committee. The son, known as John Kim, worked in marketing in the New York offices of Keystone Communications, a provider of satellite communications services that the Simmons family has since sold. Kim's employment was first reported by USA Today.
Kim Un Yong remains under investigation by an I.O.C. panel that expelled six members late last month. He is considered a possible successor to Juan Antonio Samaranch as president of the I.O.C.

HEADLINE: Investors Stir Hopes of Revival in Catskills;
Real Estate Bargains and Casino Prospects Attract Buyers of Old Resorts

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER 

 BODY:
A mere two months after the closing of the Concord Resort Hotel touched off a new wave of obituaries about the Catskills, fire-sale real estate prices and renewed hopes for casino gambling have prompted a surge of investment in the old Borscht Belt.
The Concord has already been bought by an investment group that plans to spend $40 million to convert it into a Sheraton franchise and market it to a clientele more diverse than its traditional base of Jewish vacationers. 
 And yesterday, Grossinger's, the Catskills' fabled grand dowager and the career springboard for entertainers like Milton Berle and Eddie Fisher, was sold at a Federal bankruptcy auction in Manhattan for $6 million to a partnership that includes Louis R. Cappelli, one of the leading builders in Westchester County.
Mr. Cappelli is a major contributor to Republican politicians, most prominently Gov. George E. Pataki, who controls the fate of gambling in the region. Mr. Cappelli's lawyer, Joseph S. Rosenthal, said that the partnership plans to convert Grossinger's into a "five-star golf resort and spa" whose success would not be dependent on gambling but would greatly profit from it.
Much of the region's more upbeat mood stems from the improved prospects for casino gambling. In December, regional officials of the Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs recommended approval of a $500 million casino on land at the Monticello Raceway that would be given in trust to the St. Regis Mohawk Indians.
Although the plan still awaits the endorsement of the Federal Secretary of the Interior and Governor Pataki, this first Federal recommendation has attracted the interest of investors around the country.
"It's like a great stock that has tremendous value but isn't selling for a lot of money," said Alan Gerry, a cable-television entrepreneur who owns the muddy farm in Bethel where the 1969 Woodstock concert was held. "Then one guy recognizes its value and other people start putting in money. That's what's going to happen."
Those who speak of a comeback, however, do so with caution. There has been talk of a rebirth before, but those hopes turned out to be wishful thinking, and the Catskills has more than enough forlorn main streets and dilapidated bungalows to give the skeptics reason to gloat.
And those who know the region well know too that its future will be much different from its past. "It's never going to be the same," said Phil Brown, a sociology professor at Brown University who has recently published a memoir, "Catskill Culture," about growing up in a family that worked in hotels and briefly owned a small one, Brown's Hotel Royal (not the famous Brown's in Loch Sheldrake). "Whatever they can do will be good for this area, but it won't be this Jewish paradise again."
The most concrete evidence of a revival, the old Stevensville Resort Hotel, which closed nine years ago and had been destined for demolition, will reopen in May as the 355-room Swan Lake Golf and Tennis Resort Hotel. Its lobby has been fitted with crystal chandeliers, suits of armor and a 12-foot-long jade boat that make it as opulent as anything Catskills legend ever served up.
The difference is that it also has a nonkosher Korean and Japanese kitchen intended for a more diverse clientele.
In addition, the land once occupied by the sprawling Laurels Country Club was bought last month for $1.05 million by developers who plan to build a Las Vegas-style hotel and entertainment complex.
And in Bethel, Mr. Gerry is hoping to turn the old Woodstock site into a theme park devoted to popular music. Last year the site played host to a concert that drew 70,000 people over three days. This summer Mr. Gerry is hoping to produce four weekends of music.
Although developers are clearly hopeful that the St. Regis Mohawk casino will be approved, they insist that their plans are not dependent on gambling.
"If it happens, it would be frosting on the cake," said James Hoppensteadt, a former Sheraton executive and now vice president of Concord Associates, which bought the Concord in a bankruptcy auction.
In fact, although it may seem paradoxical, officials in Sullivan County believe that the new investment in the Catskills is largely due to the fact that hoteliers have finally stopped waiting for the gambling miracle that would ride to the rescue and revitalize their resorts.
Instead, said Jonathan Drapkin, the Sullivan County manager, developers believe they can succeed by broadening their appeal beyond the working-class and middle-class Jews for whom this area was once a summer paradise.
That is why the Concord's association with Sheraton is considered pivotal. The 1,100-room Concord, built in the late 1930's by a fussy hair-tonic magnate, was snapped up in mid-January for $10.25 million. In addition to qualifying for the Sheraton banner, the developers are making one small, but seismic, change: having the kitchen serve nonkosher as well as kosher food to lure more corporate business, like conventions.
An important catalyst for the recent flurry of activity is that prices for rundown hotels have hit rock bottom -- the Concord's value fell by half in a matter of months -- low enough so that investors can afford to put up the capital needed for extensive renovations.
The fatal flaw of the old Catskills was that it provided a style of vacation that fell out of favor by the late 1960's. The groups from which guests were traditionally drawn grew more educated, cosmopolitan and cholesterol-conscious and more interested in vacations in Tuscany or the Hamptons. They tired of three bloating banquets a day and found the hotel tummlers -- frantic round-the-clock jesters whose ranks once included Danny Kaye and Jerry Lewis -- shopworn and shrill.
But the upstart developers see opportunities in more recent generational shifts. Hotel developers believe the Catskills will have a fresh appeal to working couples who may find it difficult to coordinate three-week vacations to Europe and would like shorter getaways that are only an hour and 45 minutes' drive from Manhattan.
"Whatever worked against the Catskills before can work for it now," said Zev Scharf, a partner in the new ownership of the Laurels, which has only the moldering shell of its swimming pool to suggest its past.
Even before the recent spate of deals, Sullivan County, the heart of the Catskills with 70,000 year-round residents, had been making itself more alluring, promoting the demolition of moribund properties and advertising itself as a playground for fly-fishing, eagle sightings, golf and skiing. Main street storefronts have been restored and 15-year tax abatements provided to developers like those at the Stevensville. "What we're doing is nothing short of a total makeover," Mr. Drapkin said.
In April, Wal-Mart will open one of its largest stores in the Northeast on the fringes of Monticello, and sometime soon, Route 17, the spine of the Catskills, will be rechristened Interstate 86 and improved, giving the road an elevated status that appeals to distribution companies and out-of-state tourists.
Mr. Drapkin contends that these developments have occurred without staking everything on gambling. He said that earlier flirtations with gambling hobbled growth because landowners had insisted on prices higher than their land was worth.
Even so, the region's prospects are rising at the same time that the prospects for casino gambling seem brighter then ever. Governor Pataki's press secretary, Michael F. McKeon, said Mr. Pataki would wait until the final Federal action before announcing a decision on the St. Regis Mohawk casino proposal. But he said that the Governor believed gambling could be "a positive economic tool for traditional resort areas like the Catskills."
Robert A. Berman, a one-third owner of the Monticello Raceway and the chief executive of Hospitality Worldwide Services, a hotel developer that was an unsuccessful bidder for Grossinger's, is more upbeat. "I believe that on its merits the casino project will win approval," he said. "We're hopeful that construction of the casino can begin this year." But Mr. Berman added that he bid for Grossinger's in the hope it could succeed without gambling. "The two are not tied together," he said.
Mark Kutsher, the owner of Kutsher's Country Club, one of the last major hotels still open in the Catskills, has seen the best of times and the worst in the region, and finds himself smitten with optimism over the burst of activity. "We're in the midst of a resurgence," he said. "We're on the move again."

HEADLINE: Brisk Store Sales Defy Usual January Doldrums

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
Perhaps January is not just for clearance sales anymore. Still feeling in a spending mood even after a generous Christmas shopping spree, Americans continued to show interest in both liquidation and full-priced merchandise.
January sales in stores open at least a year, a standard industry measure, jumped an impressive 7.4 percent, according to the Goldman, Sachs retail composite index. That was up from 4.5 percent in January 1998. 
 The increases, which exceeded analysts' expectations by 2 percent to 3 percent, were particularly notable because they occurred across the retail spectrum. Discounters, as usual, led the pack. But everyone (with only a few outstanding exceptions), from specialty apparel stores to the previously beleaguered department stores, shined. "If your numbers weren't good, you stood out like a sore thumb," said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report.
Because January is a relatively unimportant month for the retail industry, typically accounting for only about 5 percent of annual sales, the surprisingly buoyant sales were expected to have a positive but minimal impact on earnings.
Still the numbers were good enough that many in the industry believed it indicated that January was evolving into more than just a month to liquidate inventory. Jeffrey Feiner, a senior retail analyst with Lehman Brothers, said, "Up until the last years, January was a clearance month. Now retailers are bringing in spring merchandise earlier and having the month stand on its own instead of just dumping goods."
Continued consumer confidence was the main reason for rising sales. Mary Tolan, a global managing partner for retail with Andersen Consulting, said: "People just have a lot more to spend. Also they are increasingly being paid by variable compensation" -- bonuses, for example -- "that comes late in the year, so that could affect January sales, too."
The arrival of cold winter weather after an unseasonably warm December also played a role in pushing sweaters, snowblowers and other seasonal goods off the shelves. Susan Eich, a spokeswoman for the Dayton Hudson Corporation, said, "There was definitely a pent-up demand for cold weather apparel."
Discounters continued to barrel ahead of the crowd in January. Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, experienced a 10.3 percent jump in sales in stores opened a year. Family Dollar topped that performance with a 13.1 percent gain. And Target, a unit of the Dayton Hudson Corporation, enjoyed a 9.6 percent rise. According to analysts, those gains came from strong sales of regular-price merchandise as well as sale goods.
Specialty stores also continued their run. Sales for the Gap Inc., powered by phenomenal performances at its Old Navy and Banana Republic divisions, rose 15 percent.
Ann Taylor Stores posted 13.3 gains. A spokeswoman, Jill Golden, said the company "was pleased with customer response to both our sale and full-priced lines."
The department stores, which in recent years have suffered by being neither as cheap as the discounters nor as chic as the specialty stores, managed to hold their own last month. Federated Department Stores Inc., which operates both the Macy's and Bloomingdale's chains, had an increase of 7.3 percent. Dayton Hudson department stores even managed to outperform its hot sister division Target with 11.8 percent growth.
Saks Inc., which owns both Saks Fifth Avenue and the Profitt's stores, had an 8 percent increase. A spokeswoman, Jennifer Mann, said that clearances had been carefully controlled. "There were no promotions beyond those scheduled," at the beginning of the fiscal year, she said.
The season's big losers were the familiarly troubled names. J. C. Penney saw sales in stores open a year slide 1.5 percent from last year. The midmarket retailer, suffering from heavy competition from discounters, has been struggling for nearly four years to redefine its niche.
Talbots Inc., whose results declined 13 percent, was also sorely out of line with its competitors.
Richard Baum, senior retail analyst with Goldman, Sachs, said that the most important result of the unusually strong January may be that retailers are well positioned for the next season. "We've learned that the consumer is still alive and well and that most stores have successfully cleared out fall and winter merchandise and are set to be busy this spring," he said.

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
In New Jersey, Condos Sprout Along the Hudson

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
While rentals have dominated development along New Jersey's Hudson River waterfront for the last few years, they are being joined by a small, but growing, number of condominium town houses and apartments.
The first project to test the current willingness to buy on the waterfront is Jacobs Ferry, with 258 town houses on 14 acres at the river's edge in West New York in Hudson County. Eight months after construction began, the developer, K. Hovnanian Enterprises of Red Bank, N.J., has raised prices several times, for an average overall increase of 18 percent, and has sold or is under contract to sell 212 of the two- and three-bedroom units. 
 Sales prices range from $250,000 to slightly more than $1 million, for larger units closer to the water, according to the developer. With all of the lowest-priced units spoken for, prices for the remaining unsold units start at $470,000.
Encouraged by that response, at least two other developers are building, or expect to start building, four more condominium projects in the next nine months. Hovnanian plans to build 187 additional units. Together, they will produce 751 residences, most of them priced from $165,000 to $450,000, though some will cost $675,000 to $1.2 million.
Among the factors contributing to the increase in condominiums is that banks are financing them, though on a limited basis, for the first time since the real estate debacle of the late 80's. That decadelong dry spell in construction has created a pent-up demand for condominiums at the water's edge, developers say.
Another factor favorable to condominiums is that rents along the Hudson's west bank have increased. They average $25 a square foot a year, or $2,150 a month for a typical 1,000-square-foot apartment, according to Robert P. Antonicello, president of the ACI Group, a Jersey City concern that tracks waterfront residential activity.
"With rents at that level and mortgage interest rates reasonable," Mr. Antonicello said, "developers are betting they can convert many renters to owners."
Moreover, people squeezed out of Manhattan, where prices for rentals as well as condominiums and co-ops continue to rise, also have begun looking across the river for less expensive housing.
Waterfront homes can cost 40 percent to 50 percent less than similar size units in Manhattan, Mr. Antonicello said, noting, however, that he is unsure of how the market will receive the higher-priced units.
All those factors played a role in Hovnanian's decision to proceed with Jacobs Ferry.
"The market for this kind of development has been good for some time," Ara Hovnanian, the company's president, said. "But now is a particularly auspicious time to build because the waterfront is successfully riding the tide of Wall Street."
The town houses have 1,240 to just under 3,000 square feet on two or four levels, and each has a one- or two-car garage. They are in 17 four-story buildings on the River Road site, which will also feature two outdoor swimming pools. Monthly maintenance fees are $197.
Mr. Hovnanian said the project has attracted executive couples who work in Manhattan and affluent buyers from the suburbs who are moving into smaller quarters and want to be closer to the city.
He said 22 percent of the buyers were from Manhattan, which is double the number the company anticipated.
Among them is G. Matthew Youngs and his fiancee, Deena Edington, who two weeks ago moved into their Jacobs Ferry home from a 600-square-foot rental on Manhattan's Upper West Side. "We're quadrupling our living space and after taxes are paying about the same per month to own as the $2,700 a month we paid in rent," said Mr. Youngs, 33, director of retail analysis for Ralph Lauren Childrenwear. Ms. Edington, 26, is an account executive at the firm.
In nearby Guttenburg, Hovnanian will start construction this spring on Bulls Ferry, 154 town houses of 1,450 to 2,300 square feet; prices will be comparable to those at Jacobs Ferry. Another 33-unit section of Jacobs Ferry is also planned, which will include 15 homes, with elevators, on a peninsula. Those homes are expected to sell for more than $1 million each.
Elsewhere on the West New York waterfront, the Roseland Property Company of Roseland, N.J., will begin work this fall on 210 condominiums in two buildings, one with 4 stories, the other with 12 stories. Prices for the units, with 1,100 to 1,600 square feet, will range from $295,000 to $444,000. Another 155-unit, 12-story structure is planned.
In neighboring Weehawken, Roseland, in partnership with Arcorp Properties, a Weehawken-based company owned by Arthur E. Imperatore, owner of the New York Waterway ferry company, will also start building 48 town houses of 2,800 to 3,800 square feet in June. The units, each with an elevator, are to sell for $895,000 to $1.2 million.
Both projects are part of larger mixed-use developments that will eventually include 6,000 residences. "We always envisioned for-sale housing as part of the mix, which the market is now ready to absorb," said Marshall B. Tycher, Roseland's president.
In Hoboken, Applied Companies is constructing a 12-story, 172-unit condominium that is part of a project called the Shipyard that will ultimately comprise 1,170 condominium and rental units. In March, the company will also begin work on 134 condominiums, out of an eventual total of 1,290, at its Port Liberte project in Jersey City.
Both projects will have one- to three-bedroom units, with 800 to 2,000 square feet. Prices will range from $175,000 to $450,000 for the Shipyard units and slightly lower for those at Port Liberte. Some of the Port Liberte units will be town houses with 1,900 to 3,000 square feet and sell for $325,000 to $675,000.
"As long as the market continues to be receptive to condominiums, we will continue to build them," said Michael I. Barry, a senior vice president at Applied. "We know there is a demand, but how deep it is is anyone's guess."

The White Panthers

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
Reasonable boomers can always disagree on exactly when the 60's died -- was it the day the Beatles' "Revolution" popped up in a Nike TV ad? -- but there will be no dispute about when the 60's were embalmed. It's happening this weekend on NBC, which has turned the decade into a sweeps-month mini-series that, however earnest, suggests what "Hair" might look like as a Disney theme-park attraction.
You can actually see far more of the 60's, in all their idealism and over-the-top rage, by looking at their legacy in our now waning 90's -- our most contentious decade since. The best of the 60's has been permanently absorbed into the body politic, from the principles of the civil rights movement to the skepticism with which many Americans view ill-defined military action. The worst of the 60's is also still with us, but, in a bizarre ideological role reversal, many of the left's most egregious excesses of 30 years ago have been co-opted by the right in the 90's, even as Bill Clinton sometimes appropriates the conservatism of Richard Nixon. 
 If you're looking for pure hatred of government and the "elites" that run it -- the anger aimed at Robert McNamara and the rest of the Ivy-League-educated Vietnam policy architects of the 60's -- look only as far as the anti-establishment barking of Tom DeLay, Bob Barr and other warriors of the Contract With America Congress that shut down the Government during Newt Gingrich's short-lived "revolution." If you want to find the kind of holier-than-thou scorn that 60's protesters once heaped on what they saw as the immoral "silent majority" who supported the Vietnam War, you can find it, too, on the right; the "death of outrage" amen corner apocalyptically decries the immorality and vulgarity of the current American majority who refuse to support the prosecution of the President. If you want to find a 90's music-and-pantheism be-in to rival Woodstock, seek out the Promise Keepers.
With the exception of the Unabomber, whose cryptic polemics ranged from vaguely leftist to completely nuts, almost all the mad-dog radical violence of the 90's also comes from the right. Weathermen-style 60's terrorism is the model for the Oklahoma City bombing, the Atlanta Olympics park bombing, the bombing of abortion clinics and the murdering of doctors who perform abortions. "Off the pigs" anti-law-enforcement rhetoric is also now a conservative staple, whether it's the N.R.A.'s Waco-inspired campaign to brand Federal agents as "jackbooted government thugs" or Robert Bork's call for elected officials to "simply refuse to comply" with Supreme Court decisions they find reprehensible. Mr. Bork's latent flirtation with civil disobedience evokes nostalgia for the delight with which Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin and the rest of the Chicago 7 so memorably taunted Judge Julius Hoffman.
Conservatives aren't above trashing military leaders of William Westmoreland rank, either -- witness the efforts of Gary Bauer and others to impugn the integrity of Colin Powell when the general toyed with running for President in '96. Nor, like 60's draft resisters, do they believe in the glory of Vietnam combat. Steve Forbes, George W. Bush, Dan Quayle, Rush Limbaugh and Lamar Alexander, among other soldiers of the right, let others fight the war while they helped themselves to deferments or cushy stateside stints in the National Guard.
Despite William Bennett's boast that he once dated Janis Joplin, the radical rightists of the 90's do not mimic their leftist models of the 60's in drugs and rock-and-roll -- though they do seem to pore over the sexual passages of the Starr report as their predecessors once did "Tropic of Cancer" and the Kama Sutra. Nor, generally, do they emulate 60's radicals in championing the poor and demonizing the rich. But this, too, may soon change. Chatting with Larry King to promote his much-awaited new Presidential campaign last month, Dan Quayle talked up the plight of unemployed steelworkers and the hungry while knocking the "real rich" and "fat cats," whom he defined as corporate officers who collect stock options and don't work with their hands.
Who would have guessed that Mr. Quayle would push "power to the people," much as Marxist rebels of sometimes similarly affluent origins did on campus three decades ago? As they might say in the mini-series, maybe he's just on a bad trip.

Technology Issues Lead Market Lower in Volatile Trading

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Technology stocks tumbled yesterday and most of the rest of the stock market followed in a day of volatile trading. For the week, the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 5.3 percent, its worst one-week decline since October.
Bond prices also fell as a stronger-than-expected employment report for January confirmed that the economy is barreling ahead and made it more likely that investors will face an increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve later this year. 
 The Nasdaq index dropped 36.45 points yesterday, or 1.51 percent, to 2,373.62, and is off 4.85 percent in the last two days. It did trim its worst losses in the afternoon, however, bouncing back from a decline of 63 points, or 2.6 percent.
The Dow Jones industrial average rallied at the end to finish off just 0.26 point at 9,304.24, while the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks dropped 9.09 points, or 0.73 percent, to 1,239.40. The Russell index of 2,000 smaller-company stocks fell 5.07 points, or 1.21 percent, to 412.72.
In the bond market, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 30/32, to 98 17/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.35 percent, from 5.29 percent on Thursday.
Leading the decline in technology stocks were Intel, Cisco Systems, Oracle and Dell Computer. Investors seemed to be worrying that a new price war between Advanced Micro Devices, the world's No. 2 chip maker, and the leader, Intel, could cut into technology profits. Advanced Micro warned on Thursday that it might have a first-quarter loss because it had been forced to cut prices to compete with Intel. Its stock has dropped 19.7 percent in the last two days and closed yesterday at 16 13/16.
Cisco fell 4 yesterday, to 101 1/4, while Oracle dropped 2 1/8, to 56 3/16. Dell Computer, which hit a high Tuesday of 108 5/8, slipped to 100 7/16.
Douglas R. Cliggott, the United States equity strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities, said that the technology sector just "went up too far, too fast, and this is truly a healthy consolidation." Even with this week's decline, he added, the Nasdaq index is up 8.25 percent this year.
E*Trade Group, the on-line brokerage firm whose trading system was down for several hours on Wednesday and Thursday, had a brief shutdown yesterday, from 12:20 P.M. to 12:49 P.M. Its stock fell as low as 45 1/16, and then rallied a little. But it still finished the day lower, down 4 9/16, at 48 15/16.
Judy Balint, the president of E*Trade International, said that fewer than 5 percent of its customers were affected by the trading interruptions. She would not comment on whether E*Trade would compensate investors for any losses. But she said that "from a customer relationship perspective, we will try to do what is right."
The volatility of Internet stocks was also reflected in this week's performance of Siebert Financial, another on-line brokerage firm. A week ago Friday, its stock closed at 12 5/16. Then it zoomed to an intraday high of 70 5/8 Thursday. But it finished the week yesterday at 35 1/8.
The problem for investors and analysts lately has been figuring out whether and when the economy might slow. As 1998 ended, many economists were predicting that economic growth would slow this year from the brisk 3.9 percent pace of the last two years. But in the last several weeks, economists have been revising their moderate growth forecasts upward as data from employment to factory orders indicate that the economy is not slowing yet.
Merrill Lynch has raised its 1999 growth forecast to about 3 percent or 3.5 percent from an estimate of 2 percent just two months ago. And yesterday's jobs data, which showed nonfarm payroll jobs up 245,000, almost twice the forecast, will probably prompt more revisions.
"All the data that has come in has suggested that the economy is more resilient than we had thought," said James E. Glassman, senior United States economist for the Chase Manhattan Bank. But the bank is sticking to its forecast of 1 percent growth for now, he said.
This unexpected economic strength may be positive for the stock market because it could bolster corporate earnings. In raising its economic growth forecast, Merrill Lynch also changed its outlook for earnings for the companies in the S.& P. 500, predicting 3.5 percent growth rather than a 5 percent decline. But much higher interest rates could drag stocks lower.
For bond investors, the threat of a rate increase by the Fed is not a positive. Continued low inflation, more good news on worker productivity and concern about the financial fragility in the rest of the world could keep the central bank on hold for some time, however.
With this week's losses, the stock market is having a more modest beginning to 1999 then it appeared just a couple of weeks ago. The Dow industrial average is now up 1.34 percent for the year and the S.& P. eight-tenths of a percent.
And it seems that investors may have the same feeling. While money is still flowing into stock mutual funds, it came in last month at the slowest pace since 1995, according to AMG Data Services. Net inflows totaled just under $13 billion last month. And in the first week of February, investors withdrew $2.9 billion from equity funds, according to AMG.

HEADLINE: Consumers' Debt Climbed in December

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Borrowing by consumers increased at a faster pace in December, led by demand for auto and credit card loans, Federal Reserve data showed today.
Borrowing rose $7.3 billion, to $1.308 trillion, after increasing an unrevised $3.9 billion in November. Before today's report, analysts had expected an increase of $6.5 billion for December. 
 Revolving loans, which include credit cards, increased $2.2 billion in December, after falling $700 million in November. Auto loans rose $5.9 billion in December, after increasing $4.3 billion. Other types of installment loans fell $800 million in December, after rising $300 million in November.
The pace of consumer credit rose at a 6.7 percent annual rate in December. That is up from the 3.7 percent pace in November.
Consumers are benefiting from low inflation, low oil prices, low interest rates, hefty rises in the stock market and the lowest unemployment rate -- 4.3 percent in December and January -- since 1970.
Economists watch the Fed's credit report to help them gauge consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of economic output. More people, however, have been borrowing against their homes -- through lower-interest home equity loans -- and the Fed's statistics do not track loans secured by real estate.

HEADLINE: Istanbul Journal;
A New Bridge? Not in My Backyard!

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Turkey, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Stuck in rush-hour traffic at an approach to one of the bridges over the Bosporus on a recent evening, a taxi driver cursed the Government for not building a third bridge.
"Two isn't enough for a city of 10 million people," he fumed. "We not only need a third bridge, but also a fourth and a fifth. Then traffic will run smoothly." 
 The Government may soon seek to oblige that taxi driver and many others who believe that Istanbul urgently needs at least one more Bosporus crossing. But reported plans for a new bridge have set off an outpouring of civic protest that mirrors the battles over urban renewal and highway construction that broke out in many American cities in the 1960's and 70's.
Protest is centered in the waterfront neighborhood of Arnavutkoy, which has evidently been chosen as the European terminus for the bridge. Residents say it would all but destroy their community. They have banded together to hold meetings, put pressure on politicians, print leaflets and even pledge to chain themselves to construction equipment if nothing else works.
Civic protest movements like this one are new in Turkey, where the power of the state has always been strong and all but unquestioned. One of the first emerged two years ago in the farm town of Bergama after a foreign-owned consortium announced plans to dig a gold mine that residents feared would harm the environment.
Since then, civic protests have delayed the construction of power plants in several parts of the country. But the movement in Arnavutkoy may be the first directed against a major public works project.
One difficulty that protesters face is that no plans for the bridge have been officially announced. What information is available has come from leaks and random comments by public officials.
The agency that designs projects like these, the Highway Directorate, is based in Ankara and operates outside the control of the Transport Ministry. It was established in the 1950's with the help of Americans influenced by Robert Moses and other planners whose style was visionary and dictatorial.
"In Turkey, planning big projects like this is always done behind closed doors," said Korhan Gumus, chairman of the Human Settlements Association, a coalition of architects and other specialists that is organizing opposition to the bridge. "The guiding principle is that ordinary people can't see the big picture and don't know what's good for the city or the country, so decisions have to be made for them. We have even internalized this approach and tend to accept it as the only possible way of governing."
Bridging the Bosporus, the narrow waterway that bisects Istanbul and separates Europe from Asia, is an ancient dream. The first to succeed in doing it was Emperor Darius I of Persia, who created a temporary bridge of boats during a military campaign in 512 B.C.
The two modern suspension bridges, one completed in 1973 and the other in 1988, carry a total of 1.1 million vehicles each day. Many of the drivers are residents going from one part of Istanbul to another, but there are also many trucks and cars making long trips between points in Europe and Asia.
Some opponents of the bridge say it will do little to ease traffic congestion because the congestion is caused by poor access roads rather than insufficient capacity on the bridges. They are pushing for a rail tunnel under the Bosporus instead.
Others worry about increased air pollution and damage to the esthetics of the Bosporus, whose beauty has inspired countless artists and poets. But the most intense protests come from Arnavutkoy.
For centuries Arnavutkoy was a multiethnic village where Greeks predominated. Most of the Greeks left under pressure in the 1950's and 60's, but the village retains the feeling of a self-contained community.
Along the narrow streets that wind among wooden Ottoman houses are almost everything one needs to live: fruit and vegetable vendors, butchers, cobblers, fishmongers, barbers, cafes and restaurants, a toy store, a hardware store and even a billiard parlor. Many shops display signs opposing the bridge.
"This village is a very special place, and it allows us to live a special kind of life, a life on the streets where people know and trust each other," said Ozden Danisman, an engineer who lives in a traditional old home overlooking the Bosporus. "These days we don't sleep and we don't eat. We just work against the bridge."
The secrecy in which the Highway Directorate works, coupled with the uncertainty created by changing Governments in Ankara, has made people in Arnavutkoy uncertain whom they are fighting against. No one has publicly defended the project or even officially confirmed that it is under active consideration.
But opponents have obtained what they say are maps showing the exact path the bridge and access roads are to take. Arnavutkoy is awash in rumors and plans.
"Our first idea was to block the bridge by filing lawsuits, but now we see that it is basically a political battle," said Caglar Keyder, a sociology professor who is active in the protest movement. "We won't be able to stop it in court, but if we get enough people on our side, maybe we can win."
The Islamic-oriented Virtue Party, which seeks to portray itself as a defender of ordinary citizens against the political establishment, has joined opponents of the bridge.
"A third bridge will not ease our traffic problem," Mayor Ali Mufit Gurtuna of Istanbul, who is a member of Virtue, asserted recently. "On the contrary, it will cause irreparable damage to Istanbul."
But rather than rejoice at Mr. Gurtuna's support, some in Arnavutkoy worry that it will lead secular politicians, who detest Virtue and fear its agenda, to back the project.
"We don't have a patron, someone on the city council or some big-shot politician, to make our case," lamented Nadir Turkguc, who runs a small photo shop in Arnavutkoy. "I'm afraid that our voices won't be heard and that politics will crush us in the end."

HEADLINE: Oil Industry Sees More Job Losses

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
The United States oil industry stands to lose more than 17,000 jobs by this summer if oil prices do not rise above $14 a barrel over the next six months, an industry group reported.
About 24,415 jobs have been lost since the price decline began in November 1997, said the Independent Petroleum Association of America, an industry group based in Washington that represents small and midsized oil producers. 
 Producers are also shutting down wells that cannot be operated profitably, the group said, which could mean oil shortages later. More than half the oil and natural gas wells pumping in the 48 states excluding Alaska and Hawaii could be shut down within six months.
To date, the economic cost of lost production is $25 billion, the group said.
Oil prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange are now at $12.02 a barrel, 43 percent less than on Oct. 31, 1997. Companies like Texaco Inc. and ARCO have cut thousands of jobs to lower costs as oil prices have fallen to the lowest levels since the Great Depression.

HEADLINE: Government Plans to Track Internet Sales

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
The Commerce Department said today that it would begin tracking sales on the Internet, which it called "a major indicator of the nation's economic health."
But even as the Government pointed to figures showing that consumers spent $9 billion last year on the Internet, it warned that growth of electronic commerce would wane unless shoppers trusted that personal information would be kept private. 
 "I wouldn't want people selling information about which books I buy, or what records I buy," said Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. "The Internet is probably going to grow, anyway. It's just not going to grow as fast until these concerns are addressed."
"Consumers have to feel as comfortable doing business in cyberspace as they do on Main Street," added Commerce Secretary William M. Daley.
Mr. Daley said his agency would begin tracking sales over the Internet separately from figures for catalogue sales. But he said complete figures for last year and this year would not be available until next summer.
The F.T.C. has criticized the on-line industry for its failure to protect privacy rights.

HEADLINE: Higher, but Hollow, Academic Standards

BYLINE: By Diane Ravitch; Diane Ravitch is a research professor at New York University and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

 BODY:
Almost every state is setting higher standards for students, which is a very good idea. Few, however, are doing it right. In New York, the state's Regents have raised the bar without taking the necessary steps to help students reach it.
The Regents approved new standards in every subject, but some were so vague that the State Education Department had to issue voluminous guides to explain them. They endorsed new teaching standards, but their main effect is to pile on more regulations and more courses in pedagogy instead of the subject matter that teachers must teach and students must learn. They redesigned the Regents examinations, which guarantees that teachers no longer know how to prepare students for them. 
 Until now, New York has had a two-tiered graduation system: students could earn the prestigious Regents diploma by passing a set of rigorous Regents examinations, or they could earn a local diploma requiring simpler tests. But this spring all 11th-grade students must take a new Regents examination in English language arts, and by 2003 all students will be required to pass Regents examinations in mathematics, science, American history and global history to receive high school diplomas. Unless dramatic changes occur very soon, there may be some neighborhoods where high school graduates are rare.
New York City students are at greatest risk. Only about 20 percent now pass all the Regents examinations. In some city high schools, less than 5 percent of graduates now earn Regents diplomas.
What will happen if 95 percent of those who complete 12th grade in poor neighborhoods fail to receive high school diplomas? What will happen if more than half of all seniors in the city fail to receive high school diplomas? Will support for higher standards evaporate?
One might suppose the State Board of Regents and its staff would have thought this through. Yet since announcing nearly three years ago that they intended to require all students to pass the Regents examinations, the Regents have done little to prepare students and their teachers for the change. According to the United Federation of Teachers, many teachers have never seen the state's new academic standards, and few have received training to enable them to teach Regents-level courses.
Even teachers who have seen the Regents' new standards are not sure what they mean. Consider the standards for English language arts. As originally issued, they consisted of four vacuous statements: "Students will read, write, listen and speak for information and understanding." "Students will read, write, listen and speak for literary response and expression." "Students will read, write, listen and speak for critical analysis and evaluation." "Students will read, write, listen and speak for social interaction." Although the document offered many examples of these skills, not a single piece of literature was identified as required reading.
When it became obvious that these so-called standards were useless verbiage, the State Education Department generated a 161-page document, which still failed to name any poem, essay, novel, play or short story that all graduates in New York should be expected to have read. Instead, the department supplied a list of hundreds of readings, pointing out that these were suggested but neither required nor even recommended.
In social studies, the great smorgasbord field, the state's new standards were equally hopeless. The standard for American history, for example, was simply, "Students will use a variety of intellectual skills to demonstrate their understanding of major ideas, eras, themes, developments and turning points in the history of the United States and New York."
The standards did not identify which ideas, eras, themes, developments or turning points were most important to study, and the State Education Department again had to publish a voluminous "resource guide" to make sense of the original non-standards.
In social studies, the coverage in every area is so extensive that neither teachers nor students know how to prepare for the Regents examinations. Global history, for example, spans the history, geography, culture and economics of every major civilization in the world. The range across times and cultures is so vast that no one can reasonably expect high school students to learn what the state now requires, nor expect even teachers to master the curriculum.
In all likelihood, to get pass rates up the Regents examinations in American history and global history will probably not ask students to demonstrate any knowledge of history, just as the examination in English language arts will presuppose no prior knowledge of any literature. Instead students will be asked simply to explain the meaning of cartoons, graphs, charts, short readings and documents that refer to history.
The union representing teachers in both the city and the state insists that teachers want a grade-by-grade core curriculum. Teachers want to know what they are expected to teach and what students are expected to learn. The state's learning standards do not supply this.
In contrast, states like Texas and North Carolina have successfully adopted academic standards that identify what is to be taught and tested in each grade, and these states have reported significant achievement gains for white, black and Hispanic students. The state tests are closely aligned to the academic standards. Schools get flexibility about how to meet the standards, and schools with more disadvantaged students get additional resources.

But for thousands of students in New York State, and especially in New York City, time is running out. To pass all the Regents examinations, they need well-qualified teachers in every grade. To know how to prepare their students, teachers need clear standards and a core curriculum. Yet the state has provided neither.
If this mess is not straightened out soon, large numbers of students are likely to pay the price, and the movement to improve academic performance by raising standards will suffer a terrible setback.

HEADLINE: January Gain in Jobs Doubled the Forecast

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR 

 BODY:
Despite freezing weather across much of the nation and a financial meltdown in Brazil, the United States economy barreled ahead last month and created a quarter of a million new jobs.
The gain of 245,000 jobs in January, reported yesterday by the Labor Department, was twice what forecasters had predicted. And even with a heavy influx of workers into the labor force in January, unemployment stayed at 4.3 percent -- the lowest level in 28 years. 
 The Labor Department lowered December's job gain to 298,000 from the 378,000 it had initially reported. Still, nearly a quarter of a million jobs have been added in each of the last 12 months on average, making the labor market look stronger than at any time since the height of the Vietnam War.
That buoyancy has many forecasters, most of whom were predicting a broad slowdown just weeks ago, now saying that 1999 is likely to become the fourth consecutive year that economic growth will be well ahead of the long-term trend of roughly 2 to 2.5 percent a year.
"The American economy is the Energizer Bunny: It just keeps chugging along," said David Wyss, chief economist of Standard & Poor's DRI, who predicts the economy will grow 3.5 percent this year. If that happens, as many forecasters now predict, unemployment will fall even further.
Stock market investors shrugged off the jobs data yesterday, hoping that a strong economy would bolster corporate profits and easily absorb the effects of rising interest rates.
With job losses easing in manufacturing and with hiring robust in construction and services, the portion of Americans with jobs has leaped to a record of 64.5 percent. (In Germany and France, by contrast, the figure is below 50 percent.)
More than half of the new jobs last month were in managerial and professional occupations, leaving just two out of every hundred college graduates out of work -- most of them simply in transit from one job to another.
In parts of the Midwest and South, namely Fargo, S.D., and Raleigh-Durham, N.C., unemployment is close to 1 percent.
On average, the Midwest had the lowest unemployment, 3.5 percent as of December, the latest regional figures available. The West had the highest jobless rate, 5.2 percent in December.
And there are still some pockets of relatively high unemployment. In the New York City area, unemployment has fallen to 6.8 percent, down sharply from the 8 to 9 percent level of just a couple of years ago. Still, its unemployment rate -- along with that of Los Angeles and Miami -- is one of the highest among big cities.
Over all, the chief worry now is that things may be getting too good. Investors saw the specter of higher interest rates in yesterday's report.
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, warned last month that he and his colleagues, who left rates unchanged at their most recent monetary policy meeting, would watch for signs that the tight labor market was fueling wage inflation. And while the broadest, most reliable measures of labor costs have held steady, the report yesterday showed that hourly earnings for production and other rank-and-file workers jumped 6 cents last month, to $13.04. That brings the rise over the last 12 months to 4 percent, well above the 1.6 percent rate of inflation and the strong 2.7 percent gain in productivity.
Executives in most industries are complaining about rising job turnover and the difficulty of finding qualified workers. According to a new survey by the Olsten Corporation, a temporary-help company, 77 percent of employers reported shortages of workers, up from 69 percent in 1998. Hardest to find are computer programmers, accountants and financial professionals, but entry-level sales, telemarketing and medical workers are also scarce.
The shortages help explain why businesses are again spending heavily on new machinery and equipment. Companies are not only substituting technology for bodies, but are also trying to replace skills with software. McDonald's, for example, now has pictures of burgers and shakes, not words, on its cash registers.
But what is a worry for Mr. Greenspan and a headache for employers is a terrific boon to workers, especially those at the bottom of the pay ladder. who have had the most trouble getting and keeping jobs, especially good ones. Unemployment among both black and Hispanic workers, already the lowest in a generation, drifted even lower last month. So did unemployment among workers with only high school degrees.
As it happens, gains for the bottom one-fifth of workers have been occurring for a while now, said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute. He cites as an example young black women with only high school degrees, a group that typically has had extremely high unemployment rates. But the portion with jobs has leaped by 10 percentage points, to 58 percent, in the last four years.
"That increase is historically unprecedented," said Mr. Bernstein, who notes that the hottest topic now among scholars of labor markets is "why this recovery has been so good to folks at the bottom." The gains have come not just in jobs, he points out, but, equally important, in pay and training opportunities.
The sources of the strong labor market are not exactly a mystery. Troubles in the rest of the world may have sliced deeply into exports from the United States and caused job cuts in factories. But they have also indirectly fueled consumer and business spending by pulling inflation and interest rates down. Prices for raw materials and imports generally have fallen, intensifying price competition and prompting foreigners to snap up American stocks and bonds. And all that domestic spending -- on everything from computers and cars to new houses and furniture -- means more jobs.
In January, virtually the only areas with accelerating job losses were the oil patch and the mining industries, battered by the lowest commodity prices since energy prices collapsed in the mid-1980's. Makers of heavy machinery, which depend heavily on foreign markets, cut 9,000 jobs last month. But other manufacturers, namely auto makers and companies that cater to the construction trades, added workers.
Job losses for manufacturing as a whole have slowed sharply. Just 13,000 jobs, on net, disappeared last month, the smallest loss since September. The weaker dollar may be helping. American manufacturers are a lot more competitive at 113 yen to the dollar than they were at 147 yen last summer.
The boom in construction continued despite blizzards, with 15,000 construction jobs added on top of 99,000 jobs in December.
As usual, the mammoth service sector accounted for the biggest share of job gains. "January job gains were led by the services industry, which had above-average growth," said Katherine Abraham, Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which issues the jobs report. Hiring was strong in engineering, management and computer services. Hiring by temporary-help suppliers and health care companies, on the other hand, was sluggish.
As long as the rest of the world's troubles keep inflation low in the United States, the Fed may stand aside as unemployment falls. How low can unemployment go? With the old rules seemingly suspended, the nation may soon find out.

Standing Tall On Behalf Of a Union

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
COMPARED with the Twin Towers, Carlos Guzman and Dominick Bentivegna looked tiny as they approached the entrance of 5 World Trade Center on Thursday. They're the kind of working stiffs New Yorkers notice vaguely, if at all -- Mr. Guzman is a janitor at the World Trade Center while Mr. Bentivegna is a doorman on the Upper East Side. Bit players in the service economy, right?
Not anymore. Last week they agreed to drop a $2.4 million lawsuit against the leadership of Local 32B-32J, the city's maintenance workers union, on the condition that its president, Gus Bevona, resign. Mr. Bevona, one of the nation's highest-paid labor officials at $450,000 a year, had resisted dissident challenges in both courts and elections. The dissidents' most recent lawsuit accused him of misusing union funds to pay his legal and re-election expenses. 
 The dissidents, led by Mr. Guzman and Mr. Bentivegna as co-chairmen of Members for a Better Union, had scored court victories before. They also said they had faced harassment and intimidation from those loyal to Mr. Bevona. At one point, Mr. Guzman lived like Yasir Arafat, nervously sleeping in a different home every night after private detectives hired by the union staked out his apartment.
Now the intifada they waged against the union they thought was supposed to represent them has ended, and the union is being run by a trustee. The dissident duo have gone from being little guys to V.I.P.'s. They were entering a Trade Center building when Paul Vance, a maintenance worker, stopped taping rain mats to the floor, looked up and smiled.
"You're a big shot now," said Mr. Vance, who hugged Mr. Guzman. "Good job, man! It's about time. Maybe now we can get working rights."
The greeting was a simple act of solidarity, a reminder that unions can still mean something more than an automatic payroll deduction. Mr. Guzman's expectation that his dues entitled him to his union's respect and support prompted him to question Mr. Bevona's salary and lavish penthouse headquarters (complete with a bank of televisions that monitored other offices) and especially the union's reluctance to defend its members. "The union did nothing," said Mr. Guzman, 51. "The majority of people in this industry come from other countries. The only thing they have is this job and they have to support a family with it. The employers know that and abuse them."
Mr. Guzman's decision to go after the union's leadership was not out of character, even for a janitor who was more used to working in empty offices. He was politicized in his native Ecuador, where a military junta ruled the country during the early 1960's. "When I was 15, we were fighting dictators over there," he said. "The soldiers had guns and bullets; we just had stones to throw at them. We'd go to City Hall and protest. Somebody would die. Then we'd go to the cemetery and protest again. I grew up fighting injustice."
Mr. Bentivegna, 38, grew up in Bensonhurst looking forward to getting a union card the way others anticipate getting into the right club. "All the jobs I ever had, I always wanted to get into 'The Union,' " he said. "Any union. You'd see the papers and you'd see how the union did this and the union did that. If you had a problem, you'd call the union. It was larger than life. I'd like to see that come back to 32B, that if you call the union, the boss is going to worry."
HE had joined Mr. Guzman in 1993 when the union did little about his complaints that his supervisor used racial slurs against his Latino and black colleagues. Since then, the two of them have shared a bond that offers some hope for the city's future: an Italian-American doorman joining forces with a Ecuadorean janitor in a union filled with immigrants and minorities.
"I was raised to respect people," Mr. Bentivegna said. "There is no why. It's like asking why do you want to be a good person?"
Mr. Guzman interrupted. "It was assigned to you," Mr. Guzman joked. "Like Moses. This is your calling. Free your people."
Mr. Bentivegna continued. "I look at everybody in this union and I see only two things," he said. "You're either good or bad."
And involved.
"It's the people who make the people who govern you," said Mr. Guzman, who mastered this bit of practical democracy. "If the people don't participate, no matter who governs, you're always going to risk an abuse of power. Without participation, nothing is accomplished."
With it, everybody's a big shot.

HEADLINE: Jordan King's Heir Reaffirms Stand for Peace and U.S. Ties

BYLINE: By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr. 

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Jordan's next Government will remain committed to peace in the Middle East and close relations with Washington, but wary of both Iran and Iraq, Crown Prince Abdullah said in his first interview since he was designated successor to his father, King Hussein.
"I am an extension of His Majesty's outlook and His Majesty's beliefs," the 37-year-old brigadier general said, in speech that was British in tone but American in rhythm and vernacular. 
 The interview with several visiting foreign reporters took place on Thursday in Raghadan Palace, on an off-the-record basis. Tonight, as King Hussein's death appeared increasingly imminent, the Prince's aides authorized publication of the wide-ranging conversation, which they said was intended in part to set the record straight on the circumstances of his selection two weeks ago to replace his uncle as Crown Prince.
In the interview, Crown Prince Abdullah discussed his nuanced views of other regional diplomatic challenges, his strained relationship with his uncle, former Crown Prince Hassan, and his vision of the future of the Jordanian monarchy.
His greatest immediate internal concern, it seems, is to close family ranks behind him as he prepares to take the throne just weeks after his father unceremoniously deposed Prince Hassan after 34 years as the King's designated successor.
Prince Abdullah said he learned of his father's decision just one day before it was announced last month and the King left Jordan for a second bone marrow transplant in the United States.
He denied published reports that he flew secretly to Minnesota last fall, during the King's previous stay there, to complain to his father about Hassan, who was then Crown Prince. All the King's 12 children visited him during the six months he was being treated abroad, he said, and he had stayed for a few days at the end of September and early October.
Prince Abdullah said he greatly admired Prince Hassan, had often turned to him for counsel, and was confident that his uncle would play a senior advisory role in the new government.
"This was an issue between two brothers," said Prince Abdullah, the King's eldest son. King Hussein wanted "to have the legitimacy go back into his line," he said.
 Shortly after Prince Abdullah returned from his visit to his father at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, he gave a rare interview to an Arab-language weekly saying that he had been Crown Prince himself until he was 3 and that there was nothing to prevent reverting to the traditional line of succession -- the first indication to palace-watchers here that such a change was contemplated.
And in the interview on Thursday, Prince Abdullah made it clear that he too thought Prince Hassan had recently been too much the acting king, and not enough the loyal deputy. "The role of a crown prince should be to keep a low profile," he said.
He was quick to refer to his family's dynasty, saying, "The Hashemites are the unifying factor of Jordan."
"That is what binds us together, Palestinians and Bedouins and everyone else," he said, sitting next to his half brother, the 23-year-old Prince Ali, who was once seen as his father's most likely successor.
The man who will be King of Jordan is a personable career military officer with his father's quick smile and unfeigned modesty. He shares as well his father's deep distrust of Shiite radicalism, unfettered democracy and other perceived threats to the stability of Jordan and the survival of the dynasty.
Yet he is quite unlike King Hussein, he acknowledged, in the circumstances of his ascension to the throne, and in his relationships with his peers in the region, whose fathers were in many cases mortal enemies.
Externally, he wants above all to reassure the world that the succession in Amman will not change the foreign policy built up so carefully by King Hussein. Jordan's desire for a permanent peace between "our friends in Israel and our friends in the P.N.A.," the Palestinian National Authority, will remain its chief diplomatic priority, he said.
He emphasized the importance of the perception and reality of Jordanian neutrality in the current Israeli election campaign, joking that he had declined to take calls of congratulation in recent days from Israeli "friends" who were once active-duty generals but who are now actively engaged in politics.
But when discussing the delicately balanced Jordanian policy toward Iraq, Prince Abdullah seemed somewhat closer to the American position.His father was compelled to support Jordan's neighbor and major trading partner when other nations were arrayed against Iraq during the Persian Gulf war in 1991, and has since been a critic of United Nations sanctions that have caused suffering among the Iraqi people.
 The Prince said President Saddam Hussein of Iraq still posed a threat to Kuwait and that Jordan would support a "change" in Iraq's Government. He said he agreed with American policymakers that there "no hope" that President Hussein would voluntarily change his policies.
"We are on the same sheet of music, so to speak," he said, referring to his discussions on Iraq here last week with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright.
Yet Iran poses an ultimately more serious destabilizing threat to the region, he said, warning that the liberalizing forces represented by President Mohammad Khatami remain very much a minority.
Belying his image as a sheltered political novice, he spoke knowledgeably of the diverse pressures facing his country and its neighbors, and used candor and charm to challenge the widespread notion that his sudden ascension has strained relations within the royal family.
He also sought to emphasize the practical utility to a future monarch of his army career, which began with eight years in desert bases "in the middle of nowhere," but more recently made him the country's chief military envoy. He is comfortable with ordinary Jordanians, he said, because he has lived like an ordinary Jordanian soldier. And he has developed a close circle of professional friends in the armies of Israel, the Persian Gulf states and the United States, he said.
Prince Abdullah spoke especially warmly of his friendships in other royal families in the Arab world, and sympathetically of their desires to fight Islamic fundamentalism and retain some of their dynastic privileges.
Many of them shared American educations and an American belief in free-market economics, he said.
"We went to the same schools," said the Prince, who attended high school at the exclusive Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts and went on to study at Sandhurst, the elite British military college. "We ate in the same restaurants. We like the same movies. We have a lot in common, and we have all become very good friends."
His wife, Princess Rania, is a Palestinian whom he married in 1993, and they have a son, Prince Hussein, and a daughter, Princess Iman.
Presenting himself as a modern monarch-in-waiting whose goal is liberalize the economy and open up the political system, Prince Abdullah demurred when asked if the dynasty might, under his reign, subordinate its near-feudal power to a constitutionally protected Parliament.
"Democracy is not something that can be done overnight," he said. "It is a learning experience. It is also a discipline. Because we have a democracy, it doesn't mean that people can take things into their own hands."

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels 

 BODY:
For many people, the depth of religious divisions among Jews was captured this week in the image of Orthodox yeshiva students screaming insults at American Reform rabbis praying, with men and women together, at the Western Wall in Jerusalem.
That image, however dramatic, misses some other deep divisions existing, not between Orthodox and non-Orthodox expressions of Judaism, but in the heart of Orthodoxy itself. These divisions, which have potentially far-reaching consequences for Judaism and resemble parallel conflicts in other religious traditions, will draw 500 to 1,000 participants to the Grand Hyatt Hotel in New York City for an international conference next weekend. 
 Entitled "Orthodoxy Encounters a Changing World," the Feb. 14-15 conference is the work of Edah (Hebrew for "community"), a relatively new and, to be sure, immediately controversial group. The "changing world" of the title is the world of women's rights and Middle East peace negotiations, but it is even more specifically the changing world of Orthodox Judaism.
That world has always had its internal camps. Outsiders are vaguely aware that Hasidic Jews constitute a distinct group within the Orthodox and are in turn split into various differing allegiances, Lubavitchers and Satmars and so on.
But the most important division has probably been between "modern Orthodox," as they have termed themselves, who believe that a strict observance of Jewish law is compatible with an extensive involvement in the social, intellectual and professional life of contemporary America, and a more separatist, inward strand of Orthodoxy that rejects modernity in a much more sweeping fashion as incompatible with Jewish values.
The two groups split sharply in their attitudes toward secular education. The modern Orthodox have valued the study of Western science, literature and art and have enthusiastically entered the professions. Yeshiva University has been their flagship institution in trying this synthesis between modern culture and traditional observance.
The separatists, now labeled ultra-Orthodox by critics or, more neutrally, "haredim" ("those who tremble" in fear of the Lord), have always rejected such secular pursuits as distractions. Most secular schooling should be limited to what is needed for young people to support a family and devote themselves wholeheartedly to religious study and practice.
So what about this bifurcated Orthodox world has changed? Primarily, three things.
The modern Orthodox have increasingly felt the pressure of demands for new roles for women not simply in organizational leadership but in areas of religious life where any reinterpretation of Jewish law is sure to be controversial.
Orthodox leaders of all stripes have always insisted that the Reform and Conservative movements (to which the vast majority of American Jews adhere) are deviations from authentic Judaism. But recent developments -- the Conservative and Reform ordination of female rabbis, for instance, or the Reform movement's new acceptance of intermarriage and homosexuality, or the effort of both movements to get a legal foothold in Israel's religious life -- have turned the border between the Orthodox and non-Orthodox into a virtual free-fire zone. Anyone daring to reach across it, as some modern Orthodox have done, is in peril.
Third, and most important, the "haredim" have increasingly become the dominant force in Orthodoxy. The causes and consequences of this "turn to the right," as it has often been called, are brilliantly sketched by Jack Wertheimer, a professor of American Jewish history and the provost at Jewish Theological Seminary, in the February issue of Commentary magazine.
Young people from modern Orthodox backgrounds, for example, now often spend a year or two in Israel, pursuing religious studies in settings where haredi influence is strong. Orthodox day schools, summer camps and youth programs are disproportionately staffed by haredi educators who choose that calling over secular professions.
The consequences include a shift in authority from practical-minded congregational rabbis to the virtuoso talmudic scholars who head haredi yeshivas and who favor an escalating standard of ritual stringency.
The modern Orthodox in sum, are on the defensive. Some of their most esteemed figures are regularly having their religious credentials called into question. Indeed, Professor Wertheimer uses terms like "vilified" for the treatment meted out to these rabbis and scholars.
And the modern Orthodox themselves, Rabbi Berman said, often have "a sense that the haredim really represent true Orthodoxy and modern Orthodoxy is a movement of convenience."
He said he hoped the conference would send a different message: "that it is really possible to relate to modernity in a relatively open fashion while maintaining a passionate commitment to Torah."
He would consider the gathering a success if, on issues like attitudes toward the non-Orthodox, women's roles in Orthodox Judaism, and rabbinic authority over individuals' spiritual lives, there were simply a recognition of "a greater degree of legitimate diversity."
Even within modern Orthodoxy, however, this initiative has stirred fierce reactions. In the latest issue of The Jewish Week, Rabbi Moshe Tendler, a leading figure in the rabbinical seminary of Yeshiva University, denounced Edah as "outside the pale of Judaism"
Speaking from a separatist perspective, Rabbi Avi Shafran, director of public affairs at Agudath Israel, was comparatively detached. Modern Judaism's effort to be in the contemporary world and yet strictly faithful to traditional Judaism had merely reflected the economic insecurity of Orthodox Jews decades ago, Rabbi Shafran argued.
"Edah pines for those days," he said. "It is trying to make a compromise born of necessity into a high ideal."
Yet Edah's conference addresses a perennial choice facing any religious group "encountering a changing world": build bridges or patrol borders. There is a time and a place for both, of course, and only wisdom instructs one in where and when and how.

30-Year Bond Yield Rises As Stocks Continue to Fall
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose after the Labor Department reported that the unemployment rate in January remained unchanged from December at 4.3 percent, the lowest level in 28 years. The bond's yield climbed to 5.35 percent from 5.29 percent. 
 The Nasdaq composite index, heavily weighted with technology stocks, suffered its worst one-week decline since October, dropping 5.3 percent. The Nasdaq index closed lower by 36.45 points, or 1.51 percent, to 2,373.62, The Dow Jones industrial average rallied at the end of the day to drop just 0.26 point, to 9,304.24, while the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks declined 9.09 points, to 1,239.40. The Russell index of 2,000 smaller-company stocks fell 5.07 points, to 412.72. Page C3.
 
With the economy rolling along strongly, consumers continued to borrow for car and credit card loans in December. Borrowing rose $7.3 billion, to $1.308 trillion. C14.
 
Economic Crisis in Brazil Intensifies
Brazil's stocks, currency and bonds fell, closing out a tumultuous week that began with hopes that a new central banker could halt a free fall in the currency. The week ended with concern that rising interest rates would sink the economy, causing debt to balloon. The value of the currency, the real, fell 1 percent, to 1.82 to the dollar from 1.805. C15.
 
Airport Landing Changes Seen
The Clinton Administration wants to end limits on how many planes an hour can land at Kennedy, La Guardia and O'Hare airports, people who have been briefed on the plan said. The change, to be proposed on Monday, would make it easier for start-up airlines to challenge established carriers, at a time when the Transportation Department is looking for ways to stimulate airline competition.

Big Donations by Gates and Wife
William H. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, and his wife, Melinda, have given $3 billion to their two foundations, the president of one of the foundations said. The gifts bring the assets of both foundations to nearly $5.5 billion. Mr. Gates has given away more money than any other living American philanthropist. A12.
 
Japan Tries to Halt Rate Surge
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan indicated that he wanted the nation's central bank to buy Government bonds and sell bills to help halt a surge in long-term interest rates. Yields on Japanese 10-year bonds tripled in the last four months as investors braced for a flood of debt sales by the Government to finance tax cuts and public works spending. The rising yields drove up interest rates on a variety of things, ranging from corporate bonds to mortgages. C15.

HEADLINE: Clinton Seeks to End Limits on Landings at New York and Chicago Airports

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD and JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration wants to end limits on how many planes can land in an hour at New York's Kennedy International and La Guardia Airports as well as Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, said people who have been briefed on the plan.
The change would make it easier for start-up airlines to challenge established carriers, at a time when transportation officials have been taking steps to increase the capacity of airports to handle traffic and to promote airline competition. 
 The issue of limits is not one of safety, Federal Aviation Administration officials said. If planes are joining an approach queue faster than they are landing, air traffic controllers simply tell them to fly slower, or not to take off.
But in establishing who can fly into the airports affected by the limits, the Transportation Department has handed a huge advantage to "incumbent" carriers, which were allotted most of the landing "slots" decades ago and have relinquished few of them. Slots are now bought and sold for up to $3 million each, aviation executives say.
The Transportation Department, in a request to Congress on Monday, will ask for legislation phasing out the rule limiting flights, officials said. While the department could act itself, Congressional action provides political cover and would be less subject to court challenge.
Political brawls over similar proposals have broken out between lawmakers barraged by noise complaints and those lobbying for more air service. It is a particularly emotional, and local, issue. In his only major interview since becoming House Speaker, Dennis J. Hastert, whose Illinois district is near enough to O'Hare to benefit from more service but far enough to escape most noise problems, told The Chicago Sun-Times that he was open to adding flights there.
The rule limiting flights "is a major impediment to better air service for communities all over the country," said Jeffrey N. Shane, an aviation lawyer who represents Access Air, a new carrier, based in Omaha, that wants to fly its three Boeing 737's to La Guardia. Access leases two slots from Northwest Airlines but fears that Northwest will soon take them back for its own use.
Others said the effect of a change would be hard to predict. Allen Morrison, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said the limits had forced various airlines to be turned away.
But the executive vice president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, James Randall Schwitz Jr., said, "It's basically going to have no effect on the system."
The airports are near saturation levels now, Mr. Schwitz said, and "you can only put a certain number of airplanes in a given amount of air space at a certain time."
If more planes try to land and all are delayed as a result, experts said, that would ripple through the system, as airplanes land late, take off late for their next flights and continue to be late all day, with passengers missing connections.
But other aviation experts emphasized that the Government was bringing in new landing systems and other technology to increase capacity and that the limits on flights were too constricting.
And Mr. Shane said some airlines did not use all their slots every day, or flew small planes just to maintain the slots and keep others from getting them.
Just how elimination of the rule would affect the balance and competition among airlines is hard to predict, experts said. At Paine Webber, Samuel C. Buttrick, an airline analyst, said, "Open access to slot-controlled airports will offer entry to discount carriers, but at the same time allow dominant carriers to expand."
If not for slot controls at O'Hare, Mr. Buttrick said, United Airlines might have squeezed out the other hub carrier, American.
Most of the Congressional delegations from the New York metropolitan region are expected to join House members from near O'Hare, including Representative Henry J. Hyde, Republican of Illinois, to fight the plan in the House. Last year a similar coalition succeeded in killing a bill that would have allowed more departures and arrivals at the restricted airports.
New York City leaders were lining up to oppose the proposal. "They are crazy," said Claire Shulman, Queens borough president. "Maybe it would lower fares a little bit. But on balance, this will be a disaster for us."
But the plan is likely to win strong support from other regions, where officials complain that high airfares are hurting the economies of smaller cities.
The plane limits, formally called the high-density rule, were established 30 years ago, but the numbers have gradually increased. The proposal to phase out the rule over five years will be part of the Administration's bill to re-authorize the Federal Aviation Administration; the last re-authorization was for just six months, in part because of a dispute over limits on airport operations, and it expires on March 31.
At O'Hare, the rule limits arrivals to 80 in any half-hour and 155 an hour. At La Guardia, the limit is 68 an hour; at Kennedy, the rule is in effect from 3 P.M. until 8 P.M., and the hourly limits vary from 75 to 95. At all three airports, there are sub-quotas for big airliners, commuter flights and general aviation planes.

L.P.G.A. Head Takes Job With an Internet Company

BYLINE: By CLIFTON BROWN 

DATELINE: PEBBLE BEACH, Calif., Feb. 5

 BODY:
In an unexpected move, Jim Ritts resigned as commissioner of the Ladies Professional Golf Association Tour today after only three years to become chief operating officer of an Internet company.
Ritts will be replaced in 45 days by Ty Votaw, the tour's 37-year-old vice president for business affairs. As recently as November, Ritts was planning to remain as commissioner for at least another three years. But Ritts said he could not pass up the opportunity to work with Digital Entertainment, a corporation based in Santa Monica, Calif., which delivers television-quality programming to the Internet. 
 "I believe we are in the beginning stages of a communications revolution, and it's exciting to have an opportunity to become involved in that," Ritts said from his car phone on his way to the Orlando, Fla., airport. "This is a day of mixed emotions for me. I'm happy about the opportunity, but sad to be leaving the L.P.G.A."
Almost everyone within the L.P.G.A. was caught off guard by Ritts's decision. Dottie Pepper, one of the tour's most prominent players, said nobody suspected Ritts might be leaving during last month's players meeting.
"I'm shocked," Pepper said. "He had just gotten a contract extension. The L.P.G.A. can keep leaks from getting out better than the Clinton Administration."
Pepper said Ritts still had strong support from the players, and she said she believed that the tour would remain in good hands with Votaw, who has been with the L.P.G.A. since 1991, working for Ritts and the former commissioner Charlie Mechem.
"Between Jim and Charlie, they really groomed Ty for the job," Pepper said. "Jim's strength was marketing and television, while Charlie had great business savvy."
Ritts, 45, made a strong impact during his tenure. Televised events have increased from 19 events in 1994 to 33 this year. The tour has grown from 36 events in 1995 to 43 this year, while this year's total purses are $36.2 million, a 50 percent increase from three years ago.
With young stars like Annika Sorenstam, Karrie Webb, and Se Ri Pak to promote, the L.P.G.A. has the potential for more growth.
However, Pepper wondered if some of the tour's 43 events would have trouble attracting enough big-name players. "Ty is going to have to listen to the sponsors and to players," Pepper said, "because with 43 events, there's a chance for some weak fields."
Meanwhile, many companies within the golf industry are suffering through tough economic times. Attracting strong sponsorship will continue to be one of the tour's biggest challenges. Some of the tour's most prominent players did not have their equipment contracts renewed this year because corporations are cutting back.
"We're going to have to reach out to nongolf companies and establish those relationships," Votaw said. "Jim did a great job, and I see no reason why this will not be a smooth transition. The players know me, and my experience with the tour will be invaluable. It's an honor to take this new position, and I'm looking forward to the challenge."

Final Food Stamp Report Criticizes City Policies

 BODY:
Federal officials released their final report on New York City's welfare program yesterday, finding that city officials are violating the law by denying poor people the right to apply for food stamps.
The report from the United States Department of Agriculture repeats the findings of a draft report that became public last month. It determined that city workers fail to make food stamp applications immediately available as required by law, improperly require the poor to search for jobs before receiving help, and deny food stamp applications from needy families without first determining their eligibility. 
 Federal officials also criticized the state for failing to monitor the city's compliance with the law. They said the state's current improvement plan is inadequate and ordered the state to develop a new plan within 10 days.
State officials called the report "ridiculous," saying the problems described were minor and already being addressed. City officials, who have already agreed to improve the system, said any specific problems will be addressed immediately. But city officials also said they disagree with Federal officials, who view food stamps as critical support for poor people moving off welfare and for newly employed people trying to keep from slipping back on the dole.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL MEMO;
Suburban 'Sprawl' Takes Its Place on the Political Landscape

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 3

 BODY:
The word "sprawl" does not even appear in the index of "Earth in the Balance," Vice President Al Gore's earnest 1992 treatise on the environment. But these days that word, and the set of creeping suburban problems it embraces, from traffic congestion to loss of open space, has emerged as one of the reigning buzzwords in the political lexicon.
Politicians as diverse as Mr. Gore and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey have made the issue a priority, and voters around the nation have shown their concern in the most tangible way that taxpayers can, by passing billions of dollars in bond measures to buy and preserve undeveloped land and approving ballot measures intended to slow growth. 
 Sprawl, in sum, is the new language of environmentalism, seen by political strategists as perhaps the best way to engage voters in a debate that had become more abstract over the last two decades as regulation curbed many of the most egregious environmental abuses, from pesticides to pollution, that had animated suburbanites in the 1970's.
The new debate is being driven by some of the same concerns that inspired the original movement, but now the length of a commuter's daily drive is increasingly seen as an environmental issue like chlorofluorocarbons or global warming. And political strategists say that the voters most concerned about these issues -- suburban women -- are the voting group that helps decide elections.
"In a period of prosperity, it's not about how much we have, it's about how we hold our lives together," said Alex Castellanos, a Republican political consultant who has worked for candidates in Texas and Florida and helped spread the concept of the soccer mom. "So all these quality-of-life issues, from health care to the environment, come to the fore. A lot of it is the feminization of politics. The warrior of the suburban jungle is the mom out there in her suburban assault vehicle, and there's no oasis for her, no place for her to rest."
"Where Joe Six-Pack is not concerned about green space, he is not the dominant force on the spectrum anymore."
With its Teddy Roosevelt-style emphasis on conservation in the classic sense, the fight against untrammeled sprawl finds an equally comfortable place in Mr. Gore's emerging Presidential campaign theme of "practical idealism" and in the "compassionate conservative" mantra of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. And although it has not emerged as a top-tier issue like education or crime in public opinion surveys, it is steadily gaining.
In Ventura County, just west of here, voters in November overwhelmingly approved a ballot initiative called SOAR -- for Save Open Space and Agricultural Resources -- which will force every proposed development that requires a zoning change to be approved by a public referendum. Similar measures were passed in four individual cities within the county, just one beachhead among some 200 measures worth $7 billion that passed nationwide.
In New Jersey, Governor Whitman successfully pressed for $1 billion in borrowing to set aside half the state's remaining 2 million acres of open space over the next 10 years. Voters overwhelmingly approved the measure in November.
A statewide survey last year by the Public Policy Institute of California found that more than a quarter of Californians saw population growth and development as a big problem in their region -- hardly a surprise in a state that is expected to add 18 million more people, an entire New York State, to its current population of more than 32 million people by the year 2025. In the San Francisco Bay Area, where Silicon Valley has fueled a boom, nearly 40 percent of respondents saw growth as a major problem, while statewide a third of residents saw transportation and traffic congestion as a big problem.
"It's an issue which, on the surface, seems like a very policy-wonk kind of thing," said Mark Baldassare, survey director for the nonpartisan institute. "But there's a lot of public sentiment and concern about the everyday annoyance of sprawl and growth, and the long-range problems associated with air pollution and environmental degradation. And, after all, most Californians do live in suburban regions."
Depending on how suburban is defined, so do about half of all Americans, and the sprawl issue is increasingly seen as a way for politicians like Mr. Gore to take the lingering elitist tinge off environmentalism, and capitalize on a longstanding personal concern by casting it in terms readily apparent to average voters. In its budget proposal, the Clinton Administration is seeking more than $1 billion in new spending to help local governments preserve open space, ease traffic congestion and promote environmentally sensitive economic development. The Administration calls it a "livability agenda," and in addition seeks another $1 billion for a "lands legacy initiative" to preserve parklands.
"It's an upscale issue in the sense that if you're worried about your basic material well-being, you don't have so much time to be worried about your quality of life," said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster in Washington who said he saw increasing interest in the issue among political clients. "But once you pass that threshold, even in rural areas, where family farms are threatened by development, this is really an issue that cuts across the board for folks."
Predicting just how much steam a given issue may have in an election, much less a Presidential contest still more than a year off, is notoriously difficult, and an economic downturn could quickly relegate sprawl to the back burner. But Mr. Mellman notes that many of the Congressional seats in swing districts are centered in suburban areas, so the issue could well loom large in local contests.
Precisely because most land-use decisions are the province of cities, counties and states, it is not entirely clear what role the Federal Government may play. In announcing the Administration's initiative last month, Mr. Gore took pains to say that the Government should not act as "beauty commissar" but should instead provide financial incentives -- like transportation aid -- for localities to work together.
Richard Moe, who was chief of staff to Vice President Walter F. Mondale and is now president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation in Washington, said that although sprawl was often portrayed as the natural free-market consequence of normal and desirable growth, the reality was that government action at all levels had effectively subsidized it for years, by actions as simple as building Federal office buildings on the outer edges of cities instead of downtown.
"State policy is the single most important factor in trying to deal with this issue, and there's not a one-size-fits-all solution," said Mr. Moe, an author of the book "Changing Places: Rebuilding Community in the Age of Sprawl" (Henry Holt, 1998). "Sprawl is affecting people much more directly, in terms of air quality, visual blight, all these manifestations," he said in an interview. "It's hitting people right in the face, and they see it and know it and don't like it. They're not quite clear what needs to be done, but they know that the way we're doing it is not right."
In a recent speech to the National Press Club in Washington, Mr. Moe ticked off a litany of sprawl's reach: Since 1950, Pennsylvania has lost more than 4 million acres of farmland, an area larger than Connecticut and Rhode Island combined; metropolitan Phoenix now covers some 600 square miles, an area larger than Delaware; and by at least some estimates, over the next half-century sprawl is expected to consume more than 3.5 million acres of California's Great Central Valley, the nation's greengrocer.
If sprawl is often couched as a motherhood issue, not every group approves of efforts to limit it. The National Association of Home Builders has warned that it will fight any efforts to limit new Federal money for infrastructure like roads. In some cases, developers have successfully co-opted anti-sprawl efforts. In Arizona last fall, a measure narrowly passed that would set aside $20 million a year for 11 years to buy open space, in exchange for a ban on development fees and restrictions on urban growth.
And Mr. Castellanos, the Republican consultant, said Mr. Gore could be hurt by any sign that he still subscribed to a "fairly 60's-style environmental agenda," and he insisted that the Republicans' most important issue was the high taxes that forced families to work longer hours to keep up.
"When it comes to quality of life, you can either give someone a park to go to, or you can give her more time to go to the park," he said.
Similarly, Mr. Mellman, the Democratic pollster, said it would be possible for Democrats to attack Republican candidates who seemed too willing to allow unbridled development.
But he added: "I think it's really an issue that unites more than it divides. It goes to the question, can you understand and articulate the kinds of concerns that people have in their lives. This is an opportunity to do that."

THE COUSINS' WARS
Religion, Politics, and the Triumph
of Anglo-America.
By Kevin Phillips.
707 pp. New York:
Basic Books. $32.50. 
 Kevin Phillips burst upon the world with "The Emerging Republican Majority" (1969), a book, part polemic and part demographic analysis, that grew out of his memos for Richard Nixon's 1968 Presidential campaign. Since then, his polemics have wandered across the ideological map until the sometime conservative Republican became a muscular liberal, both protectionist and economically dirigiste. But Phillips's intense interest in county-by-county breakdowns of racial, ethnic and religious data, and their correlations with election results, stretching back to the 19th century, has remained constant. In "The Cousins' Wars," he takes his method farther back in time, and to both sides of the Atlantic, to examine the causes and outcomes of three wars that, he argues, shaped Anglo-American civilization: the English Civil War, the American Revolution and the American Civil War. The result is the king of campaign memos, a 700-page brief for Oliver Cromwell, George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Its overarching story -- of High Church cavalier aristocrats, repeatedly losing to dissenting republican entrepreneurs -- might be subtitled "The Emerging Puritan Majority."
Phillips's template is the contest, beginning in 1642, between King Charles I and Parliament. Geographically, Parliament was strongest in London and lesser commercial cities, Puritan eastern England and parts of the Midlands, while Charles I drew on southwestern England and Britain's Celtic fringe. Phillips stresses that the war also touched England's colonies, as thousands of Puritans who had fled to New England to escape the High Church regime of Charles's bishops returned to fight on the parliamentary side. Parliament's victory culminated in the strongman rule of Oliver Cromwell, and then was undone by the restoration of Charles II in 1660. But the Glorious Revolution of 1688 established Protestantism and a chastened royal house.
In the 1760's, the monarchy began to stir again, provoking restiveness in the 13 colonies. Phillips notes, as every careful historian does, that the American Revolution was also a civil war. More controversially, he sees the regional patterns of patriot and Tory allegiance as replays of the loyalties of 17th-century England. Post-Puritan New England was one hotbed of American resistance; the Presbyterian Ulstermen of the back country were another. Southern planters, despite their many cavalier habits and poses, were a third, resenting policies like the threatened establishment of Anglican bishops in the New World (they wanted to control their parishes themselves). Tory ranks included transplanted Scots (especially Highlanders) and wealthy urban Anglicans. Some of these loyalties survived in the first American party system of Republicans and Federalists.
By the time of the American Civil War, Phillips concedes, the connections to old England had become fainter. The Confederate cavalry officer J. E. B. Stuart was a descendant of Pennsylvania Ulstermen, not of English royalty. Still, the two sides imagined connections even where they were lacking: Stuart wore golden spurs and thought of himself as a latter-day Prince Rupert. And the real connections were strong enough. Abolitionism began in the 1840's religious ferment of Greater New England, when, as Emerson noted, "Dunkards, Muggletonians, Come-outers, Groaners" and all the Puritan fringe sects walked again.
Phillips justifies his title by emphasizing the effect of Americans' battles on their British cousins. Many Americans know that the Revolution had star-power sympathizers in the mother country, like Edmund Burke and John Wilkes. Phillips argues that English election returns, in the few parliamentary constituencies that were openly contested, as well as petitions to the King, show that the political nation as a whole was divided in its sympathies, along lines that repeated the divisions of the English Civil War. Curiously, one M.P. who sat for a pro-American constituency was Gen. William Howe, who in 1775 was given the job of beating George Washington; Phillips is not the first historian to claim that Howe's sympathies hobbled his performance. During our Civil War, the British elite's inclination to tilt toward the Confederacy was resisted by industrial workers and religious dissenters (often the same people). The North's victory, Phillips adds, gave a boost to the Reform Act of 1867, which extended the franchise to many of the North's English supporters.
Though the second of the cousins' wars was a defeat for Britain, Phillips argues that it gave a timely alarm to a nation that was about to confront Napoleon. More audaciously, he asserts that the United States acted in the 19th century as an Anglo-assimilating magnet for millions of Irish Catholic and German immigrants who, had they gone elsewhere or stayed home, could have complicated Britain's life-and-death struggles in the early 20th century.
"The Cousins' Wars" is frequently graceless, its prose slipping into consultantese, and the same arguments pop up in chapter after chapter. But Phillips's details are as marvelous as they are copious. In a discussion of the politics of Scottish Highlanders, he pauses to inform us that Capt. Allan Macdonald, a leading North Carolina Tory in 1775, was the husband of Flora Macdonald, the savior of Bonnie Prince Charlie during the Jacobite rebellion of 1745.
The attraction of books like "The Cousins' Wars" (David Hackett Fischer's "Albion's Seed" is another) is that they take a big view and offer a few elegant ethnic and cultural keys. The danger is that they can degenerate into demographic just-so stories. Want to know what Citizen X will do in Crisis Y? Just find out where he lives and who his ancestors were. One thing that saves Phillips from this fate is his emphasis on the decisive role of war. "Even the better angels" of our nature, he writes, "often require military escort. Such are the realities." Wars express underlying patterns and trends, but they can also rearrange them. Valor and luck in the field, and good planning beforehand, can change history. Phillips devotes much of his section on the American Revolution to Britain's attempts to divide the Colonies by conquering upstate New York. He argues that Britain might well have succeeded, either in 1777, the year of Saratoga, or in 1776, pulling "soft" Tories and waverers over to its side and discouraging supporters of the Revolution on both sides of the Atlantic. New England, Phillips believes, would still in all likelihood have freed itself, but the other states might have slipped back into the British fold for years to come.
Phillips also avoids vulgar determinism by emphasizing the political power of religion. Religions are creeds that change the way men think, and Americans have always given a lot of thought to religion. "More material was printed in mid-18th-century America about religion than about political science, history and law combined," he writes, "and even as the Revolution approached, devotional books outnumbered any single group." The battle hymns of the republicans in all three wars looked to the coming of the Lord, even as their enemies were inspired by different conceptions of the divine order.
Phillips would have enriched his case if he had also considered the evolution of Anglo-American political thought. Since each of his wars produced political upheavals, it is necessary to understand the ideologies that informed them. At one point, Phillips recites a list of big names in English 17th- and 18th-century political writing, beginning with John Locke, only to discount them. He never discusses one of the most influential thinkers of all, Henry St. John, Viscount Bolingbroke, the glib protean loser whose insincere but eloquent spin resonates to this day in groups as different as the Michigan Militia and Common Cause.
In his last chapter, speculating on how the Anglo-American world will fare in the 21st century, Phillips somewhat arbitrarily decides that religion will no longer be an inspiring factor. Language will replace prayer as the great political dynamo. "The interaction of linguistic hegemony with the communications revolution" will give the English-speaking nations clout among "the world's better-educated elites." This is dubious. If language sustained empires, Rome should have lasted as long as the Latin Mass. So Phillips may not be a prophet (come to think of it, the Republican Party is not doing so well these days). But in "The Cousins' Wars" he has given us a juicy, provocative account of where we have come from.

THE DEATH OF ADAM
Essays on Modern Thought.
By Marilynne Robinson.
254 pp. Boston:
Houghton Mifflin Company. $24. 
 Toward the end of her novel, "Housekeeping" (1981), Marilynne Robinson has her narrator remark: "Fact explains nothing. On the contrary, it is fact that requires explanation." As the 11 essays in "The Death of Adam" show, the inadequacy of fact -- of brute fact, fact unredeemed by human meaning -- is a leitmotif in Robinson's thought. One might think that preferring human meaning to brute fact implied something easygoing. Not a chance. There is a core of remarkable toughness in Robinson's thinking. If she is bent on rescuing humanity from sundry depredations, it is more in the manner of Dante or Jonathan Edwards than a promoter of self-esteem.
She describes "The Death of Adam" as "contrarian in method and spirit." She isn't kidding. One would have to search far and wide to find another contemporary novelist writing articulate essays defending the theology of John Calvin or the moral and social lives of the Puritans. We all know that Puritans were dour, sex-hating, joy-abominating folk -- except that, as Robinson shows, this widely embraced caricature is a calumny. "The way we speak and think of the Puritans," she writes, "seems to me a serviceable model for important aspects of the phenomenon we call Puritanism. Very simply, it is a great example of our collective eagerness to disparage without knowledge or information about the thing disparaged, when the reward is the pleasure of sharing an attitude one knows is socially approved."
There is a lot about Marilynne Robinson that is politically incorrect -- beginning, perhaps, with her obvious suspicion of easy categories like "political correctness." The essays in this volume range widely, from the German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who was murdered by the Nazis in 1945 for "antiwar activity" (his unpardonable sin was attempting to save people from extermination), to William Holmes McGuffey, the 19th-century Midwestern radical who gave America the famous McGuffey readers.
One of Robinson's great merits as an essayist is her refusal to take her opinions secondhand. Her book is a goad to renewed curiosity. "Everything," she writes, "always bears looking into." Her judgments are the result of grappling anew with the issues and authors she writes about. All too often, she observes, "to say that a certain text is essential to the development of American culture or consciousness is as if to say: Do not bother reading it. You know all you need to know."
She occasionally overstates matters. Her prose is sometimes richer than her argument is rigorous. She is fond of locutions like "when people still had sensibilities." And although admirably solicitous of certain damaged reputations, she sometimes overdoes her impatience with acknowledged giants. Thus when she sniffs that a "more brilliant sociologist" than Max Weber would have been more sensitive to Calvinism, one wonders whether the world has ever seen a more brilliant sociologist than Weber.
In the end, though, these are small matters, dwarfed by the current of high moral seriousness that animates "The Death of Adam." The subtitle tells us the book contains "essays on modern thought." "Against modern thought" would be more accurate. In particular, Robinson is against that aspect of modern thought -- a large and immensely influential aspect -- that inculcates cynicism. We often take the extent of one's disillusionment as an index of one's wisdom. Robinson's deeper purpose is to remind us of the culpable folly of such a view. For some time now, she notes, we "have been launched on a great campaign to deromanticize everything, even while we are eager to insist that more or less everything that matters is a romance." Thus it is that "when a good man or woman stumbles, we say, 'I knew it all along,' and when a bad one has a gracious moment, we sneer at the hypocrisy. It is as if there is nothing to mourn or to admire, only a hidden narrative now and then apparent through the false, surface narrative. And the hidden narrative, because it is ugly and sinister, is therefore true."
Puppet theories of human nature are always popular, partly because they are so simple, partly because they endow their proponents with the illusion of elite knowledge. How thrilling to know that human culture is really only a reflection of economic forces (Marx), that love is merely an alibi for lust (Freud), that altruism is a blind for genetic propagation (some followers of Darwin). Robinson is at her best when she sets out to expose the arrogance and reductive wrongheadedness of such scientistic versions of science. "The modern fable," she writes in her longest essay, "Darwinism," "is that science exposed religion as a delusion and more or less supplanted it. But science cannot serve in the place of religion because it cannot generate an ethics or a morality. It can give us no reason to prefer a child to a dog, or to choose honorable poverty over fraudulent wealth. It can give us no grounds for preferring what is excellent to what is sensationalistic. And this is more or less where we are now."
Of course, even to title an essay "Darwinism" is a provocative gesture. Few educated people today deny that the process of heritable variation Darwin described accounts, in his phrase, for the origin of species. The question, as Robinson puts it, is whether "all that has happened on this planet is the fortuitous colonization of a damp stone by a chemical phenomenon we have called 'life.' " Or, in the words of an eminent sociobiologist, "an organism is only DNA's way of making more DNA." Think of Plato, Bach, Newton, Rembrandt, Shakespeare; then consider the implications of that "only."
A phrase that recurs often in these essays is "human exceptionalism." Puppet theories of human nature are always out to dissuade us from thinking words like nobility, honor, courage, loyalty, love and virtue actually mean what the dictionary tells us they mean. Robinson urges us to take another look. In her poignant essay on Psalm 8 ("What is man, that thou art mindful of him?"), she offers an alternative credo: "I have spent my life watching, not to see beyond the world, merely to see, great mystery, what is plainly before my eyes. I think the concept of transcendence is based on a misreading of creation. With all respect to heaven, the scene of the miracle is here, among us. The eternal as an idea is much less preposterous than time, and this very fact should seize our attention." Who is rash enough to declare her wrong?

FACE-TIME
By Erik Tarloff.
249 pp. New York:
Crown Publishers. $23. 
 Benjamin Krause is young and ambitious, a nice guy who is going places. He has had the good fortune to ride the campaign of the rugged, virile Charles Sheffield into the White House and is now writing speeches for the President while ensconced in a Dupont Circle condo with Gretchen, his "cute and tough and rowdy" fellow campaigner and now girlfriend. Beyond being madly in love, what he likes most about her is that as the daughter of a right-wing former Congressman whom she describes as "a nasty, closed-minded, bigoted bastard," she is without illusions about the powerhouse scene. In Ben's eyes, that imbues her with a certain ironic view, a certain integrity that gives him a feeling of being safely grounded. He feels a bit bad that her job in the White House social office is "not a stellar assignment," but at least they are together.
Ben's fortunes -- helped by a zinger of a speech on Africa that brings raves from the President ("Listen, Krause . . . you've out-Sorensened old Ted this time") -- keep rising. Then one night Ben and Gretchen are invited to the White House to watch a movie screening with the First Couple, and before you know it his boss takes a shine to his girl. Ben is horrified and also paralyzed. How can he compete? And how can Gretchen -- still professing to love him -- be so cool about it? "Jesus, Ben, think about it," she pleads. "He's the President of the United States! It's just an amazing phenomenon, more than anything else. . . . And it's, it's flattering . . . the fact he picked me makes me feel special."
Erik Tarloff's "Face-Time," a leanly written addition to the Washington-novel stable, looks on first glance to be just one more story of cuckoldry with, of course, a knowing wink at the Clinton White House. The fact that Tarloff is married to Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and the National Economic Council during Clinton's first term, only adds to the expectation of a nice little insider story.
But "Face-Time" is better than that. As it takes us through Ben's writhing in the wind to his confrontation with the President to his ultimate confrontation with Gretchen, it rises to the level of a small morality play. Insisting that love and loyalty have nothing to do with it, Gretchen argues: "Face-time with the President . . . I mean, that's all anyone cares about around here. . . . If somehow there was something comparable for you, if some equivalent existed, I believe you'd have jumped at it too. Even if it meant betraying me in the process. I'm convinced of that. I think you're at least as jealous of my relationship with him as of his sexual access to me." And Ben, in his own slow progress to figuring it all out, recognizes "some dim resonance": "I tried not to examine it too closely, but I didn't always succeed. And each time I did, her case seemed more compelling."
We never do learn where, if anywhere, this takes him. Nor does Tarloff brand anyone a villain. Nobody is punished, least of all the President, who sees sex as a prerogative of power and remains somewhat shocked that anyone -- especially a lowly speechwriter -- would disagree. But he gives us a neat exercise in looking at the split in Washington -- and, one suspects, other power centers of the world -- between what people anxious for power really value and what they say they do.
Tarloff's characters are flat as pancakes -- why would Gretchen risk all she has for access that doesn't seem to have much of a payoff? And both the womanizing Sheffield and the smart, hustling Ben come from a familiar rep-
ertory. But precisely because Tarloff gives us dry bones to pick at instead of the usual juicy tidbits, he brings off something unusual: a story about sex and power in Washington that goes behind the headlines to a darker place. Small book; nice punch.

HEADLINE: Amsterdam's Brave New World

BYLINE: By MATT STEINGLASS; MATT STEINGLASS, a writer and Web producer, is moving to Amsterdam this month.

 BODY:
LAST spring, I was in Amsterdam with a new-media artist friend. We needed a place to check our E-mail, and our Dutch hostess offered to take us to the nearest cybercafe. She led us across a wide cobblestone square toward the Waag, a late-medieval brick fortress studded with circular turrets. Tables and wicker chairs spilled out of the fortress's broad gate; a white-aproned waiter circulated with fat glasses of Duvel beer. Inside, under a 20-foot vaulted ceiling, people chatted and sipped koffie verkeerd (cafe au lait, Dutch style), waiting for a space at a long table with a peaked ridge down the center. The computers were almost invisible, their screens built unobtrusively into the table's slanting wooden face.
My friend and I half-smiled in embarrassment; we were thinking of the nerdy, unpleasant cybercafes we knew in New York, full of taciturn patrons huddled over their screens. This place seemed so sociable! Why, my friend wondered, couldn't new media in America be more like this -- "so out in the open, so . . . " 
 So public. In America, new media tend to be a private affair. Whether you're E-mailing, Web surfing or playing computer games, in the office or at home, you're usually doing it alone. In Amsterdam, using new media is more social. There are public Internet kiosks on the city streets. On the waterfront, teen-agers congregate in the plaza of the New Metropolis, a year-old interactive technology museum. Even Amsterdam's Web site, www.amsterdam.nl, feels like an amenity, with a wealth of information that ranges from arts events to real estate to business regulations.
Such details are part of an overall effort by the Government to make Amsterdam a center of new-media technology. Jan van Diepen, spokesman for the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, said, "The Dutch Government is investing tens of millions of dollars in information-technology research institutes and in improving the information infrastructure." A recent report by the French branch of the Aspen Institute notes that these efforts have led American information-technology entrepreneurs to view Amsterdam as "the ideal European home base."
It's not surprising that the Dutch devote their technological efforts to the public sphere; after all, the Netherlands owes its very existence to huge public-works projects. As one Dutch new-media artist I talked to put it: "It's the dikes!" The country's national character is defined by public technology -- from the obvious (canals, windmills, dikes) to the more subtle (bike lanes, hothouse tomatoes and "supercows"). At their best, these technologies make the Netherlands feel like a good Web site: attractive, well-organized and incredibly easy to get around.
On my return trip last August, I started noticing well-designed infrastructure and clever gadgets the moment I got off the plane. At Schiphol Airport, the train to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or wherever you happen to be going, passes right under your feet. You descend to it via a stairless, conveyor-belt-like escalator -- no need to take your luggage off the luggage cart. Getting off at Amsterdam Central Station puts you smack in the center of the city. You can rent a bike right downstairs (which I did), and wheel it up alongside the staircase on . . . a little grooved ramp for wheeling bikes up alongside staircases, which probably has some name in Dutch.
I had reserved a room on line at The Winston, an inexpensive hotel, which, in addition to its regular accommodations, features eight rooms custom-designed by different artists. On the hotel's Internet site (www .winston.nl), you can inspect these "artist rooms" and reserve the one of your choice. I decided to try the Startel Room, festooned with representations of the artists' DNA. The hotel also bills itself as a gallery and arts venue: poets and bands perform in the Winston Kingdom nightclub, their shows broadcast over the Net via Webcam.
On arrival, I encountered a glitch: the supposedly new-media-savvy Winston had accidentally rented out my room because -- the computer was down. Would I mind staying in the Schiffmacher Room, designed by a tattoo artist? "It has . . . er . . . sexy pictures," said one of the two women at the desk, blushing slightly. "It's okay with you?"
That afternoon, with some time to kill before dinner, I decided to go out and check my E-mail. (A number of hotels, such as the Owl, have E-mail facilities, but not The Winston.) Had I wanted to take public transit, I could have made use of the national transit number. From anywhere in the Netherlands, for about 50 cents a minute, you can dial 06-92-92, and give them the address of where you are and where you want to go. Within a minute or two, a real human being -- not a machine -- will tell you exactly which trains, trams and buses you should take to get there -- right down to the minute the bus arrives at your local stop.
When I left The Winston, I pedaled off toward a cybercafe in an old canal-lined neighborhood a mile away called the Jordaan. It turned out to be a perfect ride for exploring the crucial information technologies that have traditionally defined Dutch public space: mirrors and windows.
For hundreds of years, the Dutch have been putting angled mirrors on their windowsills. These mirrors, called spionnetjes, enable one to see everything that happens on the street outside. In an old neighborhood like the Jordaan, I saw them peeking down every few blocks. The databases A.O.L. compiles on its users can't hold a candle to the intimate details the Dutch amass through their spionnetjes, or by looking in the enormous ground-level windows of Dutch houses.
The cybercafe I was headed for, the Mad Processor, is in a quiet canal house. It features a circular table covered with computer monitors connected by a high-speed network. Every night, people come by the dozens to play networked games. In the United States, these games, like Quake and Doom, are generally played over the Internet, between opponents who never see each other; in Amsterdam, people prefer to meet their opponent in person, and shout at them across the table.
"It's sort of lonely to play a game over the Internet," explains Kep, who owns the Mad Processor. (Kep is of Indonesian descent, and uses only one name.) "It's much better when you can come someplace nice with your friends." It's more social, more . . . public.
On my way to dinner, I stopped at a bank of public phones by the Westerkerk, a 16th-century church on the Prinsengracht, a canal west of the city center. One of the bright-green columns was labeled Internet, and had a keyboard and screen instead of a phone. There are 35 of these Web kiosks scattered around Amsterdam, including one in the train station; KPN Telecom, the recently privatized Dutch phone company, has been installing them since January 1997. They accept phone cards or credit cards; the cost is about 10 cents a minute. The kiosks have their limitations -- there are no seats, the keyboards are angled uncomfortably, and they're hard to spot because from the side, they look like phones. But they're great for Web surfing, and for sending quick, mindless E-mails. ("Guess where I'm E-mailing from? A canal!")
The Amsterdam new-media world is full of private little spaces, known only to the cognoscenti. Nonetheless, with a phone call or two, the digitally curious can uncover some of the attractions that don't appear on the standard tourist map.
One of these mysterious institutions is Steim, the Studio for Electro Instrumental Music. Steim, as its director, Michel Waisvisz, explained, "works in the background to help artists develop personal instruments." Steim provides its sponsored musical researchers with no-guests-allowed ateliers for their projects, "a monastery where they can isolate themselves," Mr. Waisvisz said. The artists Steim has worked with include the performance artist Laurie Anderson and Tod Machover, a professor from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, known for his digitally enhanced "hypercello" and other new musical instruments.
Steim also sponsors small performances in various places to showcase its researchers' works-in-progress. The performances aren't widely advertised, but anyone can usually attend. Just call the Steim office or check the Web site (www .xs4all.nl/steim) to find out about them. The close, communal atmosphere at these events is part of the point. Rather than doing teleconferencing or remote linkups, "we use electronics to amplify immediate presence," Mr. Waisvisz said. "This whole idea of being remote, behind a screen -- that's not going to hold out long. People want to be back in rooms with each other, packed in."
The performers I saw at Steim's Touch festival made this philosophy clear: they were festooned with digital equipment, but intimate, right there in front of you, like parlor magicians. One pair of artists used long black rakes tipped with lasers, which they swung about their heads to control musical samples; another artist controlled video projections by playing a digitally enhanced violin. Music was made with data gloves. A giant electric pipe organ was made entirely of bamboo shoots.
Later in the week, I returned to the Waag, in the Nieuwmarkt square. The Waag is the headquarters of the Society for Old and New Media, Amsterdam's premiere electronic-arts foundation. The society is upstairs, in a warren of brick rooms surrounding a fantastic skylit octagonal chamber -- the Theatrum Anatomicum. "The Waag started out as one of Amsterdam's city gates," explained Caroline Nevejan, the society's director (she has since left the foundation). "Later, it became the weighing-house, and then the building of the Masons' Guild -- that's why we have all this amazing brickwork. And then in the 1600's, it was an anatomy classroom." In the Theatrum Anatomicum, the bodies of prisoners were dissected for the edification of future surgeons -- and the entertainment of the public. It was here that Rembrandt painted his 1632 painting, "Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Tulp."
THE Theatrum Anatomicum is one of the sites of a major digital-art project called "Brandon," jointly sponsored by the Waag and the Guggenheim Museum in SoHo (www.brandon .guggenheim.org). The project is based on an article in The Village Voice in 1994 about an American teen-ager who was murdered when local toughs discovered he was anatomically female. The creator of "Brandon," Shu Lea Cheang, says the work was partly inspired by the Theatrum Anatomicum: she found it to be the perfect setting for discussions of the body and society, and the publicness of private information.
The New Metropolis technology museum, which is a 10-minute walk north of the Waag, opened in June 1997. It is a bright-green ship's prow of a building jutting into the harbor off the Prins Hendrikkade. The New Metropolis was designed by Renzo Piano, one of the architects of the Pompidou Center in Paris, and it is striking. Its roof is an immense, broad staircase facing the city, a marvelous place to soak up sun and take in the view. The interior repeats the stair motif: each of the four floors is a large step, punctured by broad staircases and balconies, so that the whole museum feels like one open space. The tickets are magnetic-strip fare cards, which you swipe to start up various exhibits.
But the New Metropolis also points up some of the pitfalls of mixing the public and private realms. The museum was financed by a partnership between the Government and a group of major energy, telecommunications and financial companies; I found the exhibits confusing and poorly thought out, often seeming to serve the agendas of the corporate backers. The ground floor is dominated by a clumsy interactive banking game for children, neither fun nor informative. And the electronic fare cards, which were supposed to keep track of how I was doing, kept erasing my investments.
The best exhibit is a big pool on the Energy floor, where children can guide radio-controlled model supertankers into multicolored plastic docks. The educational value of this exercise is a bit unclear, but it's terrifically, incontrovertibly fun. It challenges your skills. It responds instantly. It gives you a sense of control.
And this, in the end, is what I like about Amsterdam's public technology: it gives you a sense of control. The Web kiosks on the street, the well-designed airport, the transit number: they all share a common goal -- they make the world intelligible, and give you power over it.
Sometimes on my way home from Amsterdam, as I navigate the chaotic cement netherworld of J.F.K., I try to imagine what it would take to reshape New York into a place where public technology makes the newcomer feel competent and in control. By the time I'm fighting my way through the taxi line, I've usually stopped thinking about it.
 
Stops in a cyberfriendly city
Where to Stay
I stayed at The Winston, a 67-room hotel at 129 Warmoesstraat; (31-20) 623-1380, fax (31-20) 639-2308. It's just off the Dam, Amsterdam's central square, but also right at the edge of the red-light district. The Winston is inexpensive ($75 to $82 for a double with private bath), and rather stark -- definitely for the low-budget traveler. You can check out the eight "artist rooms" at www.winston.nl; doubles, all with private baths, are $81. The hotel has a laid-back bar, the Blauwlaken Lounge, on one side, and a rock and dance club, the Winston Kingdom, on the other.
For a cozier custom-room experience, there is De Filosoof, 6 Anna van den Vondelstraat; (31-20) 683-3013, fax (31-20) 685-3750. Most of the 25 rooms are decorated with memorabilia of a different philosopher, others have a cultural theme. The rooms all have private baths; doubles are $83.
And for those who must have their E-mail in-house, the Owl Hotel, at 1 Roemer Visscherstraat, (31-20) 618-9484, fax (31-20) 618-9441, provides computers with access to the Internet. Doubles are $109.
 
Cybercafes
 There are some half-dozen cybercafes in Amsterdam. The Waag, www.waag.org, (31-20) 422-7772, in the big castle in the middle of the Nieuwmarkt, has by far the best atmosphere; the terminals are free, though you are asked to buy a drink or snack. (There is a full restaurant serving lunch and dinner.) But there tends to be a long wait for a computer. Open daily 10 A.M. to midnight.
The Mad Processor, at www
.madprocessor.com, 82 Bloemgracht, (31-20) 421-1482, a 15-minute walk west of the city center, is cozy and friendly; access to terminals, about $6 an hour. Open Tuesday to Sunday, 2 P.M. to midnight; it gets crowded with rowdy game players about 10; coffee and soft drinks only.
 
Where to Eat
Among the options for dinner is the Spanish restaurant Centra at 29 Lange Niezel, (31-20) 622-3050, owned until recently by Felipe Rodriguez. Mr. Rodriguez, a prominent Amsterdam hacker, made his fortune by starting the Dutch Internet service provider XS4all. Where but Amsterdam would the essential ingredients for a Net startup be the same as those for a good restaurant? The restaurant serves such standard Spanish fare as tapas, calamari ($10.50) and paella ($18).
 
Things to Do
For information on concerts sponsored by Steim, call them at (31-20) 622-8690 (Monday to Thursday, 9 A.M. to 5 P.M.) or visit www.xs4all
.nl/steim.
 The third Next Five Minutes conference (www.dds.nl/n5m) will be held at the Waag and other Amsterdam venues from March 12 to 14. Next Five Minutes focuses on "tactical media" -- the use of the Internet and other media for alternative art and political activism. The conference will include screenings and new-media events, and will be held partly in the Waag's Theatrum Anatomicum. The Theatrum Anatomicum will also play host to events related to the "Brandon" on-line art project (brandon.guggenheim.org) in late May or June. For information on "Brandon" and other events at the Waag, check www.waag.org or call (31-20) 557-9898.
The "How Low Can You Go?" contest on March 12 will showcase ironic low-tech takes on high-tech culture; it will be held in the Paradiso theater, www.paradiso.nl, at 6-8 Weteringschans; (31-20) 626-4521.
For information on exhibits at New Metropolis, 2 Oosterdok, call (31-20) 531-3233 or visit www
.newmet.nl. The museum is open daily 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. Admission: $12.50, $8.50 for children under 16. MATT STEINGLASS

HEADLINE: Sites to Get You There

BYLINE: By L. R. SHANNON; L. R. SHANNON writes the Cyberscout column for the Travel section.

 BODY:
WEB sites for would-be, armchair and actual travelers are proliferating faster than you can say "dotcom," with so many links that it's easy to lose your way. Following are 44 useful, informative or intriguing sites that can help you find or reach your destination. 

Portals
To travel on the Web you should have a home, a place where you pick up the mail or chat with friends. If you belong to one of the big on-line services like America Online or Compuserve, you already have one, with links both to their proprietary sections and to the Web at large. But they also have homes, called portals, on the Web proper that are stripped-down versions of their commercial services; other portals were born on the Web to begin with. All offer such facilities as E-mail, news, calendars and shopping, and all have versatile search engines for finding travel sites. You can narrow your search at the beginning by going into their travel subsections.
America Online, www.aol.com. This is a very crowded page and not as homey as the regular A.O.L. site. But the travel section is filled with categories covering destinations, reservations, business travel, travel news, weather, and airline, cruise, hotel and rental car directories.
Compuserve, www.compuserve.com. Not as dull-looking as the regular Compuserve site, the travel section is slim, with seven recommended Web sites, including Barnes & Noble, presumably because you can buy travel books there.
The Microsoft Network, www.msn.com. Microsoft keeps trying. Clicking on "travel" takes you to Expedia, Microsoft's dedicated travel site.
Yahoo, www.yahoo.com. This is my favorite home on the Web, with a fairly well-organized travel subsection you can bury yourself in.
Excite, www.excite.com. This is my home away from home. I usually begin by reading my horoscope to see if taking a trip is a wise notion.
 
On the Town
MSN Sidewalk, www.sidewalk.com. For a guide to entertainment and shopping in any of some 75 United States cities, plus Sydney and Melbourne, this is a good first stop. There are also sports scores, white and yellow pages, and airline tickets.
City Net, www.citynet.com. Lodgings, restaurants and entertainment in 31 United States cities, a full plate of travel news, and reservations through Preview Travel, as well as E-mail and chat rooms.
Newsdirectory, www.ecola.com. Primarily a source for English-language newspapers and magazines, but if you click on Travel Planner under the Bonus heading you get a list of visitors centers in the 50 states by town and area code.
Fodor's, www.fodors.com. Fodor's has been a name in travel for as long as most of us can remember, and its Web site is rich with resources for making your own miniguide for a journey.
Events Worldwide, www.eventsworldwide.com. This is a reference site for festivals, carnivals, arts, sports and other events.
Eventseeker, www.eventseeker.com. An international business and leisure events database catalogued by date, location and type of event.
The San Jose Mercury News, www5.mercury center.com. A huge guide to travel, news, and everything else in northern California, and wherever else Knight Ridder publishes newspapers.
The New York Times, www.nytimes.com. This site carries articles from the Travel section, and the companion site, New York Today (also reachable directly at www.nytoday.com) can guide visitors to the city.
 
Booking Sites
Preview Travel, www.previewtravel.com. Many other services, such as City Net, call on Preview Travel for reservations. You can go to it direct, for information as well as reservations.
Expedia, www.expedia.com. Microsoft's broader travel site, where you can plan a trip to practically anywhere, and buy airline tickets and make hotel and car reservations.
Travelocity, www.travelocity.com. This is one of a handful of front ends for the Sabre reservations system that professionals use, with some 420 airlines, 40,000 hotels and 50 car-rental companies. It will even send you an E-mail message if a price changes in your favor.
Travel Facts, www.travelfacts.com. Travel Facts calls itself a research tool. Provides access to airline, rental car and hotel Web sites, a travel-agent database, all kinds of links, a chat room and feature articles.
Priceline, www.priceline.com. You make a bid for an airline seat or a hotel room, and if the establishment is willing to accept it, Priceline lets you know.
(Of course, if you know where you are going and how you want to go, every airline has its own Web page.)
 
Maps to Anywhere
The Perry-Castaneda Library Map Collection, www.lib.utexas.edu/Libs/PCL/Mapcollection/world cities.html. All the services offer different combinations of such tools as currency converters, weather forecasts and maps. If getting a map is a first priority, however, a good place to look is the Perry-Castaneda Library at the University of Texas at Austin. The endless list of maps of continents, regions, countries and cities, mostly produced by the State Department, runs from Abidjan to Zagreb. In the event that you can't find your map in Austin (Austin, for instance, is not one of the maps), the collection is linked to other map sites.
Worldwide Brochures, www.wwb.com. Here are maps, as well as guides and brochures, more than 15,000 of them. They cost nothing, usually come by snail mail and, since they are promotions issued by the countries, cities, or establishments themselves, are hardly objective sources of information.
 
Favorite Places
Caribbean Tourism, www.caribtourism.com. A guide to weather and events in 36 Caribbean destinations, prepared by the Caribbean Tourism Organization.
Paris France Guide, www.parisfranceguide.com. Paris sites are all over the Web. Here are exhibitions, entertainment and food, of course, in clear English from a print publisher of magazines, books and maps.
Hidden America, www.hiddenamerica.com. Places to go off the Interstates, and such events as cowboys reciting verse in Nevada.
Disney, www.disney.com. Disney's site is first rate if you are interested in making reservations at Disney World or Disneyland, or taking a Disney cruise.
Ski-Guide, www.ski-guide.com. Snow, lodging and dining, transportation and events at 570 ski areas in the United States and Canada. Includes most of the famous names, as well as Hound Ears Club, N.C.; Adventure Mountain Lions, Mich., and Lynx Creek, N.H.
 
On the Cheap
Shoestring Travel, www.stratpub.com. Tips, tales and deals on traveling inexpensively, contributed by its users. It is fun even if you are not going anywhere.
The Mining Company, www.miningcompany.com. This site "mines" the net to produce concise suggestions in a dozen categories, including travel. Although that category contains the usual suspects, there is a commendable emphasis on such things as camping, eco-tourism, bed-and-breakfasts, and traveling with children. The Web sites are picked by a real person with a name, not by committee or robot.
Economy Travel, www.economy travel.com. Economy is an international travel consolidator with contracts with airlines for discounted prices. The seats that go to a consolidator have not been sold through the more usual channels, so it is often possible, or even necessary, to make last-minute arrangements. You fill out a form on screen and, if a flight meets your requirements, book it. Most of the familiar airline names are on the list, as well as ones you might not think of, like Biman Bangladesh, Ukraine International and Jersey European.
A.A.R.P., www.aarp.org. The Web site of the American Association of Retired Persons has a travel section with a few articles about destinations, travel articles, and lists of hotels and cruise lines that give discounts to members.
 
It's Official
Centers for Disease Control, www .cdc.gov/cdctext.htm. Government-provided health information you may not know you need for travel, particularly international.
The State Department, www .state.gov. Voluminous information: travel warnings, addresses of embassy and consulate Web sites, a host of telephone numbers. The passport subsection has an exhaustive compilation of information, downloadable passport applications and addresses of the 3,609 United States places where you can get a passport.
Parknet, www.nps.gov. The site of the National Park Service, with information about fees and making reservations, and many maps. You can search for a park by region, state, theme or name. There is also a park of the month (North Cascades Complex, in the Pacific Northwest, when I looked) and several travel features.
 
Fellow Travelers
Traveldog, www.traveldog.com. As the old bumper sticker says, "Children are for people who can't have dogs." Traveldog lists accommodations and amenities for the pooch, including camps, day care, parks and pet sitters. A click on its Travel Agent button links to the agency Stiles in Travel, which will make arrangements after you fill out a form on the screen and E-mail or fax it, or simply phone the company.
A.S.P.C.A., www.aspca.org. A page of tips for traveling in a car with your pet. "A strong wire-mesh crate is preferable for car trips because it provides more ventilation," is one piece of advice. Line the bottom of the crate with towels or, if the pet is a cat, a small litter box. At www.avma .org, the American Veterinary Medical Association gives safety tips for "making flying friendly for you and your pet."
 
Specialties
All Aboard Cruise Center, www .flashnet./aacruise. This company says it represents all cruise lines. You can search for specific lines or destinations or consult lists of such specialty cruises as seniors, millennium and family.
Golf Travel Online, www.gto.com. Here is a database of travel for golfers; the trips can be reserved on line or by telephone. There are additional services, such as booking flights and rental cars, and getting travel insurance. Special packages are highlighted, like Bordeaux-Biarritz or Provence-Riviera golfing vacations.
Swimmers Guide Online, www .lornet.com/sgol. An international database of "publicly accessible, full-size year-round pools." If you can't find a place to swim in 5,509 pools in 67 countries you're not trying. In Andorra, try the Centro Deportivo Els Serradella.
Island Scuba, www.islandscuba .com. If plain swimming isn't good enough, drop in here to plan and book scuba-diving, including group trips, in the Caribbean. Both offshore and river diving, and many classes.
Rail-to-Trails Conservancy, www .railtrails.org. This is a nonprofit organization devoted to converting former rail lines to trails for walkers and bicyclists. It is an advocacy group and much of the site is dedicated to its cause, but it does include information about 700 rail-trails in the United States, with links to weather, bed-and-breakfasts, tourism centers and maps.
Spafinders, www.spafinders.com. You can search for spas by region or interest -- "supreme pampering," for example, or "fasting." There's also a booking function, a list of featured getaways and a day spa finder.
Weathernet Weathercams, cirrus .sprl.umich.edu/wxnet/wxcam.html. A directory of live weather cameras in North America offers a chance to see whether it's cloudy or clear in more than 800 destinations. The on-line pictures are usually refreshed every few minutes.
 
Cash Flow
Mastercard, www.mastercard .com. Visa, www.visa.com. When traveling in strange places, you sometimes need an A.T.M. more than another rich meal. Both Mastercard and Visa have sections to locate one of their hundreds of thousands of handy automatic tellers.

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
Chasing an Internet Bargain All the Way to London

BYLINE: By DAISANN McLANE 

 BODY:
ATTENTION shoppers! Attention shoppers!" The loudspeaker announcement was the cue for my mother to fling herself into the crush of eager ladies elbowing around the 50 percent-off merchandise tables. The memory of these bargain basement afternoons flooded back as I sat in front of my computer with my finger twitching on the "Enter" button at 1 o'clock one morning last November.
"Hot Deals!" flashed on my screen, and I responded with the classic symptoms of Markdown Fever: sweaty palms, racing pulse, irresistible urge to score big. Only, instead of deeply discounted chenille sweaters, I was after more tantalizing game: Chicago! Honolulu! Paris! London! Prices slashed for a limited time only! 
 In the last three years, because of the proliferation of on-line airline reservations services, budget travel has developed an exciting new twist. Most airline companies now offer, on a weekly basis, spur-of-the-moment, last-minute air fares to their on-line customers. These last-minute deals have different names at different airlines -- COOL Travel Specials at Continental, Net SAAvers at American, E-Fares at United and Hot Deals at T.W.A. But the idea behind the fares is the same principle as in any discount retail operation, from Loehmann's to Kmart: if the inventory isn't moving, cut the price until the consumers bite.
Although it is best to have an Internet connection and a Web browser to take advantage of these deals, it isn't necessary. Long before I had acquired and mastered Netscape, I was able to hook myself into the airlines' bargain basement by sending my E-mail address to the American Airlines Net SAAvers mailing list.
For the last two years, every Monday (for international fares) and Wednesday (domestic) like clockwork, I've opened my electronic mailbox to a list of American's offers, which change every week. And every Monday and Wednesday, I've idled away at least five minutes wondering whether this was the week that I should grab the $459 round-trip fare from New York to Buenos Aires, or the $279 fare from New York to Vancouver.
I never turned my armchair travel into reality, however, because -- like all amazing bargains, alas -- these fares come with quite a few strings attached. In the case of that $459 fare to Argentina, I would have to have departed on the Friday night following the Monday that the fare was announced, and return that Monday or Tuesday. When you figure that two 10-hour flights must also fit into that abbreviated weekend, there's not much time left to tango.
What's more, although the Net SAAver list occasionally included enticing destinations, the bulk of the list generally consisted of more easy-to-resist options, like, say, New York to Kalamazoo. And, during weeks of major holidays, like Thanksgiving, there were no offers at all.
Still, I couldn't help becoming addicted to the E-mail fare offers because -- well, you never know when you might suddenly get the urge to go to Kalamazoo, cheap. And last fall, when I got a new computer with a faster modem and a more powerful version of Netscape (most airline Web sites demand Netscape 3.0 or higher, or the latest edition of Microsoft Explorer), my addiction got worse. No longer did I have to wait for American's E-mail list: I could go into the Web site of any airline, and instantly see what was on the block that week.
I suppose it was inevitable that I'd soon jump on a bargain, but several things made it more attractive. In November, the off season for travel to the Europe, an increasing number of destinations there began to pop up on the fare lists. While the Net SAAvers deals (www.aa.com) were restricted to Friday or Saturday departures, and Monday or Tuesday returns, United's E-Fares (www.ual.com) had a looser timetable, allowing departure on some Wednesday flights, and a return the following Monday or Tuesday -- extra time to catch my breath between time zones.
When, in the wee hours of a Monday morning, I spotted a United E-Fare round trip from New York to London for only $239, I nearly fell off my chair. This was it.
Checking the flight availability on United's extremely user-friendly search engine, I discovered that I could choose among three flights leaving Kennedy International Airport that Wednesday night, and come back the following Monday evening or Tuesday morning, if I wanted.
The search engine also gave me some bad news: the advertised $239 fare didn't include any of the taxes or surcharges (this is often the case with last-minute Internet deals, and one must read the fine print carefully). With all the extras included, the fare shot up to $322 -- which was still, in my book, a bargain.
By now, it was nearly 2 A.M., and I was eager, but I figured I'd sleep on it. Big mistake. When I checked the United Web site again at 9 A.M., the New York-London E-Fare was missing from the list. What was up? I explored the regular reservations area of the Web site but to no avail. The deal had evaporated into cyberspace.
Sadly, I went back into United's regular reservations search engine, and plugged in the same flights and dates that I'd considered only a few hours before. Now, without the bargains, they added up to $1,406. I tried for Wednesday-to-Monday flights the following week, and got a fare in the $400 range. Reluctantly, I let go of my fantasy of a weekend in London.
On Thursday, I'd recovered enough from my letdown to venture into the United E-fare site again. Bingo! The $239 fare was back, this time for flights departing the following Wednesday. I did not hesitate -- I grabbed a Wednesday departure and a Monday return.
Once I'd gotten that far, the United reservations software came up with some nice surprises: a click of my mouse, and a map of the aircraft cabin (a Boeing 757) popped up on my screen, allowing allow me to choose my seats on each flight. An X marked seats that had already been taken, and most of the map was a sea of X's. There were still a couple of aisle seats left, so I took them, feeling lucky to have gotten on the flights at all.
After seat selection, I was instructed to make a meal choice. When I clicked on that category, a laundry list of food options suddenly paraded down my screen. There were the usuals -- kosher, low sodium and vegetarian -- but there also was Asian Vegetarian and Hindu. I figured that Hindu had to mean Indian food, which I love, so I clicked that option.
Finally, it was time to pay. Until I got my new browser, which has a security scrambler that announces itself by the presence of a reassuring padlock icon in the lower corner of my screen, I was reluctant to send my credit card information hurtling over the Internet. (Because of such concerns, Continental allows Internet customers to register their card information with a reservations agent on the phone, so they don't have to put it out on line. Some airlines, however, charge extra for a phone reservation.) But because I had used the secure Web browser for banking and paying bills, I felt confident that it worked.
So I filled in my credit card number, clicked "Purchase," and held my breath until the confirmation notice appeared on the screen.
United's E-Fares, unlike Continental's COOL specials (www.flycontinental.com), don't come with the option of paper tickets. The screen instructions told me to print out the page with my confirmation and travel information and take it to the airport.
This made me slightly antsy -- would the gate agent and security really believe I had the right to be on the flight if all I had to show them was a flimsy printout from the Internet? But flush with my triumph, I decided to put that thought in the back of my mind.
Meanwhile, I'd committed to going to London, and there was no turning back (E-fares are nonrefundable). I had to find a place to stay, fast.
United offers the convenience of a link to a hotel database. After you buy a ticket, the prompt asks if you are interested in a hotel, too. I clicked on "Yes," and filled in my information.
I wanted something under $75 a night, in a Central London location. The engine came up with a very short list of hotels, few of which fit those categories (one was 40 miles from the city!). And when I checked the hotels against my guide book, I discovered that the "Under $75"' restriction had somehow been translated to "Under 75 pounds sterling," or roughly $125, by the program -- although dollar signs appeared on the screen.
I restarted my search to look for hotels under 45 "dollars" (which got into pounds again -- making it about $75) and got even fewer results. And when I phoned the Aston Budget Studios, one of the hotels that had been recommended by the engine, they turned out to have no accommodations available for the days I needed.
I decided not to continue with the on-line hotel option. I did use the Web to help me in searching further for a place to stay, using Web sites like www.smoothhound.co.uk/hotels for additional information (and pictures) on hotels I'd found listed in guidebooks, Time Out's guide to London and Frommer's.
I am not yet convinced that it is more economical to book a room in a small hotel through an on-line booking agency (which, after all, must charge a fee) than it is to call the hotel directly and bargain.
In the end, my lodging choices came down to expediency. After placing a half-dozen calls, I determined there were precious few rooms to be had in my price range that weekend in London. When the reservations agent at the Kensington Gardens Hotel offered me her last room at $90, I took it, fast.
Could I have gotten a cheaper hotel room with more notice? Probably -- but E-fares, by definition, give you no time to plan. The bargain aspect of the fares thus may be offset by the added costs of last-minute travel, which is something that needs to be factored into the planning of any of these trips.
I approached the security check at Kennedy sheepishly, my wrinkled piece of printout in hand. To my complete surprise, the security person had my name on a special list of E-fare travelers, and she waved me right through.
I proceeded to the gate, expecting a wait with a crush of passengers on a completely full flight (after all, that little seat map had been aswarm with X's). Another surprise awaited: not only was the flight not full, but only 50 of around 150 seats in economy class were taken!
I puzzled over the mystery of why the flight had appeared full on the computer. (A spokesman for United later explained that the X's represented seats set aside for full-fare or preferred frequent fliers, and so, did not necessarily mean that those seats were sold.) Then I sat down to my equally mysterious "Hindu" meal of spice-free steamed veggies and rice, served with plain yogurt. Oh well, so much for Indian food.
I peeped into the first class compartment and noted, gleefully, that it was crowded and noisy. Then I returned to my quiet, empty economy cabin, feeling the triumph of the woman who grabs the Armani off the $20 rack at Loehmann's. I spread myself out luxuriously across an empty row of seats and slept most of the way to London.

Steam For Sale

BYLINE: By MAX FRANKEL 

 BODY:
The enduring mystery of the Lewinsky affair is why the public has been so forgiving of conduct we all so recently assumed to be unforgivable. Bill Clinton exploited that tolerance shamelessly, and his pursuers ignored it dangerously. But we all struggled to explain the phenomenon satisfactorily. Why did this sexual escapade shock so little and entertain so much?
 Questions about "skeletons" in the closet were always the first ones put to any political candidate -- and female skeletons were always the first to disqualify. Bill Clinton himself reaffirmed that sturdy standard when he greeted the appearance of Gennifer Flowers as a mortal threat to his candidacy in 1992. And when the Lewinsky dalliance leaked just a year ago, the President understandably doubted the public's tolerance for bawdy sex -- as, of course, did Judge Starr and his avenging angels. 
 Some say the explanation for public tolerance lies in the economy, the American people's sense of well-being. But peace and prosperity have never shielded politicians from scandal. Something more profound has been shaping the public's attitude. And suddenly, in a flash, at my neighborhood newsstand the other day, I found the answer.
 Virtually nothing about sex is any longer private or shocking. Sex not only sells, the racks were shouting, it sells unblushingly. Open Sex, Openly Arrived At! Seduction on Demand! Orgasms for All! The very same polls and focus groups that were sustaining Bill Clinton were inspiring the cover come-ons of all these respectable journals. The magazines peddling fashion, beauty and life-style fantasies were shouting slogans of obvious political relevance:
"BE THE BEST SEX OF HIS LIFE: How to Tease Him Mercilessly, Seduce Him Slowly and Then Rock His World in Ways He's Only Dreamed About."
"LIBIDO 101: Read him these sizzling scenes from sexy page-turners and you're guaranteed to scorch the sheets. We even found the exact page numbers so you can skip right to the good stuff."
 Was Larry Flynt intruding further into our mainstream politics? Not at all. His Hustler, and also Penthouse and Playboy, were safely segregated over yonder with the other rawhide rags. I was being brazenly wooed right out front, just beside Time, Newsweek, and The Financial Times, by the perfumed pages of nice-girl and goo1d-guy romance.
 Cosmopolitan: "Give Him the Best Sex of His Life. . . . What Does It Take to Be a Sexually Enthralling Do-Me-or-Die-Me Diva Who Men Never Forget? . . . Are You More Buddy Than Bedmate? Bust Your Lame-Lover Label Before It Sticks. . . . New Ways to Get a Lust-Worthy Bust: Whether you want to fill out that twinset or flaunt touch-me-now cleavage, we have a booty of boob boosters that'll make the most of your bust fund."
 New Woman: "Love It Up! 6 Stay-Hot, Stay-Happy Secrets. . . . 7 Signs He Still Thinks You're Sexy."
 Marie Claire: "Sex Secrets You're Entitled to Know."
 Glamour: "Is He Your Secret Sexual Soulmate? How to Meet or Make Your Man the Lover of Your Steamiest Dreams. . . . His Sex Secrets: Should You Go There? . . . Q: We're planning a romantic fling in my car. What's the best way to do it? A: Wear loose-fitting clothes . . . load up on pillows . . . watch out for the gearshift."
 All this steam, mind you, appeared in a single month, generated by advertisers whose lust for the 20-39 singles crowd obviously makes them equal-opportunity hucksters -- as hot for women as, in more traditional ways, for men.
 An obviously desperate Esquire heaved a top-heavy Pamela Anderson at me across its cover and proclaimed physiological solidarity with the girlie gazettes: "BREASTS! The Triumph of Cleavage Culture. . . . Everywhere you look, another perfect pair. Padded, enhanced, augmented. Empowered. A living, breathing symbol of our whole big, fat falsie world."
 And from Details came: "BODY HEAT! The First Annual Lingerie Issue . . . Whether it's stalwart boxers or a thrilling thong, it says a lot. It says from here on it's serious. . . . If it does its job well, you're not gonna have it on for very long anyway."
 Given how this stuff sells -- and a dozen journals of this genre seem to find 50-60 million readers every month -- how could Bill and Monica fail to sell? They have obviously invaded our minds, lived our fantasies, made themselves into us and us into them.
 Why, then, was the public's comfort with all this surging sex so surprising? Was it not the healthy culmination of our era's triumph over uptight puritans? Those of us who grew up searching for naughty words in the dictionary and tracing over Esquire's Varga girls have witnessed such startling change -- from the mere hint of nakedness in "I Am Curious Yellow" to "The Full Monty" -- that we should have known a President's dalliance and an intern's intoxication would play out mainly as late-night comedy.
 Moreover, we should celebrate our passage. Open sex is clearly healthier than sex repressed. Coping with human longings, loves and fantasies is hard enough when they can be acknowledged and confronted. Treating them as dirty and shameful obstructs human relationships.
 But open is not the synonym of honest. The steamy literature on my neighborhood rack is not romance. The emotions on display in our gamy President and prurient publications are equally cynical and synthetic quests for gratification, typical of our time perhaps but hardly edifying.
 As The Times's Ben Brantley has observed, the most open display of sexuality on Broadway this season was Nicole Kidman's famously perfect body in various states of partial and briefly total undress. But our critic found "The Blue Room," David Hare's reworking of Arthur Schnitzler's "La Ronde," to be "ice-cold" -- "a joyless cycle of users and the used," registering no more pain and passion than "the lurid neon lighting in which it is bathed."
 A joyless cycle of users and used. We know the plot. We voted for it. We'll buy it every time.

HEADLINE: A Promising Youngster Called Photonics

BYLINE: By BILL SLOCUM 

 BODY:
PHOTONICS became a buzzword for robust economic times ahead during last fall's gubernatorial elections. But for Chandra Sekhar Roychoudhuri, a researcher and professor at the University of Connecticut, the word's meaning runs deeper.
The science of light-wave manipulation, photonics has been with us as far back as the days of the flashbulb. But its applications now are nothing short of revolutionary. Photonics has become an integral part of everyday life, whether it be in microsurgery, compact disk players or in running shoes that blink at night. 
 For Mr. Roychoudhuri, head of UConn's new Photonics Research Center in Mansfield, the word prompts consideration about the next phase of human evolution.
"It all started with the Big Bang," he said. " 'In the beginning there was light.' Every serious religion talks of light being the first thing in the universe. Now humans have learned to control and manipulate this light."
Yet Mr. Roychoudhuri is frustrated. The state, he says, is behind the curve when it comes to making itself hospitable to the emerging photonics industry. While photonics has been identified by Gov. John G. Rowland as one of three new technologies Connecticut will focus on in the future, Mr. Roychoudhuri characterizes state support for his center as underwhelming -- less than $3 million in the past three years.
There is no research laboratory in Connecticut to compare with those at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology or Stanford University in California. UConn has the state's only engineering school and one of just two photonics programs in Connecticut. (The other is at Three Rivers Community-Technical College in Norwich.) Compared to freer spending competitors like Florida and Arizona, Connecticut is losing ground as the industry begins to define itself, Mr. Roychoudhuri said.
"You cannot spawn new technologies without knowledge creation," he said. "States that don't invest heavily now in growing fields of knowledge like photonics run the risk of being left behind. Connecticut in the next five years will find that out."
The Northeast is home to more than a third of the nation's more than 3,000 photonics companies.
Connecticut, seeking industrial growth since the recession of the early 1990's, had been connected to photonics long before the term found currency. In 1960, the Perkin-Elmer Corporation (then based in Norwalk) built the world's first commercial laser. Back then the field of light-wave manipulation was known as optics, and efforts by the military to harness the laser brought other Connecticut science-based companies like the United Technologies Corporation into the field.
Today photonics encompasses far more than the laser and there are more than 150 photonics-centered companies in Connecticut, employing 18,000 people. Yet few of these companies are major players.
"We are absolutely perfectly positioned to be a powerhouse, but companies based in Connecticut tend to be on the small side," said Wayne Burwell, acting executive director of the Connecticut Photonics Cluster, an informal collective.
Connecticut's most commonly cited success story is that of Uniphase Telecommunications Products, based in Bloomfield. Since being spun off by United Technologies and sold to San Francisco-based Uniphase in 1995, U.T.P. has been a beneficiary of the Internet revolution, producing lithium niobate optical modulators, which are used to modify light as it is transmitted through wires to communicate information.
Used in connection with the state-of-the-art wavelength division multiplexing system developed by the Ciena Corporation in Baltimore, these modulators can transmit as much as 10 billion bits of information a second. (A complete set of the Encyclopedia Britannica comprises 1 billion bits of information.)
In 1995, when the company was known as United Technology Photonics, 55 people worked for what was then a break-even business catering to the cable television industry, U.T.P.'s founder Fred J. Leonberger recalled. Today U.T.P. employs nearly 400 people. Monthly production has gone from 50 modulators to more than 1,000. That helped Uniphase sales jump from $12 million in 1995 to $50 million in 1998. "The Internet is the primary driver of our business today," he said.
A soft-spoken scientist who laughed and shook his head when asked if he ever took a business class in college, Mr. Leonberger now finds himself the chief technology officer for a worldwide corporation, juggling conference calls and trans-Atlantic flights in addition to overseeing operations in Bloomfield.
At the Photonics Research Center at UConn, one current project deals with the possibility of creating fiber-optic amplifiers, which would allow telephone lines to stretch hundreds of miles without a single repeater. Another goal is to create a device that would allow telephone switching entirely by photonics, speeding up the connection process exponentially. Mr. Roychoudhuri calls that the "Holy Grail of photonics research."
Not all Connecticut photonics businesses focus on telecommunications. In Willimantic, Structural Integrity Monitoring Systems is developing sensoring equipment for bridge safety checks. The Zygo Corporation in Middlefield makes instrumentation for measuring manufacturing procedures to less than a millionth of an inch. DeMaria ElectroOptics Systems in Bloomfield is concentrating on laser printing, "the lowest cost per watt of any laser on the market," said the founder, Anthony DeMaria.
Mr. DeMaria, a former assistant director at the United Technologies Research Center, focused on cultivating scientists like Mr. Leonberger, who would later start out on their own. "He hired a lot of us," said Walter Glomb, another DeMaria protege now the chief operating officer of Heliometrics, which is developing laser measurement devices in Ellington.
The merging of business and high-tech science has been one constant of the photonics boom. Small-scale enterprises, fueled by venture capital and based on patents owned by the company's founders, are springing up across the state.
"There's great engineering talent here in Connecticut," said Kevin Didden, president of the CiDra Corporation in Wallingford, which produces sensoring equipment for oil wells. "Where they used to be paid a straight salary, now they get stock options as well. Now when you talk to technical people, they understand what a stock option is."
But Connecticut's paucity of photonics educational centers is a sore point with some business leaders in the state. "Virtually 100 percent of our talent is hired from out-of-state," said Paul G. Suchoski, U.T.P.'s general manager.
One reason for the company being based in Bloomfield was its proximity to Springfield Technical-Community College, just over the state line in Massachusetts. While the programs at UConn and Three Rivers are noted, Mr. Suchoski said, "It could be 10 to 15 years before they have a world-class operation in Connecticut."
The state has been supporting its photonics industry in other ways. Connecticut Innovations Inc., a publicly chartered corporation based in Rocky Hill initially funded by state bond proceeds, is investing in high-tech Connecticut-based businesses.
Its president, Victor Budnick, says that among its successes is a $1.75 million investment to CiDra in early 1997, which, buttressed by private financing, has thus far created around $20 million in total capital.
But CiDra is the only photonics company that Connecticut Innovations is actively invested in, representing 8.9 percent of its total investment portfolio, just one of the 53 companies it has helped.
The state is also working with photonics firms on the research end. At UConn, both the Photonic Research Center and the Department of Material Sciences are working with Stratford-based E-Lite to create ultra-thin computer displays.
"There's a limit to how much the state can spend," said Robert V. Smith, dean of UConn's graduate school. "The good news is we're doing it to some degree. The bad news is we'd like to do more."
Connecticut has done as well as it has in photonics because of state-based pioneers like Perkin-Elmer and United Technologies, from which came many present-day companies, and to neighbors like American Optical in Sturbridge, Mass.
Zygo, for example, was formed by three former Perkin-Elmer employees in 1970. Today it manufactures light-sensitive measuring equipment. Paul F. Forman, one of the founders and now chairman emeritus, said one reason Zygo stayed in Connecticut was the state's quality of life.
"It's a good place to live, but if I wasn't living in Connecticut when we started the company, we would not have come to Connecticut," he said. "The locations which have a world-class research university that truly builds collaboration with industry gives start-ups a real advantage. In photonics, Connecticut hasn't arrived yet."

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: A New 90-Page Booklet;
Help for Tenants And Landlords

 BODY:
The title is "What Every Landlord and Tenant Should Know," but if New York City's landlords and tenants were told they had to know everything that's in the new booklet, they might go into shock.
Better to browse through this 90-page handbook, the seventh edition in a series put out by the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, plucking out nuggets of information. 
 It was written by Jane Dickler Lebow, who has edited previous editions, including the sixth, which appeared in 1991. Because of legislative action in 1997 there is much new material.
Browsers will learn what the mechanisms are that bring about the decontrol of both vacant and occupied apartments (page 23); what one's relationship must be to a tenant of record if one is living in an apartment and expects to succeed to the tenant's rights some day (page 11); what the rules say about subletting an apartment (page 30).
And they will get some advice. Tenants are advised, for example, that they should not ignore landlords' requests for information or other official mail regarding high-income deregulation. And landlords will find that they are required to warn new tenants of possible lead-paint risks in their buildings.
The Citizens Housing and Planning Council is a 62-year-old organization of professionals in the housing, planning and economic-development fields, mainly lawyers, architects, planners, private and nonprofit owners and former public officials.
Single copies of the handbook cost $5 and are available from the council at 50 East 42d Street, Suite 407, New York N.Y. 10017-5405.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property / 450 West 33d Street;
From Skating on the Ice to Logging On to the Web

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
THIS space is going to scream 'new media,' " said Kevin O'Connor, the chairman and chief executive of Doubleclick Inc.
The space he was referring to is the 16th floor of the building at 450 West 33d Street at 10th Avenue. For years it was better known as Sky Rink, one of the few places in midtown where skaters and ice hockey players could practice their skills. (The rink has since moved to Chelsea Piers.) 
 Now the 50,000-square-foot, column-free space is to be converted into the headquarters of Doubleclick, a company that acts as a broker for advertising on the World Wide Web and measures the efficiency of the ads. The company is one of the fastest growing of the computer-based communications companies in the city's so-called Silicon Alley, hiring on average of a person a day during the last year.
The company is also leasing 100,000 square feet on the 12th floor of the 33d Street building so it can consolidate all its operations under one roof.
Doubleclick is the first company of its kind to secure economic incentives from New York City and State to expand its operations locally, rather than keep a headquarters in the city and shift back office-type jobs to other locations. The company will receive a total of $5.1 million if it stays in place and meets job growth targets.
Rents in the building, which is owned by the John Hancock insurance company, have recently ranged from the low to mid-20's per square foot annually.
In addition to being long and wide, the 16th floor space has volume, with 26 feet between the floor and the bottom of the steel trusses that support the roof. According to Frederic M. Strauss, an architect with the Phillips Group, this layout permits the construction of mezzanines totaling about 11,000 square feet under city zoning rules.
Rather then place the mezzanine around the periphery of the space, as is most common, Mr. Strauss has proposed building two-story-high structures within the confines of the former ice rink space. The two-story enclosed structures would be used largely as meeting rooms and would stand out against the backdrop of low-level cubicles that will probably occupy the rest of the floor.
To further add dramatic impact to the space, the mezzanine-level rooms will be linked by a second-level catwalk stretching diagonally almost completely across the rink space.
In addition to the interior space, the 16th floor also includes two sizable deck areas totaling about 20,000 square feet, in the front overlooking 10th Avenue and in the back facing the General Post Office building. Those decks will be used to provide amenities such as a basketball court, a running track and a shaded dining area to the mostly young staff members, who are expected to work long hours. (A rock climbing wall has also been discussed, but does not appear on current renderings of the project.)
"People spend so much time at work that you need a place where people want to be," Mr. O'Connor said. He said the market for technically qualified employees was so competitive in New York that pleasant working conditions are an important consideration for young people deciding on which of several job offers to accept.
Other new-media companies have equipped their work spaces with exercise rooms, pool tables and ping-pong tables.
A little over three years ago Doubleclick was two people, Mr. O'Connor and his co-founder, Dwight Merriman, working in a basement in Atlanta trying to cook up an Internet-based business. Today the company has 500 employees worldwide (375 in New York), operates in a dozen countries and is publicly traded, having sold an initial public offering in February 1997.
The company's first 3.5 million shares were offered at $17 a share, but jumped to $26.75 at the close of the first day of trading. The stock has been extremely volatile since then, trading as low as $13.50 and as high as $114.62 and recently has been trading at about $100 a share.
The company name derives from the two quick strokes of a button on a computer's mouse control needed to make changes on a screen.
Mr. O'Connor said the company had the choice of relocating to the West Coast, famously the home of technology-based start-up companies, or New York. "We decided to come to New York because New York is the advertising capital of the country and this is where our customers are," he said.
HAVING a base of operations in New York was also a help in the company's international expansion. "Being from New York gives you a lot of credibility overseas," he said. "The attitude is that anyone who can build a business in New York is real."
This rapid growth has helped keep the company on the forefront of technical development but has presented practical difficulties. "My biggest challenge has been real estate," Mr. O'Connor said.
Currently, Doubleclick people are spread over six different floors of two buildings, one at 41 Madison Avenue, at 26th Street, the other at 245 Fifth Avenue, at 28th Street. "Sky Rink gets us together again," he said, using the old name of the 16th floor as shorthand for both floors in the 33d Street building.
He seemed to find that attractive, but he said that without the financial incentives, the company might have looked elsewhere. "We would have always kept a core sales group in New York, but there are a lot of people in the back office and engineering who do not have to be there," he said.
Under the deal with the city's Economic Development Corporation, Doubleclick get $1 million to keep its operations in the city and will get $3 million more if the number of jobs in the city grows to 756. The Empire State Development Corporation contributed $900,000.
Doubleclick officials said the space being rented on 33d Street can accommodate as many as 1,000 people, which gives some indication of of their expectations for growth.
Charles Millard, president of the E.D.C., said the city had targeted new media as an engine for economic growth. "The Giuliani administration is committed to the growth of Silicon Alley," he said, using another term for the concentration of computer-based companies in Manhattan. "And we want to send a message to the rest of the country that New York is behind this industry."
Developing the industry locally while it is in its infancy is important, he said, because of the jobs it is likely to generate as it grows. To the extent that new-media companies prosper in New York, they would help moderate the influence of financial services firms that now dominate the economy and extract huge incentives from the city by threatening to move.
The Web is the first new type of media to be introduced since the widespread distribution of television half a century ago, according to Wenda Harris Millard, who is executive vice president for marketing and sales at Doubleclick and no relation to the E.D.C. president. "Cable was not really a new medium," she added, "it was just a different means of distribution."
Doubleclick executives first looked at the space on 33d Street last summer, but it took until just last month to conclude a deal, in part because the company's requirements kept changing. "This is the only deal I've ever been involved in where the amount of space tripled during the negotiation," said Scott Schneider, a lawyer with Loeb & Loeb who advised on the transaction.
Because of the nature of its business, Doubleclick operates around the clock and on all days of the week -- in industry parlance, "24/7." As a result it arranged for exclusive use of two ground-floor loading bays and two freight elevators in the onetime warehouse building to move equipment in and out as needed.
Because it once housed a major bank's computer center it is well equipped with electrical power and telecommunications equipment, brokers said.
"We needed space like this," said Mr. O'Connor. "The buildings we are in now close at 6 P.M."
With the 10-year agreements now signed, Mr. Strauss said he will go into more detailed design than was possible when it was not clear exactly what would be included in the lease. Doubleclick officials said they hoped to move into the building in November.
The massive 1.6 million-square-foot building, which occupies two blocks along 10th Avenue, is also home to WNET, the public television station better known as Channel 13, and The Daily News.

HEADLINE: Trees to Harvest, at Work in the Woods

BYLINE: By CAROLYN BATTISTA 

 BODY:
JOAN NICHOLS had marked some 50 trees in a Lebanon woodlot. Now her husband, Scott, was cutting them down, one by one. "This operation -- one fellow with a chain saw dropping trees, a skidder pulling them out -- is fairly typical of Connecticut," she said.
Her husband neatly dropped a 90-foot oak; his helper, Rick Connolly, readied the skidder. Watching it all was Bill Jahoda, whose family has long owned the woodlot. "This is being done for a family sugarbush," explained Mr. Jahoda, a retired science professor. He'd helped select the oaks and other trees being removed to make more room for sugar maples.
 Mrs. Nichols is a forester; her husband is a "supervising forest products harvester," a logger. They began Nichols Forestry and Logging in Lebanon in 1990, the year they got married. They said they didn't know of any other couple in Connecticut working as such a team.
 She said she grew up on Long Island, and had not expected to take up logging. She did love her family's vacation trips to Maine and to the Adirondacks, however. "I always liked the woods," she said. "I didn't like being in the city." She said she considered a career in environmental education until her studies at SUNY's College of Environmental Science and Forestry at Syracuse set her to thinking along other lines. "We require wood products," she said. "The more I learned about cutting trees, I thought, 'If we're going to do it, we should do it right.' " 
 After graduation, she worked for the United States Forest Service in Montana for two years before settling in Connecticut, where she worked for a sawmill -- and eventually met Scott, a contract logger who had briefly attended the University of Maine before deciding he'd rather go to work. "We met in the woods," she said. The Nichols, both 39, have two daughters, 2 and 4. And while they may be unusual as a working couple, their activities are not at all unusual in the business of logging -- a dangerous, demanding business worth some $414 million annually to the state's economy.
 Douglas Emmerthal, of the Connecticut D.E.P.'s Division of Forestry, said that logging has high rates of injury, and fatality rates higher than those of firefighting or police work. "It's a high-overhead business," he added. "Insurance -- liability and workman's compensation -- is a huge expense." Equipment is costly, with $800 chain saws just the beginning. A few years ago, the Nichols paid $83,000 for a new skidder and $90,000 for a used tri-axle logging truck. Each would cost more today, and Mr. Emmerthal noted that the latest, most sophisticated models are expensive indeed. "It's not hard to spend $250,000," he said.
 Logging has become increasingly professional in recent years. To remain certified as a "wood products harvester" or a "supervising wood products harvester," a logger must attend programs on topics like safety and environmentally sound practices. "It's not just a bunch of guys with chain saws," said Mrs. Nichols. "Loggers need to do a good job -- leave the woods in good shape, but also supply specific products." That means thorough planning and careful work. "When I meet with landowners," she said, "I try to get an idea of their objectives. I do an inventory, and I try to give them as much information as possible."
A logger also needs information. Where and how will this timber be used? Generally, said Mr. Nichols, "You need to know before you lay it on the ground." Every mill has specific requirements, for specific products, and those often change, Mr. Emmerthal pointed out. "You have to do a lot of homework, make a lot of phone calls," he said. "Say you cut a tree into 9-foot, 6-inch lengths. Maybe you'll find a market tomorrow that would have paid a third more for 9-foot, 8-inch lengths."
 Timber from Connecticut is marketed widely and winds up in all kinds of products.
Mrs. Nichols eyed the Jahodas' logs. "Better logs are going to a mill in Quebec. Lower grade material is going to local mills for railroad ties and pallet material," she said. The Jahodas' best logs would go to a veneer mill in northern Vermont. On a recent day Mrs. Nichols met in the Jahodas' driveway with Pierre Lambert, a mill owner from Quebec who had come to Connecticut to buy timber.
Loggers and landowners are always looking for good markets, affordable trucking has made longer hauls feasible, and new projects keep coming along. Mr. Connelly, the skidder operator, recently bought a sawmill and has been working with Mr. Nichols to learn more about wood and woodcutting. He hopes to sell manufactured post-and-beam house packages.
Almost 60 percent of Connecticut is forested, with about 90 percent of the forested land privately owned. "I don't worry about running out of timber," said Mrs. Nichols. "More is coming of age."
But there are concerns like the increasing fragmentation of woodlands. "Woodlots are getting smaller," she said, as owners divide their land among younger family members. Some people haven't the means or interest to keep a wooded parcel. Many owners just want to get their land cleared; they tell her they need the money.
Said Mrs. Nichols: "I tell them, 'I can do that. I can pay for your timber -- but you can't cut timber like that again for 40 years. It's not going to look pretty, and it's definitely not in the best interest of the resource'."
Sometimes, of course, land is simply cleared for new development. With rising land values, she noted, "The development pressure on woodlots are severe."
Mr. Nichols added that he has to make a living. If a landowner decides to clear everything, that's what he does. "I'd rather do lots like this," he said, looking over the Jahodas' carefully managed land. "Scott is a highly skilled logger; he handles his chain saw fast, but carefully," said Mr. Jahoda. "Joan has deep environmental concerns. She'll say, 'I don't think you should cut this,' even though it could be money in her pocket."
Mr. Jahoda has found that landowners are becoming more interested in management plans that not only produce timber but also provide other benefits, like improved wildlife habitat. "We've had a forestry plan here since 1980," he said. The family land -- which includes trails and a pond -- was named a model tree farm, or managed woodlot, in 1985.
 Trees kept falling. "I hate to see them come down," he said. "They're old friends -- but they're crowding the sugar maples. My son has about 350 taps here in the spring." He set off to show Mrs. Nichols the sugar house, where his son boils sap to make syrup. Meanwhile they talked. Oak growth is down, they noted, because so many deer and turkeys are devouring acorns.
Recent research suggests that acid rain is leeching calcium from the soil. "That's frightening," said Mr. Jahoda. But mostly they talked about their fondness for the woods. "This isn't just a paycheck," said Mrs. Nichols. "It gets under your skin." She belongs to logging and forestry organizations and is Lebanon's tree warden.
 Still, she chuckled when asked what she and her husband plan for their own woodlot -- 74 acres they just purchased in Lebanon. "Nothing right now," she said. "I'd like to walk the woods and not worry about working it."

HEADLINE: The View From/Larchmont;
Teaching Respect With a Drumbeat

BYLINE: By LYNNE AMES 

DATELINE: LARCHMONT

 BODY:
KENNETH LITTLE HAWK was beating the drum. Fast, fast, faster, until the children seated around him oohed and aahed. "Now," he said slowly, drawing out the word, "What drumbeat is that?" A little girl cried out, "Indian!" Mr. Little Hawk shook his head. "No, that's Hollywood. Indians do not play drums like that except in movies, when the director wanted to indicate that one of these red savages was lurking behind a rock or was going to drop out of the sky."
Then he smiled. "I'll show you how Indians really play drums." With hands on the skin of the drum he made a steady, vaguely familiar rhythm. "This is the beat of the heart, the beat of the human heart." 
 Mr. Little Hawk, 64, a Micmac Indian, was at the LIFE Center, a nonprofit environmental education organization on Weaver Street here. LIFE -- the letters stand for Local Involvement for Environment -- has been offering classes and workshops for 29 years. A few months ago it set up headquarters in a small house near the Larchmont Reservoir. The space enables them to hold more programs with special guests. Mr. Little Hawk was one of them.
"We want activities that can excite people from age 2 to 82," Suzanne Bartash, an administrator, said. Debbie Lazarus, chairwoman of family events, added: "We like to have as a guest someone who teaches respect for animals, plants and everything in nature. Certainly Mr. Little Hawk fit that bill. A striking, charismatic man with sculptured cheekbones and long silvery hair, he spoke of the Indian's reverence for the earth, saying, "All must work together to mend the global hoop that encompasses all two-legged, four-legged and winged ones and plant life."
He showed the 50 children and adults in his audience rattles made of gourds, drums made of turtle shells and a horn fashioned from a conch shell, telling them that Indians do not like waste and believe there is a use for everything. In a slow, sonorous voice he told tales of his people.
But there is more than myth and romance to Kenneth Little Hawk. He is a sophisticated person who has worked a wide variety of jobs before settling into his current identity, 15 years ago, as performer and spokesman. He has acted on stage and in film, taught economics at the college level and held a secret government engineering job. He grew up in Orange, N.J. -- he still lives in that state, in Whiting in the Pine Barrens -- but he has traveled throughout the United States and beyond.
"At one point, in the early 1980's I decided to track down my grandmother's people," he recalled. "I went to Nova Scotia and found people who knew my family. On the way back I stopped in reservations in Canada and America. I met Indians who were alcoholics, drug addicts, people in sad situations, people in trouble, who were no longer interested in the old ways, in the old people and what they had to offer. So I decided to do this, to give talks and performances to as many as who would listen, to get the message across."
That message begins as soon as one looks at Mr. Little Hawk. On this evening he was wearing black fringed pants and jacket, moccasins, a breastplate and many necklaces. Audience members asked about those, and he described them: a choker made of abalone shell by a Lakota friend, an oyster shell with the meat still fossilized inside "gifted to me" by a fellow actor in a California production of the play "Black Elk Speaks," a little leather medicine pouch filled with herbs, roots, bark and leaves, "some known, some unknown."
He also showed the children and their parents (and a few adults who had come without youngsters) how to make use of everyday objects. "Before the Europeans brought iron to this country, our pots were made of tightly woven straw and grass or of skins," he said. "But you could not just put that on the fire, it would burn. So when we wanted to heat water, for example, we had to heat the stones and then, when they were very hot, put them in the water.
"One day my grandmother said to me, 'Do you know what else you can do with stones? You can hold them in your hand and drum with them.' " He demonstrated with two small, smooth rocks, creating sounds both resonantly hollow and clicking and flat by shifting the weight and position of his fingers. "So you can play drums with stones, but you must never, never throw stones at people or at animals. The animals are people, too."
Next came a demonstration of a rattling musical instrument made of nutshells. "When you have a bowl of fruit and nuts, you probably eat the nuts and throw out the shells. But Indians do not. We tie them to a string and make a nutshell rattle." He shook it loudly and the room grew hushed. "See, you don't have to go to Toys "R" Us for everything."
This mix of reverence and humor was typical. Mr. Little Hawk would weave a spell with his words, play a haunting little melody on a bamboo flute or cast an intense look at the audience. And then he would deliberately break the mood with a modern reference, reminding people that, after all, he was not only an Indian with knowledge of the old lore but also a regular late-20th-century guy.
The combination intrigued his audience, but there were a few who seemed uncomfortable. Michael Glotzer, 62, a retired retailer, said to Mr. Little Hawk: "I heard you call yourself an Indian. I thought that wasn't politically correct. Why don't you say Native American?"
Mr. Little Hawk looked torn between a frown and a laugh, but chose to smile and said: "I'm not about political correctness. I was an Indian way before political correctness. My brother once said to me, 'Indian is a good thing. When Columbus first came to these shores, he spoke Spanish. In Spanish, "in" means "of." "Dios" means God. So, to the Spanish, we are "Indios," people of God. I'm O.K. being an Indian."

State Program Primes Distressed-Area Projects

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
AFTER more than 15 years of abandonment and neglect the nearly nine-acre site in the southern half of Woodbury -- mostly rundown buildings, including a 19th century factory that once was an industrial engine for the southern New Jersey city -- was a shambles.
Now the site, comprising seven separate but contiguous parcels along Green Avenue within a city-designated redevelopment area, will be transformed into a residential enclave for the elderly. 
 Woodbury MewsSenior Campus, as the project is known, is expected to include 290 independent and assisted-living rental units -- some with meals and support services for low- and moderate-income elderly tenants -- in two new buildings and the old factory, which will be rehabilitated and expanded.
There will also be two other new buildings and one renovated building to house, among other things, medical offices, recreation space and an adult day-care center.
The project will be built in phases over the next two years, with the renovation and expansion of the factory to begin this spring. The entire project is being developed by International Senior Development L.L.C. of Jenkintown, Pa., at an estimated cost of $34 million.
Woodbury Mews is moving forward thanks to a new $425-million state program called New Jersey Urban Site Acquisition, or NJ-USA. It provides interim loans for the acquisition of distressed or abandoned properties that are part of viable redevelopment plans as well as further financial assistance in redeveloping the sites. The aim is to spur or enhance a revival in the surrounding neighborhood.
Thomas B. Bowe, the City Administrator of Woodbury, said that the Woodbury Mewes project would not only turn around a "financial albatross and community eyesore," but cause a domino effect in the rest of the 15-block redevelopment area where the city plans to rehabilitate low- and moderate-income houses.
The NJ-USA program, begun last summer, is the latest in an ongoing effort to make redevelopment easier in the state's urban centers.
"Too many buildings we see boarded up stay that way for an eternity," Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said in her inaugural address a year ago, referring to the need for the NJ-USA initiative. "But cities find it too difficult to take action and so they sit there ugly and unprofitable. This program will enable cities to acquire and redevelop these properties that stand in the way of redevelopment efforts."
The New Jersey Legislature last July appropriated $25 million in general state revenue to create a revolving fund for the program to provide short-term loans to local governments, nonprofit groups or private developers to buy such properties. The loans, which are offered at below-market rates, generally are expected to run six to 18 months and are usually secured by the property.
Because distressed or abandoned properties often come with tax liens the loans will, if necessary, also cover the cost of obtaining clear title to them. Other state sources will be available to overcome other impediments to redevelopment often associated with sites, such as environmental cleanup costs.
The significance of the fund, state officials said, is that no other state program offers short-term loans for acquiring properties, especially in urban areas where redevelopment is difficult even in the best of circumstances. Groups borrowing from the fund might not be able to get loans from conventional sources because of the risks involved with projects at this early stage of development.
"Yes, there is more of a risk with these projects, but sometimes the state has to take the risk," said Jane M. Kenny, commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs, which oversees the NJ-USA program. "This is one of our most important tools because it helps make problem properties shovel-ready."
"The state," she added, "is not so much interested in the redevelopment of one boarded-up building, but rather to direct its resources to projects that will help rebuild whole neighborhoods."
To be eligible for the NJ-USA loans projects must be part of a larger municipal redevelopment plan for the area and be in one of the 67 urban-aid municipalities in the state. There are no maximum loan amounts.
While the state money doesn't represent the major portion of redevelopment financing it helps "fill in the financial gaps," said William Best, executive director of the New Jersey Redevelopment Authority, which manages the NJ-USA program.
"It is a way to prime the pump because it provides the risk capital needed to spur redevelopment efforts in cities," he added. The authority, an independent agency within the state's Department of Community Affairs, was created two years ago to invest in projects in the state's urban-aid municipalities.
IN Woodbury, International Senior Development received a $1.4 million loan to buy the seven Green Avenue parcels. It is the first of eight loans approved under the program to close. Of the other seven approved loans, together totaling some $7.4 million, the largest is a $4 million loan to the Housing Authority of the City of Elizabeth.
The housing authority will use the money to purchase land in the Elizabethport section to build 115 rental units for low- and moderate-income tenants. That project is part of a larger plan to replace two timeworn public housing complexes in the area, together totaling 655 rental units in 20 buildings, with 608 new residences, some on scattered sites elsewhere in the Elizabethport section.
Projects approved under the program will also be able to take advantage of an additional $400 million in financial assistance available through the New Jersey Housing Mortgage Finance Agency and the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, also within the state's Department of Community Affairs. Those agencies, respectively, will issue $100 million and $300 million in bonds to provide financial assistance. The assistance will include construction loans, at below-market rates, as well as permanent mortgages, depending on the site's planned commercial or residential reuse.
For the developer of the housing project for the elderly in Woodbury, the $1.4 million received from the NJ-USA program "expedited the project by months, if not years," said Garry R. Hoffarth, a principal at International Senior Development.
"Typically, conventional lenders are reluctant to put that amount of money into projects that are in the planning stage," Mr. Hoffarth said. Gaining control early of the site, he added, gives the project a sense of reality, which will make a difference when trying to attract other financing from the state as well as private lenders.
The first phase of the project includes the development of 112 rental units -- with meals, recreation and personal care as options -- for moderate-income tenants 70 and older with an annual income of no more than $22,000 for a single person or $35,000 for a couple.
The units will be in the 1830's factory, a local landmark where pharmaceuticals were once manufactured, which will be renovated and expanded by 80,000 square feet to 100,000 square feet, Mr. Hoffarth said. Monthly rents for studios or one-bedroom units are expected to range from $1,000 to $2,500, he said, depending on the size of the apartment and the services elected.
As now envisioned, later phases of the project will include a two-building, 178-unit assisted-living complex and a 10,000-square-foot building containing medical offices and an adult day-care center. In addition, there will be a recreation center in a renovated barn and a separate, newly constructed day-care center for children, the sizes of which have yet to be determined. Mr. Hoffarth said Hospicomm of Philadelphia would manage the housing component for the elderly and provide the personal care.
The site was purchased from the City of Woodbury, which owned the factory parcel after taking it back through foreclosure a decade earlier. The city, using its condemnation powers under the state's redevelopment laws, purchased the remaining parcels, one of which had a $60,000 tax lien.
Mr. Bowe, the city administrator, said the sale of the property, "enhances the tax base of the city" since part of the site was not generating tax revenue for the last decade. And after reimbursing the existing property owners the city has some $500,000 "to fold into its housing program," for the area, he said, noting that without the state money "we would still be knocking on doors."
The city plans to buy and rehabilitate low- and moderate-income residences on blocks adjacent to Woodbury Mews after relocating the present tenants. The houses, many now rundown and owned by absentee landlords, will then be sold to individuals, rather than as a package to investors. Though that money is not sufficient to redevelop the up to 90 residences initially included in the plan the hope is that the activity taking place in the area will draw private investors elsewhere in the redevelopment neighborhood, Mr. Bowe said.

HEADLINE: In School, Summer and Saturdays, Too

BYLINE: By FRANCES CHAMBERLAIN 

 BODY:
EDUCATORS note with alarm the growing discrepancy between test scores in city schools, where crowded classrooms, poverty and limited resources depress test results, and in more affluent suburban schools.
So some Connecticut school districts are making a concerted effort to even the score by requiring that students in academic jeopardy attend Saturday morning classes or summer school. 
 New Haven schools initiated changes last year, when letters went to the parents of 2,000 children who were advised to attend summer school. Enrollment jumped from 810 in 1997 to 1,239 in 1998 after the notification.
This year, there won't be much choice. Any child in third grade who has not mastered the basics of reading and writing will be required to attend summer classes, or repeat third grade.
Children who do attend will be assessed at the end of the summer, and if they test more than a grade below where they should be in reading proficiency, will spend another year in third grade, in addition to attending after school and Saturday classes.
"We needed to do something to raise the consciousness of parents," explained Dr. Reginald Mayo, New Haven's Superintendent of Schools. "A drastic promotion/retention policy will get their attention."
Dr. Mayo's plan did get attention; many parents are enthusiastic and have volunteered to help on Saturday mornings. "I've been applauded for this more than anything I've ever done," he said. "People want their kids to learn. The overwhelming majority realize that we're trying to help, not hurt."
Waterbury's schoolchildren face a similar program with a recently approved Saturday Academy, scheduled to begin March 6, a proposal for mandatory summer school and the eradication of social promotion. This traditional practice involved moving students on to the next grade regardless of whether or not they had acquired the appropriate skills.
The shift in educational policy comes about, in part, because of the discrepancy between Connecticut Mastery Test scores in urban and rural areas. "We started to cast about for an economical solution for the short term," explained the Waterbury Superintendent, Dr. Roger Damerow. "All of this is an attempt to deal with test scores."
The initiatives are being supported by a $20 million state grant, approved by Gov. John G. Rowland and the state legislature, to improve reading literacy in 14 cities. "The funding comes from the state," explained Tom Murphy, a spokesman for the State Board of Education, "but the program designs are local."
While New Haven and Waterbury chose the Saturday academy and summer school model, "In Hartford they decided to hire a reading specialist for every school. They will evaluate every student and work with them to improve literacy," Mr. Murphy said. "There isn't any 'one size fits all' to this. The funds were designed to help districts expand programs. There are 14 different designs for this state initiative. We'll see how it turns out and learn from each district."
Young students in the city are up against special challenges, Dr. Damerow said. "In a suburban school, the students all come in on the same footing," he explained. "Here, they come with no English skills or no toilet training, while others have parents who take them to the museum every day. There is no baseline from which you can teach."
Mastery tests have been used to assess progress since 1993, Mr. Murphy said, and the state average has risen consistently.
"However the cities all lag far below the state average and quite far below the more affluent suburbs. The urban areas are 20 to 30 points below," he said. "These are very important numbers and we do regard this type of targeted grant with contributing to closing that gap. This is designed to help all students develop a command of reading by the end of third grade so they can read to learn."
Dr. Damerow added, "We want to do a better job with a really diverse population." About 600 to 650 children, grades kindergarten through third, will be recommended for the Saturday Academy.
"Our test scores aren't bad among other Connecticut cities, but they are poor in terms of other schools in the state," Dr. Damerow said. "The kids vary in ability, but it's not their fault. The parents are sometimes preoccupied with their own survival."
At one Waterbury elementary school, Dr. Damerow explained, children have more to deal with than they should. "There were murders in the neighborhood and people were breaking into the building to steal kids' clothes, gloves and boots to sell them. Can you imagine then what the kids are like? I was a mentor for one boy who moved five or six times in 1 1/2 years. The family had nothing and the little boy was left to fend for himself. These are scenarios that don't play out in the suburban or small town places. I'm not trying to paint the city as a bleak, awful place; it's not. But each city child is more of a story than the average suburban child. The variables are daunting."
Joseph Nolan, a third grade teacher and vice principal at Barnard School, said, "Children need to find success, and if they find success at an early age it could pay rewards. Waterbury has a fairly high drop-out rate. Maybe the academy will turn kids on to school. There will be 10 kids in a class, with teachers who want to be there. It should be positive."
Dr. Anne Wigg, who teaches a preschool program at Driggs Elementary, said, "People are tired of talking about what's wrong. They want to create effective change." Dr. Wigg, who spends her after-school hours as a volunteer tutor for about 12 students, added, "This wide spectrum has a lot to do with home environments. I have three children in my class whose fathers have been killed this school year."
Both teachers, however, argue that rather than limiting their classrooms, the cultural diversity of the city adds richness. "We have an incredible mix of kids here," Mr. Nolan added.
Dr. Paul Sequeira, Waterbury's assistant superintendent, has been responsible for many of the logistics of organizing the Saturday Academy. "There is tremendous need here," he said. "Kids must meet exit criteria and master competencies. Saturday academies identify kids who are at risk, pull them out now, work with them and meet their deficits."
The academy will be held for three-hour periods on 22 Saturdays, he explained. "It's like regular school, but with a different approach. We have a good cadre of people to make it work. This forces us all to think differently, be creative, and address the needs of the client -- the parent and child."
He added, "If we've identified the child as needing help and the parents refuse, we ask them to sign a waiver. What has been done here before hasn't worked. There is a recognition from the staff that we need this."
In New Haven, Dr. Mayo has identified two basic goals. "We want to see a 5 percent increase in reading, writing and math scores on the Connecticut Mastery Tests, and we want kids to be reading on grade level in third grade by the year 2001," he said. "Youngsters who move on, past grade four, without these skills, usually don't do well in the rest of their academic careers. Right now, this is our benchmark."
The Saturday Academy in his city is open to second, third and fourth grade students at six elementary school sites. They will have 45-minute classes in reading, math and writing, based on Connecticut Mastery Test strategies, plus one recreation class in gym, music or art. There are 650 children enrolled to date.
The Stamford School District is also considering a Saturday Academy, according to Tom Murphy at the State Board of Education.
And what do the students themselves think of such programs?
Mr. Nolan, at Waterbury's Barnard School, asked his class about the value of Saturday morning classes.
One third grader thought the whole plan was simply no good: "I think Saturday morning school is a bad idea. Because some people might not want to go, that's why. I'm not going to Saturday morning school. I just need to know my math and I just don't really care."
But others were for the plan. "I think Saturday School is good," replied one student. "Because some of us learn more. It might be fun and exciting. We might like it. We just might have fun."

HEADLINE: Businesses in Pursuit Of an Elusive Labor Pool

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
WHEN Leo James Dufour Jr. advertised for assemblers and cabinet makers for his business, Connecticut Carpentry in Meriden, he said he got a few responses, but most of them weren't qualified to work at his 14-year-old company.
"Our ads say you have to have five years' experience, and the only guys we get in the door have barely been behind a table saw," Mr. Dufour said. "I employ seven people now, but that's only because that's all I can find. I've got a lot of work booked for 1999, but the problem is finding good, skilled employees." 
 Wilson Morin, president of Capital Erectors in Southington, which puts up steel frames for buildings, had much the same lament: "As long as people have some basic skills," he said, "we can train them. But the last ad I ran for welders, I got a dozen responses -- one was a piano player, one was a painter and a couple of them were factory workers.
"It's hard to find any qualified help," Mr. Morin said. "And to make it worse, people are stealing each others' employees. You take the time and spend the money to train someone and the next thing you know someone is hiring them away."
In fact, help-wanted signs were more common than sidewalk Santas in most Connecticut cities over the holidays, and they are one sign that hasn't come down. Most economists say the most serious problem facing the state's economy in 1999 is a shortage of workers to fill the jobs that have been created in an expansion that began seven years ago.
Dr. William McEachern, an economist at the University of Connecticut in Storrs and editor of a quarterly digest on the state's economy, said Connecticut added about 20,000 jobs last year, and he expected it would grow by about 15,000 jobs this year.
"The reason job growth is going to slow is not that the jobs aren't there, just that the bodies aren't there to fill them," Dr. McEachern said. "If you go look in the technical schools in the state right now, anybody who's graduating in June already has a job lined up."
The United States Labor Department estimates that over the last six years, the number of jobs in the state has increased by 130,000, while the labor force has shrunk by 100,000, Dr. McEachern said. While he thinks those statistics might be exaggerated, "There's no question that the job situation is very, very tight."
Tim Phelan, president of the Connecticut Retail Merchants Association, said retailers have mixed feelings about the labor situation in Connecticut.
"When the economy is strong most folks aren't looking for part-time work to supplement their income, so retailers have a little trouble filling jobs," Mr. Phelan said. "On the other hand, that usually means most people are working full-time, and they have more money to spend, and that's good for retailers."
But experts say all employers could be squeezed as the labor situation tightens further. Todd Martin, an economist with People's Bank in Bridgeport, said there has been a 2 percent increase in jobs every year for the last few years, while population has been growing at less than half that rate. The unemployment rate in the state is just 3.4 percent, generally much lower than the national rate, and in some areas it dips even lower, such as Stamford's 2 percent.
"With a labor market that is that tight, you would expect that companies are going to compete very heavily for skilled workers, and we're seeing that in some sectors, such as computer programmers, companies are bidding very high for the best workers," Mr. Martin said.
The result is twofold, Mr. Martin said. First, companies unable to find employees will either rein in their expansion plans, or create jobs in a state where the labor market is not quite so restrictive. Or, companies will spend more money training unskilled workers who are still available in the state, raising their cost of doing business and making them less competitive at a national level.
Either strategy is likely to rein in the state's economic recovery, he said.
Peter Gioia, an economist with the Connecticut Business and Industry Association, said, "We've done three surveys on the business climate in the last six months, and what has come through in all of them is that companies are having a difficult time finding employees, particularly at a high skill level, but even at the entry level. Availability of workers is something that has popped up very strongly on our radar screen, where in past years it wasn't there at all."
A financial services company in the same building where the association is headquartered recently had its first job fair to attract potential employees, and it is offering existing employees a bonus if they recruit a new employee.
"Companies are doing a lot of things differently these days -- using more temporary help, making more use of overtime, using the Internet to find workers out of state," Mr. Gioia said. He said the problem could grow particularly acute in the coming year, as the economy continues its long recovery. One recent survey of association members who employ 25 or more people found that 40 percent said they planned to create more than 10 new jobs in the next two years, and almost half of those said the number would exceed 25.
Dr. Edward J. Deak, a professor at Fairfield University and head of the New England Economics Project, said it seems inconsistent to have a labor shortage when so many of the state's largest employers, particularly in the military and insurance industries, are laying off workers.
"The problem is, are they going to match up their skills with another job?" Dr. Deak said. "If people are laid off in financial services, are they going to try to find a job in retail trade, where there are openings?"
Larry Davidson, president of Weathervane, the New Britain-based clothing retailer that has 54 stores stretching as far west as Ohio, said he has managed to fill most of the sales openings in his Connecticut stores with part-time high school and college students. His problem is filling jobs back at headquarters, the accountants and other specialists who keep the enterprise on track. The labor situation in Connecticut is one of the worst he faces, particularly for the kind of people he needs to hire, he said.
"The problem is the applicant pool of people from post-college to their early 30's is smaller here," Mr. Davidson said. "We don't have as big a pool of college graduates to pick from as other states. It's a demographic issue. I think many people don't perceive Connecticut as a vibrant place for young, single professionals, so they're going somewhere else."
Eric C. Allen, vice president for human resources at Greenwich Hospital, which employs about 1,300 people, said in today's labor market, any large employer has a continuous recruiting program underway.
"We've seen a steady tightening in the job market the last few years, but particularly in the last year," Mr. Allen said. "In certain of our professional and technical areas, it's very difficult to find someone. Radiation therapists, computerized tomography technicians, intensive care and operating room nurses -- any of the serious technical areas, those jobs are very difficult to fill.
"But whatever you're looking for, it's a tough environment," Mr. Allen said. "You have to look longer and see more people, which increases your recruiting time, and costs."

HEADLINE: White Elephants, Big and Empty, Await Their Fates

BYLINE: By SUSAN E. KONIG

 BODY:
THE lights are finally being turned out at the 1.5 million-square-foot Lockheed Martin building in Lake Success. The 58-year-old structure, which served as United Nations headquarters from 1946 until 1951, will be empty by mid-month as the last of the plant's 500 employees move to a new, more modest building in Uniondale.
Developers are full of ideas about how to redevelop the 93-acre property. But until a plan is adopted, the Lake Success site will join the list of Long Island white elephants, the large buildings and properties that sit empty while their owners consider what to do with them, often disagreeing with their neighbors and local governments on issues like taxes, pollution and the impact of redevelopment on traffic and surrounding property values. 
 Easily the most notorious of these properties is the mothballed Shoreham nuclear power plant in Wading River. But the Island's economic shifts and changing values in health care and education have produced a sizable herd of white elephants, ranging from sprawling complexes like the Pilgrim State Psychiatric Center in Brentwood to relatively cozy properties like St. Paul's School in Garden City.
Some properties are coming off the white-elephant list. Grumman's old sites in Bethpage and Calverton are being put to new commercial uses. Stephen Jones, Suffolk County's director of planning, is optimistic that the list may soon be further reduced.
"The nation's economy is great," he said, "and being so close to New York City, the financial center of the world, Long Island feels the waves of growth pretty quickly. This kind of growth has been happening at about 10-year intervals, and it's happening now. Yes, changing economic tides have left quite a few properties empty. But new growth spurts are touching them and making them ripe for redevelopment, particularly the vacant military-industrial sites and state hospitals."
No single redevelopment plan could work at such disparate sites as Lake Success, Garden City, Brentwood and Calverton, and all the plans are still in preliminary stages. But they have this much in common: a desire to develop for a variety of uses. The emphasis on mixed use reflects a change in the Island's economy, Mr. Jones said.
"In the 80's, the Reagan years, our growth was still largely based on defense buildup," he said. "Now our economy is much more diversified. We need space for computer and information systems, service-oriented businesses and offices. There are also markets for housing, retail and recreational space -- not the heavy industry the Island once had to support."
But even in a boom, redevelopment doesn't happen overnight. Plans must be drawn, financing arranged and permits secured. The process can be halted at any stage by community opposition. Negotiations can take months, or years.
When visions of these properties range from parks to shopping malls, disagreements are inevitable. For example, Wilbur Breslin, president of Breslin Realty Development Corporation in Garden City, said that if the existing buildings are demolished, Lockheed Martin, Pilgrim and even St. Paul's could succeed as retail sites.
"Each of these properties has tremendous potential value for commercial use like shopping centers," said Mr. Breslin, whose specialty is shopping centers. "Many of the Island's strip malls, which were built in the 1970's and 80's, have high vacancy rates -- about 30 percent -- because they were poorly designed and offer little parking. But these huge sites could be redeveloped into enormously successful retail areas."
Such statements do not sit well with Lee Koppelman, executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board. "I think Long Island has peaked out in terms of major shopping centers," he said. "Many of the major malls, like Walt Whitman and Roosevelt Field, have been expanded in recent years.
"At this point," he said, "more major retail centers are the last thing Long Island needs."
 
LOCKHEED MARTIN
From Manufacturing To Hotels and Gyms
Lockheed Martin is the last of several military contractors to occupy the Lake Success property. Its original tenant was Sperry Gyroscope, which made bomb sights and other precision equipment during and after World War II. Its 20,000 workers made it one of the largest employment sites in Long Island history.
Sperry Gyroscope (later Sperry Rand) leased the property from the Federal Government before buying it in 1951. In 1986, Sperry merged with the Burroughs electronics company to form Unisys. The Loral Corporation acquired the complex when it bought Unisys's defense electronics division in 1995, and Lockheed Martin acquired Loral in 1996.
Kendl Philbrick, a Lockheed Martin spokesman, said that downsizing of its Long Island operations rendered the Lake Success site too large for the company's needs and made it too expensive to maintain.
Lockheed could sell the building "as is" to another user or it could sell off parcels to developers. But North American Realty Advisory Services, a real estate consulting company in Manhattan that has been retained by Lockheed Martin to help create a redevelopment plan, favors keeping the property and tearing the place down. Theodore Pugh, the consultants' senior vice president, stressed that a plan for multiple uses would be based on demolishing the building and starting from scratch.
"People are looking for more open space and less traffic," Mr. Pugh said. "We are proposing mixed uses as the best way to accommodate that."
In September, a 13-member task force representing Lockheed Martin, the Town of North Hempstead, the Village of Lake Success and local business and civic groups began meeting to monitor proposals and make a recommendation. The consensus thus far is that the land should be developed under a master plan, rather than subdivided and developed piecemeal, Mr. Pugh said. Other community concerns include traffic, maintaining the tax base, creating jobs and making certain that groundwater contamination from years of military manufacturing is remedied.
The latest proposal, developed by Mr. Pugh, involves demolishing the existing building and erecting a 300-room hotel with conference center, 300 housing units for the elderly, a 150-bed geriatric center, a 60,000-square-foot sports and fitness center, 530,000 square feet of office space and another 72,000 square feet of retail stores and restaurants. A new road would be built between Marcus Avenue and Union Turnpike to help ease traffic. Five thousand parking spaces could be added while still turning more than 35 acres of building and parking lots into green space.
"I believe this mixed-use plan will have the least amount of negative impact over time," Mr. Pugh said. "Nassau County has gotten much more congested since that building was first built. Because of increased downsizing at the site, there have been fewer and fewer people coming and going. But if another industrial firm comes in, the area will be very overcrowded and have a tough time supporting the flow of traffic."
Not everyone is pleased with the proposal. Marietta DiCamillo, a 17-year resident of New Hyde Park and a task force member, said she was concerned the plan was "too dense" and would add too much traffic to the area. Ms. DiCamillo said that she and other neighbors would like to see "more housing on the property and not so much commercial activity."
"This community recognizes that redeveloping the site is inevitable," she said. "But we want to see reasonable, rational growth. If the proposed plan were to go forth as it is, people who live south of this property would face endless hours of traffic jams, noise, air pollution and, frankly, far too many cars. We're entitled to the suburban life style that New Hyde Park and Long Island represent, and we hope a mutually agreeable conclusion can be met."
Mr. Pugh said that once a plan is agreed on, "the entire approval process could take as long as 18 months, after which the individual buildings must be approved before any construction could begin."
 
ST. PAUL'S SCHOOL
Historic Landmark May House Elderly
St. Paul's School, in the heart of Garden City on Stewart Avenue, is an architectural masterpiece listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Victorian Gothic structure was part of an elaborate Episcopal Church complex built as a memorial to Alexander Turney Stewart, Garden City's founder, by his wife, Cornelia, after Mr. Stewart's death in 1876. St. Paul's, a boys' school, was completed in 1883, the Episcopal Cathedral in 1885 and St. Mary's, a girls' school, in 1892.
St. Paul's eventually merged with St. Mary's, but the village historian, John Ellis Kordes, said that by the end, enrollment had declined by about 75 percent from a peak in the 1950's and 1960's. The school was closed after graduating a class of 28 in 1991, and the site was offered for sale the following year.
The diocese was unable to find a buyer, according to Robert Schoelle, the Village Administrator, so in 1993, the village purchased the 48-acre site for an appraised price of $7.2 million, with a notion of making it the village government offices.
The two largest outbuildings, a field house and gymnasium holding five basketball courts, were quickly put to use as a recreational center. But the Village Hall idea soon foundered -- the village had bought the building without performing sufficient structural analysis.
"We thought about moving our Village Hall there, which is greatly in need of upgrading," Mr. Schoelle said. "But a structural engineering firm determined that while the building was basically sound, it would need more than $18 million in rehabilitation, and that was simply too prohibitive."
Six years after the sale, the main building and its library sit idle.
A committee of Garden City residents and village officials was formed to investigate other uses. "We spent a couple of years looking at proposals from private schools, as well as from the Board of Education for a public high school," Mr. Schoelle said, "but again, the cost was prohibitive."
After 111 public meetings, including 15 with the Board of Trustees, 25 presentations to the village's property owners' associations, 18 interviews with development consultants and 19 with potential buyers, the committee released its recommendations in December 1996:
The village would keep 38 acres of fields for use as a park or for athletic activities; the gymnasium and field house would be used for cultural, social and athletic activities; the library, as well as eight modest cottages on the premises, would be razed, and the main building would be leased to a developer for a living facility for the elderly.
The committee is now negotiating with Carematrix, a Massachusetts concern, for a 148-unit geriatric housing facility. Fifty-seven units would be in the old main building; the remainder would be in a 66,000-square-foot wing the company plans to add to the back of the structure.
Mr. Schoelle's office said that Carematrix's latest offer includes payments of nearly $3.8 million over a lease lasting at least 40 years. The payments would cover barely half of Garden City's investment. Officials noted that Carematrix would also be making additional annual payments in lieu of village taxes, but the amount was not specified.
The deal would preserve the old building, however -- no small consideration in a village that in 1973 allowed the Stanford White-designed Garden City Hotel to be torn down to make room for a more modern but far less attractive structure.
Carematrix's renovations and new construction would take about two years, Mr. Schoelle said, cautioning that "everything is still being negotiated. There's no formal deal as yet."
"In making our decision, we were looking for a demand-driven enterprise," Mr. Schoelle said. "Senior assisted living is an industry which is growing at a tremendous rate."
It also offers the "quietest use of the building," Mr. Schoelle added, "without increasing traffic in the area."
Mr. Kordes said he supported the assisted-living plan.
"St. Paul's is an architectural gem and a local landmark, and I think the village trustees are doing the right thing, trying to find life for it in the 21st century," Mr. Kordes said. "By leasing it to Carematrix, it will get the rehabilitation it needs, and we don't lose control of it. I don't know of any better alternative."
Not everyone agrees. James and Barbara Kenny and Lawrence and Barbara Rafferty, longtime residents of Garden City, filed suit in December 1997 to stop the lease of St. Paul's to Carematrix. Mr. Kenny said the lease would be "an illegal alienation of public-trust property, since the village acquired the property with the promise that it would be used as a public space."
Mr. Kenny maintains it would take a state legislative act to legalize private use of this public space.
"We voted on the property with the understanding that the main building would be used as a town hall," he said. "Now the village says the cost of rehabilitation is $18 million and too prohibitive. I don't believe that's so. I think it could be restored for a lot less."
"I'm not opposed to having the historic main building used for senior housing," he added. "What I am opposed to is the addition of 66,000 square feet and the razing of the chapel. That's not preservation."
The case is pending in state court, with arguments scheduled for March 22.
 
PILGRIM STATE
A Development Plan Is Kept Vague
Once listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest psychiatric hospital in the Western world, the 70-year-old Pilgrim State Psychiatric Center includes 69 buildings on 820 acres of property in Brentwood. In the 1950's, the center accommodated 16,000 psychiatric patients in its 4.3 million square feet. Today, however, the number of patients is down to just over 1,000, and after a short stint housing a 1,000-inmate prison (closed because of local opposition), most of the buildings are vacant, costing the state about $2.5 million a year to maintain.
Two years ago, Governor Pataki announced plans to sell surplus land at 12 psychiatric hospitals in New York State. In a sealed-bid process, more than 1,100 acres at three centers in Suffolk County were finally sold last November: 44 acres at the former Central Islip Psychiatric Center; 408 acres at the Long Island Development Center in Melville, and 655 acres at Pilgrim State. Some 20 buildings on 165 acres at Pilgrim will be kept by the state Office of Mental Health and other organizations to accommodate psychiatric patients, said James Morgo, president of The Long Island Housing Partnership in Hauppauge, a nonprofit agency dedicated to establishing affordable housing on the Island.
The Melville-based Reckson Associates Realty Corporation won the 655-acre Pilgrim State property with a bid of $32 million.
Three years ago, a task force of community members and state and town officials was formed to oversee plans for the property's redevelopment. Thus far, a master plan recommends that one million square feet be devoted to recreational and athletic activities, 500,000 square feet for office space, 300,000 for industrial uses and 90,000 for commercial use, and that up to 500 housing units be built on 100 acres of land.
Reckson Associates must meet various specifications before getting final approval to redevelop the site. The existing buildings, most of which contain asbestos, must be demolished and rainwater catch basins must be cleaned up, according to Empire State Redevelopment Corporation in Manhattan, the state's economic development agency, which, along with the task force, will negotiate and finalize the sale.
Mr. Koppelman, the Planning Board director, warned that too much retail development at the site would "dry up Brentwood's central business district."
The people at Reckson remain tight-lipped about their exact plans for the property, until they meet task force approval. Gregg Rechler, Reckson's executive vice president, said its plan would involve "a mixed-use approach, as the task force and community have recommended," but that he could not be more specific. "It's difficult to say at this time exactly what our master plan will be, because we're working with these other people," he said.
But at least one member of the task force wants Reckson to make the first move. The Rev. Gerald Twomey of St. Anne's Catholic Church in Brentwood said he was waiting to see a master plan proposal.
"Still," he said, "the proposed senior housing is very important. Islip Township has the largest percentage of seniors of any township in the country, so affordable senior housing is very much needed here. Also, Brentwood is something of a poverty pocket on Long Island, so I think any development that brings new jobs and tax abatement is a definite plus for us."
 
NORTHROP-GRUMMAN
Military Complex To 'Enterprise Park'
It has been nearly three years since Northrop-Grumman closed its operations at the 5,900-acre, federally owned Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant in Calverton, eliminating not just hundreds of high-paying jobs but also about $1 million a year the military contractor had been paying the Town of Riverhead in lieu of taxes. Last month, however, the property regained a pulse when 1,625 acres were approved for sale by the Town of Riverhead to three developers for $36 million in cash.
The Federal Government gave Riverhead 2,900 acres of the Calverton site, which Grumman had rented from the Navy for 40 years, just six months ago, and handed the remaining 3,000 acres to the state Department of Environmental Conservation as a nature preserve.
About the same time, the state made Riverhead's property -- which it calls the Enterprise Park at Calverton -- more attractive for investors by designating 1,248 acres as an economic development zone, giving owners and tenants a variety of tax- and cost-cutting incentives, including lower utility rates, tax credits for job creation and sales tax exemptions on construction materials.
Lazarus Burman Associates, a Syosset development group, was one of the three companies that have risen to the bait. Andrea H. Lohneiss, the head of Riverhead's Community Development Agency, said Lazarus Burman had offered Riverhead $17 million for the property's 525-acre industrial section, which includes 1.1 million square feet of industrial and office space as well as a 10,000-foot runway. The company could build up to two million additional square feet of office space, Ms. Lohneiss said, and the runway would be used by industrial tenants, rather than for commercial use.
Landmark National, a developer of golf communities based in New Albany, Ohio, has offered $13.6 million for 800 acres, Ms. Lohneiss said, and would build two 18-hole golf courses at an estimated cost of over $30 million, a 300-room hotel and conference center, and up to 300 single-family homes that would surround the golf courses. Landmark was the developer of several renowned golf courses, including Palm Beach Polo in Palm Beach, Fla., and P.G.A. West in Palm Springs, Calif.
A third major buyer would be N.H.L. Skate, an affiliate of the Manhattan-based Mentmore Holdings Corp., which has offered $5.4 million for 300 acres, where it plans to build a baseball stadium, a sports complex and a family entertainment center.
Of the remaining 1,275 acres owned by Riverhead, 410 acres of pine barrens have been designated for preservation and can never be developed. Some of the rest will be dedicated to green space, some may be used for a sewage treatment plant, and only 200 acres are not spoken for, Ms. Lohneiss said.
Ms. Lohneiss's agency, which includes town residents and business leaders experienced in real estate development, will draw up and finalize the sales contracts. She predicted that environmental impact studies and zoning changes should not be stumbling blocks at this point, noting that the Navy completed an environmental review of the site before Riverhead took possession. A rezoning plan to accommodate the proposed uses is also already under way, she added, and could be in place as early as April.
Community reaction seems uniformly positive, presaging little of the rancor that has infected the planning for other white-elephant sites. Harvey Hellering, a retired telecommunications executive who has lived in Riverhead for 13 years, called the plans ideal.
"We don't want an enormous development here, because it's where we live," he said. "But the Calverton site is very out of the way. You don't pass it as you drive along the main highways. It's a beautiful development which is completely infrastructured and doesn't need much work. Yet it's been just sitting there. The Town of Riverhead has so much tax-free government land that we really don't have a good tax base, and we lost about $1 million a year when Grumman left. Now we have the chance to regain that money."
He also noted that the redevelopment would create badly needed new jobs. "We lost 3,000 to 4,000 jobs over the years as Grumman left," he said.
Ms. Lohneiss said the town's consultants had projected that "within five years 2,200 new jobs with an annual payroll of $26 million will be created and property taxes should reach about $1.7 million."
"We believe the impact of these sales will be wonderful, not only for the town of Riverhead but for all of Suffolk County," Ms. Lohneiss said.

HEADLINE: IN MY . . . PURSE/KAREN HIMLE

BYLINE: By ROY FURCHGOTT 

 BODY:
As senior vice president for corporate affairs at the St. Paul Companies, an insurance conglomerate in Minnesota, Karen Himle totes the predictable accouterments of her trade, from pens to legal documents. But the other contents of her Louis Vuitton purse say almost as much about the local climate as they do about her job.
Inside are two tubes of hand cream, six tubes of lipstick and two containers of lip balm. "Winter is very dry," she says. 
 The bag was a Christmas gift she requested for its ample interior; her old one couldn't handle all the stuff she likes to have on hand for her two daughters, Lauren, 9, and Kirsten, 5. On this day, out tumbled a grape Juicy-Juice box drink, a lollipop and a canister of undeveloped film from a snowmobile vacation and Lauren's birthday party.
The purse also holds many business cards, which she keeps not only as a record of whom she has met but also for scrap paper. "I always take notes on the back," she said.
It is clear that Ms. Himle, 43, wasn't prepared for the recent increase in stamp prices. The bag contains a variety of unpaid bills, each awaiting an extra penny of postage.

Restorer From Monticello
Peter Hatch, director of gardens and grounds at Monticello, will talk about his 22 years of restoring, maintaining and writing books on the subject on Wednesday at 10 A.M. at Phillipsburg Manor in Sleepy Hollow. 
 His illustrated lecture, "Thomas Jefferson, Gardener," will explore the passion for gardening that led Jefferson to plant 113 species of ornamental trees, 65 varieties of shrubs, more than 100 herbaceous plants in the flower gardens and 450 varieties of 95 species of fruits, vegetables, nuts and herbs.
After his death in 1826, the gardens fell into ruin, but thanks to his record keeping and Mr. Hatch and his associates, they have been restored.
Washington's home will be the subject of a program on March 10 at 11 A.M. at the same site. Dennis Pogue, director of restoration at Mount Vernon, will talk about "Reconstructing George Washington's Pioneer Farm." In a departure from the traditional focus on Washington and the house where he spent many years and died, Mr. Pogue will describe the 5-year, $3 million project in which a new agricultural exhibition was created on the grounds, defining Washington's place in agricultural history and the slave-based economy under which his farm thrived. The restoration includes the re-creation of Washington's barns and outbuildings.
The fee for each lecture is $10 by advance registration. Both programs were organized by Lyndhurst in Tarrytown, a property of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, and Historic Hudson Valley. For reservations, call 631-4481.
 
Lithographer at Purchase
Ed Colker, whose woodcuts, lithographs, etchings and limited editions may be seen at the Neuberger Museum of Art at Purchase College through April 25, will lead an informal gallery tour of his work during the Art Sandwiched-In program on Wednesday at noon.
"Five Decades in Print: Ed Colker," a traveling exhibition organized by the University of Arizona Museum of Art in Tucson, is meant to show that the artist is an illuminator, rather than an illustrator.
He received classical training as a designer, etcher and engraver at the Philadelphia Museum School. During his long career he has been a dean and department head at the University of Illinois in Chicago and at Cornell University. He served as dean of visual arts at Purchase College from 1980 to 1985 and recently retired as provost of Pratt Institute in Brooklyn.
Admission to the Neubergeris by donation of $4, $2 for people older than 64 and students. Children younger than 13are admitted free. For more information, call 251-6100.
 
Evening on Haiti
An evening of Haitian music, dancing, readings of prose and poetry and impromptu dialogue begins today at 5 P.M. in the living room of the Edward Hopper House in Nyack. It is the first in a series of programs related to the current exhibition of Haitian art from the private collection of the filmmaker Jonathan Demme.
Steve Deats of the Rockland Conservatory of Music will provide the beat for the dancing of Rose Deats. Mr. Deats is the Haitian drummer featured on the soundtrack of Mr. Demme's film "Beloved." Cheri Perkins-Raglan will read from her poems, and a reception will follow the performance.
Hopper House Art Center is at 82 North Broadway. Admission is by donation of $3. For more information, call 358-0774.
 
Dance Performance
"See the Music, Hear the Dance," a program performed by members of the Westchester Philharmonic Orchestra and the Mid-Westchester Y Dance School in New Rochelle, is meant to involve children from 6 through 12 years in the creation of a dance performance through the collaboration of composer, musician, choreographer, dancer and conductor.
The program, to be presented today at 1 and 2:30 P.M. at the Performing Arts Center at Purchase College, is one of the orchestra's informal Sunday afternoon concerts aimed at introducing children to classical music. The program will include works by Glazunov, Offenbach and Scott Joplin.
A concert on March 14 in the same spot at 1 and 2:30 P.M. will be narrated by the actress Lucie Arnaz. The story, written by Sharon Dennis Wyeth with music by Brad Ross, is from "A Family for Baby Grand." It follows the piano on its travels from the protection of its concert grand mother to a store window and eventually to the concert stage where the baby grand becomes part of a new family of violins, tubas, piccolos, trombones and bassoons.
The price of both concerts is $30, $20 for children. Single tickets are $17.50 and $12.50.. Call 682-3707, extension 10, for reservations or more information.
 
Looking at Women in Art
"Salome: Images of Women in Contemporary Art" opens today at the Castle Gallery of the College of New Rochelle, remaining through April 9. The exhibition presents an overview of the way women are represented in art at the close of the millennium.
"We can no longer take images of women at face value," Katherine Gass, guest curator of the exhibition, said. "A wide range of subtexts have emerged that challenge us to look with harder intensity and greater intellectual consideration."
The use of Salome as a metaphor for the complexity of a woman is based on interpretations of power, seduction, loyalty and revenge, which motivated her demand for the head of John the Baptist as quid pro quo for dancing for King Herod.
A reception will be held today from 2 to 4 P.M. for the painters, sculptors, photographers and video artists who contributed to the show. They include John Ahearn, Chuck Agro, Maureen Connor, John Currin, Barbara Ess, Jenny Gage, Dana Hoey, Catherine Howe, Richard Kern, Kellie O'Bosky, Tony Oursler and Hannah Wilke.
A panel discussion among the artists, Ms. Gass and Dr. Susan Channing, chairwoman of the Arts and Sciences Department at the college, will take place on March 3 in the auditorium.
Admission to the exhibition and the panel discussion is free. Call 654-5423 for more information. ELEANOR CHARLES

HEADLINE: The Fight to Restore the Hudson's Beauty;
River of Dreams: Clean Up the Waterfront and the Tourists Will Come

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
ONCE so pristine it fired the passions of an entire school of painters, the Hudson River waterfront has become littered with the remnants of industrial development. While environmentalists, developers and city planners grow frustrated with the landscape of deteriorating bulkheads and abandoned factory buildings, they are also thwarted by a fickle marketplace, the cost of removing chemical contamination and political infighting.
In the more than decadelong struggle to rehabilitate the property between the train tracks and the water, those groups have logged few gains. From Yonkers to Peekskill, officials continue to seek solutions while enticing real estate speculators to the river's edge and trying to pacify an electorate eager to eliminate pollution. 
 Officials are also wrestling with these questions:
*In seeking profits, will waterfront developers build so densely that they obscure views of the Hudson and bar access to the public?
*What mix of residential, commercial and recreational development is appropriate?
*When housing is built, what balance should be struck between market-rate units and affordable ones?
Such problems are not unique to the Hudson waterfront. "We're seeing the same phenomenon around the globe," said Dick Rigby, co-director of the Waterfront Center in Washington, a 17-year-old nonprofit consulting organization.
"In a word, the problem is de-industrialization," Mr. Rigby said. "That has left a lot of abandoned territory, but it also spells opportunity, although there are often many issues to sort out first."
For the 10 communities along the 49 miles of Hudson River in Westchester, there have been shared dilemmas like housing projects that have fallen through and special problems in deciding what to do with property when a major corporation leaves town.
In Hastings-on-Hudson, for example, a series of optimistic waterfront development proposals in the late 1980's and early 1990's finally gave way to an economic recession and then to the discovery last year of polychlorinated biphenyls buried along the waterfront. Concentrations of underground PCB's at a former industrial site in the village measured as high as 381,000 parts per million, the State Department of Environmental Conservation reported. The state standard for PCB's below the surface is 10 parts per million.
The Hastings riverfront has the highest concentration of PCB's of any site in the state, and it is believed that the contaminants are flushing into the main waterway with each tide. PCB's used at the former Anaconda Cable and Wire factory have been shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals and is linked to learning problems in children exposed even to small amounts before birth.
Worried Hastings residents -- who several years ago fought against growing piles of garbage illegally dumped on their docks -- marched on Albany last week demanding an immediate cleanup of the latest threat to their quality of life.
"We're taking the bull by the horns in this matter to get a cleanup going," said Jean Zimmerman, chairwoman of the Hastings Waterfront Watch citizens group, who said she was angry and frustrated. "And we're going to keep fighting until that happens."
In Tarrytown, efforts to transform an aging industrial site to a park have also been thwarted in part by pollution (coal tar deposits from industrial uses) but mostly by what Mayor Eileen Pilla describes as "politics, pure and simple politics."
Members of the Board of Trustees have failed to agree on what constitutes proper development for the village -- and as a result, in the last three years residents have seen only limited revitalization of their 22-acre waterfront. "They just don't get it," Mayor Pilla, a Democrat, said last week of Trustees who oppose her plans for housing and a supermarket at the river's edge. "What they forget is that our waterfront is a contaminated site, and a redevelopment company is willing to come in and clean it up and invest millions of dollars in projects that would in turn contribute to our tax base."
The bulk of the resistance to Mayor Pilla's plans has come from Trustee Paul Janos Jr., a Republican and restaurateur who is running for Mayor. The fight with the current Democratic administration is not about whether to clean up and develop the waterfront, Mr. Janos said, but how best to accomplish those goals. (Mrs. Pilla announced recently that she would not seek re-election.) With the remark "Let's do our homework first," Mr. Janos said that the 400 housing units proposed by the Mayor would increase the village's population "by 10 percent overnight" and would put stress on Tarrytown's road system.
A less contentious scenario is taking place in the village of Ossining, where Cappelli Enterprises of Valhalla has an agreement with the village to develop residential units, an amphitheater, a restaurant and a health and fitness club on 10.5 miles of the village's waterfront.
Ossining's redevelopment plans have been unusual in Westchester in that they have taken only three years to evolve -- "and with no hassles," said Michael D. Zarin, a White Plains lawyer and land-use expert representing the village.
"There will be some affordable housing and also housing for the affluent," Mr. Zarin said. "Ossining is a diverse community, and the waterfront will reflect that."
He observed that the ease with which the redevelopment project has been accepted reflects "a somewhat apolitical Village Board that has not infused politics into this."
Just south of Ossining in the village of Sleepy Hollow, dissension over the waterfront has come not from within but from an increasingly strained relationship between village officials and the major corporation, General Motors, which dominated the waterfront there for almost a century. Villagers are now witnessing the dismantling of the General Motors plant, which was closed about two years ago.
Mayor Sean Treacy said last week that he is worried that G.M. will redevelop its 100-acre scenic property near the Tappan Zee Bridge with scant regard for the present needs of the village. G.M. had employed generations of Tarrytown residents at its Westchester plant since the early 1900's, and the village is now struggling to shift its economy and carry on, the Mayor said.
While he said he is hopeful that a potential developer -- Donald Trump is reportedly among them -- will envision a bold future for the property, Mayor Treacy said he wants it to have a variety of uses and remain accessible to the public for boating and hiking.
Up and down the river there is also talk of attracting tourist dollars.
"But none of us really believes that our waterfronts are going to become a Disney World on the Hudson," Mayor Treacy said.
Mayor Robert W. Elliott in Croton-on-Hudson agreed. "It will be as much or as little as each community wants," he said, observing also that most tourists would be attracted to the cultural and scenic attributes of the river and not to large commercial ventures along it. He predicted, however, that some day ferries would busily crisscross the river again, as they did earlier in the century.
New York Waterway operates a seasonal tourist ferry from Manhattan to Tarrytown and plans to begin another this spring to carry commuters back and forth from Haverstraw in Rockland County to Ossining, where they can board trains to New York City.
Mayor Elliott, also president of Historic Rivertowns of Westchester, an alliance concerned with future uses of the river, said all but a small section of Croton-on-Hudson's waterfront is owned by either the village or the county. The village's plans are to maintain a large part of its nine miles of waterfront as open space for recreational use -- and not to develop it commercially.
Nearby Cortlandt has the longest waterfront in the county -- 11 miles -- and has decided to keep almost half of it as open space.
In Yonkers, which has 5.3 miles of waterfront, many proposals for redevelopment have failed over the years, apparently because of poor planning and changing economics.
Most notably, a plan announced in 1979 for a 1,850-unit condominium project, Pierpointe on the Hudson, was barely under way before it collapsed under financial pressure. Less than 10 percent of the units were eventually developed, and the rest of the plan was abandoned.
"In the past, the city has left the details and responsibility of the waterfront to private developers," James Surdoval, Director of Downtown and Waterfront Development, said. "Now we're working in partnership with the private sector."
Mr. Surdoval said the developer for the current proposal, Collins Enterprises of Old Greenwich, will build market-rate rental housing, along with office and retail space. In addition, a public park and an esplanade are planned for the first phase, to be completed in two years. The property is to be developed with a combination of Federal, state, county, city and private funds, Mr. Surdoval said.
In part, an unpredictable economy also foiled earlier plans for development of the waterfront in Dobbs Ferry. In the late 1980's, a bankrupt developer walked away from a proposed 140-unit housing project, leaving behind unfinished model homes and construction debris near a steep hill leading to the Hudson.
The project became the subject of a lawsuit prosecuted by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., senior lawyer for the Riverkeeper Fund and a professor at the Environmental Litigation Clinic of Pace University's School of Law. The successful citizens' suit, which was filed in Federal District Court in White Plains, cited sections of the Clean Water Act and said the crumbling development posed a threat to populations of fresh water fish and blue crabs in nearby Wicker's Creek.
Now, 90 duplex town houses are being proposed for the site, although those plans are encountering roadblocks. This time, a citizens group and others are objecting to the project because it would be near an American Indian archeological site and shell midden where thousands of artifacts like knives, hunting tools and pottery have been unearthed.
Some progress is being made through the efforts of land trust groups. In Irvington, the nonprofit Scenic Hudson Land Trust stepped in last spring to help transform 12 acres of industrial waterfront to a park, buying two parcels on the waterfront. That project also marked the state's first expenditure of $175,000 in Clean Water/Clean Air Bond Act funds to clean up contaminated sites. In the case of Irvington, the contaminants are lead and small amounts of petroleum hydrocarbons. In Peekskill the land trust recently helped buy 8.1 acres on the river with matching city funds. The plans call for cleaning up a former industrial site for recreational use.
Observers like Jeffrey Anzevino, a waterfront specialist and planner for Scenic Hudson in Poughkeepsie, said that for many communities the question is, Will proposals become a reality or will they become casualties of a changing economy and conflicting political goals?
Another uncertainty ahead for Westchester's waterfront involves the pockets of riverside contamination and who will bear responsibility for undoing past land-use mistakes: the municipalities, the state, the present owners or a combination of those? Will the worries of the people who live along the river and visit it be heard?
"Often when a highly toxic site is discovered, the community doesn't have the courage to resist, but we're determined to get officials to listen to us," Mrs. Zimmerman in Hastings said.

HEADLINE: In the Region / Connecticut;
Developer Uses State Law to Fight Local Resistance

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
LATE last month displeasure with Connecticut's Affordable Housing Law led Darien to follow a path blazed in New Canaan two years ago by condemning an approved residential complex that would have had a 25 percent component of units for moderate-income tenants. Plans to purchase the Darien property by eminent domain for municipal purposes are under way.
Also last month, a referendum in the affluent community of Orange in New Haven County approved, by a vote of 1,523 to 326, condemnation of a 10-acre parcel that was under purchase contract for development as rental apartments. 
 In all three communities the developer whose projects were the target of municipal takeover was Avalon Bay Communities of Alexandria, Va.
All three projects are typical of Avalon's design for luxury -- low-rise rental-apartment communities built in New England architectural style and offering residents pools, clubhouses, concierge services, gyms and other amenities.
And all three projects were also typical of another Avalon strategy -- using Connecticut's Affordable Housing Law as a way to overcome local opposition in upscale residential towns where rental apartments are perceived as serving an undesirable transient market. Under the state law's provisions, local authorities who reject projects with moderate-rent components cannot prohibit their construction unless they can prove to the court's satisfaction that the plans threaten the community's welfare.
The law was adopted in 1989 in an effort to increase the state's stock of housing with moderate rents or prices to 10 percent of dwellings in every town. Most Fairfield County communities fall well below that goal.
Developers who provide the 25 percent component are granted extra density for their projects. The income of tenants for the below-market-rate rental units may not exceed 80 percent of the state's or area's median income, whichever is lower. Qualified applicants are selected on a first-come, first-served basis. In a high-income area such as lower Fairfield County, 80 percent of the state median income of about $54,000 would apply in determining below-market rents.
Avalon has contracted to buy the 32 acres on which to build 189 apartments in 24 buildings in Darien from the D'Addario family. The only access to the property is through a 3.7-acre parcel owned by David Duhaime, a New York City developer, whose application to build 148 apartments in an adjacent parcel was rejected. The Selectmen have resolved to condemn his project as well.
"This has become a common tactic in Fairfield County," said Ridgely Brown, Mr. Duhaime's lawyer. "The town uses condemnation to make things negotiable."
During the law's decade of existence Avalon has been successful in using the law to build apartments in Trumbull, where resistance was severe, and in Wilton, where it was less severe.
In New Canaan, mediation ended in an agreement whereby the town deeded a 9.1-acre site to Avalon elsewhere in the municipality in return for the 3.64-acre downtown site owned by the developer. Avalon then signed a 99-year lease for 10,000 square feet of the property to build a 15,000-square-foot office building.
Unlike New Canaan, Darien has no alternate sites to offer. "We are completely built out," said First Selectman Robert F. Harrel, Jr. "When we add onto a school we have to take land from athletic fields or open space. I don't think people were put off by the affordable housing component. What Avalon charges for affordables is a reasonably healthy rental."
Timothy Hollister, a Hartford lawyer who specializes in affordable housing cases, is handling the Darien and Orange disputes for Avalon. The company is a defendant with Darien in a lawsuit brought by Mr. Duhaime appealing the approval of Avalon's application for 189 apartments next door to his rejected project.
"The law is successful but agonizingly slow," said Mr. Hollister. According to a survey he conducted two years ago, 1,500 units around the state received zoning approval in housing courts set up to hear cases related to the law. "That's about 2 percent of the building permits issued for housing."
BEFORE Darien's condemnation resolution becomes a reality, an appraisal of the property must be made for the town, and a vote on appropriating funds to acquire the property by eminent domain must be taken by Darien's Board of Finance and Representative Town Meeting.
In the meantime, Samuel B. Fuller, regional vice president of Avalon Bay Communities, said, "Darien's decision doesn't change our position. We will go ahead expeditiously to begin development. Condemnation will cost them north of $20 million. That's the value for which we have an appraisal based on the highest and best use of the land."
Darien and Orange have contended that there are pressing needs for the parcels in question. In Darien, Mr. Harrel said, "municipal uses have not been totally defined, but we need a senior center, athletic facilities, a community center, and child care."
Orange held two referendums on borrowing $1.5 million to purchase Avalon's optioned 10 acres. The first failed. The second won after Robert C. Sousa, the First Selectman, convinced the town that 200 acres south of Route 1, including the Avalon parcel, would be ideal for a technology park.
"We are not worried about affordable housing," he said. "We have 13,000 people in 4,000 homes. Avalon wants 168 apartments, or 4 percent of the town's housing. We are concerned about the size."
A 40-acre parcel behind Route 1 was offered by the town as an alternate site and rejected by Avalon because it determined that 35 acres are wetlands.
Shortly after Avalon submitted its application to Orange in 1997 the zoning was changed to eliminate residential and retail uses on the entire 200 acres, retaining only industrial use. A 50-acre parcel next to Avalon's, owned by Stew Leonard's supermarkets since 1996, was also rendered useless and is subject to condemnation.
"We're still shaking our heads, wondering what they want," said Stew Leonard Jr., president of the firm. A Marriott Hotel, Christmas Tree Shop, and two restaurants have recently been built adjacent to his land. "We're just going to sit on it, plant corn for a few years," Mr. Leonard added.
Ernest Cuzzocreo, owner of 70 of the 200 acres, including the optioned Avalon parcel, is skeptical about prospects for a technology park. "I've had the land for sale for many years with different brokers, and there has been no activity whatsoever," he said. "In the past four years the town's Economic Development Commission has not brought a single prospect to look at the property."
Nor is he pleased with the town's offer of $1.5 million when Avalon has appraised it at $6.5 million.
In three towns where affordable housing is in good supply Avalon is building market-rate apartments. Avalon Valley with 268 apartments, and Avalon Lake with 135, are rising in Danbury and open for leasing. Occupancy is scheduled for early spring. Avalon Haven in North Haven received a required zone change and construction will start on 128 apartments this summer.
The remaining four of Avalon's eight Connecticut projects are in Stamford, one of the few Fairfield towns that exceeds the 10 percent affordable housing goal. As a result, said Robin Stein, Stamford's director of land use planning, "they don't need to use the affordable units as a club to get in here."
Three of the Stamford complexes will be rented at market rates, the fourth, on the former Burdick Elementary School site owned by the city, must have 15 percent of the 300 units offered at affordable rates under the city's own ruling.
Avalon Grove and Avalon Glen, built in downtown Stamford during the 90's with a total of 638 apartments, charge from $1,300 to $3,200 a month for one- to three-bedroom units; occupancy is 95 percent. "They are obviously serving an important niche in the market," said Mr. Stein.
Pent-up demand that Avalon and other builders are fulfilling could be intensified, he said, when construction of three or four approved office buildings is no longer delayed by lack of financing due to a dearth of preleasing commitments.
Avalon's success nationwide is grounded in its policy of building the kind of luxury rental apartment communities that attract young professionals on their way up to home ownership and older empty-nesters scaling down from a large house. The company targets attractive towns close to major cities, towns where incomes are relatively high.
Rents have escalated with inflation, a robust economy, and luxurious extras in amenities and architectural features, leading to questions in a heterogeneous city like Stamford about Avalon's selective use of the affordable housing law, and an appearance of elitism.
"They tend to build gated communities," said Mr. Stein. "We don't see as many of the people who live in Avalon Grove walking around downtown as we had hoped. They drive in and drive out -- like people do at the mall."
"Part of Avalon's success is price," he acknowledged, "but given the legitimate concern about affordable housing here we would like to explore with them ways to get more of it."

How to Break The Chains

BYLINE: By MICHELLE COTTLE; Michelle Cottle is a Washington writer.

 BODY:

Q. I work for a lawyer who has become very abusive. He tells clients that I am messing up their cases and losing paperwork. He alternately curses me and calls me "dear." At the same time, he is constantly giving mesmall gifts. I am seeking other employment, but he has tried to stop me. Now he insists that we walk out of the office together so that other lawyers in the building can see that he, in his words, owns me. His best effort at flattery was to tell me jokingly that if I left, he would die. I know he has behaved this way toward former female employees, but since he is a sole practitioner and I am the only employee, there's no way for me to go over his head. Any advice?
 
A. Get out. Your boss sounds not just abusive, but downright creepy. Even if his more bizarre statements are in jest, his fixation on you seems decidedly unhealthy. 
 "Some of the things he's doing come close to being physically dangerous -- walking her out and making subtle threats," said Cindia Cameron, organizing director of 9 to 5, National Association of Working Women, which is based in Milwaukee. You should check the hours that your building has a security guard on duty, Ms. Cameron suggested.
In finding a new job -- and in surviving in the meantime when there are only two of you -- you face an especially sticky situation. First, make sure you have calmly told your boss exactly what behavior you find so objectionable. Then, if you still have to, put your points in writing and present them to him.
Ms. Cameron advises being as specific as possible. "There's no point in saying, 'Your behavior is making me crazy,' " she said. Instead, ask your boss to refrain from giving you presents, calling you "dear" and criticizing you in front of clients.
Save a copy of your note at home. If the situation worsens and you resign before finding other work, the documentation could help you collect unemployment insurance benefits. "She would have a viable argument that she didn't quit per se, but was really forced to quit in terms of how he treated her," said Doris Ng, a lawyer for Equal Rights Advocates, an advice and counseling organization based in San Francisco.
Because your boss seems intent on sabotaging your job search, try to keep him in the dark as to where you're looking. Should potential employers ask for references, simply explain that you can't list your current boss because he does not want you to leave, Ms. Cameron advised.
As for your rights, legal action doesn't sound like a choice at this point. "There's no law against being a jerky boss," she said.
Although your workplace certainly sounds hostile, whether your boss's behavior rises to the level of sexual harassment is open to question, Ms. Ng explained. "There doesn't seem to be any quid pro quo involved," she said.
Rather than prolonging the fight with your boss, better to simply end it. And, after you escape to a new job, just make sure you don't leave him a forwarding address.

HEADLINE: Filling in the Blanks At Battery Park City

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
"I GET a headache if I don't hear the sound of piledrivers," said James F. Gill, the chairman of the Battery Park City Authority.
Hold the aspirin. 
 So many projects are under way at Battery Park City that the 92-acre landfill along the Hudson River, a once-blank slate on which politicians and planners have been writing for four decades, is actually running out of room.
"We're going like the hammers of hell," Mr. Gill said. Two thousand apartments in eight buildings, a Ritz-Carlton and an Embassy Suites hotel, an addition to the Museum of Jewish Heritage-A Living Memorial to the Holocaust and a home for the Skyscraper Museum, two public schools, four ferry slips and a 15-screen multiplex are newly finished, in construction or being designed. If Mr. Gill had his way, the recently merged National Association of Securities Dealers and American Stock Exchange would be in the mix, too.
All told, the current boom involves 10 of the remaining 18 undeveloped parcels. And Mr. Gill said he has "every intention" of allocating the rest of the available lots on his watch. "Battery Park City sat doing nothing for a long time," he said. "I want to get as much built as is humanly possible while the market continues."
John La Mura, the president and chief executive of the authority, underscored a "need to reflect carefully" on what comes next. "If commercial buildings in lower Manhattan are becoming residential," he said, "where do people recreate? If the residents who live here say, 'We enjoy this ratio of open space,' with each new apartment building, that ratio diminishes."
Although she does not always see eye-to-eye with the authority, Anne Compoccia, the chairwoman of Community Board 1 in lower Manhattan, agrees that things are advancing quickly at Battery Park City -- too quickly. "They should slow down and think about what they're doing," she said.
Of course, growth always induces growing pains, and Battery Park City is not immune. The loss of open space has meant the eviction of Cirque du Soleil, which pitched its tent for 10 years on the landfill. A six-year struggle has yet to be resolved between the authority and the unit owners in the Hudson View West condominium over the ground rent and payments in lieu of real estate taxes. And the expansion plans at the Holocaust memorial have been postponed for the moment by a dispute over financing between Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki.
There is also much tension between Mr. Gill and Mr. La Mura, both appointees of Mr. Pataki, although they insist it has not hampered significant decisions.
More substantively, the authority is torn between its fiduciary responsibility to get top dollar for development sites, its municipal responsibility to make Battery Park City a lively citywide attraction and its social responsibility to insure that neighborhoods are diverse and desirable.
A tug-of-war between the community and the authority over an "interim" ballfield, for example, was only partly resolved by the authority's assurance that the field will be made permanent. The question now is what happens to the development potential -- 870,000 square feet, roughly 870 apartments -- represented by the baseball diamonds, tennis and basketball courts. Mr. Gill said the total value of the land if fully developed would be $100 million. Were the authority to forgo that revenue, he said, it would amount to "the most expensive Little League field in the world." What the authority will do instead is shift most of the unused development rights -- perhaps 700,000 square feet -- to other parcels in the north neighborhood, which will yield larger buildings on those sites than were called for in the master plan.
"The more we develop," Mr. Gill said, "the more revenue we generate."
The authority estimates it will turn over $44 million to New York City this year, after operating expenses of $21 million and debt service of $65 million on $1 billion in bonds. Total revenues are $131 million, of which $119 million comes from ground rents and payments in lieu of real estate taxes. The authority owns the land and leases it to developers until the year 2069.
One-quarter of the operating budget goes to maintain the generously landscaped parkland, which is the prime attraction of Battery Park City to many New Yorkers -- and a lure for development. "I look at it as leveraged money," said Robert M. Serpico, the authority's chief financial officer. "You're spending money to make money."
Thirty percent of the space at Battery Park City was set aside for parks, plazas and esplanades under the 1979 master plan by the architects Alexander Cooper and Stanton Eckstut, during the chairmanship of Richard A. Kahan. The plan called for 14,000 housing units (4,550 have been built and 2,000 are in the pipeline) and 6 million square feet of commercial space, a goal that was met by the World Financial Center and exceeded with the construction two years ago of the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The original plan of 1969 envisioned a population of 50,000 -- two-thirds of them middle- and low-income families -- and employment for 35,000.
Today, some 40,000 people work in the World Financial Center, including the Mercantile Exchange and its Commodity Exchange division. About 8,000 people live in Battery Park City, but it is a far less diverse population than was envisioned. "We've got too many yuppies," Mr. Gill said. "I mean, we like yuppies. But enough already."
"I don't want Battery Park City to be an elitist community," he said. "I don't think that's healthy for any community."
To broaden the age mix, the authority has awarded a development site in the north neighborhood to Brookdale Living Communities of Chicago, a national builder of high-end, independent-living quarters for the elderly. Its 14-story, 220-unit building, the Hallmark, was designed by Lucien Lagrange and Schuman Lichtenstein Claman Efron. The $50 million project is to open next year.
Residents will have to be at least 62 years old. Fees are to run from $3,400 a month for a studio apartment to $8,500 for a two-bedroom unit with a den, which is to include daily breakfasts and 20 dinners, housekeeping and linen service, some utilities, a health clinic in the building and other features.
"With the amenities that Battery Park City has to offer as it gets built up, it's a great place to retire and grow old," said Mark J. Schulte, president and chief executive of Brookdale.
At the same time, the authority is encouraging more families with children to settle in Battery Park City through the construction of larger apartments.
"When we started to develop the north, we put an emphasis on family-sized apartments," said Enid K. Feist, vice president for policy and operations at the authority.
In Tribeca Bridge Tower, which the authority developed itself and now plans to sell, there are no studio apartments and only 21 one-bedroom units. But there are 128 two- and three-bedroom units. Depending on size and location, a three-bedroom apartment rents for $4,500 to $6,000 a month. The authority set aside 30 apartments for families who cannot afford those rents but earn too much to qualify for the "80-20" program. The architects were Costas Kondylis, John R. Menz & Richard Cook and Pasanella & Klein Stolzman & Berg.
At the base of the tower is Public School-Intermediate School 89, with room for 850 students, which opened in September. "If you live in our building, you can send your kid down the hall to school," Mr. Gill said. "If the kid is smart enough when he gets to high school level, he can go to Stuyvesant" -- right across Chambers Street.
Another step toward economic integration is "80-20" housing, in which 80 percent of the apartments are rented at market rates and 20 percent are subsidized and made available to those earning 50 percent or less of the median income for New York City. In return, developers obtain real-estate tax abatements and lower-interest financing through tax-exempt bonds.
Ms. Compoccia said that was far from a panacea. "I'm middle-class," she said. "For argument's sake, give me the opportunity to live in a place like that."
FOUR new buildings at Battery Park City are in the "80-20" program:
* River Watch, a 9-story building with 209 units, developed by the Brodsky Organization and designed by Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer Associates and Schuman Lichtenstein. Occupancy is expected in June.
* A 9-story building (yet to be named) with 208 units, developed by the DeMatteis Organization and designed by the same team as River Walk. Occupancy is expected late this year or early in 2000.
* Tribeca Park, a 27-story building with 395 units, developed by the Related Companies and designed by Robert A. M. Stern and Mr. Kondylis. It is to open in May.
* Tribeca Pointe, a 43-story tower with 340 units, by the Rockrose Development Corporation. Tenants have begun moving in.
Tribeca Pointe dramatically illustrates the impact of the "80-20" program. Two-bedroom apartments rent on the market for $3,285 to $4,760 a month. But a family of four with a total annual income between $19,090 and $25,100 could have qualified for a two-bedroom apartment at $525 a month.
"It's truly like winning the lottery," said Kevin P. Singleton, vice president and general manager of Rockrose Development. Chance does figure into it, since priority is determined by numbers assigned to the applications as they are randomly pulled from mail bags. There were more than 3,000 applicants for 70 apartments at Tribeca Pointe, said Sofia Estevez of Rockrose.
Last month, Rockrose was designated the developer of a site at 21 River Terrace in the north end. Designed by Gruzen Samton, the 27-story building will have 300 to 330 units. None will be subsidized. And Rockrose will pay the equivalent of full real-estate taxes.
A significant footnote at 21 River Terrace is that one of the bidders was Avalon Bay Communities, a real-estate investment trust based in Alexandria, Va.
"The most important thing that has changed recently is that national real estate companies are responding to the authority's R.F.P.'s," said Jon McMillan, vice president of the Landmark America development concern in Portland, Me., and former planning director at Battery Park City.
Other national companies arriving at Battery Park City include the Promus Hotel Corporation of Memphis, Tenn., which is allied with Forest City Ratner Companies in the construction of a $163 million, 14-story mixed-use project on Vesey Street, which is to be completed in 2000.
Bisected by a 140-foot-high, art-filled public atrium, the building will contain a 4,000-seat multiplex operated by Regal Cinemas of Knoxville, Tenn., which calls itself the largest motion picture exhibitor in the world; a 463-room Embassy Suites Hotel and a New York Sports Club. The architects are Perkins Eastman, with interiors designed by Alexandra Champalimaud.
The next hotel at Battery Park City, opening in 2001, is to be a 250-room Ritz-Carlton, which will occupy the lower floors of a 38-story tower planned by Millennium Partners on the southernmost parcel. The deluxe hotel chain, based in Atlanta, has not been in New York for two years.
The $175 million project includes a permanent, rent-free home for the Skyscraper Museum, which has wandered from space to space since its founding three years ago. On the 14th floor will be a restaurant with an outdoor terrace overlooking the harbor. Above that will be 150 condominiums. The architects are Gary Edward Handel & Associates and the Polshek Partnership.
In designing the tower, the architects attempted to move beyond the existing esthetic in the residential neighborhoods, where guidelines carefully specify traditional-looking brick and masonry buildings.
While the north side of the Ritz-Carlton Downtown will hew to that, the south and west facades will have a 35-story curtain wall of glass, representing a "more progressive esthetic," said Todd H. Schliemann, a partner in the Polshek firm.
"Lighthouse" was a word used both by Mr. Schliemann and by Scott P. Keller, a partner in Gruzen Samton, which designed Tribeca Pointe at the opposite end of Battery Park City, also with a broad expanse of glass in its upper floors.
"It's like a beacon for the whole of Battery Park City," Mr. Keller said. "As such, it should reflect not only the residential buildings but the office buildings."
With the two critical end sites accounted for, the authority is focusing on a huge parcel in the middle, Site 26, north of the World Financial Center. Officials estimate it could accommodate 1.4 million square feet of commercial development. It was in play last year as a possible site for the New York Stock Exchange.
World Financial Properties, the successor to Olympia & York, which owns and manages the World Financial Center, has proposed building a new home for the National Association of Securities Dealers and American Stock Exchange on Site 26.
Michael Jones, the chief administrative officer of the N.A.S.D., said last week that Battery Park City "certainly could be" a site but that no decision had been made yet.
"We'd love to see Nasdaq-Amex decide to stay downtown," said Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York. "And certainly one of the most attractive sites downtown is Battery Park City."
Daniel Rappaport, chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange, believes it might be especially fruitful if Nasdaq and Amex were only a block away.
"Having them as neighbors would lead us perhaps to becoming more involved in joint ventures." Mr. Rappaport said.
The exchange is one of the most surprising features of Battery Park City, in that nothing about its restrained, gray-flannel facade betrays the sheer pandemonium within, where two 25,000-square-foot trading floors seethe with hundreds of brokers and traders swarming around circular pits.
Clad in the eye-popping colors of a medieval pageant, shouting and gesturing wildly, they buy and sell futures and options in crude oil, heating oil, gasoline, natural gas, platinum, copper, silver and gold.
Mark Shearman, a natural gas trader, said he liked the extra room in the ring, better places to eat and a gym in the building. But the biggest change in his routine since the exchange moved from the World Trade Center is that he commutes by ferry. "It's a nice little ride across the river," he said, "and I'm right at the building."
MR. SHEARMAN is in good company. About 13,000 passengers a day use the small, floating ferry terminal. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is planning a permanent new one, doubling its capacity to four slips. The $24 million project is to open in 2001.
Crossing West Street to Battery Park City sometimes seems like more of a challenge than crossing the Hudson, especially for children, the elderly or disabled. There are three pedestrian bridges over the roadway but the elevators are not yet working at the bridge that joins the north end to TriBeCa. The authority is considering a fourth bridge, around Morris Street, Mr. La Mura said, as a link the burgeoning south neighborhood.
With the perspective of 20 years and 20-20 hindsight, Mr. Eckstut said one problem with the 1979 plan was the necessary assumption that the Westway highway would be built along the Hudson River, affecting the orientation of Battery Park City.
"The project essentially turns its back to the city," said Mr. Eckstut, now a principal in Ehrenkrantz, Eckstut & Kuhn. While he sees things in need of "tweaking" -- the listless retail space in the World Financial Center, the lack of meaningful waterfront activity -- Mr. Eckstut sounded generally satisfied with the plan as it evolved. "It really feels and looks like New York, which was our goal," Mr. Eckstut said. Where development has veered from the plan, he finds it is usually positive. For instance, he said, "There's a whole emerging cultural district that we never anticipated."
That district is anchored by the Museum of Jewish Heritage and Holocaust memorial, completed in 1997 to designs by Kevin Roche, with interiors by Patrick Gallagher.
The museum is planning a $44 million east wing, containing an auditorium, galleries and viewing rooms for the archives of Steven Spielberg's Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation. Mr. Roche and Mr. Gallagher would collaborate again.
New York museums are typically knit to the surrounding urban fabric but a visit to the Museum of Jewish Heritage helps dispel the sense of incongruity in its isolated location at Manhattan's tip.
After circling the windowless first-floor galleries on Jewish life a century ago, then the windowless second-floor galleries on the Holocaust, a visitor arrives at a hexagonal rotunda on the third floor, with a tall glass case enclosing a Torah scroll that was to have been exhibited in a museum of the "extinct Jewish race" in Prague.
Beyond that case is a row of windows. And out the windows are Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty.

Why Roll theDice?

BYLINE: By FRED BROCK; Fred Brock is an editor at The Times. His column on the approach to and arrival at retirement will appear the first Sunday of each month. E-mail may be sent to fbrock@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
AS the politicians and lobbyists in Washington strive to score political or ideological points in the Social Security debate, they should be aware that people like Edith Chvala are watching them. Like some economists, she questions the wisdom of staking Social Security funds on the stock market.
Ms. Chvala, 75, lives alone in a mobile home seven miles southeast of Silver City, N.M., on $703 a month -- $542 from Social Security and $161 from a pension. 
 She jokes about being poor, but is quick to point out that she is blessed with good health. Many older people are in worse financial shape, she says, often because they are faced with large prescription bills not covered by Medicare.
As she watches the struggle over Social Security, Ms. Chvala has come to at least one conclusion: She is not excited about proposals that would put a portion of the funds, now invested in Treasury securities, into the stock market -- whether it's President Clinton's plan for the Government to invest the money or the Republicans' notion of allowing individuals to invest part of their Social Security tax payments themselves.
"I'm not a gambler," she said. "It seems like they want to gamble with our retirement money."
If Ms. Chvala is cool to the ideas, so is L. Douglas Lee, chief economist at HSBC Securities in Washington. Unlike many of his Wall Street brethren, he has reservations about privatization, despite the billions of dollars it would pump into the stock market. And he is one of a number of economists who believes that low-ball economic projections and assumptions have led to erroneous conclusions that the Social Security system must be "saved" or "fixed."
Mr. Lee, who is 51, has nothing per se against investing retirement funds in the stock market. But he points out that the Social Security system is more than a retirement program, with features like benefits for the disabled or for dependent children after the death of their working parent. "I think the Government should fund the social welfare aspects of Social Security," he said.
Privatizing Social Security, he said, won't increase the overall resources of the economy, but merely shift them around. And it could drive up interest rates by decreasing the money available to the Treasury, forcing it to borrow more in the private sector.
Mr. Lee says the conventional wisdom that the current system faces bankruptcy is "a little silly."
"Economic forecasts are wrong a large part of the time," he said. "We have to be very careful about making major policy decisions based on projections, especially when other projections, which are very reasonable, show a very different outcome."
But he said that putting part of the budget surplus into Social Security, in effect reducing the Federal debt, as President Clinton has proposed, would build the nation's resources. That would likely bring economic growth, which would increase payments into the Social Security fund, he said. He thinks the Republican plan to cut taxes would only encourage consumption.
"The one thing we can point to over the last few years that has had a positive effect on savings has been to reduce the Federal deficit and move into surplus," he said. "This produces growth, and that's what's going to be needed in order to meet the promises that have been made to future retirees."
IN the end, decisions about Social Security will have direct effects on real lives of real people -- like Ms. Chvala.
A native of Germany, she came to the United States in 1930, when she was 7. She grew up in New York, living in Queens and then Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn.
She married in 1945 and followed her husband, a construction worker, around the Northeast. In 1970, they moved to Buffalo, where she worked as a nurse's aide for 20 years. That job was the source of her small pension. The couple divorced in 1973.
At the urging of a son, she moved to New Mexico in 1990, when she was 67. She used her savings to buy a mobile home and parked it rent-free on her son's property. The son later divorced and moved to Arizona, but his former wife allowed Ms. Chvala to stay.
Four times a week, Ms. Chvala drives her 1985 Chevy Blazer to Western New Mexico University in Silver City, where she swims and is a volunteer at the school's museum.
She thinks she might qualify for some sort of welfare, but would rather get by without it, as Social Security lets her do.
"I like my independence," she said. "I don't want to ever have to live with my children. I am so thankful for my health. My plan is to just drop dead" -- when the time comes. And she would rather that politicians keep their hands off Social Security in the meantime.

HEADLINE: Don't Give Public Land To Private Golf Course

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The sign pictured in your article on a golf course developer that wants to annex part of Liberty State Park speaks volumes, or at least more audibly and true than the comments in support of the idea: "Notice: Golfers Only Beyond This Point." 
 While the developer and his political allies want to convey that this is a "public" course that will somehow benefit children, African-Americans, and the local economy, I believe the only people who will benefit are the privileged few who can afford the fees, equipment, and time off required to get in 18 holes. Maybe there will be free rounds for kids and the economically underprivileged, and maybe the owners will continue to allow Fourth of July picnics on what will be the 17th and 18th holes. Then again, I think not.
The article attempts to minimize the issue by calling the land in question a "sliver" and "spit." If this is true, why can't the developer subdivide his current 16 holes?
In any case, land was set aside for Liberty State Park to be used by all people. Since when do we hand over any amount of public park land to a private developer? I voted for a ballot question in November, which was passed by a majority vote, providing for purchase by the state of open space to be saved from development. An excellent idea, I thought. But the golf proposal would be giving away land we already have.

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Saturn SC2;
Finding a Jackpot Behind Door No. 3

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
NECESSITY is the mother of invention, and for the Saturn Corporation of General Motors, a rather simple invention is generating a much-needed lift in sales of its aging car line.
Saturn's coupe, sedan and wagon, developed in the 1980's and introduced in 1990 -- with few significant changes since -- compete in an ice-cold part of the market. Small-car sales have dropped nearly 10 percent over two years -- Saturn's sales plunged 17 percent -- as buyers shifted to sport utilities, midsize sedans and more luxurious cars. A midsize Saturn, the L-Series, comes this summer, and another freshening of the small cars is due. Still, existing models will not be replaced until the 2003 model year. 
 Against that backdrop, Saturn executives and a group of dealers held a brainstorming session on what they could do to bolster sales while waiting for new products. One suggestion came from Stuart Lasser, who owns three Saturn franchises in New Jersey. His son Hal, then 8, had complained about how hard it was to climb into the rear seat of the two-door model. Mr. Lasser's idea: Why not add a third door?
About that time, minivans were arriving with four doors, and extra doors were being added to extended-cab pickups. At auto shows, design studies like the Pontiac Rageous and Mercury MC4 -- both of them ostensibly coupes -- had small back doors aimed at making them somewhat practical.
Within six weeks of Mr. Lasser's suggestion, Saturn had engineered a prototype of a three-door coupe. The model scored well in consumer clinics, and Saturn decided to put it into production. As of November, all Saturn coupes have been built with a small, rear-hinged door behind the driver's door.
A month later, Saturn reported a spurt in sales, its first year-to-year increase since April and one of the few positive notes in the small-car market. The gains continued in January, with coupe sales up 28 percent.
After a recent test-drive of a Saturn SC2, I was not surprised that the new coupe was doing so well. Even with the third door, which is nearly invisible when the doors are closed, the car has the sporty look that coupe buyers like. Yet the third door opens new markets: Most Saturn coupe owners are single, but the three-door may prove attractive to parents with small children, who like the look but need more practicality.
From the outside, one cannot immediately detect the third door. Last summer Saturn invited some journalists to a preview of future products. Unable to ascertain what was different about the coupe on display, reporters walked around it muttering "What's the big deal?" under their breath.
Then a Saturn executive opened the driver's door and popped open the small door behind it. The innovation was suddenly so obvious. "Why didn't anyone think of that before?" I blurted out -- a line that Saturn executives seized on to use in advertising.
On close inspection, the outline is evident, but doesn't detract from the car's swoopy look. The door has no handle, inside or out; it can be opened only by grasping a small lever exposed when the front door is opened. The latch is not particularly convenient for rear-seat passengers, but that small seat isn't suited for adults anyway.
The extra door -- its window is fixed in place -- is ideal for tossing in a gym bag, a briefcase or a couple sacks of groceries. It allows children to scurry in without having to tip the front seats forward, and it lets parents buckle in their charges without straining their backs. It is ideal for a driver with a wheelchair, who can swing the chair in behind the driver's seat after he or she is positioned at the wheel. With no center pillar, there are no obstacles for loading or unloading the wheelchair.
One suggestion, though: Saturn should consider lighting the area around the latch, which I fumbled for in the dark when assisting my children.
Because the third door is so useful, one may wonder why Saturn didn't add another to the other side. The main reason is the expense, in a market segment highly sensitive to price, but Saturn officials say that consumers who want four doors will buy four-door models -- that is, sedans.
Despite adding the third door, Saturn has lowered prices slightly for 1999. The SC1 now starts at $12,885; the SC2, with a bigger engine and nicer trim, opens at $15,445.
Because adding the door meant eliminating the center pillar, the driver's shoulder belt was moved from the pillar to the side of the seat. That works fine as long as the belt remains in the loop that serves as its guide. But on my test drive, the belt popped out often and pressed against my throat.
Beyond the third door, little has changed on the plastic-bodied, front-drive, four-passenger coupe. Despite continual efforts to muffle the engine, including yet another try this year, the Saturn remains noisy, especially compared with competitors like the Toyota Corolla. "This car is loud," a 10-year-old passenger -- my daughter -- observed. And aside from the engine roar, at 8 miles an hour an aggravating groan came from underneath. After hearing this on two test cars, I asked Saturn officials if there was a problem. They assured me that the abnormal noise was normal, a routine function involving the anti-lock brakes.
The SC1 base model continues to be powered by a single-overhead-cam four-cylinder engine. Displacing 1.9 liters, it is rated at 100 horsepower. The more expensive SC2 comes with a dual-overhead-cam engine that produces 124 horsepower. A five-speed manual transmission is standard; a four-speed automatic is optional.
Saturn was among the first small-car makers to offer traction control, which helps to keep wheels from spinning on slippery surfaces, and it is still one of the few with this feature. (It is included with anti-lock brakes.) Having just come through one of Michigan's snowiest Januarys on record, I greatly appreciated the traction control, which turned the coupe into a sport utility on my unplowed street.
Saturn's hallmarks are economy and reliability rather than quiet, comfort and performance. The handling is nothing special, and acceleration is only adequate.
But dealers do, generally speaking, coddle their customers, who get royal treatment on par with that accorded Lexus owners (who spend far more). Plus, Saturn stores offer something one can't find anywhere else: a two-door car that has three doors.
 
INSIDE TRACK: It's the same old car, but now it has a grand opening.

In Euroland, Deal Makers Shun the Partner Next Door

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland

 BODY:
WHEN Europe's single currency hit the markets just over a month ago, one of the prophecies was that it would lead to a wave of mergers across the Continent's suddenly invisible financial frontiers. Those deals may yet be brewing. But with merger frenzy in the corporate air, they haven't happened quite so rapidly as forecast.
Last week's announcement of plans for a $17 billion takeover of Paribas by Societe Generale, for example, reflected a belated French move to pursue the sort of consolidation of banking and financial services already familiar in Switzerland and some other countries in Europe. But, like a notable nonbank merger announced last month, the acquisition of Marconi Electronics by British Aerospace, it is a move within national borders. 
 Certainly, the pace of mergers and the pressure to make them have accelerated in the 11-nation euro zone since it began phasing in the new currency. But European deal makers have continued to plow familiar furrows.
The announced takeover of Britain's Guardian Royal Exchange by the giant French insurer AXA brings together one company inside the euro zone and one outside it. (Britain is not a member of the currency union.) The pharmaceutical merger that will create the giant AstraZeneca combines companies in two non-euro nations, Sweden and Britain.
Meanwhile, other big deals, like the planned acquisition of Volvo A.B.'s car division by the Ford Motor Company, the DaimlerChrysler merger and Deutsche Bank's deal to acquire Bankers Trust, have crossed the Atlantic.
Many people argue that the logic of a euro zone -- a huge single market of 290 million people, underpinned by a common currency and free of the risks of currency exchanges -- will inevitably press companies to fuse across its internal frontiers for economies of scale, market dominance and cost savings. Some saw the start of that process with the announcement in December of a partial merger deal between two pharmaceutical giants, Hoechst of Germany and Rhone-Poulenc of France.
But one view among corporate leaders who spoke and mingled at the World Economic Forum here, a gathering of the business and policy-shaping elite, is that cross-border mergers within the euro zone face an array of obstacles.
The barriers are rooted not just in national sentiment but also in the politics of unemployment, the slow pace of deregulation in some industries, the hesitancy of some companies to move toward public ownership and, not least, the tough competition rules of the European Union itself.
Consider the view of Gerard Mestrallet, head of the huge French-Belgian corporation Suez-Lyonnaise des Eaux, the fruit of a merger of three companies to create a combine of energy, water supply, waste services and communications businesses.
"Equity nationalism," Mr. Mestrallet said, makes institutional investors in continental Europe wary of the stock of companies in one another's nations, impeding cross-border deals. "We are going to have to find greater acceptance by institutions of the paper of other countries," he said.
ACCORDING to Paul Gibbs, a merger and acquisition analyst at J. P. Morgan in London, cross-border mergers among the 11 euro nations totaled $73 billion last year as the debut of the euro approached, versus $21 billion in 1996. But, significantly, that figure was still less than one-tenth of the record $842 billion of all merger activity involving European businesses last year.
Many forces are at play. A large number of the small- to medium-sized companies that power the German economy are only now preparing themselves for the capital markets after decades of private ownership and bank financing, said Wilhelm Haarmann, a German acquisitions lawyer here. And longstanding efforts to create a pan-European military industry are thwarted because of political sensitivities toward industries like military equipment and aerospace that retain strong government ties, particularly in France.
Regulation is strict, too, within the euro zone. The European Commission, said Fields Wicker-Miurin, an investment banker at A. Kearney Ltd. in London, "has a great deal to say about which deals are acceptable and which are not."
In a continent where unemployment is more than 10 percent, and much higher among young people, any big cross-border merger would immediately raise political hackles over the single issue of downsizing.
"When you lay off people there is a lot of fear, and the unemployment issue is a public issue, especially in Europe," said Daniel Vasella, president of Novartis, the Swiss drug company.
But without the efficiencies that are supposed to wring profitability from the merged companies, jobs are likely to be destroyed eventually anyway, a point that is sometimes lost on the populist strain of merger opponents.
"Only a profitable company can be a social company and create jobs," said Jurgen E. Schrempp, co-chairman of DaimlerChrysler.
Still, corporate bosses see growth in the populists' following.
Rolf-Ernst Breuer, the head of Deutsche Bank, complained in Davos that public sentiment may be swinging against megamergers. The media, he said, have taken to depicting corporate leaders like him as megalomaniacs. And politicians, he said, complain: " 'Look what these managers do: They buy and sell companies like used cars.' "
So, Mr. Breuer warned, "I think we have to be aware that the climate will change rather soon."
Whether such concerns will blunt corporate appetites is another matter. "We have a strategy, and the strategy has not come to an end with Bankers Trust," Mr. Breuer said. "We have to be ready to grab opportunities that offer themselves."

Who'll Fill Two Spaces At Big Mall?

BYLINE: By MARCIA BIEDERMAN 

 BODY:
When it opened in November 1996, Atlantic Center, the enclosed mall at the corner of Flatbush and Atlantic Avenues, was considered by some to be a beacon to retailers reluctant to venture into parts of the city outside Manhattan. Now, however, with the impending departure of two large stores, a big chunk of the mall is scheduled to go dark, and it remains to be seen whether other retailers will keep the flame going.
Caldor Corporation, a discount chain based in Norwalk, Conn., which announced plans to liquidate two weeks ago, will close its 130,000-square-foot store at the mall in May, said Joyce Baumgarten, a spokeswoman for Forest City Ratner, owner of the mall. Last Wednesday Kohl's Corporation reached an agreement to buy 32 Caldor locations in the New York region but none in the city itself, said Gary Vasques, a spokesman for Kohl's. 
 Even before the Caldor news, going-out-of-business signs were up at the mall's 44,000-square-foot Sports Authority, part of a chain based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., which has closed a number of stores. Calls to the company were not returned.
Together, the two retailers occupy about 40 percent of the three-story structure. Other major tenants are Old Navy, Office Max and Pathmark.
The developer is "talking to a lot of people" about filling the spaces, Ms. Baumgarten said. Overall, Atlantic Center is "doing well," she said. She would not provide sales figures.
But an author of a new study of retailing in low-income urban areas said there were only a few retailers likely to take over the space. "There aren't a lot of Caldors out there," said Carl E. Steidtmann, director of the retail industry group at Pricewaterhouse Coopers, the accounting firm. Atlantic Center needs to find tenants quickly, he said, because "dark space doesn't send a very good message to the consumer."
The study, conducted by Pricewaterhouse Coopers and the Initiative for a Competitive Inner City, a nonprofit group, found that in a nation saturated with suburban stores, economically disadvantaged urban areas can offer retailers significant untapped profits. Yet, Dr. Steidtmann said, many chains considered such areas unattractive. "Retailers want to open stores where they have opened stores before," he said.
Both he and Murray Forseter, the editor of Chain Store Age, a trade publication, named Kmart as a likely candidate to take Caldor's place at Atlantic Center. But Stephen Pagnani, a spokesman for the discount chain, based in Troy, Mich., said, "We have nothing on our agenda currently for New York, period."
Dr. Steidtmann mentioned Target, a chain operated by the Dayton Hudson Corporation of Minneapolis, as another possible Caldor replacement, but Mr. Forseter disagreed.
Joe Enos, a spokesman for the Old Navy division of Gap Inc., in San Francisco, said Old Navy was "pleased with the traffic at Atlantic Center." And the Pathmark "has exceeded expectations," said Rich Savner, a spokesman for Pathmark Stores Inc. of Carteret, N.J. Neither would provide details. MARCIA BIEDERMAN

Why Couldn't Anyone Keep Brazil From Burning?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland

 BODY:
WHEN Russia's troubles seemed about to send Wall Street and the world over a cliff last fall, President Clinton announced a new strategy in the war against economic contagion.
No longer would the International Monetary Fund and Washington wait for countries to get into deep trouble before coming to their aid. Instead, they would act ahead of disaster, stepping in with precautionary loans for fundamentally healthy economies. Brazil would provide the first test of the new strategy. 
 It all sounded extremely sensible. President Clinton's aides compared the strategy to a grand immunization program. Others conjured up images of alert firefighters spraying water on the roof of an intact house in a burning neighborhood.
Scarcely three months later, the I.M.F.'s $42 billion preventive package for Brazil -- including a $5 billion commitment from the Treasury -- looks like another failed effort to stop the global economic crisis. Why did the $42 billion defensive line crumble so fast? And, assuming Brazil is not the last domino to fall, what do the events there portend for the coming year?
"The Brazilian experience raises as a question whether it is feasible for the I.M.F. to act in a preventative mode," said Jeffrey R. Shafer, the former Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs and an architect of the 1995 Mexico bailout. "Perhaps all they can be is an ambulance corps."
At the heart of the failure was a bet that turned bad. Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and his deputy, Lawrence H. Summers, signed on to the deal because they were relatively confident that the Government of Fernando Henrique Cardoso had the clout to execute the economic changes it promised in return for the aid. "These are all probabilistic decisions," Mr. Rubin said recently. "You make the best decisions you can based on the information you have at the time. You can't judge these things by how they turned out, post facto."
In short, Mr. Rubin places his bets the way he did during a 26-year career on Wall Street, with the understanding that a certain percentage will go bad.
But Washington operates on different rules, and already there is sniping on Capitol Hill that Mr. Rubin placed too much confidence in Mr. Cardoso, much as the Treasury bet too readily last summer that President Boris N. Yeltsin would execute economic changes in Russia.
Both bets went wrong for essentially the same reason. Mr. Rubin and Mr. Summers negotiated with their counterparts, but the Russian Duma, and then the Brazilian Congress, failed to deliver. The budget cuts and other austerity measures were just too hard for politicians to swallow. It was the classic clash between the demands of the markets and the demands of populist politics.
Needless to say, the workings of the Brazilian Congress and the Russian Duma are as different as the February weather in Brasilia and Moscow. But no doubt it was the experience of being seared in both legislatures that led Mr. Rubin, in a speech to the World Economic Forum here, to say that when it comes to saving nations from economic implosion, "I have come to believe that the ultimate key is not economics or finance, but politics -- the art of developing support for strong policy, especially for the hard decisions that involve present sacrifice for future benefit."
THE problem with precautionary programs like the one the Treasury and the I.M.F. tried in Brazil is that they can relieve the pressure on politicians to make those hard decisions.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Rubin hoped that the announcement of the huge package would give Mr. Cardoso the breathing room to bring a reluctant and famously free-spending Congress into line. It had the opposite effect. With the $42 billion package in place, Congress concluded that the economy was insulated from disaster, even if it dragged its feet on unpopular votes.
"In retrospect, we took the heat off the Brazilians just when they needed to get energized," one senior Administration official said recently. The only benefit, others in the Administration say, is that the meltdown was postponed until January -- when it did less damage to the rest of the world than it might have in October.
The Brazil experience, though, is worth remembering when judging some of the other ideas floating around about how to stabilize the world financial system. One is to "prequalify" countries for aid in the event of a crisis. The country in question would demonstrate to the I.M.F. that it practiced safe economics -- no wild spending, a minimum of crony capitalism and corruption, real oversight of its banking system. In return, the I.M.F. would promise to come to its aid if the markets ever staged a run on the country.
What would happen, though, if the country fell off the wagon? Announcing that its government no longer qualified for protection would be the equivalent of throwing the nation to the sharks. Even without such a declaration, investors would sniff any failure to act, and race for the exits. Just ask Mr. Cardoso, who will now spend the rest of the year trying to rebuild the confidence he lost by waiting too long.

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: Mark L. Yockey;
Artisan International Fund

BYLINE: By WILLIAM R. LONG 

 BODY:
THE financial crisis in Asia and Latin America has been a good reason for Mark L. Yockey, manager of the Artisan International fund, to favor European stocks. But it is not the only one. He follows a bottom-up approach to picking stocks, looking for focused, fast-growing companies run by progressive managers -- and he is finding more and more of them in Europe.
"In Europe, you've had a sea change in the last five years in the quality of the management," he said. "A whole new wave of management came in, and they really were more focused on profitability." 
 Harnessing that kind of management awareness for his fund has helped Mr. Yockey earn an average annualized return of 21.4 percent from Artisan International's inception in December 1995 though January of this year, versus just 8.3 percent for the average foreign stock fund, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher.
Lanky, with salt-and-pepper hair, Mr. Yockey, 42, works in a 29th floor office in San Francisco with three analysts. The four travel the world, sizing up companies that have caught their interest.
One of their rules of thumb is that a company's forward price-to-earnings ratio should be no greater than its three-year forward earnings growth rate, a variation of the common price-earnings-growth, or P.E.G., ratio, which compares a stock's p/e with its one-year earnings growth rate. Mr. Yockey looks for big profit margins and cash flows, but also for management that zeroes in on its best business. "We love focused managements," he said. "If you try to do one thing, you can probably do it pretty well. But you try to do six different things, and you know what? It just doesn't work."
Not that his tenure has been without bumps. In 1997, 13 percent of the fund's assets were in Latin America and 8 percent in Hong Kong. Downturns in those markets resulted in a return of just 3.5 percent that year versus an average of 5.1 percent for its peers.
Deregulation is another theme, especially in telecommunications -- and not just for European companies. Metronet Communications of Calgary, Alberta, is taking advantage of deregulation to provide voice and data services to business customers. It is the fund's biggest holding, at 4.5 percent of assets.
The chief executive of the company is Craig Young, who headed Brooks Fiber Properties, a local telecommunications services company bought by MCI Worldcom last year. "He successfully built one company and sold it," Mr. Yockey said.
Metronet is building broad-band fiber optic networks for high-speed communications in major Canadian cities. Mr. Yockey expects company sales to grow from $200 million this year to $500 million or $600 million in 2001, in Canadian dollars. "We think in 2001 they'll become profitable," he said, versus the losses he expects them to post for both 1999 and 2000 due to capital expenditures.
Artisan International first bought class B shares of Metronet at the initial public offering price of $16.23 (United States) in December 1997. The shares closed on Friday at $38.50. Mr. Yockey's target price for January 2000 is $60.
The hot product of another pick, Finland's Nokia, is the little wireless phone that also keeps an electronic list of names and numbers and receives E-mail messages. "Nokia is driving the cellular phone business on a global basis," Mr. Yockey said.
He first invested in Nokia in the fall of 1997, at the outset of the Asian financial crisis, when the price of A.D.R.'s was down to $37, from about $50. "The stock had been creamed because people were saying that the sales in Asia were going to be poor," he recalled.
But the company's earnings grew by more than 60 percent in 1998, and the A.D.R.'s have shot up to $130.375; his target in 12 months is $175. He estimates Nokia's average annual earnings growth at 30 percent, and its 1999 price-earnings multiple is 28.
Nokia management has done a brilliant job, Mr. Yockey said: "Ten years ago they were a little company up in Finland that nobody had ever heard of, and today they are one of the global leaders in the cellular communications market."
Health care companies are another favorite. He invested in Roche Holding A.G., the Swiss drug giant, in October at about 16,000 Swiss francs and has a target price of 22,000 francs for January 2000. It closed on Friday at 18,250 francs.
Mr. Yockey calculates Roche's three-year earnings growth rate at 23 percent, below its 1999 price-earnings multiple of 26. He said he made an exception to his usual stock-selection rules because Roche was "one of the best companies in the world" and because he expected a big acquisition soon, which would bolster its earnings. He said he was upbeat about new Roche drugs, including Xenical, for obesity; GS4104 for influenza, and several for cancer.

HEADLINE: PERSONAL BUSINESS;
Electronic Middleman for Mortgages

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
NEVER before had William Ikley enjoyed much leverage when applying for a loan, especially a mortgage.
But this time, Mr. Ikley, 36, a butcher who lives in Eldersburg, Md., had a firm deal just one business day after logging on to the Priceline.com Web site. And he, not a lender, was in charge. "It's been a real easy experience," he said. "There wasn't any pressure, doing it from home." 
 In fact, he applied while in his pajamas. And he expects to have a check in hand tomorrow, 10 days after initiating the name-your-price mortgage.
Priceline.com made its name by letting consumers offer bids on airline tickets -- then hotels and, in New York City, cars. The vendors can then accept or reject the offers. Now the company has extended this method for more complex transactions: mortgages.
The new program might not be such a smooth process for everyone. Mr. Ikley needed only a small second mortgage, a $5,000, five-year home equity loan. He was knowledgeable enough to do without the guidance provided by mortgage brokers, who stand to lose business to this potentially less expensive electronic middleman. And as Mr. Ikley learned, Priceline's lenders are not exactly giving money away. He will be paying 8.17 percent rather than the 6.9 percent he had optimistically proposed.
Still, his transaction represents another stage in the evolution of what Priceline calls buyer-driven commerce, which harnesses the Internet's speed and vast scope.
The Tower Group, a consulting firm in Needham, Mass., estimates that by 2001, 10 percent of first mortgages in a $1 trillion-a-year market will involve the Internet. Many Web sites and institutions already match borrowers and lenders, but Priceline's is the first program that lets the consumer initiate the terms.
"We put the customer more in control," said Richard S. Braddock, a former senior executive at Citicorp who is now chairman of Priceline.
THE mortgage process, conducted in partnership with Lendingtree, an on-line loan originator, is fairly straightforward. A loan seeker can apply to finance a particular house, condominium or co-op or to qualify before choosing a property. The borrower visits www.priceline.com and specifies a type of financing (like 15- or 30-year, fixed rate or adjustable), an interest rate, points and a desired closing date. A monthly payment may also be proposed.
The applicant also supplies income and other information that a lender can use to evaluate creditworthiness. A $200 deposit is charged to a credit card. Any response from among Lendingtree's 15 lenders, including the Dime Savings Bank of New York, Greenpoint Financial and the Money Store, must arrive within two business days.
If a lender accepts, the deal is struck and the deposit is applied to the usual fees, like the appraisal. Or the lenders can submit counteroffers. If the borrower rejects them, the application dies and the $200 charge is erased. The charge is not refunded if the customer walks away from an accepted bid.
Unlike Priceline's other businesses, its mortgage service relies on applicants who have already done enough homework to know what they want and what terms they can reasonably expect.
At Priceline.com, borrowers cannot browse through an array of rates and terms without risking a commitment. "It doesn't really allow for shopping," said James P. Punishill, an analyst at Forrester Research of Cambridge, Mass.
Other on-line services -- Web sites of individual lenders or the dozens of so-called aggregators like E-Loan or Quicken or Lendingtree itself -- do allow borrowers to survey the financial landscape.
Armed with information, though, Priceline customers will gain great flexibility, according to Theodore Iacobuzio of the Tower Group. They will probably save money, too, unless they can strike a deal with, for example, a local bank that throws in a free checking account or other services.
Brokers, for their part, are taking this new mortgage-market refinement in stride, said A. W. Pickel 3d of Lenexa, Kan., co-chairman of the technology panel of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers.
"There's definitely a place for it," he said, but he contended that he and his colleagues, many of whom have Web sites of their own, would not suffer much, because consumers need the hand-holding that brokers provide.
Priceline is not as free of added costs as borrowers might think, Mr. Pickel said, because lenders must add to their rates or points the fees they pay to Priceline but which the service does not disclose. Mortgage brokers collect fees in similar ways.
Though Mr. Iacobuzio thinks the on-line mortgage business has "a very big future," he said it would be many years before paperwork disappears and transactions can be conducted electronically end to end.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS;
For New Orleans, Mardi Gras Is Becoming an All-Year Cash Cow

BYLINE: By ROY FURCHGOTT 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS

 BODY:
THE calendar says Mardi Gras season lasts seven weeks this year, from King's Day (Jan. 6) to the climactic Fat Tuesday (Feb. 16).
But for the industry behind "laissez les bon temps rouler," Mardi Gras has become a rapidly growing year-round business with global exports. 
 "Economically, it is by far the single-largest special event," says Marc Morial, the Mayor of New Orleans. "It's bigger than Jazz Fest, it's bigger than the Sugar Bowl, it's bigger than the Super Bowl." An annual study by James J. McLain, an economics professor at the University of New Orleans, shows that Mardi Gras spending in the New Orleans area alone has more than tripled in 12 years, to $840 million in 1998 from $240 million in 1986.
To see that growth in tangible form, look no further than the bead- and trinket-strewn racks of Accent Attic, which takes in more than $6 million a year by supplying members of krewes -- the clubs that sponsor and ride on Mardi Gras parade floats -- with the so-called throws they shower on revelers.
"Mardi Gras is over 100 years old, but it has made tremendous growth in the last 15 years," said Accent Attic's owner, Dom Corlone, a former jewelry salesman who went into the Mardi Gras business in 1980. "Fashion jewelry was difficult because if you didn't sell it right away, it was out of style. Mardi Gras, what you buy won't go stale. It looked like a safe business to go into."
But growth has also attracted competitors who underpriced some of Mr. Corlone's products, so lately he has emphasized catering to the krewes' desire for exclusive trinkets. On his annual buying trip to Asia, Mr. Corlone designed a special necklace for Le Krewe d'Etat, which he has since kept under wraps lest other krewes rush to competitors for copies. The secret: "For the night parade, glow-in-the-dark beads," he said, and a battery-powered flashing-eye medallion.
In the 11 Accent Attic stores, bead prices range from less than 2 cents a strand for 18 inches of plastic beads to $1.16 for an 8-foot-long string of fake pearls. There are also bracelets, hair ties, surgical scrubs, hats, banners, stuffed toys, women's underwear and all manner of beverage containers in the official Mardi Gras colors of purple, green and gold.
According to Dr. McLain's report, the average krewe member will toss $540 of this stuff to the crowd, and it's not uncommon for a float rider to go through $1,000 worth or more. In all, Dr. McLain estimates that more than $9.1 million in throws were tossed last year.
THROWS are a visible but small part of the industry that has grown up around the 60 separate Mardi Gras parades in New Orleans each year. There is bigger money in building parade floats, a market dominated by three specialist companies. The largest is Kern Studio, parent of several family-run concerns, which gets $20 million in annual revenue from outfitting 33 of the parades, according to Barry Kern, the company's president. Mr. Kern and his siblings, Brian, Blaine Jr., Blainey and Thais, run the 52-year-old company with their father, Blaine Sr., the founder.
Kern maintains more than 300 floats and thousands of ornamental props, which are often recycled: This year, a giant bust of John Wayne was altered to become Freddy Kruger's scarred visage. The company is now building its largest float, the 240-foot-long "S.S. Endymion," with a million feet of optical-fiber lighting effects powered by a generator "which we believe could light up a minor league baseball park," said Ed Muniz, captain of the Endymion krewe. Dues from Endymion's roughly 2,000 members underwrite the $2 million cost.
Once a seasonal business, Kern is now busy year-round, and not just because it is already designing floats for 2000 before the 1999 models have rolled. The company runs tours of its float factory and rents its warehouses for parties. Mr. Kern said the company's facilities, known as Mardi Gras World, are host to about 125 parties a year averaging 650 guests each. "It's a cash cow," he said.
But it is still not the whole cow. Kern gets 20 to 30 percent of its revenue by using its Mardi Gras skills in other businesses, like building facades, decorations and rides for theme parks and running parades in places from Philadelphia to France to Japan.
Demand for Mardi Gras products is increasing outside of New Orleans as seasonal celebrations grow in cities like Galveston, Tex., and Shreveport, La., and in Mobile, Ala., where a parading tradition predates that of New Orleans. Accent Attic makes 15 percent of its sales out of state, from Italy to Guam and even the Asian countries where the beads are made. "We ship it right back to Hong Kong, because you can't find it there," Mr. Corlone said.
Other businesses get in on les bon temps, too. Bakeries across Louisiana add extra shifts to crank out a Mardi Gras tradition, king cakes -- brioche dough circles filled with spice, fruit or cheese and dusted with green, yellow and purple sugar with a small plastic baby doll baked inside. The cake is served at the beginning of the season -- the feast of the Epiphany; whoever is served the slice with the doll buys the next year's cake.
Gambino's, one of the larger bakers, has a separate plant that cranks up in late December to turn out up to 5,000 king cakes a day, about half shipped to out-of-town customers in a $25 to $50 Mardi Gras kit with paraphernalia like beads, cups and a CD of suitable music. Two weeks before Mardi Gras, one day's orders from Gambino's included shipments to Britain, Norway, Spain Switzerland, Belgium, Japan, Taiwan and Venezuela.
The Mardi Gras bonanza even reaches neighborhood concerns. Small hardware stores do a brisk business in a peculiar product: folding wooden ladders with a seat attached and wheels on two of the legs. Children sit on top to watch the parades, and afterward the ladder is collapsed and used as a rolling carrier for ice chests, sleepy kids and Mardi Gras booty. Philip Deutch, owner of four Ace Hardware stores, said the contraptions bolster what are otherwise the slowest months for hardware retailing: Mardi Gras season accounts for more than half the ladders his stores sell.
The ladder-seats typically cost about $60, but ladder shoppers also commonly buy spray paint, staple guns and glue guns to decorate the ladders. The city's famous termites help assure that customers come back year after year.
Though the city goes to some lengths to stave off direct commercial tie-ins with parades, commercialism occasionally creeps in anyway, especially in the suburbs. The Popeye's restaurant chain gives krewes "doubloons" to throw that can be redeemed for a discount on a chicken dinner. A local potato chip company, Zapp's, makes Mardi Gras-colored bags of chips for use as throws. And Anheuser Busch has sent the Budweiser Clydesdales every year since 1964.
But there will be no Nike or Nokia Mardi Gras. "We are opposed to commercial involvement in the parading events," Mayor Morial said. "It doesn't need to be changed. Why overanalyze something that is so successful?"

The Profit Picture: A Rosy Tinge for '99

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

 BODY:
NOW that fourth-quarter earnings are mostly in the books, it is clear that the worst fears about last summer's emerging-markets panic did not pan out. Indeed, it suddenly seems that many naysaying forecasters are painting a far brighter earnings landscape for 1999.
At Merrill Lynch, economists recently raised their forecast for earnings growth of the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to 3.5 percent in 1999, up from a previous prediction, in mid-December, of a 5 percent drop. That's an 8.5-percentage point swing in less than two months. 
 The change resulted from "continued strength in the economy and less pressure on profit margins, which is the result of continued restructuring," said Gerald D. Cohen, a senior economist at Merrill Lynch.
Merrill is far from alone in its optimism. "I'm very bullish on corporate earnings," said Byron Wien, United States strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "The economy has a lot of momentum, and I'm optimistic earnings are going to exceed expectations."
Among strategists, the average estimate for that growth is 4.1 percent for companies in the S.& P. 500, versus two-tenths of 1 percent in 1998. according to I.B.E.S. International, a research firm. And among the industries in the index, the engines are likely to be technology, health care and perhaps energy -- a huge 1998 loser that most analysts see stabilizing in 1999.
That is good news for investors, especially with the stock market at record levels and valuations. In the absence of lower interest rates, better profits are probably the best catalyst for more market gains.
Indeed, some strategists suggest that the factors that dampened earnings in last year's third quarter -- the first time in seven years that profits declined for American corporations -- have proved extremely short-lived. Edward Kerschner, a Paine Webber strategist who expects profit growth of 5 to 8 percent in 1999, contends that the poor third quarter resulted from several coincidental factors, including the market plunge in August, the General Motors strike and a steep drop in oil earnings.
Yes, emerging markets still gyrate. But in the case of G.M., the company has already stunned industry analysts by suggesting last month that its earnings could top $10 a share in 1999 if the company meets aggressive financial and production targets. And many analysts do not think oil prices can fall much below their current $12 level.
Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts, who estimate profits for individual companies and tend to be far more optimistic than the strategists, are forecasting aggregate profit growth of 17.2 percent for the companies in the S.& P. 500, versus the strategists' estimate of 4.1 percent, according to I.B.E.S. The gap between the two groups' forecasts is generally far less.
But analysts are already starting to scale back their estimates, as has often been the case in the past. The analysts tracked by I.B.E.S. lowered their first-quarter profit-growth forecasts for S.& P. 500 companies to 4.4 percent as of Jan. 28, down from 5.5 percent a week earlier. Even given the customary volatility of such forecasts, the change represented a surprisingly large reduction in such a short time, said Joseph Abbott, an equity strategist at I.B.E.S.
WHY are analysts optimistic?
In technology, they see continuing strong sales of personal computers, software and semiconductors -- and they know that slack overseas demand in 1998 could make this year's numbers look that much better. I.B.E.S. estimates are for white-hot earnings growth of 35.6 percent for the industry.
Health care is getting help from continued good results at pharmaceutical companies, which have been coming up with an array of new drugs. I.B.E.S. expects 15.9 percent earnings growth for the year.
One big turnaround sector is likely to be financial companies, with expected earnings growth of 17.7 percent -- although the gain would be from last year's disappointing numbers, which were dragged down by third-quarter disasters in emerging markets and hedge funds.
While oil prices could fall again, further depressing energy stocks, some analysts think the industry may have bottomed. Mr. Kerschner calculates that if earnings in the industry had been flat in the fourth quarter, instead of declining over 63 percent as analysts estimate they did, total domestic corporate profit growth would have been about twice as high for the period.
Still, strategists predict that several sectors could be disappointments this year, particularly two that can suffer in periods of slow growth: basic materials and commodity companies and capital equipment suppliers like the Case Corporation, Deere & Company and Caterpillar Inc. "That's where the real vulnerability is," said Chuck Hill, director of research at First Call in Boston.

As companies finish reporting their 1998 results, market watchers say earnings growth for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, despite beating expectations, is proving tepid. But their expectations for 1999 are bright in almost every industry. Chart lists selected earnings expectation for 1998 and 1999. Note. Analysts' estimates assume that the S.& P. 500 includes the same stocks in each year; strategists' estimates reflect changes in the composition of the index. (Source: I.B.E.S. International)

An Investor Who Shops for Spunk

BYLINE: By GEANNE ROSENBERG 

 BODY:
AS investment pundits warn about an Internet bubble and Bill Gates of Microsoft wonders where the mania for Internet stocks will end, Michael S. Egan is quietly keeping his chips on the virtual table.
Mr. Egan, 58, knows something about building companies. He made a fortune by turning around the Alamo rental-car company and selling it to Republic Industries in 1997 for $625 million, with his stake worth about $587 million. Then he started an investment company, Dancing Bear Investments, and looked for promising businesses. 
 About that time, he was becoming infatuated with cyberspace. "I started doing a lot of business electronically with the airline reservation systems and the Internet," he said in an interview. "It was quite apparent that it was going to be the major economic revolution of the world since maybe the printing press or currency."
But Mr. Egan wasn't about to invest in a company just because it had dot-com in its name. He was looking for a startup nobody else had heard of and true grit in the people in charge. "They had to have a high, high work ethic," he said. "They had to be able to suffer a blow."
Mr. Egan, an alumnus of Cornell University, mentioned to the university's president one day that he was looking for a "media play on the Net." Perhaps, he was told, he should check out a company called Theglobe.com that a couple of recent graduates, Todd Krizelman and Stephan Paternot, had started while still in college.
Theglobe.com calls itself an Internet "community" that offers its users entertainment, information and shopping opportunities. Mr. Egan liked the concept and flew to Ithaca, N.Y., to have lunch with the two men. After five hours, he made it clear he wanted to buy into their venture.
In February 1997, he dispatched Edward Cespedes, a Dancing Bear executive, for follow-up talks. "Ed was told that he couldn't leave the office until the negotiation was done," said Mr. Krizelman, now 25, one year older than his partner. "He lived on our couches in the office and shared meal after meal of Chinese food with us." Six months later, Mr. Egan paid $20 million for a 51 percent stake in the company.
The payoff came last Nov. 13. In its first day of trading, the stock of Theglobe.com rocketed 606 percent, from $9 to $63.50, the biggest first-day run-up of any initial public offering. "It was an adrenaline day if there ever was one," Mr. Egan said. His stake of roughly six million shares is now worth $382 million.
Mr. Egan has made other smart investments, most notably a controlling stake in Nantucket Nectars, a Massachusetts juice maker, that he sold last year to Ocean Spray for an undisclosed profit. Even for this low-tech venture, his enthusiasm was boundless. Tom First, one of the founders, recalled a conversation on a private jet: "He starts talking about how the company would be a $200 million company within five years while I'm concerned that on our one van in Boston the shocks were blown out."
Mr. Egan has used some of his wealth to lead the life of a country squire, building a $12 million mansion in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., for temporary shelter while he renovated his main spread nearby, and assembling a Nantucket vacation compound of 15 houses, a dining hall, a movie house and a baseball diamond for a family that includes five children and three grandchildren.
But his fears after selling Alamo -- that he would "dry up and blow away" -- proved groundless. As he looked for investment leads, he says, he heeded a lesson he learned when he was 15 and was helping to build a family amusement park in his native Wisconsin. He was having trouble managing a work crew of a dozen Native Americans and hired a middle-aged chief named White Cloud as his assistant. White Cloud got instant results, making him realize that "it's the people around you who get the job done for you."
As a young man, Mr. Egan at first pursued a career in tourism. But a "humbling" job in food service, followed by a low-paying stint in academia, cooled that ambition, and he jumped at the chance to run an old friend's family business.
Sitting in the cluttered Silicon Alley office of Theglobe.com recently, he looked more like an artist than an investor with his snowy white hair, black pullover sweater and black trousers. But he talked like an investor as he dismissed fears about an Internet stock bubble. "There's a very good reason a lot of capital is pouring into the Internet," he said. "Fifty million or 100 million data bases being joined with three billion users."
In other recent deals, Mr. Egan bought and sold AutobyInternet Inc. and bought a majority stake in Inteletravel, a privately held Internet travel company. He plans to take public his own start-up, Certified Vacations, a travel company, at the end of this year. Last Monday, Theglobe.com announced its first acquisition, the expected purchase of Azazz.com, an Internet retailer.
What drives Mr. Egan? He says he wants to help young entrepreneurs make their way. The other day, he says, he had breakfast with the two founders of Nantucket Nectars, both in their early 30's. "You see the enthusiasm for life in their eyes and hear it in their voices," he said. "Maybe I'm trying to recapture my youth."

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT;
Wall Street Likes What It Sees In Detroit

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
THESE are fat times for American auto makers. Adjusted for inflation, gasoline prices are as low as they have been in decades, and interest rates are down, too. Perhaps most important, the economy keeps chugging along, keeping sales buoyant.
So, many companies are awash in cash. Some money is being spent: Ford Motor paid $6.5 billion last month to buy Volvo's auto operations. Daimler used $33 billion worth of stock to buy cash-rich Chrysler. But a lot of money is being held as a cushion against the next prolonged drop in sales. 
 At the moment, Wall Street seems to like what it sees. Maryann N. Keller, a managing director at ING Baring Furman Selz, has been following autos for a quarter-century. Last week, she spent some time talking about developments in the business.
 
Q. For much of your career, Detroit has turned out products that many consumers considered inferior to Japanese automobiles. Now, things appear different. Is that the way you see it?
 
A. I am encouraged on two fronts. First, the relative competitive balance between the United States and Japan is as good as it has been in 30 years. The gap has been closed in many areas, from quality to cost to engineering. In some areas you could say American companies are in the lead.
There are some very good Japanese auto makers, with Honda and Toyota head and shoulders above the rest. But Mitsubishi and Nissan are in big trouble.
The second thing is that American companies are beginning to identify themselves differently. It used to be that they had to control all areas of production. Now, they are looking at defining what the strategic competencies they need to have really are, and are seeing their responsibility as defining the vehicle and then developing the brand, marketing and distributing it.
 
Q. Is General Motors' decision to spin out Delphi Automotive an example of this new way of thinking?
 
A. I think the separation of G.M. and Delphi is a significant positive for General Motors. In the past, G.M. always argued that its inferior profit margins, compared with a company like Chrysler, were a result of the fact that G.M. made more of its own stuff. With the spin-out, G.M. will have the chance to have a different kind of cost-of-capital structure. Once it is finished, G.M.'s liquidity, or working capital, will increase by about $2.7 billion.
 
Q. What do you think of Ford's acquisition of Volvo's auto business?
 
A. As far as I'm concerned, that is an acquisition which doesn't solve Ford's problems. Volvo preferred to be bought by Ford because Ford is demonstrably a very good parent. It has been very, very careful in nurturing Jaguar, for example.
But from a financial standpoint, Volvo won't add much to Ford's earnings. There is nothing wrong with Volvo; in fact, it's a company that is without a lot of problems and has real expertise in safety engineering. So if Ford had to buy something, it is as good an acquisition as Ford could have made.
 
Q. What are Ford's problems?
 
A. Ford's issues are cars in North America, and its international operations.
In North America, Ford derives a very high percentage of its sales from car rental companies like Hertz. The average private consumer loves Ford trucks. But Ford has not been able to make much headway in heightening consumer perception of its cars. It needs to be able to tackle this because eventually the pot of gold it has in pickups may go away.
Internationally, Ford has struggled in the 1990's and has lost market share. It has not come up with an effective product response to reverse that.
 
Q. The conventional argument for mergers is global overcapacity. Do you buy that?
 
A. I am perhaps the only person on the planet who doesn't see massive consolidation ahead in the auto industry.
Excess capacity has been a problem for the last 25 years. The fact is, auto companies will build factories whenever they feel they can get an advantage. They did some pretty stupid things in the 1990's.
So I don't think excess capacity is going away. You can't prevent auto company managements from thinking they will have a more strategic reason for investing in a part of the world where they think they can do a better job than the competition. But the U.S. market is where the bulk of the earnings come for the Germans, for Toyota and Honda and for the American manufacturers. This is it.
 
Q. Do you see anyone willing to acquire a Japanese company?
 
A. I don't think any Japanese manufacturers will be taken over. Japanese companies are complicated, Japanese accounting is not transparent and a lot of losses are hidden. Japan is not going to be an engine of growth for a while.

HEADLINE: Can Harlem's Heritage Be Saved?;
Many Jewels of Its Vibrant Past Are Gone. Now Some Residents Are Fighting to Landmark the Rest.

BYLINE: BY NINA SIEGAL 

 BODY:
IN 1976, Josephine E. Jones set eyes on stained-glass windows, carved cherry bannisters and Minton tiles in a Queen Anne-style row house at 137 West 122d Street in Harlem, and she knew it was the home she had dreamed of owning. The detailing was a signature of Francis H. Kimball, one of New York's leading turn-of-the-century architects, and the street was once known locally as Doctors' Row.
Mrs. Jones had made her way north from Greenville, S.C., where her father, a cotton sharecropper, worked for a white landowner with an expansive Victorian estate. Though Mrs. Jones's family had lived in a tiny shack without running water, she remembered playing in the Victorian house and fantasizing about owning one as grand. 
 On 122d Street, Mrs. Jones discovered that treasure, but hardly anyone else recognized it. The neighborhood had been neglected for 30 years, and there were more abandoned buildings on the street than inhabited ones. Thieves had filched many gargoyles, gables and other ornamental details from the row houses, and one historic brownstone had been painted bright orange.
None of that fazed Mrs. Jones, who bought the house for $15,000. In 1992, she asked the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission to designate her home, and the row houses adjoining hers, as official landmarks. She was not the only one. Middle-class and professional African-Americans were increasingly drawn to Harlem, attracted by relatively inexpensive real estate prices, dropping crime rates and signs of economic renewal. They, too, wanted their historic homes and Harlem's other jewels to gain landmark status, which they hoped would help their preservation efforts.
Too many markers of their heritage, they say, have already been destroyed. The famed Cotton Club is gone, as is the Audubon Ballroom, where Malcolm X was killed. So are the Lafayette Theater, where Orson Welles staged the first all-black production of "Macbeth," and the Harlem Opera House, which Oscar Hammerstein opened in 1889. Other important cultural moorings have deteriorated or been partly dismantled, like the Renaissance Ballroom and Theater, Minton's Playhouse and Small's Paradise, where many jazz legends took the stage.
Preservationists argue that many cultural touchstones remain, and can be saved if the Landmarks Preservation Commission acts quickly. They point out that the city's landmarks law lets owners of historic properties qualify for special grants and low-interest loans for restoration work. And the law carries penalties for alterations that compromise a building's historic integrity.
But the landmarking process is never easy, and it is complicated by Harlem's own economic and social dynamics. Some community developers, for example, argue that landmarking brings bureaucratic restraints and higher expenses that make it more difficult to renovate old buildings. Others say that poverty and other social problems make it harder for neighborhood activists to focus on preservation efforts.
Nevertheless, in the last several years, people like Mrs. Jones have formed local advocacy groups to pressure the city and the commission to recognize historic sites in Harlem. In 1991 the city landmarks agency issued a list of 25 sites it promised to place at the top of its agenda. But some residents say the process has stagnated, and neighborhood leaders are expressing frustration.
"Harlem has been ignored up until now," said Carolyn Kent, co-chairwoman of the parks and landmarks committee of Community Board 9, which covers West Harlem. "It has been ignored by its own residents, by downtown advocacy, by the commission, by elected officials. It's a tragedy because we've lost all these places that are of great international importance."
The president of the Hamilton Heights-West Harlem Community Preservation Organization, Ron Melichar, said that many architecturally significant buildings have been ignored. "The concern we feel is that as you look generally at the housing stock in Harlem, you see a deterioration and an increasing disregard for the historic value of what is there," he said. "It has had a big impact on our community, because it doesn't allow for us to move ahead with the revitalization that should happen."
Michael Henry Adams, a preservationist who is writing a book about historic Harlem, has become one of the area's most vocal advocates of landmarking. He argues that the Landmarks Preservation Commission has neglected buildings above 96th Street, thus erasing "the heritage and history and culture of so many people."
"It is not the kind of racism where someone calls you a name," Mr. Adams said. "It's the worst kind, where they just ignore you." He added: "It is an utter scandal that the incredible architectural and cultural heritage here can be destroyed when we have a law in place to protect it. But it is being used in an inequitable way."
The chairwoman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission, Jennifer J. Raab, said that protecting Harlem was one of her top priorities, along with lower Manhattan and Douglaston, Queens. When Ms. Raab was appointed by the Mayor in 1994, she said, no action had been taken on 12 of the 25 sites that had been nominated. Since then, she said, seven of those sites have been landmarked, including the 1933 Harlem Y.M.C.A. on 135th Street, near Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard, where many important black figures from Richard Wright to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. have lived, visited or spoken.
Mr. Adams was not impressed. "What is that?" he said. "Seven buildings compared to some 600 buildings in Douglaston, Queens, alone, and hundreds of buildings designated in TriBeCa and Greenwich Village. Fewer than 7.5 percent of the buildings that have been designated in New York have been above 96th Street."
Ms. Raab contested Mr. Adams's count, saying that the agency did not tally landmark designations that way. She said her own agenda for Harlem included landmarking more buildings in the Hamilton Heights Historic District, the area between 140th and 145th Streets and St. Nicholas and Amsterdam Avenues. Once that is done, she said, she would consider requests for a Sugar Hill Historic District between Edgecombe and Amsterdam Avenues from 145th to 155th Streets.
"We have been very active in Harlem, very active," Ms. Raab said. "I've been up, I've been out, we've been planning and we are trying to make good decisions. This is something we care about a lot."
But she also said that she tended to focus attention on neighborhoods where there was a strong outpouring of support for landmarking from residents, because she wanted them to understand that landmark status was a responsibility as well as an honor.
Yet as Yuien Chin, an organizer of the Hamilton Heights-Sugar Hill Historic District Committee, a group seeking expansion of the historic districts in western Harlem, pointed out, "The people who fight for landmarking do it in their free time, and there are just so many other quality-of-life issues in this neighborhood that the resources are spread thin." Nevertheless, she said: "We are organized. It just may not be in the traditional way the commission is used to."
But some community developers who want to revive Central Harlem say landmarking would hurt rather than help. Karen A. Phillips, chief executive officer of the nonprofit Abyssinian Development Corporation, said the cost of rehabilitating a historic building under the landmark law can be 20 to 25 percent higher than renovating an ordinary building. For example, she said, some landmarked buildings must have a special kind of wood-frame window that costs three times more than a modern aluminum window.
"If you landmark all of Harlem, you're preserving a ruin rather than preserving a community," Ms. Phillips said.
Even defining the boundaries of Harlem is tough. The landmarks commission contends that sites in Morningside Heights qualify as Harlem, for example, and some preservationists would like to see the neighborhood's borders extend above 155th Street, which is generally considered the beginning of Washington Heights.
In the area traditionally considered Harlem (between 96th and 155th Streets on the East Side and 110th and 155th Streets on the West Side, excluding Morningside Heights) there are now three historic districts: the Hamilton Heights Historic District, in the elevated western section of the city near City College; the Mount Morris Historic District, near Marcus Garvey Park in Central Harlem, and the St. Nicholas Historic District, the two blocks of 138th and 139th Streets commonly known as Striver's Row, because the elite of Harlem lived there.
The commission has also given landmark status to about four dozen individual buildings. Some of the best known are the Apollo Theater, on West 125th Street; the former home of Alexander Hamilton, known as the Grange, on Convent Avenue; the Abyssinian Baptist Church and Community House, on West 138th Street; the Harlem Courthouse, on East 121st Street, and Astor Row on 130th Street. These sites, the commission says, represent pre-Civil War Harlem, the ecclesiastical heritage and the social history of the area.
By way of comparison, however, almost all of Greenwich Village, from St. Luke's Place to West 13th Street and from Washington Street to Washington Square East, is an official historic district, complemented by some 30 individual landmarks in the West and East Villages. A large swath of the Upper West Side -- from Central Park West to Amsterdam Avenue beginning at 62d Street and ending at 85th Street -- is a landmark district, and 50 buildings in the area have landmark status.
Andrew S. Dolkart, an architectural historian who teaches at Columbia University and wrote "Touring Historic Harlem: Four Walks in Northern Manhattan" (New York Landmarks Conservancy, 1997) as well as a history of Morningside Heights published last year, said the city landmarks commission was off to a good start in Harlem. But, he said, "There are still a lot of things, many of them equally good, that have not been landmarked, so there is a pressing need to do more."
The Mount Morris Historic District, for example, was too narrowly defined when it was designated in 1971, Mr. Dolkart said. He said the district should include the Queen Anne row houses on 122d Street, which he said make up "one of the outstanding rows in New York." In 1996, the row was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, with the help of the New York Landmarks Conservancy, a nonprofit group that offers financial and technical help to save historic properties.
But a National Register listing is merely honorific, said Peg Breen, the Conservancy's president, and offers few protections for city buildings. Only the city landmarks law, which carries penalties of up to $5,000 for an initial violation that is not corrected after two warnings, can insure that historic homes are not torn down or altered beyond recognition, she said.
Debbie Wright, president and chief executive officer of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, said that historic preservation is crucial for Harlem because it can help promote tourism. If important sites are preserved, she said, more tourists will visit and spend money in local restaurants, shops and clubs.
In 1924, the writer Arna Bontemps said that the hub of Harlem, near 135th Street, was "like a foretaste of paradise," adding, "A blue haze descended at night and with it strings of fairy lights on the broad avenues."
But that paradise is barely recognizable today. The home of Florence Mills, perhaps the most famous stage performer of the Harlem Renaissance, is one example. The building where she lived, at 220 West 135th Street, is boarded up and so untended that the limbs of a tree reach out of the windows from within the building's husk.
The scholar James Weldon Johnson, who at the turn of the century wrote the poem "Lift Every Voice and Sing," as well as "Black Manhattan," the first historical account of African-Americans in New York City, lived at 187 West 135th Street, next door to the jazz pianist Fats Waller. James Van Der Zee, an important photographer whose work chronicled life in northern Manhattan from the 20's through the late 60's, had his first studio at No. 107.
At the corner of 135th and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard is Small's Paradise, which Lana Turner once called "the home of the happy feet," where waiters wore roller skates or danced the Charleston as they served black and white customers in the 20's. Near the opposite corner was the headquarters of the United Negro Improvement Organization, founded by Marcus Garvey, the first major black pan-African philosopher. Though these buildings still stand, they are unmarked and in various stages of disrepair.
Around the corner on 136th Street, the home of the New York Urban League, founded in 1911 to help Southern blacks who had moved to the city, also still stands, although it has been modernized. But the house on the block with the greatest cultural significance, according to Mr. Dolkart, is gone. That was the rooming house run by Iolanthe Sydney, at No. 267, which Mr. Dolkart wrote, was "the headquarters of the Harlem Renaissance's vanguard wing" and a temporary home to the writers Langston Hughes, Wallace Thurman and Zora Neale Hurston.
And though the intersection of 135th Street and Seventh Avenue (now Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard) was known the Campus of the Harlem Renaissance, according to David Levering Lewis, a historian, only two major historic sites on these two critical blocks have been designated as city landmarks.
Some who live in the existing Harlem historic districts argue that landmarking is uplifting for neighborhoods. The president of the Hamilton Heights Homeowners Association, John Cardwell, said he wanted to see his district expanded because he believed the landmark designation enhanced community pride.
"This neighborhood is changing from a war zone where there's been an active drug war going on to an historic district that is interpreting Alexander Hamilton's time and bringing attention back to the architecture and the streetscape," he said.
When Mrs. Jones began her crusade to expand the Mount Morris Historic District, she had the support of Landmarks Harlem, an advocacy group founded by State Senator David A. Paterson to lobby for preservation in the district. In 1994, the group helped get the National Register of Historic Places to pick Harlem as one of its top 11 most endangered places in the United States. But Landmarks Harlem collapsed in 1996 after a controversy involving one of its officials and allegations of misappropriated funds.
Since then, Mrs. Jones said, she has not been able to garner the kind of community support for landmarking in Central Harlem that the commission seems to want. She said she declined an offer to have just her house designated because she wants the Mount Morris Historic District expanded to include it and many more houses.
Yet Mr. Adams said he worried about the perception that broad community support was needed for landmarking. The law, he said, does not require neighborhood lobbying. If that were the case, he added, only people in wealthy communities would be able to preserve their pasts.
"To contend that only if you have the leisure and the time to advocate on behalf of your community will you be able to get attention, then it's a foregone conclusion that people who live in poor neighborhoods will not get preservation," Mr. Adams said. "The dynamic is that poor people and minorities are shortchanged over and over again by government because people say they aren't organized."
 
A Glance at the Past That Has Been Lost
 
 BLACKS were originally restricted to the balcony of the 1912 Lafayette Theater, near right, on Seventh Avenue between 131st and 132d Streets. In 1936, Orson Welles staged the first all-black production of "Macbeth" at the theater, where Bessie Smith, Duke Ellington and other legends had also performed. A church bought the building in 1951 and had the facade demolished during renovations in 1990.
In 1965, Malcolm X was assassinated at the Audubon Ballroom, center, on Broadway between 165th and 166th Streets. The 1912 building, with lavish terra-cotta details, was gutted in the early 90's for a Columbia University science center, but the facade was preserved.
The Harlem Opera House, far right, at 209 West 125th Street, was opened by Oscar Hammerstein in 1889. In the 30's it featured swing bands and then became a cinema, but it was torn down in 1959 for a bowling alley.

How to Curb Borrowing: Make Lending Riskier

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
EVER since the global financial crisis began in East Asia 19 months ago, public debate has focused on the mistake made by the damaged countries: too much borrowing. Now the flip side of that problem is coming into focus: too much lending.
The latest thinking about how to stop new outbreaks of global financial distress features proposals to slow down lending by making it riskier and more expensive. The plans, coming from academics and public officials, would rein in the banks, mutual funds, hedge funds, pension funds and wealthy individuals in industrial countries who in the 1990's poured tens of billions of dollars in short-term loans into East Asia's booming economies. 
 These loans played a huge part in precipitating bankruptcies, bank failures, plunging currencies and recessions, first in Asia, then in Russia and now in Brazil. When trouble came, the lenders canceled the loans, withdrawing their money and leaving whole countries in ruins.
"The fact is that in this particular crisis, private sector lenders have not emerged well," Stanley Fischer, first deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said a week ago at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, an annual gathering of world leaders, corporate executives, economists and other movers and shakers.
The lenders, naturally enough, aren't happy about the attempts to alter their behavior. Rising from his seat in the audience, Deryck C. Maughan, vice chairman of Citigroup Inc., responded to Mr. Fischer by noting that lenders had already lost considerable sums in the current crisis -- a curb in itself on overly risky lending in the future.
In Washington, William Cline, chief economist at the Institute for International Finance, which represents lenders, said new rules that make lending riskier would only inhibit the flow of capital that emerging countries will need to expand their economies once the current global crisis ends.
"It will take some time for a really strong, resurgent lending market to revive," Mr. Cline said. "It is asking for trouble to put up impediments now to this future lending."
But that is the very goal of the new proposals. They seek to avoid flooding a country with too much short-term lending that can be quickly withdrawn. Already some nations are restricting such lending by taxing short-term loans as they enter the country, thus making them more expensive for the borrowers.
The new approaches would strike at the lenders, preventing them, for example, from pulling out their money in the event of crisis conditions -- a weakening currency, shrinking economic growth -- that threaten to devastate an economy. Other proposals would give debtor countries the legal right to reschedule and postpone payments owed to foreign banks and bondholders.
Restricting lenders would solve another problem. It would deflect criticism that the Clinton Administration and the I.M.F., in pushing through huge bailout loans for countries in crisis, are using public money to repay lenders for risky credits they should not have extended in the first place, or at least not in such quantities. Such bailouts will only encourage excessive lending in the future, this argument goes.
"If lenders don't take a hit, they won't price their loans correctly," said Robert Litan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "They will set interest rates too low, and they will shovel too much money into questionable markets."
THE proposals to curb lending are coming increasingly from international organizations, most of which bring together representatives from industrial countries where the lenders are located. One proposal, for example, would require or encourage lenders to put aside, say, 9 cents or 10 cents for every dollar lent to banks and businesses in high-risk countries. These are amounts larger than the sums that are required to be put aside today. With that extra money sitting idle, lenders would have to increase their interest rates to earn as much as before -- and the higher rates would inhibit lending.
Another change would make it easier to renegotiate debt, much of which is in the form of bonds sold to mutual funds, hedge funds, wealthy investors and the like. Through a majority vote, for example, these bondholders could agree to stretch out payments from hard-pressed debtors in emerging countries. Currently, most bonds agreements require a unanimous vote to do this.
Still other proposals would put ceilings on short-term lending in risky markets, or require lenders to take a loss on their loans in the event of a crisis -- a "haircut" that Mr. Litan is pushing.
Are any of these changes likely to be adopted and enforced? Probably not, if the global crisis ends soon. Besides, there are few mechanisms to enforce these rules across borders.
Even if the global crisis endures, overcoming the resistance of lenders will not be easy. Borrowers may also object, given the likelihood that the various restrictions will require them to pay higher interest rates.
"The problem is," Mr. Litan said, "that no one wants to be the first to make the necessary commitment."

Cold War Foes Join as Capitalist Tools

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
IF anyone had suggested during the cold war that former C.I.A. and K.G.B. agents would one day be working together as business partners to provide sensitive information to American corporations, the idea would have seemed too far-fetched to be believed.
But that is exactly what is happening today as hundreds of out-of-work spies from the United States and Russia are joining hands in the pursuit of capitalism, providing protection, intelligence and political risk assessments to American companies extending their reach to emerging markets and other global hot spots. 
They include men like Gen. Viktor Budanov, a former chief of counterintelligence for the K.G.B., who formed a joint venture with Gerard P. Burke, who was once assistant director of the National Security Agency. Mr. Budanov heads the Moscow office of Parvus International, a business intelligence firm in Silver Spring, Md., founded by Mr. Burke that employs former C.I.A., K.G.B. and Soviet-bloc agents.
"We do not talk about our former jobs," Mr. Budanov said. "We are in a new life and we are now partners in the same boat of helping our American clients."
Even the American Society for Industrial Security, a trade group with 35,000 members representing private security companies, has a Moscow chapter with about 35 ex-employees of the Soviet intelligence agency.
"Who knows the territory there better than former K.G.B. officers?" said Joseph Ricci, a spokesman for the group. "Some of our members at first had a hard time with having a Russian chapter -- but then most of our members started out working for the U.S. Government. But these K.G.B. guys are not employed by their government anymore and they have to make a living. Their loyalty is to who is putting food on their table."
Business intelligence firms provide American corporations operating overseas with information about local politics and pitfalls, protection for executives and background data on local business partners.
Companies like Parvus keep American businesses from stumbling into bad business arrangements in far-flung places like Kazakhstan, Russia and the Ukraine and bail them out when they do -- helping them deal with kidnappings, fraud, theft and extortion.
For many of these firms, it makes perfect sense to employ former spies, many of whom have spent their lives studying other cultures, speak many languages and can often surreptitiously ferret out information through networks of local contacts -- both among local government officials and shadier types.
"Former K.G.B. officers, like our C.I.A., are the best and the brightest," said Frederick W. Rustmann Jr., a retired C.I.A. officer who is head of CTC International (named after the C.I.A.'s Counter-Terrorism Center), a firm in West Palm Beach, Fla., with six former C.I.A. agents and one ex-K.G.B. officer on staff and scores of former Soviet-bloc spies on retainer abroad.
"We were all in the same trade and we all learned the same techniques," Mr. Rustmann said. "K.G.B. officers are naturals. We use them to collect information for us and for security. You can rent a former K.G.B. agent with four languages, a gun and a car for 50 bucks a day. And he'll interpret for you."
A lot of former Russian spies are available because the K.G.B. was broken up into several agencies and scaled back after 1991, and the financial rewards are far greater on the outside. And the recent political and economic turmoil in Russia has only increased the demand for their services, with Western companies scrambling for more intelligence and protection than ever before.
BUT don't the spies feel a little weird about working side by side with their former adversaries? Apparently not.
"Yes, our countries were enemies, but many of us were friends," Mr. Rustmann said. "The fact is, when I was in Libya I had lots of K.G.B. friends. Our backgrounds are similar, our psychology and training are similar. We used to go on picnics together and our families were friends. I was always trying to recruit Boris and he was trying to recruit me."
Mr. Burke said in the six years that Parvus has been doing business in Moscow, only once did a client -- a Fortune 100 company -- raise questions about whether former K.G.B. agents were trustworthy. Mr. Burke dealt with this concern by slowly introducing his K.G.B. staffers to the American client and then increasing their level of responsibility and accessibility to corporate secrets.
"I've been in this business for many years and I'm able to vet these people carefully," Mr. Burke said. "From time to time in the back alleys of the world, you are confronted with a lot of inducements and you see a very, very dark side. There are some former spies I wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole."
Many former Soviet-bloc spies say they are still serving their countries, only in a new way, by making sure that American businesses keep capital invested in their homelands. "Instead of doing stupid cold war stuff, we have finally found some useful purpose in life," said one former spy who asked not to be named. "We want to make sure that American investors don't get burned here so that capital keeps flowing in. What used to be a lethal weapon has now become very peaceable."

HEADLINE: The Nation: Social Security on Wall Street;
Flirting With a Buy Order for $1 Trillion in Stock

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
WHAT would happen if the Government were investing hundreds of billions of dollars of Social Security reserves in the stock market, and the anti-abortion forces in Congress decided that none of it should be put into companies that make or import pills that induce abortion?
Playing politics with the Social Security reserves would be quite unpopular. But companies that might want to put abortion pills on the market could hardly afford the risk that their stocks would be off limits to maybe the biggest single investor in the world. So it's a safe bet that any plans to put the pills on sale would be shelved. 
 That is the kind of nightmare foreseen by the economists and politicians who oppose President Clinton's plan to beef up Social Security reserves by investing some of the money in stocks. Political tampering, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, warned Congress last month, could "put at risk the efficiency of our capital markets and thus our economy."
Republicans and conservative economists oppose the Clinton plan because they fear Government intrusion in the markets. But most of them would also divert Social Security money into stocks. Under various proposals, all workers would be allowed to take some of the money they would otherwise pay in taxes and invest it in stocks that would go into their own private investment accounts.
But these plans are fraught with potential problems, too, the most serious being the possibility that workers could lose some of their retirement savings through bad investments or a drop in the market.
Both sides are trying to take advantage of a simple fact of economic history: Over a long period of time, private stocks have earned much more money for investors than the Government bonds where by law the Social Security reserves are now held. Economists project the average annual return on stocks over the next 75 years to be 6 percent to 7 percent more than the rate of inflation, compared with an average of less than 3 percent above inflation for Government bonds.
This is important because every additional dollar investments earn for retirement is one less dollar the Government will have to raise for Social Security through higher taxes or reduced benefits when the baby boomers begin to retire early in the next century.
But the issue is more a matter of politics and ideology than of economics. Most of the advocates on both sides -- those who want the Government to control the investments and those who want workers to invest the money themselves -- would rather leave the Social Security system as it is now with its lower return on investments than take what they see as the unacceptable risks of the other side's proposal.
UNDER President Clinton's plan, nearly $600 billion, or 15 percent of the Social Security trust fund, would be invested in stocks between now and 2015. Counting dividends and inflation, the Government would then own about $1 trillion in stock, nearly 4 percent of all the outstanding public stock in the country.
A strict firewall would be built to protect this investment from political meddling. Management would be placed in the hands of an independent board whose members would serve long, staggered terms and not be subject to removal for political reasons. Investments could be made only in broad index funds, not in individual stocks. The Government's voting rights on its shares would be restricted, and the managers would be required to vote shares solely according to the economic interest of the beneficiaries.
The President and his economic advisers argue that the management board would be every bit as insulated from politics as the Federal Reserve Board. And they say the experience of state pension funds and the Thrift Savings Plan for Federal workers shows that public pension money can be invested in the stock market without political interference.
But critics point out that over the years, the Federal Reserve has often been subjected to political arm twisting. (The Nixon White House, for example, leaned heavily on Arthur Burns, then chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, to see that the economy was especially strong in 1972 when Nixon ran for re-election. Burns denied it, but many historians today are convinced that he manipulated monetary policy to that effect.)
Any firewall that Congress builds, the critics note, Congress can also tear down with one vote.
As for state and local pension funds, they have generally avoided political tampering, but there are countless exceptions. Pension funds in California and Illinois have been required to contribute money to offset state budget deficits. Funds in Pennsylvania and Connecticut recently lost millions of dollars because politicians insisted they make investments to keep or attract job-producing businesses in those states. In the 1970's and 1980's, more than half the state legislatures prohibited their retirement funds from being invested in companies that did business in South Africa. Pension funds in four states -- Florida, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Vermont -- have been required to sell their stock in tobacco companies.
The Thrift Savings Plan has indeed been free of politics. But with assets of about $70 billion, its portfolio is much smaller than Social Security's would be. In addition, unlike Social Security, participation is voluntary for Federal workers.
"Pension fund money is lusted after by politicians of both parties," said Richard H. Koppes, former general counsel of the California Public Employees' Retirement System. "They can't resist themselves."
Allowing workers to invest part of their retirement money themselves, as most Republicans want to do, avoids most of the political problems, but it raises others. Most Americans are not sophisticated about finance and could be victimized by unscrupulous sales pitches. In 1988, when Britain allowed workers to opt out of the public pension system and invest in private accounts, many people lost billions of dollars to scam artists in what was called the "mis-selling" scandal.
Another problem is that markets are not always strong. The decade of the 1970's, for example, was not good for stocks. Adjusted for inflation, the average portfolio did not reach its 1969 level, even with dividends reinvested, until 1983. A huge Government portfolio could smooth the peaks and valleys, but private investors could lose a large part of their retirement savings in a bear market.
FINALLY, small accounts would be expensive to administer, and a sizable chunk of workers' savings could go to administrative fees. According to Arthur Levitt Jr., chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, a 1 percent annual fee, for instance, reduces an account's balance by 17 percent after 20 years.
Still, since almost everyone in politics wants to put some of the money in the stock market one way or another, perhaps the President and Congress will decide that the reward is worth the risks. The division between the two sides over how to invest the Social Security money is so sharp, though, that a compromise will be difficult. But the attraction of finding a way to minimize tax increases and benefit cuts is mighty strong.

Pressing the Issue Of Pay Inequality

BYLINE: By DANIEL M. GOLD 

 BODY:
Compensation continues to swell for top corporate management even as wages for the work force rise only marginally, a wage gap that some people consider a problem for the economy and society. The most recent of Business Week's annual studies found that at the 365 biggest companies in the country, the ratio of the chief executive's pay to that of a factory worker grew to 326 to 1 in 1997. The ratio was 44 to 1 in 1965.
High time then, according to an advocacy group in Boston called United for a Fair Economy, to bring the issue to the board room. This year, the group's Responsible Wealth project has recruited shareholders to file resolutions at eight companies to examine the wage gaps within their labor forces. 
 Resolutions on the proxies for Allied Signal, BankAmerica, BankBoston, Citigroup and General Electric ask the companies to cap the chief executive's pay at a specific multiple of what the lowest-paid full-time employee makes; the multiple would be established by each company. A resolution at AT&T seeks a flat cap on the chief executive's pay, not linked to the compensation of the lowest-paid worker. A resolution at Huffy, the bicycle maker, asks the company to report on the ratio between the highest- and the lowest-paid workers during the last 10 years.
No one at United for a Fair Economy is expecting the resolutions to pass; social-issue resolutions rarely muster the support of more than 2 or 3 percent of voters. But last year, in a test, the group floated the General Electric proposal and was glad to see it draw 6 percent of the votes.
Scott Klinger, the Responsible Wealth coordinator, said a vote "in the 10 to 20 percent range would be significant" and would force a board to consider action of some sort. The object of the project, he said, was to raise the issue to a level of public debate.
The topic is not just a flavor of the season, he added. The group expects to expand its efforts to other companies for many shareholder meetings to come. "We see this as a multiyear, sustained effort," Mr. Klinger said. DANIEL M. GOLD

The Dogs Show Up The Cats

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
The canine super bowl opens tomorrow and these tradition-bound pages, as usual, will roll over for it. After all, the Westminster Kennel Club show at Madison Square Garden is a "major fixture" with rich, ancient franchises, paeans to fine breeding, breathless television analyses of poise and conformation, maybe even a betting line. There will be rookies, veterans, passionate fans. It has everything a big-league spectacular needs and little to fear; no tall dog is expected to slip out on his handler tonight looking for action on Eighth Avenue. 
 Three weeks later, on its little paws, the Cat Show will pad into town. A feline super bowl it is not. No one from this department will be sent to interview the top tabby, to decipher millennial attitudes from the popularity of specific breeds. As far as we're concerned, the dog show is an athletic competition, the cat show is a fur exhibition.
How come?
"There's not much sporting about cats," said Roger Caras, whose books and broadcasts have made him a leading animal expert. "Cats don't perform. They just sit there. You feed them. They are the most economically insignificant of all domestic animals. They have this reputation of being independent, but they are animals who have given up their independence so they can be taken care of. Cats and dogs should not be compared."
Caras's voice, crisp and authoritative, softened: "The first time I saw a Border Collie at work, tears came to my eyes. It was astounding. The ballet of that incredible work, the intelligence, the energy."
I told him a friend of mine thinks cats are self-starters who will go after mice without being asked, while dogs, often lazy and stupid, will watch mice play.
Caras snorted. "Dogs are far better mousers than cats. I've got a Jack Russell terrier, one of the 27 animals including cats in my house right now, who is incredible at hunting vermin. Cats are important if you are lonely; they are for loving, and that's real. But their only function is companionship."
There was a slight gasp when I recounted this to Christine MacMurray, the medical editor of the Animal Medical Center in New York. "Roger Caras said that?" she said. "Why would you even compare dogs and cats? They are as different as elephants and tigers. Oh, you asked the question."
When I asked MacMurray if she thought it was fair that we covered the dog show and not the cat show, she made a sound like a yawn. "I won't be reading about either one, much less going to them," she said. "I'm sure there is some value in celebrating the best, but most of this is about advertising for breeders. Those of us in the animal advocacy world are more interested in controlling the populations so that millions of cats and dogs -- including purebreds -- are not killed every year."
This was not exactly where I wanted to go. The question on my mind had been simple: Why do we give so much more attention to a show featuring dogs than to a show featuring cats? Could it be that the patriarchal media have made a connection with the perceived masculinity of The Dog (top dog, big dog, dawg)?
 "Nah," said Caras. "There is nothing more masculine than an old tom cat. A very rough animal. And they don't call a female dog a bitch for no reason."
But don't many pet owners see a powerful dog as an affirmation of their own masculinity?
"Let me quote some friends," said Caras. "Joe Garagiola loves little fluffy dogs, like Yorkies, and he's very secure in his masculinity. Gretchen Wyler, that wonderful performer, told me that a dog is her child that will never grow up, and a horse is her dancing partner."
MacMurray said she was glad I had brought horses into the conversation. Besides being treasurer of Pets Alive, a group that rescues animals, including horses, she has very strong feelings about best friends and dancing partners in the sports world.
"I'd like to see horse racing and dog racing made illegal," she said. "It's a form of abuse. Greyhounds live terrible lives. I don't know much about race horses." I told her that it was the human grooms who lived badly at the race track, but that few horses had golden feed bags. Rendering trucks cruise the race tracks for horses that break down or don't win enough. Losers become glue or food for dogs and Frenchmen.
MacMurray shuddered. "Thanks for calling, Bob," she said. "But back to your original question. These extravagant shows about cats and dogs don't help the problem. The audience doesn't see the irresponsible breeders, the puppy mills, the dogs discarded after summer vacations, the cats prowling the alleys of the city."
But isn't that about bad human breeding? These shows are about good animal genes. Caras said, "We want to pick out those who best represent the breed, and make sure their genetic material is preserved."

A Lovers' Quarrel With Technology Issues

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN

 BODY:
Investors, long enamored of technology stocks, had a sudden change of heart last week, and chip makers and computer-related companies tumbled, sending the tech-nology-heavy Nasdaq composite index down 132.27 points, or 5.3 percent, to 2,373.62. Intel, Cisco Systems and Microsoft were all down for the week.
 The broader market was also off, but not nearly so much. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9,304.24, down 54.59 points, or 0.6 percent. Low unem-ployment figures and other buoyant economic news led to worries that the Federal Reserve, which left rates unchanged last week, might soon nudge them up. 
 The Bank of England did the opposite, unexpectedly lowering its base interest rate by a half percentage point, to 5.5 percent, but stocks failed to respond to the stimulus. The FTSE 100 index closed at 5,855.3, down 40.7 points for the week.
 Markets in Germany and France also closed with small declines. In Frankfurt, the electronically traded Xetra DAX closed at 5,097.48 points, down 82.81 from the previous week. In Paris, the CAC-40 blue-chip index closed at 4,147.30, down 104.50. In Tokyo, where stocks of computer chip makers were also hit, the Nikkei fell to 13,898.08, down 601.17 for the week.

HEADLINE: Keeping Jobs In the City

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your Jan. 17 article "The End of the Line," raises complicated issues regarding not only the imminent closing of the Swingline stapler factory in Queens, but also other New York City enterprises as well. 
 How do you reconcile the desire to maintain a business and a work force in the city with the soaring costs of running a business here?
And how do you do so while competing with both foreign and American companies operating offshore and with domestic companies operating nonunion?
As chief executive and president of Eagle Electric Manufacturing, a wiring device company, I confront these issues daily. Eagle Electric has provided good, secure jobs for thousands of the foreign-born since we opened our doors more than 75 years ago. We were founded and built by an immigrant.
I empathize with the pain of the Swingline workers who have lost or are about to lose their jobs. I can also appreciate the factors that may have governed Swingline's decision to close its doors.
Unlike Swingline, however, approximately 15 months ago, in an unprecedented agreement with Local 365 of the United Automobile Workers, which represents our workers, our company negotiated a labor contract guaranteeing that a significant number of jobs would remain in Queens. In addition, we voluntarily decided to close a nonunion plant owned by us in North Carolina, and we relocated those jobs to our unionized plant here in Long Island City; unheard of in this day and age, but reflective of our commitment to our company and its work force and to the city.
All New Yorkers need to recognize and support the companies that are striving to keep jobs here in the city. That includes not only continued economic support by city and state governments, but also the active promotion of our products.

HEADLINE: Clinton Moves to Support Jordan, Trying to Speed Up Aid Delivery

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
President Clinton, moving swiftly to show American support as Jordan undertakes a historic transfer of power, said today that he would seek to accelerate delivery of $300 million in financial assistance to Jordan and would press international lenders to ease its foreign debt burden.
The Administration is concerned that Jordan's deepening domestic economic problems could undermine the new Government of Crown Prince Abdullah, who was sworn in as Regent as his father, King Hussein, was being kept alive on a respirator. Mr. Clinton wanted to signal quickly and forcefully American support for Prince Abdullah, who faces not only domestic economic troubles but also possible threats from hostile neighbors, particularly Iraq and Syria, Administration officials said today. 
 Mr. Clinton is making plans to attend the King's funeral in Amman whenever it occurs, White House officials said today.
"At this difficult time, my thoughts and prayers, as well as those of all Americans, are with His Majesty King Hussein, his family and the people of Jordan," Mr. Clinton said in a statement today. "The United States stands by Jordan and is determined to do all that it can to support and strengthen it."
Mr. Clinton has begun consultations with Congress to gain rapid approval of the $300 million in new aid to Jordan promised as a part of the Middle East agreement negotiated at the Wye Plantation in Maryland in October.
The money, to be paid in installments of $100 million a year over the next three years, would come on top of the $225 million that Congress has already approved for economic and military aid to Amman for the current fiscal year. The Administration is seeking an additional $225 million in aid to Jordan in the 2000 budget submitted to Congress this week.
Jordan owes foreign creditors nearly $7 billion and faces near-term repayments totaling hundreds of millions of dollars, a senior American official said.
Mr. Clinton said the Administration had enlisted other major economies and the states around the Persian Gulf in an international effort to provide new resources for Jordan. He also said the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank would consider emergency aid.
A senior Administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that international efforts to shore up Jordan's economy had been under way for several months but that the impending death of the King gave the discussions new urgency.
American officials indicated that there would be no change in policy toward Jordan, which has been a stalwart ally in efforts to broker a peace between the Israelis and Palestinians. The President has said he considers the emotional appeal from King Hussein to Israeli and Palestinian leaders to have been the critical factor that led to the success of the Wye talks last fall.
"King Hussein has been a giant as a leader in terms of his commitment to the peace process," another senior Administration official said. 'His statesmanship and wise counsel have been particularly important to President Clinton over the past few years. The loss of that kind of leadership is significant."

HEADLINE: A Move to Rid Parks of Snowmobiles

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: GRAND LAKE, Colo.

 BODY:
An arctic gale was blowing in Squeak Creek as Ken Todd roared down from the Continental Divide, bucking his powerful snowmobile through drifts on a road in Rocky Mountain National Park.
It was a motorized tableau that a coalition of environmental groups would like to erase from the National Park System. In a midwinter attack, the coalition, called the Bluewater Network, has petitioned Bruce Babbitt, the Interior Secretary, to ban snowmobiles from the 28 places among the National Park System's 378 that allow them. In the Northeast, snowmobiling is allowed only in the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area in Pennsylvania and Acadia National Park in Maine. 
 But the environmental coalition, representing an estimated 1 million members, is butting helmets with about 2.5 million Americans, the estimated number of people who ride snowmobiles every winter.
Mr. Todd, pulling his machine out of a drift here, flipped up his helmet visor and bellowed over the wind at an altitude of 10,000 feet, "The extremists would have the parks shut down to everybody."
Whether or not the environmental groups succeed, their petition highlights sharpening conflict between snowmobile riders and cross-country skiers on public lands. In National Forests, not part of the Park System, managers are zoning land for motorized or nonmotorized use. Here in Colorado this recreational segregation has come as snowmobile riders have expanded their reach with more powerful machines.
In addition, public lands managers and the public are growing less tolerant of the noise and air pollution from off-road recreational vehicles.
Thirty years after they first became popular, snowmobiles are still so noisy that they are sold without horns, and their emissions are dirtier than the blue smoke pumped out by 1950's automobiles. A modern snowmobile emits roughly 225 times the carbon monoxide and 1,000 times the hydrocarbons and nitrous oxides of a modern car, said Russell Long, executive director of Bluewater Network.
In a warning to snowmobile manufacturers, California adopted pollution targets for personal watercraft in December, calling for 75 percent reductions in emissions of hydrocarbons and nitrous oxides by 2001.
"Many of the personal watercraft manufacturers also make snowmobiles," said Charles Emmett, an engineer for the California Air Resources Board, a state agency charged with controlling air pollution. "So it is likely that they can adopt the same advanced technology."
John Sacklin, chief planner at Yellowstone National Park in central Wyoming, said, "We are going to try to move towards goals and targets on noise and air pollution." Rated by snowmobile magazines as the nation's top snowmobiling vacation spot, Yellowstone may have the clout to force manufacturers to adopt cleaner technologies.
Yellowstone has also become the poster park for the environmental groups' attack. Of the six National Park areas that receive more than 1,000 snowmobile visits a winter, Yellowstone receives the most, 60,110 last winter.
At the West Yellowstone entrance to the park, in Montana, carbon monoxide accumulations have caused nausea in park rangers, forcing the park to pump fresh air into ticket booths and to cut lines of snowmobiles by selling tickets in town.
Last month, the Montana Department of Environmental Quality installed an air pollution monitor at West Yellowstone. Yellowstone officials say that the park has already violated Federal air quality standards, sometimes surpassing pollution levels found in Denver, the region's largest city.
On Jan. 21, the Bluewater Network took a shotgun approach to snowmobiling, petitioning Secretary Babbitt to close the National Park System to snowmobiles, asking the Environmental Protection Agency to set air and water pollution rules for snowmobiles, asking the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to regulate snowmobiles for creating carbon monoxide health risks to workers, and asking the National Transportation Safety Board and the Consumer Product Safety Commission to study the high accident rates among snowmobilers.
"A small minority of thrill seekers are turning our National Parks into playgrounds at the expense of the majority who would like to keep their National Parks with clean air quality and free of all this noise," Dr. Long of Bluewater said from his office in San Francisco.
But the $6 billion-a-year snowmobile industry is enjoying a renaissance on the wings of more reliable machines and warmer clothing. After a deep slump in the 1980's, the number of snowmobiles registered in the United States has rebounded to 1.4 million machines, close to the high of 1.6 million in 1978. Over the last decade, the average price of a machine rose by 55 percent, to $5,800, as aging baby boomers turned to snowmobiling as a way to enjoy the outdoors in winter.
"People don't want to be couch potatoes in the winter," said Christine Jourdaine, executive director of the American Council of Snowmobile Associations, a club group based in East Lansing, Mich. "They want to go out and enjoy the great outdoors."
In the United States, clubs maintain 132,000 miles of snowmobile trails, breathing economic life into dozens of remote towns. Here in Grand Lake, which bills itself as Colorado's Snowmobile Capital, snowmobile rentals pump nearly $2 million each season into a town with a winter population of 369.
"Before snowmobiling, you could shoot a cannon down Grand Avenue and not hit anybody," Lori Crane, who runs Spirit Lake Polaris and Rentals, said as snowmobiles putt-putted down the main street here, past shops and restaurants.
Although snowmobile registrations in Colorado have doubled in a decade, to almost 30,000, Ms. Crane and other snowmobile enthusiasts believe that there is enough public land for everyone.
Snowmobile riders have free run of Colorado's Arapaho National Forest, where there are no speed limits. Next door, in Rocky Mountain National Park, they are restricted to a 16-mile segment of Trail Ridge Road from town to the Continental Divide, a vertical ascent of 2,000 feet with a speed limit of 35 miles an hour regulated by radar. Cross-country skiers and snowshoe users have all for themselves the rest of the 414-square mile National Park.
In National Parks, snowmobiles are allowed only on roads or lakes used by cars or boats in the summer.
"These are ours -- everybody's -- National Parks and Forests," said Brian Mahony, president of Grand Lake Trail Groomers, a club that grooms 107 miles of snowmobile trails in the National Forest, Colorado's largest trail network. "When you ride over eight feet of snow on the ground, there is, aside from the emissions, no impact."
Disagreement comes from Bob Bruce, who has a cabin near the National Forest.
"You have 12-year-old kids driving snowmobiles at 80 miles an hour down roads where you are not supposed to go over 25," said Mr. Bruce, a computer company executive from Boulder. "Over the weekend, the noise is absolutely deafening. There is this whole blue haze that hangs over the National Forest."
In moves that can cut hydrocarbon emissions by one third, snowmobile manufacturers are shifting to biodegradable oils and to gasohol, said Edward J. Klim, president of the International Snowmobile Manufacturers Association, a trade group based in Haslett, Mich. Mr. Klim said he suspected that environmental groups would not stop with taking the taste of oil out of the air.
There is no hidden agenda, said Jasper Carlton, executive director of the Biodiversity Legal Foundation, a Colorado group in the Bluewater Network.
"We want snowmobiling out of the National Parks," he said. "The Forest Service is next. When they refuse, we are going to sue them."

HEADLINE: Wassily Leontief, Economist Who Won a Nobel, Dies at 93

BYLINE: By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE 

 BODY:
Wassily Leontief, who won the Nobel prize in economics in 1973 for his analyses of America's production machinery, showing how changes in one sector of the economy can exact changes all along the line, affecting everything from the price of oil to the price of peanut butter, died Friday night at the New York University Medical Center. He was 93.
His analytic methods, as the Nobel committee observed, were adopted and became a permanent part of production planning and forecasting in scores of industrialized nations and in private corporations all over the world. 
 Following the model of his so-called input-output analysis, General Electric, for example, was able to load data from 184 sectors of the economy -- such as energy, home construction and transportation -- into a mammoth computer to help it predict how the energy crisis brought on by the Arab oil boycott in 1973 would affect public demand for its products and services, from light bulbs to turbines.
A well-known academic figure, Mr. Leontief was the director of the Institute for Economic Analysis of New York University from 1975 until 1991; even after his retirement he still taught at the university into his 90's. Before coming to N.Y.U. he taught economics at Harvard for 44 years and directed large research projects there as well.
Mr. Leontief was a thinker who often complained that too many of his academic colleagues spent too much time staring out their office windows instead of being out in the field, as any good economist ought to be, counting things. "Facts," he said. "You have to have facts. Theories aren't good unless you have facts to back them."
When asked how he developed the input-output analysis recognized by his Nobel memorial prize, he would invariably begin, "Oh, it's really very simple -- what I wanted to do was collect facts." The facts he sought were those that explained how segments of production were interconnected.
He showed that if you carefully studied changes in the cost and components of one type of product, you could determine the resulting changes in cost and components of others along the production chain.
Suppose you have a sudden rise the price of oil or steel? Mr. Leontief taught government officials and corporate executives to track how this influenced the costs of production in other segments of a local or national economy, both within an industry or more broadly across many industries and many nations.
Wassily Leontief was born Aug. 5, 1905, in St. Petersburg, the son of Wassily W. Leontief, an economist, and the former Eugenia Bekker. A brilliant student, he was allowed to enroll when he was only 15 at the newly renamed University of Leningrad. But he got in trouble by expressing vehement opposition to the lack of intellectual and personal freedom under the country's Communist regime, which had taken power three years earlier. He was arrested as he was nailing up anti-Communist posters on the wall of a military barracks and placed in solitary confinement. Released after several days, he promptly resumed his anti-Communist activities and was arrested several more times.
Finally, in 1925, he was allowed to leave the country, a turn of fate he attributed to a growth on his neck. He said the authorities believed that the growth was cancerous and that he would die and be of no use to the state. He left Russia to resume his studies in economics at the University of Berlin, and his parents soon followed. The growth was benign and he completed his doctorate in 1929. He spent a year as an economist advising the Government of China, particularly on the planning of a new railroad network.
Then he came to the United States and worked briefly in New York at the National Bureau of Economic Research, where his published work quickly attracted attention, and Harvard invited him to join its economics faculty. He agreed, provided the university help him develop his ideas about production. Harvard gave him a research assistant and a $2,000 grant to develop the system of input-output analysis that the world was to adopt. He and his assistant began constructing a table covering 42 American industries, taking months to compile figures and perform calculations that computers would latter handle in fractions of seconds.
During the war, he helped the United States Government with planning for industrial production, worked as a consultant to the Office of Strategic Services and supervised compilation of a 92-economic-sector table for the Department of Labor. In 1948, Mr. Leontief set up the Harvard Research Project on the Structure of the American Economy with the aid of large grants from the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations and the Air Force to expand and refine his input-output models. Soon he had a staff of 20 -- and a 650-punch-card computer from I.B.M., then the state-of-the art.
He did not, however, keep the Air Force grant long once the Eisenhower Administration came to power; some of its officials were critical of his input-output theory as smacking too much of a planned economy. That was precisely what he thought it should smack of.
One of his goals in studying the nature of changes in industrial production was to enable nations to plan in ways that would be economically beneficial and help them avoid periods of economic hardship. But to some economists the idea of national economic planning was ill advised: not only would it not work, they said, but it might make matters worse and also might open the door to excessive Government control. They maintained it would be better to let the private sector and the free market determine the course of future economic events.
To Mr. Leontief, it seemed short-sighted for nations to devote little or no thought to the analysis of the future of the overall economy, especially after what he regarded as the effective work of modern economists in devising projections that are mathematically and statistically sound. He spoke out often on the subject in the 1970's and 80's.
He and Leonard Woodcock, then president of the United Auto Workers, proposed that the Federal Government establish an Office of National Economic Planning to help coordinate economic projects and make recommendations on policies they said could avert unnecessary unemployment, inflation, failures in health care, shortages in affordable housing, energy, public transportation and other requirements of a civilized society.
The idea never materialized. If anything, the generation of younger economists who followed him, many of whom he taught, developed less respect for the abilities of national Governments to plan for the long term. It bothered him greatly that toward the end of the century many Americans seemed to have lost broad faith in their Government's ability to improve the lot of its citizens, particularly through economic programs.
In an Op-Ed article in The New York Times in 1992, he said there was little doubt that the United States Government had played an important role in a generally prosperous economy for more than half the century, from ending the Great Depression in the 30's to guiding the nation through most of the rest of the century in generally sounder economic health than most of the rest of the world.
Mr. Leontief was always fearful that employment problems would accompany widespread use of the high-speed computers that he himself relied on almost from the moment they first became applicable for nonmilitary purposes after World War II. He warned that computers would be for many workers what the tractor was to the horse -- great for the farmer but not great for the horse.
In an interview in 1996, when he was 90, Mr. Leontief, noting the trend toward corporate downsizing, said: "Individual entrepreneurs will continue to do better and better and better, but significant segments of the work force will do worse and worse. Ultimately, Governments will have to play a role in arbitrating and correcting this."
Mr. Leontief seemed to grow more liberal with age. During the student protests on the Harvard campus in 1969, he split with most senior faculty members and joined with a younger group more sympathetic to the protesting students. In 1975, he resigned from Harvard, where he was the Henry Lee Professor of Economics and chairman of the university's Society of Fellows, its most distinguished group of scholars. He left a year ahead of schedule, complaining that too often teachers at the graduate level did not teach and researchers did not do research.
Shortly before he resigned, he joined an internal report criticizing Harvard's economics department, which had long been regarded as among the world's best. The report said that the department had failed to adequately recruit minority faculty members, that it took an overly narrow approach in scholarship and that a "deterioration in attitudes and relationships" had occurred.
At N.Y.U., he continued to expand his work on input-output analysis and helped foreign nations adopt it. China was among the last to do so, as it intensified its industrialization in the late 1980's.
Wassily Leontief, a balletomane and connoisseur of fine wines, said he also thought of himself as a squire of Willoughby Brook in northern Vermont, where he and his family had a summer home. It was all very well to be an internationally regarded scholar, but landing a beautiful brook trout, he would say with his sly smile, was his passion.
He is survived by his wife, Estelle Helena Marks, a writer, whom he married in 1932, his daughter, Svetlana Alpers, the art historian, author, and professor of fine arts at the University of California at Berkeley, and two grandsons.

HEADLINE: New Fighting Along Border Of Ethiopia And Eritrea

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Feb. 6

 BODY:
The truce between Ethiopia and Eritrea, two former friends in the Horn of Africa, shattered today as troops in the disputed border region engaged in what both sides said was heavy fighting.
Both sides said the number of dead was high, and each blamed the other for renewing hostilities. 
 "It's a bit too early for us to give specific casualties, but they have been very heavy," said Yemane Ghevreab, a spokesman for Eritrea.
Tensions have been rising along the border area in the last several weeks, despite efforts by the United Nations, United States, Kenya and other countries to stop a war that many outside officials worry could be particularly bloody.
Since a short burst of fighting ended last June, both nations have been buying tanks and warplanes and fortifying the border with thousands of soldiers. An estimated 200,000 or more troops are on the border.
A statement from the Ethiopian Government said Eritrean soldiers attacked at dawn today along one of three fronts, known as Badme-Sheraro.
The Ethiopians said that the attack was "successfully repelled" and that they captured the town of Geza Gerlase, which they described as a "major Eritrean stronghold."
Selome Taddesse, an Ethiopian spokeswoman, said the fighting did not include air attacks. The statement said Eritrean forces suffered heavy losses.
The Eritreans said Ethiopian forces attacked them at 6 A.M., using tanks, artillery and missiles. Mr. Ghevreab said the forces of the two sides are now roughly one mile apart. He said that the attack failed to dislodge the Eritrean soldiers from their trenches but that many Ethiopians died in the attempt.
He said 60,000 troops, on both sides, are in the immediate area.
He also said that no planes were used in the fighting but that the Eritrean Government warned people living in the capital city, Asmara, and other major towns not to go outside because of fear of air raids.
Eritrea, which had been the northern region of Ethiopia, became independent in 1993 after three decades of civil war. The two nations, both considered friends of the United States, never drew a formal line through the 625 miles that separate them.
A series of disputes largely over trade and economic issues exploded last year in a fight over sovereignty of the Badme region, a rocky and sparsely populated triangle that each side claims. Hundreds of people died, including civilians, in several weeks of fighting that ended in a cease-fire brokered by the United States.
In the last two days, Ethiopia has accused Eritrea of launching an artillery attack at the same front and of bombing the town of Adigrat. Eritrea strongly denied both accusations, saying Ethiopia was looking for an excuse to begin fighting again.
The Organization of African Unity has proposed a peace plan, endorsed by the United Nations Security Council, that calls for Eritrea to withdraw its troops from the disputed border. Ethiopia has accepted the plan, but Eritrea has insisted that it will not withdraw unless outside monitors are put in place.

HEADLINE: With German Craft Rules, It's Hard Just to Get to Work

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: GUMMERSBACH, Germany

 BODY:
To read the local court's verdict last October, Werner Hund was more than just guilty. He was a "danger to the public interest," an incorrigible repeat offender who had to be stopped.
Mr. Hund, 40, is a self-employed roofer. His alleged crime: taking telephone calls at home from customers. 
 Talking on the phone is not usually illegal. But Mr. Hund was only licensed to work as a "traveling" carpenter and not as a "master" roofer. It was all right for him to walk up to a construction site and offer his services, but he was forbidden to have a fixed place of business.
Now, eight years after Mr. Hund says he did not hang out his shingle, the local authorities are about to shut him down. "They keep talking about the unemployment problem, but they're putting me out of work," he grumbled.
Mr. Hund is one of countless Germans caught up in a much broader political battle over job protection and workplace flexibility. Germany has some of the strictest work rules in Europe, which have helped produce one of the best-paid and most productive work forces in the world.
But Germany also has high labor costs and a stubbornly high unemployment rate of more than 10 percent. And competition is increasing as Europe becomes a single market with a single currency. In Spain, tens of thousands of people work in illegal sweatshops that operate with impunity.
The work rules cover more than 90 professions, and few areas are as tightly regulated as the country's skilled crafts. Those include everything from carpentry, baking and piano repair to window washing, house painting and boat building.
Most other developed countries, including the United States, set licensing standards for many professions. But in Germany the entrance barriers are higher, the rules more complex and the punishments harsher.
House painters, for instance, need to attend classes for several years, serve as apprentices and then pass a rigorous exam before receiving a coveted "meisterbrief." The classes and testing alone often cost more than $5,000, not counting the living expenses that a worker has to pay while not earning money.
While workers do not require full certification to work under the supervision of a meister, a vast majority of craft workers are either self-employed or work in small companies that do little outside hiring.
Consider the case of Simone, 34, a roofer in the town of Hagen. After working illegally for three years, she was caught by city officials last November and given a staggering fine of 80,000 marks, or about $47,000.
"This is a profession dominated by males, and I don't have any other job possibilities," said Simone, who did not want to disclose her full name in public because she is still looking for work on the sly. "The only way I could get certified would be to live in another city for at least seven months while I attended roofing classes. I can't leave my family for seven months."
Defenders of the system argue that it protects the public from shoddy work and helps finance education programs. Besides setting rigorous educational standards, master craft workers all pay dues to national associations that run technical training centers.
"We live in a time when quality is ever more important," said Hanns-Eberhard Schleyer, secretary general of the Association of German Handworkers in Bonn. "The strength of Germany is largely due to the strength of its middle-sized industry and to its skilled workers."
But others argue that the organized craft workers are simply shielding themselves from competition. "The main purpose of all this is to protect themselves," said Horst Mirbach, the author of a book on laws governing craft workers and founder of an advocacy group in Bonn called Action for Trade Freedom.
The German Government liberalized the law somewhat last year, making it easier for people to move between different crafts and lowering the requirements for certain lines of work.
But even today the rules are strict -- and tricky. Marion Beuter is an authorized piano tuner near Heidelberg. But she lives in daily fear of being caught repairing pianos, which she is not certified to do.
A potentially major battle is brewing over companies that repair personal computers, most of which never bothered to seek accreditation because the entire field was so new.
There have already been a few scuffles between traditional office-machine services and the newer computer consulting and repair companies. So far the big craft organizations have generally refrained from filing complaints, but they may not for long. "It is still very controversial," acknowledged Mr. Schleyer, of the handworkers' organization.
Meanwhile, the battles are being fought by people like Thomas Melles, an unemployed carpenter who runs a tiny advocacy group in the town of Woltersdorf called the Professional Association of Independent Craft Workers. The group's logo features a ghost carrying tools, a whimsical reference to spooking the establishment. (The German acronym for the group is BUH, pronounced boo.)
"None of us have gotten into trouble because we weren't paying taxes or because of complaints about the quality of our work," said Mr. Melles, who was ordered to stop work last fall and faces a fine of 5,000 marks, or about $3,000, each time he is caught.
Like Mr. Hund, Mr. Melles thought he had found a loophole in the rules by registering as a "traveling" tradesman. The idea dates back to the times when knife-sharpeners and handymen would ply their services door to door. A traveling tradesman can perform many jobs without being a master, but is not allowed to advertise or even keep an office.
But the distinctions have now reached hair-splitting exactitude. After lengthy deliberations, the local guild here in Gummersbach allowed Mr. Hund to paint a colorful sign on his truck but prohibited him from putting a telephone number on it.
Mr. Hund obeyed -- sort of. He put a phone number on the back of his truck, underneath another sign promoting his work as a fully authorized scaffold-builder.
After listening to witnesses and deliberating about the truck, a local court ruled last October that Mr. Hund should lose his license as a traveling roofer. "Unless the license is revoked, the public interest will be jeopardized," the court ruled.
A final decision on the license is due within the next few weeks. In the meantime, Mr. Hund is grabbing as much work as he can get.

HEADLINE: City Disposed of 41% of Repossessed Buildings, Report Finds

BYLINE: By PAUL ZIELBAUER 

 BODY:
New York City is making strides in a four-year push to restore more than 30,000 tax-foreclosed apartment buildings to private ownership and eventual rehabilitation as affordable housing, city officials said yesterday.
The number of foreclosed buildings under city control has fallen 41 percent, to 17,941 in 1998 from 30,358 in 1994, said Housing Commissioner Richard T. Roberts, citing a preliminary report by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. That is the lowest level since the city began taking over such properties in 1978, Mr. Roberts said. 
 "You will see this continual drop as we move to aggressively move this housing into private hands," he said.
Over the same period, building inspections in the city have risen more than 35 percent to 44,612 a year from 33,000 -- "a dramatic increase in productivity," Mr. Roberts said.
As a result, more buildings are now being recast into apartments for needy families, providing the city treasury with $6 million a year in property tax revenue, the report said.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani cited the statistics released yesterday as proof that Building Blocks, the city's four-year-old program to transfer control of repossessed housing, was working.
But redeveloping blighted buildings still requires more aggressive enforcement of housing codes, Mr. Giuliani said. Despite the increased number of housing-code inspections and housing-code inspectors, he acknowledged that a lack of rigorous enforcement had hindered the redevelopment of some buildings and allowed some penalty-ridden landlords to avoid paying fines.
"There are a lot of inspections being done, but the enforcement mechanisms are not taking place," Mr. Giuliani said. "That's the place where changes have to be made."
Ronay Menschel, the president of Phipps Houses, a large nonprofit housing developer in the Bronx, Queens and Manhattan, said the city deserved credit for turning over more foreclosed apartment buildings to the private sector, which includes nonprofit organizations. But the decrease in the city's backlog of such properties may also be due to the booming economy, "because property owners are able to make their payments," she said.

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In / Bloomfield, N.J.;
Commuting Convenience, Moderate-Cost Housing

BYLINE: By JERRY CHESLOW 

 BODY:
WHAT Bloomfield lacks in glitz it makes up in convenience. Bisected by the Garden State Parkway, this town of moderately priced homes just 15 miles from midtown Manhattan is a commuting corridor.
It has 10 parkway ramps over the five miles within its borders, and its two main commercial streets -- Bloomfield Avenue and Broad Street -- are six-lane Essex County roads. 
 And township officials are eagerly awaiting yet another transportation enhancement: In two years, N.J. Transit's Montclair Connection will be routed through Bloomfield directly into Penn Station, shaving 15 minutes off the current half-hour commute to Manhattan and eliminating the transfer to the PATH train at Hoboken.
 "The Montclair Connection will accelerate the revitalization of this town, with younger commuters buying the homes of senior citizens," said Mayor John A. Bukowski Jr.
According to Jay J. Baumgardner, a broker at Prudential Leo and Pica Realtors here, there are about 200 houses for sale in the township, about half as many as were on the market at the start of 1997. He added that the average time needed to sell a properly priced home was now 90 days, compared with 120 in 1996.
 The houses for sale on the Multiple Listing Service range in price from $74,000 for a 70-year-old three-bedroom as-is colonial on Newark Avenue, to $265,000 for a 26-year-old four-bedroom colonial on Evans Road. Most houses sell in the $120,000 to $170,000 range. According to Mr. Baumgardner, many of the buyers come from more congested towns in neighboring Hudson County or are from the apartments in Bloomfield itself.
 Joseph J. Pisauro, the township assessor, said Bloomfield has 4,000 rental units in apartment buildings and half again more in two-, three- and four-family houses. Rentals range from about $700 for one-bedrooms to about $1,500 for three-bedroom units.
There is one high-rise apartment complex, the two-building, 15-story, 346-unit Troy Towers on Conger Street, where rents range from about $700 for a one-bedroom to $1,500 for the most expensive two-bedroom unit, according to Mr. Baumgardner. The largest apartment complex in town is the 160-building, 816-unit Forest Hill Manor on Belleville Avenue, where rents range from $670 for a one-bedroom to $879 for a two-bedroom.
 There are about 1,000 condominium units, most of which are in four major complexes: the 391-unit Brookdale Gardens, off Broad Street; the 188-unit Whitestone Gardens on Hoover Avenue; the 111-unit Bloomfield Commons on John Street and the 68-unit Greenbrook Condominiums on Greenbrook Drive. According to Mr. Baumgardner, prices range from about $55,000 for some one-bedrooms in Whitestone to about $190,000 for some three-bedroom town-house units in Greenbrook Condominiums.
 The turnover of homes has resulted in a 10 percent increase in public-school enrollment over the last four years, according to Superintendent of Schools Thomas J. Dowd, bringing the current total of students in the school system's nine elementary schools, one middle school and Bloomfield High School to 5,600. By next year, it is projected to grow to 6,000.
Last year, the township approved a $13 million bond referendum to add 12 classrooms to the middle school and to update the other schools.
At present, the overall average class size is 23, slightly over the state average of 22. However, some classes have as many as 28 students.
 LAST June, 72 percent of the high school's 357 graduates went on to higher education. On the S.A.T., the graduating class had scored scored an average of 481 on the verbal section and 496 on the math section, compared with state averages of 495 and 511, respectively.
 The high school has six advanced-placement courses in English, calculus, biology, chemistry, physics and United States history. In addition, it has a school-to-career program for students who enter the workplace after finishing high school.
 "We recognize that not all of our seniors are college-bound," said Mr. Dowd. "So we train students in skills that will help them find and keep jobs. They learn how to fill out applications and to interview. They also are placed in one-day-a-week internships with local companies, such as Hoffmann-LaRoche, where they can get experience before entering the job market.
 Mr. Dowd said that all schools in the district had computer laboratories, and all of the classrooms are networked into the computer system of each school's library or media center.
 Computer education begins in kindergarten, where pupils are taught fine motor skills and color recognition through the computer. Most high school graduates emerge with word processing, spreadsheet and database management skills.
 Among the newer residents of Bloomfield are David F. and Sarah J. Sorensen, both of whom grew up in neighboring Nutley, and their 18-month-old son, Jack. They purchased a three-bedroom colonial on Whittle Avenue last February for $154,000.
 Like most of Bloomfield, Whittle Avenue is in transition, according to Mr. Sorensen, with young families replacing retirees. Currently, the families are split about evenly between empty-nesters and families with children, he estimated.
 "We were looking in Nutley, but we felt really poor on our housing budget," said Mr. Sorensen, a mathematics teacher at Bloomfield High School. They found that they could buy much more house for the same money across the town line. "We probably got about 30 percent more house for our money here and the neighborhood is similar," Mr. Sorensen said.
 Mrs. Sorensen works for Prudential Retirement Services in Woodbridge, a 20-minute commute made easy by the presence of parkway ramps in the township.
 The township's center is a Revolutionary War-era green where George Washington's army trained. That green is part of a 15-block historic district bounded by Montgomery, Spruce, New, Broad and State Streets. It includes the 11-acre campus of Bloomfield College, a 2,000-student private four-year institution founded in 1868; numerous large Victorian homes and the brick Church on the Green, constructed in 1797.
 According to Lucy Sant Ambrogio, the 92-year-old curator of the Bloomfield Historical Society, the cement for the church was purchased by Gen. Joseph Bloomfield for $140 after local leaders named the area in his honor. General Bloomfield went on to become the fourth governor of New Jersey.
 The township has four supermarkets and a 270-store downtown business district that is suffering from a 10 percent store vacancy rate. Councilman Tim Kane, a prime mover behind the creation of the Bloomfield Center Alliance, said that local businesses and the township have established a $50,000 fund to enhance the downtown. The public-private Alliance was formed last year.
 "We are working on more parking, street lighting, better signage and more uniform facades," Mr. Kane explained, adding that the group wanted to organize joint sale days. "We are also trying to attract a hotel chain to build a facility near the parkway or on one of our old industrial sites."
 The largest of those sites is the 14-acre former Westinghouse Electric property, which produced materials for the Manhattan project in World War II, according to Mayor Bukowski. Of the 11 buildings on the site, nine have been demolished and the other two will soon be knocked down, according to Mr. Kane.
 THE economic redevelopment plan is being drafted by the Public Advocate, a consulting firm headed by Donald R. Smartt, which is based in Verona, N.J. Mr. Smartt said that some of the improvements were as simple as moving parking meters closer together, since they were installed 30 years ago when automobiles were larger.
Other improvements will involve the demolition and replacement of existing structures such as stores that are not handicapped accessible. He also said that efforts were being made to lease a six-story commercial building at 2 Broad Street, which forms one of three anchors of the downtown. The other two are the train station and Bloomfield College.
 The building is now 95 percent empty, Mr. Smartt explained. When it was fully leased three years ago, 300 people worked there and brought considerable business to the downtown.
 Bloomfield has two county parks -- the 121-acre Brookdale Park and the 70-acre Watsessing Park -- and 55 acres of local parks, the largest of which is the 12.5-acre Memorial Park on John F. Kennedy Drive. Memorial has three tennis courts, a baseball diamond, a basketball court and a football field, all of which are lighted.
Bloomfield also has a 178,000-volume public library and two arts centers -- the Oakside-Bloomfield Cultural Center and the Westminster Theater, which is part of Bloomfield College but open to the public.
Oakside, a sprawling mansion on Belleville Avenue, was built in 1902 for David Oakes, grandson of another David Oakes, who built a woolen mill in Bloomfield in 1830.
The mansion, with its numerous gables, slate roof and extensive flower and vegetable gardens, was sold to the township by the Oakes family in 1979 for $182,000. It is now the Oakside-Bloomfield Cultural Center. The three Oakes Mill buildings, where uniforms were produced for the Union Army in the Civil War, are on Belleville Avenue near the mansion. They now house small industries.

HEADLINE: The Nation: The Short-Handed Military;
A Wisp of a Draft

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE Navy cannot put full crews aboard its warships. The Air Force has a shortage of pilots. Recruiting soldiers has become so difficult that between now and May, the Army will give $3,000 up front to any reasonably able young man or woman who enlists.
Isn't it time, then, to think about bringing back the draft? 
 Now, relax, all you draft-eligible young men (and maybe, someday, even young women) out there. It's early yet to start reviving old excuses for the draft board or packing your bags for Canada.
But a quarter century after the last conscripts mustered at boot camp, the idea of reviving the draft has gained new currency among a small group of academics, lawmakers and even military commanders.
They argue that a restoration of the draft -- perhaps as part of some wider program of compulsory national service -- would not only solve the personnel crises facing today's volunteer forces but also provide an antidote to the military's growing detachment from society.
The Army Times called for the draft last month, saying it would make up for recruiting shortfalls and insure that political leaders "would enter office understanding the military, its strengths and weaknesses, and its culture."
In a recent book about the Marines, "Making the Corps" (Scribner, 1997), Thomas E. Ricks, a Wall Street Journal reporter, argued for conscription to rectify what he regards as an ominous alienation of the military's warrior culture. He and others say it would restore to American society a sense of collective duty and sacrifice lost after the draft ended in 1973. This is the sort of sentiment behind the popularity of "Saving Private Ryan" and Tom Brokaw's new book, "The Greatest Generation."
"I think it's certainly worth considering," Capt. Thomas G. Otterbein, commander of the Navy's newest aircraft carrier, the Harry S. Truman, said when asked about the draft. "We, as a people, don't seem to have the same national ethos we used to have, where public service, whether it be military or some other aspect of it, was sort of expected."
It would take an act of Congress to restore the expired Military Selective Service Act, and that is not about to happen, given the political, social and economic forces arrayed against the idea of interrupting the fledgling careers of today's youth at a time of peace and prosperity.
Imagine, too, the debate that would have to take place about the question of women. When there was last a draft, America was a different place. The notion of conscripting women was almost unthinkable (though not entirely, since for a time during World War II, the Army worried that it might have to draft female nurses).
Today, women make up 14 percent of the military, serving in virtually all except the most combat-intensive units. In the attacks on Iraq in December, women flew jets into combat from the deck of the carrier Enterprise. Excluding women from the draft today would raise vexing questions about equality and women's role in society. "It's one thing to ask people to send their sons to battle," one Pentagon official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "Is anybody going to support sending their daughters?"
FOR this and other reasons, the overwhelming majority of the nation's uniformed leaders oppose the idea of reviving the draft on its face. Most of them are old enough to remember the malcontents that the draft foisted on the Army and, to a lesser extent, the Marine Corps. (The Air Force and Navy always had enough volunteers, many motivated by the desire to avoid being drafted into the Army or Marines.)
The uniformed leaders say today's military is better educated, better trained and better motivated than any conscripted force ever was or could be again.
Rudy De Leon, Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, said that nothing short of a national emergency would rally the public support necessary to reinstitute the draft. "The notion that the country would have a draft absent a critical problem is out of sync with our history," he said.
Through most of its history, the United States has depended on volunteers to fight its wars and keep its peace. The nation first drafted soldiers in 1861 at the beginning of the Civil War, when it faced the ultimate emergency: survival. It did not do so again until May 1917; 15 months later, the drafted ended before World War I did.
President Franklin D. Roosevelt revived the draft in 1940 -- technically the first peacetime draft, though war was imminent. A year later, only weeks before Pearl Harbor, it survived a Congressional challenge by only a single vote. After a postwar respite, the longest period of compulsory service began in 1948. It lasted 25 years, through tense times of the cold war: Korea, the Berlin airlift, the Cuban missile crisis.
President Nixon, a Republican who campaigned against the draft, let the Selective Service Act expire in 1973 during the waning months of the Vietnam War. It was Vietnam, of course, that killed the draft, but not just because the war was unpopular. The draft was widely viewed as unfair. Those with the means or the connections -- Bill Clinton, Dan Quayle -- avoided conscription. Those who didn't -- blue-collar workers, blacks -- went to the jungles.
Yet while a revival of the draft appears remote today, the question is not as academic as it might seem. By law today, as during the draft, every American male citizen or permanent resident between 18 and 25 is required to register with the Selective Service System. High compliance is insured in part by the fact that proof of draft registration is a prerequisite for Government jobs, job training or student financial aid.
Ninety-one percent of men of draft age -- more than 10 million -- are now a draft card away from military service should the need arise. (Failing to register is a Federal felony punishable by up to five years in prison and $250,000 fine, though the crime hasn't been prosecuted in years.)
In recent months, some members of Congress have mused publicly about reinstating the draft, including Senator John McCain, a prisoner of war in Vietnam and Representative Floyd D. Spence of South Carolina, the Republican chairman of the House's Armed Services Committee.
And the military's mounting personnel woes -- even at a time of force reductions -- have given the idea new seriousness. The Navy fell short of its recruiting goals last year by nearly 7,000 sailors, and the shortfall is now manifesting itself as shortages of sailors in the fleet. In the first quarter of this fiscal year, the Army fell short by 2,345 recruits, nearly 20 percent below its goal for the period, despite new ads, bonuses and an increase in college aid.
For now, the Pentagon hopes to solve the problem with raises and better retirement benefits. The services are also taking steps, some of them controversial. The Navy plans to recruit more youths who have not finished high school. The Army hopes to target the nation's growing Hispanic population, where many young men and women seem more eager to serve than non-Hispanic whites or blacks.
Adm. Jay L. Johnson, who as Chief of Naval Operations is the Navy's top officer, said that even with recruiting problems, it was "pretty tough to beat" the force he has. "Now, somebody might say, 'Yeah, O.K., Johnson, what if you can't get that force?' " he said. "If you can't get that force, then I guess we have to have another discussion."

CORRECTION-DATE: February 14, 1999, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about a debate over whether to restore the draft misstated the year in which the United States first drafted soldiers. It was 1863, not 1861. The article also referred incorrectly to a 1941 vote in Congress: it was on extending the term of draftees, not on extending the draft itself. Because of an editing error, the article also referred incorrectly to the Military Selective Service Act. While the draft has expired, the act has not, and still governs registration.

A small but dedicated group of partisans works to bring an extended form back to newspapers.

BYLINE: By Felicity Barringer

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
IF Donald C. Drake, one of the reigning masters of narrative journalism, were writing this article, he would not begin with this sentence. Mr. Drake, a writer and assistant metropolitan editor at The Philadelphia Inquirer, would craft something more like this:
"The 30 American men in the barren hotel dining room were weary from jet lag and a sleepless trans-Atlantic crossing, but it didn't matter because they were eager to get started." That is the way Mr. Drake began eight days of 1,800-word daily chapters that he wrote last fall on the quest of a group of American men for Russian and Ukrainian brides. 
 A month earlier, a reporter, Joy Powell, took six days to offer readers of The Minneapolis Star Tribune a tale of immigrant isolation, gang viciousness and murder.
Within the last few months, serial narratives -- examining a handful of people on a quest or in a crisis -- have run in newspapers like The Boston Globe and The Washington Post. In December, the venerable Associated Press, home of the terse 700-word news article, offered clients a five-part narrative serial about the harrowing rescue of some fishermen whose boat sank underneath them in the Gulf of Alaska a year ago.
Of course, there is a bit of deja vu here. Serial storytelling, the fictional variety, has been part of newspapering since Victorian times, when American readers of Charles Dickens's "Old Curiosity Shop" waited at the docks, as legend has it, calling to new arrivals, "What happened to Little Nell?" (She died.) Narrative has been central to society at least since Homer's Iliad. More recently, narrative journalism found a home in Philadelphia in the 1970's when Eugene L. Roberts Jr., The Inquirer's former editor, remade that newspaper.
The narrative series, with its close-up focus on individuals, their trials and their emotions, is gaining converts but is not welcome everywhere, according to Mr. Drake and Maxwell King, another former editor of The Inquirer. In a reference to the columnist who dominated American journalism for four decades, until the mid-1960's, Mr. King said, "Walter Lippman and the other reformers drove an awful lot of stuff off the news pages, and narrative journalism was part of it."
It has not helped, Mr. King said, that some narrative journalism is just bad. Skeptical editors, he said, "make judgments about some narrative journalism that isn't very well executed and say it isn't news."
There is another problem. As any weary panelist judging entries for a journalism award can attest, narrative journalism, as practiced from Baltimore to Seattle, demands a large chunk of a reader's time -- 20 to 30 minutes for each of four to eight installments. But in focus groups, some people say they do not have time to read newspapers.
The latest solution offered by narrative journalism's proponents is to make each piece shorter -- a 1,100-word, five-minute read -- and let the narrative run for weeks.
One prototype for this approach is a 29-day series done by Mark Bowden, a reporter at The Philadelphia Inquirer, under Mr. King's aegis. The series, "Blackhawk Down," recreated the October 1993 battle in Mogadishu, Somalia, during which two Marine helicopters were shot down and 18 American soldiers were killed.
The series was supplemented on The Inquirer's World Wide Web site with audio clips from interviews, the soldiers' own pictures and diaries and video clips from CNN and other archives. Mr. Bowden responded to questions on line.
Jennifer Musser, who produced the enhanced version of the series on the Web site, said that at its peak the series drew tens of thousands of people a day. Internet return addresses showed how the cluster of interest spread from the Philadelphia area to Fort Benning, Ga., where the Mogadishu units had been based, to the Pentagon and to other cities whose newspapers picked up the series off the news wire of Knight Ridder Inc., which owns The Inquirer.
The Inquirer made 3,000 copies of a CD-ROM containing the series and the Web site enhancements. The disks were sold, along with series reprints and a companion video.
Knight Ridder has set up a video production unit, KR Video, in Philadelphia, where producers made an hourlong program out of "Blackhawk Down." It was sold with the CD-ROM and was shown on WHYY-TV, the local public television station, last year.
"Blackhawk" is not over yet. A book of the same name by Mr. Bowden is being published next month by Grove-Atlantic. Movie rights have been sold. In April, CNN is scheduled to run an account of the battle, using Mr. Bowden's reporting. About 100 to 150 visitors a day still visit the Web site (www.blackhawk.com).
The Inquirer is showing that newspapers that publish narratives can do themselves good, economically as well as journalistically. But the very commercial success of a series like "Blackhawk Down" may make it a little suspect.
Narratives may prop up sagging circulation figures, but are they news? Or are they entertainment masquerading as news? Certainly, a narrative series, with its close-in view of events and its emphasis on emotion, informs readers in a very different way than a series that exposes official wrongdoing.
"Investigative journalists are more prosecutors than storytellers," Mr. Drake said. Serials, by contrast, are a form of soap opera. "You get the readers involved with a character, so they wonder what is going to happen," he said. "It's looking at news in a totally different way."
For whatever reason, he added, three-quarters of the editors he has met when he was invited to discuss narrative journalism have little or no interest in narrative serials.
Roy Peter Clark, who teaches at the Poynter Institute, an educational center for professional journalists in St. Petersburg, Fla., has also been proselytizing, as well as writing serials. "You could argue that all of television, including all of TV news, is a serial narrative, a story of a set of familiar characters who return and who we identify with," he said. "Newspapers have rightly reclaimed" the form.
But can those who embrace the form avoid the pitfalls of irrelevance and hokiness? Can they really hold segments to 1,100 words? Since this article (which is about 1,100 words) began with the opening sentence of Mr. Drake's serial on Russian brides, perhaps it should close with the last sentence of that series.
"Now the hard work began."

Can a computer program figure out the market? A former analyst and a mathematician are betting that theirs can.

BYLINE: By Janet Stites

 BODY:
SILICON ALLEY in New York is known for many things, but not as a hotbed for advances in computer science.
Mention genetic algorithms or artificial intelligence, common parlance among computer scientists, and eyes may very likely roll among even the most respected new- media executives in New York. In fact, an almost Luddite attitude toward hard technology seems to prevail in Silicon Alley, where Bikini.com, "the world's biggest beach party," is an example of the cutting edge. 
 On the fringes of Silicon Alley, though, can occasionally be found a company like the Intelligenesis Corporation, which was founded in early 1997 by Ben Goertzel, a mathematician, and Lisa S. Pazer, a former Wall Street economist and analyst. Intelligenesis is trying to change the way people measure business risks or make buying decisions by combining, in a software program called Webmind, elements of the Internet with artificial intelligence technology or "machine learning," by which the software can, for example, "remember" who Alan Greenspan is and why he matters.
The technology is the brainchild of Dr. Goertzel, who received his Ph.D in mathematics at age 22 from Temple University, then did research at the University of Western Australia and later taught mathematics, computer science and psychology at City University of New York.
"For a long time, I had been designing an architecture for artificial intelligence, but didn't have the machine to do it on," said Dr. Goertzel, now 32. "When I started using the World Wide Web, I realized it was a metaphor for the brain -- that the Web could be a mind."
Webmind gathers and processes what it perceives as "human intelligence" data from text documents, like news articles -- whether on the Internet or corporate networks -- to help users spot trends or make predictions. The results, which can be presented as numbers, a chart or perhaps eventually even a sentence, are meant to complement rather than replace traditional mathematical modeling -- to help analysts, in a sense, to read between the lines.
Ms. Pazer herself left off trying to outguess Mr. Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and quit Wall Street in 1993 to write a novel. But after coming across Dr. Goertzel's research on the Web, she put aside her fiction project to start Intelligenesis, which she now serves as president and chief executive.
Here is how she explains Webmind: "If you want to try to determine whether Greenspan is likely to raise interest rates, Webmind can query news archives for Greenspan's comments over the last six months. Because it understands aspects of natural language, it can give a qualitative answer by building a graph giving weight to each of his comments and showing how he reacted in the past in relation to his comments. You don't search for documents; you search for answers."
At full throttle, the software is supposed to be able to answer specific queries that depend on establishing relationships, like "How much money did the United States give to Russia in 1998?"
Ms. Pazer contends that Webmind has far-reaching applications. "The financial market is our proving ground," she said. "We can measure risk and volatility. But the technology could be used by anyone trying to evaluate risk or isolate trends." The list of potential users ranges from risk managers at insurance companies to market researchers to political strategists.
But Webmind is still in its infancy. Intelligenesis is currently testing the software with potential customers and has a demonstration for qualified users at its Web site, www.intelligenesis.net. "We have to prove to them that the technology works," Ms. Pazer said.
If they do that, Dr. Goertzel and Ms. Pazer hope to develop partnerships, supplying Webmind to financial news services or other on-line information providers, in a revenue-sharing arrangement. As the Webmind brand becomes more established, Ms. Pazer would look for such partnerships to give way to straight licensing deals.
Though the business viability of Intelligenesis's product remains to be seen, the company has attracted the involvement of some influential people.
The vice chairman, for example, is John B. Evans, a co-founder and chairman of another Alley-based company, Biztravel.com. Danny Hillis, co-founder of the supercomputer company Thinking Machines, who is now vice president of research and development in the Walt Disney Company's department of imagineering, recently joined the Intelligenesis strategic advisory board.
Among others who are watching the progress of Webmind is Alexander Chislenko, a researcher at the Media Lab at Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has followed Dr. Goertzel's work for some time, because it complements some of his own. "I think it's a credible technology, and the approach is promising," Mr. Chislenko said. He predicted that Webmind would prove valuable in modeling some parts of the financial market that other technologies cannot. But Mr. Chislenko cautioned, "No technology can predict the whole market."
Backed solely by private investors so far, Intelligenesis employs nearly 30 people, with a heavy mix of programmers trained in the social sciences -- some working from the company's office on Lower Broadway, others commuting by way of the Internet from Norway, Russia, Brazil and Australia.
Dr. Goertzel and Ms. Pazer contend that all the really significant predictions and decisions that people make are, in the end, based on human psychology. And Webmind, they say, can use artificial intelligence to translate the multitudinous outpourings of human psychology into valuable data.
"When you think about Webmind, think about being at a cocktail party," Ms. Pazer said. "Think if you could process not just the conversations you had, but all the conversations in the room."

TURBO-CAPITALISM
Winners and Losers in the Global Economy
By Edward Luttwak
290 pages. HarperCollins. $26.
By the term turbo-capitalism, Edward Luttwak means turbocharged capitalism, or the state of today's American economy, which has been "unleashed by the abolition of anti-competition laws and regulations left over from the 1930's, by the technological innovations thus allowed, by the privatization of whatever could be privatized, and by the removal of most import barriers." 
 Turbo-capitalism has been sweeping the world since the 1970's, Mr. Luttwak says, when, first in the United States and then in Britain, it replaced the controlled capitalism that had been in place since the Great Depression of the 1930's.
It has resulted from spectacular gains in productivity brought on by the computer revolution, and it has made many people very rich. But has it been a good thing for society as a whole? This is the question debated engagingly in "Turbo-Capitalism" by Mr. Luttwak, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington and the author of numerous books on military strategy.
Turbo-capitalism has worked thus far in the United States for two reasons, Mr. Luttwak argues somewhat mordantly. The first reason is the American legal system, which protects turbo-capitalism from the kind of corruption it suffered last year in Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand. The second reason is the invisible but lingering influence of Calvinism.
In what is perhaps the liveliest section of his book, Mr. Luttwak explains that three Calvinist rules shape "both everyday choices and fundamental attitudes" in American life. Rule One is for the winners and dictates that wealth is not only praiseworthy but a sign of moral achievement as well. The only catches are that you aren't allowed to enjoy it (witness the boring food in most Caribbean resorts) and that you have to give it away.
Rule Two is for the losers and, conversely to Rule One, holds that "failure is the result not of misfortune or injustice, but of divine disfavor." Rule Two "explains why the United States has never had a significant socialist party: losers blame themselves rather than the system, they hate themselves instead of resenting the winners."
As for Rule Three, it is for the non-Calvinists who reject Rule Two, "who are not paralyzed by guilt and who are too uneducated to express their resentment legally." For them "there is only one possible form of expression: to break the law, by engaging in criminal activities such as murder, armed robbery, violent assault, rape and the smoking of marijuana in pipes or home-made cigarettes." Followers of Rule Three end up in prison.
But elsewhere in the world advanced turbo-capitalism won't work so well, Mr. Luttwak predicts. That's why France and Japan have rejected it in favor of controlled capitalism. For them, he adds, economies exist to serve the needs of societies, not the other way around.
And in the United States the contradictions of turbo-capitalism are increasingly evident. Using the Microsoft Corporation as his benchmark, Mr. Luttwak says that the new high-tech titans produce much capital but relatively few new jobs. The rich get richer, but those driven out of work by the computer revolution are forced to take lower-paying service jobs. The unskilled they displace turn rationally to criminal activity like drug dealing.
The resulting strains on society include the breakdown of community, the return of poverty, an addiction to consumption, the rise of debt and a "destruction of authenticity" that is evident everywhere from medicine to sports to book publishing.
"Turbo-capitalism" is one of those books that offer the reader perspectives on practically everything, often enough an unexpected one. For instance, Mr. Luttwak argues that Russia has successfully made the transition to a market economy, that "the fat cows that yield their abundant milk in advanced economies" all began as "lean and hungry wolves . . . seizing profitable market opportunities in any way they could." As "the original entrepreneurs and investors become rich, the wolf loses its fangs, gains weight and size, grows udders."
True, some of the book's arguments are a little pat. While Mr. Luttwak's linking of unemployment and crime makes some sense, he doesn't really prove the connection. And it seems a shade far-fetched to blame the insecurities produced by American turbo-capitalism for the return of the death penalty, the movement against smoking, the disapproval of topless bathing, the prohibition of pornography and all forms of political correctness.
Still, much of what Mr. Luttwak writes makes sense, particularly his discussions of industrial policy, or government assistance of select industries ("The strongest argument for industrial policy . . . is that the government of almost every advanced country already has one"); of free trade as an ideology ("The god of the market-worshipers that celebrate the glories of turbo-capitalism is Adam Smith, but theirs is a devotion that crucially depends on not reading him"), and of the prevalence these days of central bankers who shun whatever is inflationary and worry not in the least about its opposite, "deflationary" (which "is heard as a merely technical expression, not as a powerful condemnation of over-restrictive fiscal and monetary policies that strangle growth, and which in the 1930's brought about the Great Depression, political chaos, dictatorships and war").
In the end, he offers no prescription for turbo-capitalism, merely predicts that "the wave of the future could be populism," the essence of which is always "a revolt of the less educated against elite rule, elite opinions, elite values and the elite's consensus on how government and the economy should be run."
He concludes: "As compared to the slavery of the defunct communist economies, despiriting bureaucratic socialism and the grotesque failures of nationalist economics, turbo-capitalism is materially altogether superior, and morally at least not inferior, in spite of all its corrosive effects on society, families and culture itself. Yet to accept its empire over every aspect of life, from art to sport in addition to all forms of business, cannot be the culminating achievement of human existence. Turbo-capitalism, too, shall pass."

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Leading Race He Hasn't Entered, Bush Plays It Coy

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 5

 BODY:
Forget about the Senate trial. The favorite pastime in Republican circles here is trying to decipher the intentions of a politician who is comfortably cloistered in a far-off capital: Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
While Republican Presidential wannabes are crisscrossing the country, hoping they will make a dent in the polls by declaring their intentions over and over again, Mr. Bush insists that he has not made up his mind. 
 But because Mr. Bush has a commanding lead in the early polls, his noncandidacy is dominating the race. Rivals are already ridiculing his "compassionate conservative" slogan. And many campaign strategists are frozen in place, refusing to be wooed by other contenders until they get a nod from the Governor.
Conventional wisdom has it that Mr. Bush will indeed run. But his mixed signals have left some Republicans speculating that he really does not want to be President, or drag his family through the ordeal, and may skip the race. Still others speculate that Mr. Bush decided long ago and is simply orchestrating a tantalizing waiting-for-'W' game to keep up the suspense, and put off answering hard questions about issues.
"I'm thinking through it all," Mr. Bush said in a telephone interview from Austin, where he practically boasted that he had not been keeping up with the Senate impeachment trial. "I'm going to make a very informed decision."
Mr. Bush sounded a bit surprised when a reporter told him that he had at first expected him to definitely run but now would be surprised, but not stunned, if he did not. "It sounds like you're kind of like me," he said. "You've gone from absolutely----.
"You feel one way one day and one way the next."
The speculation has stirred anew that Mr. Bush has begun summoning experts to Austin to brief him on the issues, as well as political operatives to talk about assembling a campaign.
"It's not only preparation, it's a matter of being informed," Mr. Bush explained. "My foreign affairs experience is Mexico. I want people who know a lot about foreign affairs to come down and brief me." This week, he met with many of his father's economic advisers, including Michael J. Boskin, who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bush.
The Governor sounded even more like a candidate when he spoke of how Wayne L. Berman, a Republican fund-raiser and veteran of the Bush Administration, had traveled to Austin to talk about raising money for a campaign. Would Mr. Berman be his chief money man?
"My definition of raising money is, I want a lot of main money people," Mr. Bush said. "This is going to require a big team with a lot of people. Wayne's a friend of mine."
The Governor also spoke highly of Mel Sembler, the finance chairman of the Republican Party. "Would he help?" Mr. Bush asked. "I hope so at the right time. He's a close personal friend. I've seen him socially; he's also been down to talk about 2000."
Mr. Bush did not rule out the possibility that he could amass so much in donations that he could forgo Federal subsidies and spend as much as he likes. "It's a big decision," he said.
When some close advisers of Mr. Bush came to Washington after Christmas to feel out fund-raising consultants, some Republicans speculated that they were not sanctioned by the Governor but by eager loyalists who were prodding him to run. But Mr. Bush scotched that notion. "Of course," he said when asked if he had dispatched the advisers to Washington. "It's a way to let people know I'm interested. Keep your powder dry."
All this Bush talk is unimaginably frustrating to those who already have been trudging through chicken dinners in Iowa and New Hampshire, only to see themselves dwarfed by a noncandidate.
"You get a big buildup when you're outside the arena," said former Vice President Dan Quayle, who is decidedly in the arena for 2000. "If you stay out, you're not going to have the media scrutiny and tough questions. On the other hand, in Iowa and New Hampshire, people want you to come in early and often."
With a hint of exasperation, Mr. Quayle said of the Governor: "Sooner or later he's going to have to decide."
Mr. Bush knows the waiting game cannot continue forever. "I think about the year 2000, obviously, a lot," he said. "Time is moving. There's a certain sense of anxiety among the people who hope I will run. I'm beginning to think through a timetable. I understand there's a deadline."
Asked about the deadline, the elusive Mr. Bush emerges. "I guess it's a matter of feel." Then again, the Governor said, "I need to send a signal."
But for now at least, it seems like Mr. Bush would like to keep everything the way it is now: He does not have to campaign. He does not have to do anything but be Governor. And the polls, consistently, predict that he will be the next President of the United States.

HEADLINE: To Build Savings, Cut Taxes

BYLINE: By Paul D. Coverdell and Robert G. Torricelli

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In his second State of the Union address, John Kennedy left us good advice for prosperous times. "Pleasant as it may be to bask in the warmth of recovery," he said, "the time to repair the roof is when the sun is shining." In other words, now is a good time for Americans to be building up their savings. Unfortunately, they aren't.
The nation is experiencing a savings and retirement crisis that requires immediate, bipartisan attention. One-third of Americans have no savings at all, and the next third have less than $3,000 in savings. Although baby boomers have contributed to the explosion of investment in securities, only 2 in 5 of them will have enough savings to maintain their living standard when they begin to retire in 2011. 
 Our economy remains the envy of the world. But there are troubling signs as well. Manufacturing slowed in December for the seventh straight month, dropping to its lowest level in almost eight years as global problems continued to hinder exports.
Sustained growth is directly connected to savings and investment. In 1992, the personal savings rate stood at 5.7 percent and has plummeted since, to the point where recently it dropped into negative numbers for the first time since 1933! At this rate, economists warn that net savings will drop to negative 4.5 percent in just two years. In other words, Americans will be spending not only everything they earn, but 4.5 percent of what they have yet to earn.
While working toward a solution on Social Security, Congress and the President must also explore other options for retirement savings. Only half of American workers are covered by employer pensions, and only two-thirds of thosewho have the chance to participate in a 401(k) plan do so. This leaves more than 50 million workers with no pension plan other than Social Security.
We believe that a plan with modest tax reforms would encourage saving and investment while putting Americans on the path to retirement security.
First, we propose to increase individual savings by providing a tax exemption for the first $500 in interest and dividend earnings ($250 for single people). That would be a tax savings of a modest $75 to $140 to more than 66 million Americans. Put another way, a $10,000 savings account would earn 5 percent interest tax free. Congress's Joint Economic Committee on Taxation estimates this would eliminate all taxes on savings and investments for more than 30 million Americans.
Second, we can increase investment by eliminating taxes on the first $5,000 of long-term capital gains. This would encourage low- and middle-class workers to invest, and older Americans, the largest group realizing capital gains, would benefit significantly.
Third, we need to modestly raise the threshold between the 15 percent and 28 percent income tax brackets. An increase of $10,000 for joint filers ($5,000 for single filers) would give taxpayers up to $1,300 in tax relief. Too many middle-class families have not had the option of saving because rapidly rising incomes have pushed them into higher brackets.
Taxes are at their highest level since World War II. In 1997, the median income for a two-earner family was $55,000, $22,000 of which went to pay Federal, state and local taxes. Adjusted for inflation, that is triple the burden it was in 1955. In other words, families would have had $13,000 more in annual income had the tax burden remained constant.
With the projected budget surplus, there is enough room to provide tax relief and preserve Social Security. The best way to continue expanding the economy is to return a portion of the surplus to the taxpayers, while providing incentives for them to save for retirement. We believe this proposal is a modest and progressive step to begin shoring up personal savings while keeping the United States on the path of long-term economic health.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Jet Noise Sounds Different Upstate, Three Ambitious Politicians Find

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
Many politicians have long believed that the label "too New York" -- as in City -- is the scarlet letter of state elections, suggesting all manner of evil to upstate voters, from ultra-liberalism to ultra-pushiness.
And though Senator Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat from Brooklyn, overcame the tag last year in unseating Alfonse M. D'Amato, politicians with statewide ambitions recognize that their handling of upstate-downstate conflicts can still make or break their campaigns. 
 Indeed, concerns about alienating upstate voters may help explain the responses of three New York politicians -- Mr. Schumer, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Representative Nita M. Lowey -- last week to news that the Clinton Administration wants to allow more planes to take off and land at the city's two major airports, La Guardia and Kennedy International, by ending the system of "slots," which limit how many planes can land in an hour.
Over the last two years, Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Schumer and Ms. Lowey have strongly opposed efforts to increase the number of takeoff and landing slots at La Guardia and Kennedy. But the response by the three to the Administration's proposal was muted.
What happened? The pressures of statewide politics, for one thing. Two years ago, all three were local officials with mainly local concerns. Now Mr. Schumer represents the entire state in the Senate, while Mr. Giuliani and Ms. Lowey are thinking of running for New York's other Senate seat in 2000.
Enter the polarizing issue of airline traffic. Few things are more emotional for thousands of people who live near Kennedy and La Guardia and believe that aircraft noise is already intolerably loud.
But the issue generates almost equal passions in places like Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Albany. It can cost more to fly from New York City to these cities than to London, airline service in the region can be spotty at best and many upstate companies say the high cost of air travel threatens jobs.
The answer, many upstate officials contend, is to allow more flights into important hubs like La Guardia and Kennedy, a change that could help regional and start-up carriers that want to serve upstate cities to compete with the big airlines that control that market.
In 1997, Mr. Giuliani joined Claire Shulman, the Queens Borough President, in suing the United States Department of Transportation to prevent the addition of 21 new flights a day at La Guardia. Mrs. Shulman was one of the Mayor's most prominent Democratic supporters in his 1997 re-election campaign, and the suit, which ultimately failed, certainly was well received in Queens, Brooklyn and Staten Island.
But after Mrs. Shulman predicted on Friday that the Mayor would join her in opposing the Clinton Administration's latest plan, the Mayor's aides demurred.
"We have to review this," said Deputy Mayor Randy L. Levine. "The safety of the skies is paramount and we'll look at it in that context. But we also believe we have to grow the airports." Mr. Levine declined to elaborate on why the Mayor was not prepared to denounce a plan similar to one he had opposed a year before.
But Mr. Giuliani knows a thing or two about upstate-downstate conflicts from firsthand experience. In 1994, he broke Republican Party ranks to endorse Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, a Democrat. But when Mr. Giuliani campaigned upstate for the Governor, he seemed to infuriate voters who did not want a city official, even a Republican one, telling them whom to support.
The Mayor also no doubt understands that Democrats, stealing a page from the Republican playbook, are already saying that a moderate-to-liberal Republican from New York City like Mr. Giuliani will never excite the Republicans' conservative base upstate.
But across the partisan divide, Ms. Lowey faces a similar conundrum. A Democrat from Westchester, she has been an ardent opponent of adding flights to La Guardia and Kennedy. When asked about the Clinton Administration plan on Friday, she said she did not like it, but carefully framed her response to emphasize first her concern about the upstate economy.
"We know that the upstate cities suffer the consequences of expensive and inadequate air service," she said. "And downstate communities suffer from excessive air noise and pollution. We need a solution that addresses both problems."
Ms. Lowey said she would prefer requiring large airlines, which control most of the takeoff and landing slots at La Guardia and Kennedy, to give some of their slots to regional carriers serving upstate New York. That would help competition without necessarily increasing air traffic, she said.
But that idea, which was endorsed by Mr. Schumer during last year's Senate campaign, faces fierce opposition from the major carriers, which can sell or lease those slots for up to $3 million each.
In post-election travels upstate, Mr. Schumer has emphasized that improving air service upstate is one of his priorities in the Senate. Though he did well for a Brooklyn Democrat among upstate voters last year -- winning about 45 percent of the vote -- Mr. Schumer recognizes that his re-election will be imperiled if he does not expand his support north of the city.
Asked in an interview last Monday how he would justify adding new flights at La Guardia and Kennedy to his Brooklyn constituents, Mr. Schumer recalled a floor speech by an upstate Republican in the House supporting gun control. While hunters might be inconvenienced by gun laws, the Republican had argued, they had an obligation to accept those laws to help reduce gun violence in the cities.
Similarly, Mr. Schumer said, city residents have an obligation to help their brethren upstate improve their sputtering economy.
On Friday, Mr. Schumer came close to supporting the Clinton Administration proposal, calling it "an opportunity to bring competition to upstate and under-served areas that desperately need it for economic development." But he added that before he endorsed the proposal, he wanted the Federal Department of Transportation to come up with a plan to minimize noise around the city's airports.

HEADLINE: Missile Strikes Against bin Laden Won Him Esteem in Muslim Lands, U.S. Officials Say

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER

 BODY:
Six months after the deadly bombings of two American Embassies in Africa, the counterattack against the man suspected of being the mastermind, Osama bin Laden, has failed to weaken his ability to strike again but succeeded in making him a hero in the Islamic world, senior United States and foreign officials say.
Mr. bin Laden's most potent political weapon, his violent oratory condemning the American presence in the Persian Gulf, is winning sympathy and support from North Africa to South Asia, United States officials say. That poses a growing threat to American personnel and policies abroad. 
 "This is a political movement," said a top American counterterrorism official. "We have to have a political and diplomatic strategy to attack him without aggrandizing him." But Washington lacks one, the official said.
The United States has aimed cruise missiles, covert operations and criminal investigations against Mr. bin Laden. It has arrested men believed to be his political associates. It has thwarted two of his plans to attack more American embassies, United States officials say.
But American stratagems to block his access to bank accounts, cut his connections to terrorist cells and sever his links to political supporters have not succeeded. Secure in his redoubts in Afghanistan, Mr. bin Laden could strike "at any time" against symbols of American power, the Director of Central Intelligence, George J. Tenet, told Congress last week.
"I don't think he's isolated, incommunicado or out of money," another senior counterterrorism official said. "And I don't think anything we've done has changed the minds of his true believers."
The sense that Mr. bin Laden has strong political support even among American allies abroad is shared within the State Department, the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Council.
Many officials there say their boldest counterattack on Mr. bin Laden -- firing cruise missiles at his guerrilla bases in Afghanistan and what they suspected was a chemical weapons factory in Sudan -- may have backfired.
The missiles inflicted little lasting damage but helped to make Mr. bin Laden "a revered figure" in the Islamic world, a third senior counterterrorism official said.
Mr. bin Laden receives money and political support from princes of the Saudi royal family, whose King he has vowed to depose, and from powerful people and financial institutions in Kuwait and Qatar, where there is a strong American military presence, United States officials say.
Administration officials say they are continuing to press foreign governments to arrest suspected supporters and associates of his. Secret arrests and unpublicized detentions of several suspects took place three weeks ago, officials said.
But the arrests do not always stick. Seven people detained in England and Albania at the behest of the United States have been quietly released for lack of evidence in recent weeks, officials said.
Senior American officials have argued fiercely about strategies against Mr. bin Laden. "Wanted" posters went out last month, with blood-red type reading: "This is not politics. This is MURDER."
But now a different picture is gaining force in the Islamic world.
A poster of Mr. bin Laden hangs in Pakistan's oldest and largest religious school, on the old silk route to Afghanistan. He is smiling, holding an automatic rifle. The poster calls him a holy warrior.
"Osama is a hero," Sami ul-Haq, a leading Islamic politician, who runs the religious school, said in an interview. "Every young man here wants to be like him." He said he was sending hundreds of his graduates to support Mr. bin Laden's allies in Afghanistan.
This glorified image is spreading in Pakistan, the country the United States is relying on the most to help bring Mr. bin Laden to justice. "When bin Laden speaks, he is reflecting the aspirations of the people," said Naseerullah Babar, a retired general who recently served as Pakistan's Interior Minister.
In Pakistan, "the principal reasons for bin Laden's having popular appeal are growing," said Robert B. Oakley, a former American Ambassador in Pakistan and a former State Department counterterrorism coordinator.
"People feel they have no voice," he said. "They look at a people with great wealth while they live in deep poverty. They resent the personal corruption of the Saudis" and the power of the United States.
American counterterrorism officials ruefully agree that Mr. bin Laden's oratory also rings true in Saudi Arabia.
His attacks on the Saudi royal family's repression and corruption are factually similar to State Department human rights reports and C.I.A. economic analyses. But they differ sharply in blaming the United States for shoring up the House of Saud by stationing troops in the Arabian Peninsula.
Mr. bin Laden's popular support swelled after the cruise missile attacks, American officials and allies in the region agree.
"What was served by the cruise missile attacks?" said Mohammad Siddique Kanju, the Deputy Foreign Minister of Pakistan. "You've inflated one individual to an enormous extent. Why would you want to create more like him? Such acts only help him proliferate."
Attacking Mr. bin Laden with missiles gave him the status of a state -- a nation unto himself, as an intelligence official said -- in a war with America.
"And if we make it into a war, we lose," said Mr. Oakley, the former Ambassador. "We'll swell their numbers enormously." That further increases the political threat that Mr. bin Laden presents, American officials concede.
Some officials say the United States does not yet know its enemy well enough to defeat him. The picture of Mr. bin Laden presented by the United States has been blurred by conflicting public statements at the highest levels of the Government.
On Aug. 20, when the United States destroyed a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan with cruise missiles, President Clinton's most senior national security aides said it was a secret chemical weapons factory financed by Mr. bin Laden. Those same officials later conceded that they had no definitive evidence of that.
The same day, Mr. Clinton gave a speech tying Mr. bin Laden to plots to kill the Pope and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. But those plots were carried out by people to whom Mr. bin Laden may have peripheral connections, if any, according to available evidence.
"He has been blown beyond all proportion," said Ghazi Salah el-Din, the Information Minister of Sudan, where Mr. bin Laden lived from 1992 to 1996. "I know the guy, having met him. And he's not that mighty. He's being pumped up. I can understand that in the context of trying to personify terrorism. But the United States has created a hero out of him."
American law enforcement, intelligence and national security officials are divided on some fundamental issues. For example, they disagree whether, as a Federal indictment charges, Mr. bin Laden and his adherents helped train and arm the men who killed 18 American soldiers in Somalia in 1993.
Mary Jo White, the United States Attorney in Manhattan, said, "We are confident in the allegation." But senior officials, including some who served in Somalia, say they doubt the charge, which President Clinton made hours after the cruise missile attacks.
Mr. Oakley, the United States envoy to Somalia at the time of the attack, is among the skeptics. "Nobody I've talked to, most of whom were in a good position to know, knows anything about that," he said. "We never heard anything about bin Laden."
Jonathan Howe, the retired Navy admiral who was the top United Nations official in Somalia in 1993 and is a former deputy national security adviser, shares those doubts.
"When a President makes a statement like that, there's got to be something to it," he said. "But I have no idea what it was."

HEADLINE: Kosovo Talks Offering Limited Autonomy

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: RAMBOUILLET, France, Feb. 7

 BODY:
In closely guarded talks at a 14th-century chateau here, foreign negotiators are asking the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo to accept less autonomy than they once had in exchange for protection by NATO ground troops, a lawyer advising the ethnic Albanians said today.
As the first serious business got under way at the Kosovo peace conference, with the ethnic Albanians and Serbs huddling in separate work rooms on different floors of the chateau, the shape of the agreement the negotiators are aiming for began to emerge. 
 In general, the draft accord is weaker in its political, defense and economic parameters for Kosovo than the ethnic Albanians would like. But the negotiators, led by an American diplomat, Christopher R. Hill, hope that the ethnic Albanians will accept the weaker version in exchange for the deployment of NATO troops, Paul Williams, a former State Department lawyer who is advising the 16-member ethnic Albanian delegation, said in an interview.
Mr. Williams said it appeared that by offering Kosovo less status than it had during the 1970's and 80's, the United States, Europe and Russia hoped to persuade President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to accept NATO troops on his territory.
Mr. Milosevic, who in 1989 stripped Kosovo of its autonomy within Yugoslavia and subordinated it to direct -- and repressive -- rule by Serbia, opposes foreign soldiers as peacekeepers in Kosovo. He is more likely to acquiesce if he still maintains some substantial control over Kosovo during the three-year transition period that is under discussion here, Mr. Williams said.
Mr. Williams, who advised the Bosnian Government delegation at the talks in Dayton, Ohio, that ended the war in Bosnia in 1995, said that by not insisting on a stronger status for Kosovo and risking the wrath of Mr. Milosevic, Washington appeared to be minimizing the prospects of NATO air strikes.
NATO agreed last week to bomb Serbian positions in Serbia and Kosovo if Mr. Milosevic failed to accept broad autonomy for the province, considered the birthplace of the Serbian nation, during the scheduled two weeks of talks here.
Since winning the authorization for NATO air strikes -- in which American planes would take the dominant role -- the Administration has played down the likelihood of such strikes.
Instead, it has played up the probability of a NATO-led ground force in which the United States, according to President Clinton, would deploy a much smaller contingent than European countries.
So far, Britain and France have offered about 14,000 troops for a force of about 25,000. Germany is volunteering some 3,000, and the United States 2,000 to 5,000. Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary -- the three former Soviet bloc nations who will join NATO this spring -- are expected to take part in the force.
Officials in Paris and Brussels say the peacekeepers would most likely be commanded by a British general, Sir Michael Jackson, commander of NATO's Allied Rapid Reaction Force, with a French deputy under him and an American general commanding the United States force under their orders.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright warned in a speech this weekend that failure at the talks could result in "wide-scale violence" and would jeopardize gains made in Bosnia, where American troops are the largest contingent of a NATO-led peacekeeping force that is commanded by an American.
The 11-month-old conflict in Kosovo has pitted Serbian forces against guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army, who have garnered the sympathy of much of the province's overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian population.
The Serbs are seeking to retain control over the province. The ethnic Albanians have been seeking independence, but appear willing, in exchange for NATO troops, to consider an autonomy that would lead to eventual independence.
Mr. Williams said that after reading a draft agreement dated Feb. 2, he concluded that these elements were of concern for the ethnic Albanians:
*The Serbian security police, which according to American and other foreign officials has been involved in massacres of civilians in Kosovo, would have to withdraw the bulk of its forces, but would be allowed to leave 2,500 officers in the province.
*The Yugoslav Army, which has provided crucial support to the police in the conflict, would be allowed to leave 1,500 soldiers in three garrisons to serve as guards patrolling the borders with Macedonia and Albania.
*The new 100-member legislative assembly envisioned for Kosovo would have an ethnic Albanian leader, but the speaker would be a Serb, who could prove to be inordinately obstructive to a smooth-functioning body. Another provision, intended to protect minority rights, allows a majority of legislators from a minority group in Kosovo -- for instance, the Egyptians, the Gypsies or the Serbs -- to block legislation if it was deemed of "vital interest" to Kosovo.
*Kosovo would not have a central bank and would remain dependent on Serbia to obtain foreign loans from such institutions as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. When it was autonomous in Tito's old Communist Yugoslavia, Kosovo had its own central bank, Mr. Williams said.
On the judicial front, the Feb. 2 draft accord gave far less authority than earlier drafts to the international war crimes tribunal investigating massacres and other atrocities in Kosovo, Mr. Williams said.
He said the latest version had been watered down so the parties to the accord needed only to "cooperate" with the United Nations tribunal, which is based in The Hague, the Netherlands.
To date, Mr. Milosevic's Yugoslavia has broadly refused to cooperate with the tribunal, insisting that it will try any war crimes suspects itself and refusing to hand over three Yugoslav Army officers indicted by the tribunal on charges of overseeing the massacre of 261 people outside the town of Vukovar during the Croatian war in late 1991.
The document does not address what will happen after the three-year transition period, or what Kosovo's final status might be. The ethnic Albanians have called for a referendum to be held then, but the Serbs oppose that because it would almost certainly lead to independence.
The absence of those key points might allow Mr. Milosevic to sell a Kosovo deal to his people, Mr. Williams said. The Serbs' national myth is rooted in Kosovo -- although few Serbs actually visit the impoverished province, which is home to the most treasured Serbian Orthodox monasteries and churches.
Mr. Williams said he had so far been barred from entering the chateau and working alongside his clients. He has been in touch sporadically by cellular phone, and is drafting positions on his computer at a nearby hotel.
The French Foreign Ministry had initially refused to allow the advisers to the ethnic Albanians into the chateau, but relented late today and will let three of them into the chateau on Monday, Mr. Williams said.
The other two advisers are Marshall Harris, and Morton Abramowitz, the former president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
The outside expertise is essential to the ethnic Albanian delegation, Mr. Williams said, because it does not include any lawyers and has few members with international experience.
By contrast, the Serbian delegation is headed by Ratko Markovic, an experienced Government lawyer who helped draft the 1990 Serbian constitution and is intimately familiar with the kind of legal and diplomatic maneuvering that has been a hallmark of Mr. Milosevic's rule.

HEADLINE: DEATH OF A KING: IN WASHINGTON;
Clinton Gives Condolences And a Pledge Of Support

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
President Clinton mourned the death of King Hussein of Jordan today and pledged support for Jordan's new ruler, promising to work with him to continue efforts toward a comprehensive peace settlement in the Middle East.
Mr. Clinton, in remarks here before flying to Amman with three former Presidents for King Hussein's funeral on Monday, mourned the dead monarch as the architect of modern Jordan and an indispensable peacemaker. He called him a partner, a friend and "a magnificent man." 
 "God willing, soon all will see what he saw and preached: There can be no peace, no dignity, no security for any of Abraham's children until there is peace, dignity and security for all of them," Mr. Clinton said.
It was a tribute to the King's remarks, concluding the peace talks in Wye, Md., in October, in which he said: "There has been enough destruction, enough death, enough waste, and it's time that together we occupy a place beyond ourselves, our peoples, that is worthy of them and of their sons, the descendants of the children of Abraham."
While Mr. Clinton stressed his expectations of a smooth transition of power in Amman and seamless continuity in United States-Jordan relations, Administration officials and Middle East experts cautioned that the new King faces a number of potential challenges to his authority, both internally and externally.
The greatest immediate threat is economic. Jordan has suffered through a devastating drought and a loss of public confidence in the nation's currency, the dinar.
On Saturday, Mr. Clinton announced that he would seek to accelerate delivery of a promised $300 million in United States aid to Jordan to help revive its torpid economy and to help cover the costs of steps Jordan is taking following the Israeli-Palestinian accords reached at the Wye Plantation.
Officials said that the President acted to reassure the Jordanian people and King Abdullah that the United States is prepared to help ease the nation's economic troubles and to support the new King politically.
"This is obviously a delicate time in Jordan; everybody has to realize that," Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser, said in an interview today. "Internally, I don't believe there will be serious challenges to his authority or legitimacy." Mr. Berger predicted that other members of the Hashemite royal family would loyally support the new King.
But the new King faces potential challenges from his neighbors. "He's obviously got actors on his borders that he's got to keep his eye on, most particularly Iraq," Mr. Berger said, issuing a warning to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq that the United States would act harshly against any attempt to threaten Jordan. "It would be an act of enormous recklessness for Saddam to challenge him."
Robert B. Satloff, director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said that while he expected the ascension of the new King to be smooth, Jordan moves to the world's watch list as a country whose future cannot be plotted with certainty.

HEADLINE: DEATH OF A KING: THE ROYAL WIDOW;
Once Derided, Noor Is Likely to Remain a Power at the Palace

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Feb. 7

 BODY:
For more than 20 years, she was his wife and confidante, an American-born beauty who became a Jordanian Queen. And even with the death of King Hussein, no one here is expecting Queen Noor to go away.
At age 47, she is now the honored widow of a sovereign whose family includes his 11 children, by four wives. 
 Queen Noor was at the King's side throughout his illness and is said to have been a buoying force as family members gathered around his hospital bed. And as the King lay dying, she won hearts here by venturing into the rain on Saturday evening, her head covered modestly in white chiffon, to circulate outside the hospital gates -- the widow-to-be comforting the bereaved.
It was a graceful gesture from the Queen, who has been a target of sniping in the past but whose strength and warmth have recently won her increasing affection, and who is now seen as likely to endure as an important voice behind the Jordanian throne.
"She was a Jordanian standing there with her fellow Jordanians, sharing the moment and her emotion and feeling," said Sima Bahouf, who has worked closely with the Queen since 1986.
Queen Noor was not seen in public today. She had rarely left her husband's side during his treatment for cancer over the last six months, and her confidantes said she was grieving in private.
But she is expected to be on center stage at her husband's funeral on Monday, and she won praise from Washington today as President Clinton, a good friend, called her "a daughter of America and a Queen of Jordan" who had "made two nations very proud."
The new King, Abdullah, is not Queen Noor's son. He was born to Princess Muna, the King's second wife. Queen Noor's own eldest son, Hamzeh, 18, was passed over last month when the King appointed a new heir. But in an arrangement that many here believe was a parting gift from Hussein, an enduring role for her family line was cemented today when King Abdullah designated Hamzeh as his Crown Prince.
King Hussein's widow was born Lisa Najeeb Halaby to a Christian Arab-American family and raised in Washington, D.C. She took the name Noor al-Hussein -- the light of Hussein -- when she converted to Islam and married the King on June 15, 1978.
The Queen quickly became a warm stepmother to two of the King's children, Prince Ali and Princess Haya, the children of the King and his previous wife, Queen Alia, who died in a helicopter crash in 1977.
Queen Noor and the King have had four children of their own, two boys and two girls, beginning with Prince Hamzeh, who was born in 1980.
But the Queen has not always been regarded with favor at home. A 1974 graduate of Princeton University, she has been an outspoken advocate for women's rights, economic development and environmental protection. She has been seen by some Jordanians as too ambitious, too forceful and too foreign to be Queen in what is a very conservative society.
She shocked some Jordanians several years ago when she posed for a magazine photograph with her husband on one of the King's Harley-Davidson motorcycles. More recently, during the internal palace jockeying over who would succeed the King, she was subjected to particularly harsh barbs from people close to the King's brother, Hassan, who was then the Crown Prince.
But her associates say she has tried to turn a deaf ear to criticism from people who saw her and her son as Hassan's rivals, recognizing as one of them put it, that, "If you want to attack a man in the Middle East, then the easiest target is his wife."
And in his last public statement, the angry Jan. 25 letter that dismissed Hassan as Crown Prince, the King offered an eloquent testimonial to a wife he said had been the target of baseless criticism, calling her "a Jordanian who belongs to this country with every fiber of her being."
There is no constitutional place for the King's widow within Jordan's monarchical system, but there is precedent for a powerful role. After King Hussein himself was crowned in 1952, at age 16, his mother, Queen Zein, was a major force for well over a decade, advising her son as he matured as a statesman.
Queen Noor almost certainly has more political experience than King Abdullah, a career soldier. She has served as a roving ambassador for Jordan, and was a frequent visitor to the White House at the King's side.
Well-connected Jordanians say they believe that the new King may well turn to Queen Noor as a unifying source of institutional memory and as someone who can help to solidify a royal family that otherwise might find itself divided.

HEADLINE: The Big City;
Willy Loman: Revenge Of a Nephew

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
WHEN "Death of a Salesman" opens Wednesday night, a crowd of sleek, successful people will gather on Broadway to feel very sorry for a chubby loser across the East River who wanders around babbling about Ebbets Field. It will be the 50th anniversary of a play that can be seen as a classic American tragedy -- or as a Manhattanite's revenge on Brooklyn.
Arthur Miller first encountered Willy Loman's world in the 1920's, when his parents took him across the river by limousine to visit their poor relations in Midwood. Then, when he was a teen-ager, his father's coat-making business collapsed in the Depression, and the Millers were forced to move from their spacious apartment overlooking Central Park to a small house in Midwood. 
 The young Arthur Miller was dismayed by their misfortune and by some of his relatives in Midwood, particularly his uncle Manny Newman, a loudmouthed salesman with grandiose ambitions, who took great pride in his two sons' athletic and sexual prowess. When visiting his uncle, Mr. Miller would later recall, he felt "gangling and unhandsome" and usually heard "some kind of insinuation of my entire life's probable failure."
The nephew had the last word. Mr. Miller moved back across the river and won international renown with a play about a family modeled on Uncle Manny, his two sons and his long-suffering wife. In the play, the salesman ends up envying Bernard, a nerdy teen-age friend of his sons who grows up to become a lawyer about to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
Mr. Miller wrote the play not long after the suicide of his Uncle Manny, who had long suffered from "black moods" and anxieties that "flooded him with despair," according to Mr. Miller's autobiography, "Timebends." When you read today about these fits of depression alternating with manic dreams of success, it is tempting to conclude that the real-life Willy Loman's tragedy was being born before the age of antidepressant drugs.
Of course, a biochemical abnormality is not the sort of tragic flaw that makes a classic play. Mr. Miller and his admirers have grander explanations for the death of a salesman. Willy's fate is supposed to be partly a result of his own moral failings, in particular the adulterous affair that his son is traumatized to discover. When Willy kills himself, he is haunted by the memory of his infidelity and by the fear that it ruined his son's life.
But is it plausible for one affair to cause such ruination? Mr. Miller has had his own infidelities -- he left a wife and two children to marry Marilyn Monroe, then divorced her and married another woman -- but he has survived to the contented age of 83. And when you consider Mr. Miller's recent impassioned defense of President Clinton, Willy's indiscretion hardly seems to rise to the level of a suicidal offense.
Willy's other great failing is supposed to be his deluded pursuit of the American dream, his embrace of hollow commercial values. He ends up desperately unemployed because he has no substance and no skills. At his grave, the mourners fondly recall the front stoop he built -- "He was a happy man with a bag of cement" -- as they lament his pursuit of "the wrong dreams."
"For a salesman, there is no rock bottom to the life," a neighbor says. "He don't put a bolt to a nut, he don't tell you the law, or give you medicine."
BUT why is a salesman doing anything less substantial than what a lawyer does -- or, for that matter, what a writer does? They're all basically traffickers in information who make a living by influencing people with words. Why pick on salesmen? And why imagine, during the postwar boom in white-collar employment, that Willy would be better off as a blue-collar worker building concrete stoops?
Mr. Miller's attitude resembles the old British aristocratic horror at those who work "in trade." Social and intellectual elites have traditionally tolerated lawyers and other professionals, and they've looked with kindly condescension on peasant farmers and artisans, but they've disdained money-grubbing merchants. They know how threatening the bourgeoisie's ambitions can be.
Willy Loman is not a representative figure -- most Brooklyn salesmen did quite nicely over the last half century, and few of them were ever as pathetic as Willy. But to certain Manhattanites, it may be comforting to imagine that vulgarians like him and Manny Newman are hopelessly stuck across the river.

HEADLINE: DEATH OF A KING: THE OVERVIEW;
Hussein of Jordan, Voice for Peace, Dies

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Feb. 7

 BODY:
Jordan crowned a new King today after Hussein, ruler of the Hashemite Kingdom since 1952 and a man admired around the world as a champion of peace, succumbed at age 63 to the cancer that had ravaged him in his final days.
King Hussein died as his heart failed in an Amman hospital at 11:43 A.M., 48 hours after he was flown home unconscious from a clinic in the United States. The palace said it had been his "persistent wish" to die on Jordanian soil. 
 Within two hours, in a somber yet seamless succession, the late King's eldest son, now King Abdullah II, appeared on television in his debut as Jordan's ruler to console a nation already in tears.
At the age of 37, King Abdullah, until two weeks ago an army major general and still untested in the affairs of state, became the fourth leader of this small but strategically vital, 76-year-old desert kingdom. Man in the News, A13.
"We will preserve the course that Hussein set," King Abdullah said as he announced his father's death, with an openness that is unusual in the Middle East. He promised to maintain the legacy left by King Hussein after nearly a half-century on the throne.
"Hussein was a father, a brother, to each of you, the same as he was my father," the new King said of the only leader most Jordanians have known. "Today you are my brothers and sisters, and with you I find sympathy and condolences under God."
As his Crown Prince, he appointed his half-brother Hamzeh, 18, the eldest son of Queen Noor, in a gesture that appeared intended at least in part to solidify ranks within the royal family.
It was a day of grief in Jordan, as people wept in the streets, mosques sounded with readings of sacred verses from the Koran and mourners huddled in the rain outside the hospital where the late King's body lay.
In capitals around the world, heads of state paid tribute to the wisdom, courage and humility of a man some called one of the great figures of the 20th century.
"Through good times and bad, through health and illness, he showed the power of a strong will applied to a worthy cause," President Clinton said in a statement from Washington. The President said he believed that King Hussein "will smile on us one more time" when the Middle East is finally at peace.
Hussein is to be buried on Monday on the grounds of Raghadan Palace, in Amman, among royal tombs that hold the bodies of his grandfather, King Abdullah I, Jordan's first ruler, and King Talal, who abdicated when his son Hussein was just a teen-ager.
An extraordinary array of world leaders, past and present, headed to Jordan to attend the state funeral. The group includes Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary; former Presidents Ford, Carter and Bush; Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, and a host of Arab leaders including the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat.
From Israel a delegation led by President Ezer Weizman will also include Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and two former Prime Ministers -- Shimon Peres and Yitzak Shamir -- to honor a neighbor whose most lasting leap of faith may have been the peace he forged with Israel in 1994.
During a reign that lasted nearly 47 years, King Hussein lost the West Bank and East Jerusalem in a war with Israel in 1967, and he fought off coups and assassination attempts.
But he emerged through the decades as a force for moderation in a region racked by extremism, often to the dismay of fellow Arabs appalled by the public and private overtures that finally brought peace with Israel.
Mr. Netanyahu, a sometime rival as well as a peace partner, called the late King "a courageous leader, a loyal friend, a maker of peace."
A statement by Mr. Arafat's Palestinian Authority said that with the King's death "we lost a leader of insight and enlightened thinking." And President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, the other Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel, praised the late King for his "bravery."
The passing of Hussein left Jordan in the hands of a young ruler, Abdullah, who was thrust to prominence on Jan. 25. That day, in what proved to be a brief return home after six months of cancer treatment, Hussein designated him as Crown Prince in place of his own brother, Hassan, who had held the post for 34 years. That shift brought hints of discord within the royal court, and it raised questions about whether a King Abdullah would be able to meet the challenges of leadership in a country with a troubled economy and worrying neighbors.
But in the days since, diplomats have said they have been heartened by signs of maturity from the young ruler and by his strong signals that he intends to maintain his father's commitment to a broader Middle East peace.
Today in his public appearances, King Abdullah wore a coal-black suit of mourning and a brilliant red checkered kaffiyeh headdress -- reflecting ties both to the West and to fellow Arabs that King Hussein used to help Jordan to play an outsized role.
Until his appointment as Crown Prince, he had not figured highly in speculation about which of Hussein's sons might one day assume the throne. Yet even on Saturday, as his father lay dying, Abdullah was invested by Jordan's Parliament with the full powers of the monarchy. Today he offered gestures of continuity and family unity. As he entered the chambers of Parliament, where he put his hand on the Koran and read a single-sentence oath of allegiance, he was accompanied by every other senior male member of the royal family, including his 51-year-old uncle, Prince Hassan.
In a poignant moment, the new King paused as he approached the podium, standing at attention, his back to the audience, before a full-length portrait showing his father in military dress as a young man.
The designation of Hamzeh as the new Crown Prince and heir to the throne is a departure from Hashemite tradition, in which a king should be succeeded by his eldest son. But it follows the example set by his father in 1965, when he designated Hassan as Crown Prince at a time when Abdullah was just 3 years old.
King Abdullah's son, Prince Hussein, is now only 4. But more important to the decision, Jordanian analysts said, may have been the wishes of King Hussein, who regarded Hamzeh as his favorite.
Because Crown Prince Hamzeh, unlike King Abdullah, is a son of Queen Noor, the late King's fourth and final wife, the choice will almost certainly help to bond a royal family that has sometimes displayed divided loyalties.
Palace officials said Queen Noor and all of King Hussein's children had been at his bedside at the time of his death. The King never regained consciousness since returning to Jordan on Friday from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., where doctors concluded that they could do no more in his battle against non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the form of cancer that claimed his life.
King Hussein was kept on a respirator here, the palace officials said, but progressive organ failure had already claimed his lungs, liver and remaining kidney, and finally this morning it stopped his heart and caused brain function to cease.
The Cabinet met immediately to proclaim Abdullah the King, and news of the death and the accession was announced swiftly on Jordanian television, which showed a portrait of the late King draped with the country's flag.
The news of the announcement was preceded, as is customary in the Arab world, by readings from the Koran. It was not long before King Abdullah delivered his television address, flanked by Jordanian flags and pictures of his father and of his own wife, Princess Rania.
"This is God's judgment and God's will," King Abdullah said. "God bless Hussein, the father, the brother, the commander and the man."
Even before he spoke, Jordanians had begun to pour out their grief. First scores, then hundreds of people began arriving at the locked gates of the King Hussein Medical Center, abandoning cars behind police barriers blocks away and walking through chilling rain to stand beneath the portrait of the late King.
Among the crowd, a dark-skinned woman in traditional desert dress sobbed uncontrollably, comforted by red-eyed strangers from smart urban offices. The crowds swelled, and young men pumped fists into the air, chanting: "Hussein! Hussein! Hussein!"
Across the country, all usual radio and television programming was replaced by the mournful chanting of sacred verses.
Though Jordan had been steeled for this moment for days, if not weeks, almost everyone here, from Cabinet ministers to Bedouin shepherds, appeared to be in shock.
"Until now we did not believe that he would die," said Mohammed Bahesh, 24, a hotel clerk whose work clothes were soaked through to the skin. He had been standing outside the hospital entrance for hours on the chance that he would catch a glimpse of the royal hearse leaving the closely guarded compound.
He never did. Plans to transfer the King's body to his former palace residence were deferred until Monday. The Government announced that all offices would be closed for a week of national mourning.
Official three-day mourning periods were announced, too, in Egypt and Syria -- Arab neighbors that in years past have openly called for King Hussein's overthrow.
Even now, Syria has remained a fierce critic of his peace with Israel. But its Government offered a conciliatory gesture today, announcing that a referendum scheduled for Monday, in which President Hafez al-Assad was to be elected to a fifth term in office, would be postponed for two days.
With scores of world leaders and other dignitaries heading to Jordan for the funeral, analysts of Middle Eastern affairs will be watching Arab delegations closely to see who does and who does not attend.
The Saudi delegation is to be headed by Crown Prince Abdullah. His presence will mark a fresh gesture of reconciliation toward Jordan, which angered the Saudis in 1990 by siding with Baghdad after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
Jordan has since turned its back to the Baghdad Government, but Iraq, too, said it would send a high-level representative, Vice President Taha Mohieddin Maruf. But Syria is expected to be represented at a lower level, in what would be in part a protest at the presence of the high-level Israeli delegation.

HEADLINE: STATES DECLINING TO DRAW BILLIONS IN WELFARE MONEY

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 7

 BODY:
Billions of dollars of Federal welfare money are piling up in the Treasury, unused by state officials, who won control of the money in 1996 by arguing that they knew best how to spend it for the benefit of poor people.
More than half the states failed to use the full amounts of their Federal welfare grants last year, Federal and state officials say. Data compiled by the Department of Health and Human Services show that states had an unused balance of $3 billion, out of $12 billion available in the first nine months of last year. 
 In addition, six states, including Ohio and Mississippi, passed up the opportunity to get extra Federal money from the Labor Department to help move long-term welfare recipients into jobs.
State officials said the number of people on welfare had dropped much faster than they expected, making it difficult for them to use all the Federal money they were entitled to. While a few states have been innovative, many have been slow to develop new welfare programs since responsibility shifted from the Federal Government to the states. In addition, some states are saving money for use in a recession. States can allow money to accumulate, and draw it when their needs increase.
The latest Federal data show that West Virginia, one of the poorest states in the nation, had an unspent balance of $72 million, representing 65 percent of its annual Federal grant under the new welfare program, known as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.
"We are aggressively looking for ways to use this money," said Shana K. Phares, a spokeswoman for the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources. "We are keenly aware that if we don't spend the money in a timely manner, it will be extremely tempting for Congress to take some of it back."
Under the 1996 welfare law, the Federal Government provides each state with a fixed amount of money, regardless of any changes in the number of people who qualify for assistance. Each state's annual allocation, which is to remain steady for six years, was based on Federal spending in 1994 and 1995, when welfare spending and caseloads were high. States may carry over unused Federal money from year to year but are required to spend specified amounts of state money, equal to 75 percent or 80 percent of what they spent on welfare in 1994.
Jack Tweedie, a welfare policy expert at the National Conference of State Legislatures, said, "States see the money as a reserve for a future economic downturn, but caseloads have dropped so fast that many states are building much larger reserves than they planned." The surplus, he said, could be used for social policy innovations.
The 1996 law gave states vast authority to devise programs of assistance to low-income families, but Mr. Tweedie said, "Few states have taken advantage of the flexibility they have to develop new programs; few broadened the population served."
State officials are somewhat defensive about the sums they have allowed to accumulate, and are often vague about how they will use the new resources.
Since President Clinton signed the welfare law in August 1996, the number of people on welfare has dropped 35 percent. It exceeded 12.2 million then and is below 8 million today. Reasons for the decline include an intense emphasis on work in welfare offices around the country, and a booming economy, with the lowest unemployment rate in more than 25 years.
New Jersey had a surplus of $170 million in its Federal welfare account on Sept. 30, the end of the Federal fiscal year. That represents 42 percent of its annual grant. Jacqueline Tencza, a spokeswoman for the state's Department of Human Services, said that nearly $60 million of the unused money was earmarked for administrative costs and child care.
The latest official data for New York, covering the first nine months of the last fiscal year, show a surplus of $335 million, representing 18 percent of the total awarded to New York for that period.
Connecticut, which has a low poverty rate, is in the minority, having used almost every penny of its Federal welfare grant, $267 million a year. Claudette J. Beaulieu, a spokeswoman for the state's Department of Social Services, said it had sharply increased spending on child care, to $150 million last year from $40 million in 1994.
Kansas, which receives a Federal welfare grant of $102 million a year, had an unused surplus of $89 million in June 1998, and state officials predict that the balance will be $50 million in June of this year.
"Kansas is a fiscally conservative state," said John Garlinger, a spokesman for the Kansas Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services. "We are being very prudent in how we spend this money."
Minnesota receives $268 million a year from the Federal Government for welfare programs. As of June 30, it had a surplus of more than $110 million in its Federal account.
Stephan P. Nelson, a budget analyst in the Minnesota Department of Human Services, said: "We project that our spending in the next four years will be $30 million to $40 million a year under the annual grant. We've been pretty conservative in our budgeting, so that we'll be prepared if a recession hits."
State officials said such conservatism was justified because states bore the financial risk of any economic downturn, and would have to pay most of the cost if welfare rolls increased again.
In Louisiana, another one of the nation's poorest states, officials confirmed Federal figures showing that they had more than $90 million of unspent Federal welfare money in the Federal Treasury. That is more than half of the state's annual welfare grant of $168 million.
Judy Watts, president of Agenda for Children, a child advocacy group in New Orleans, said, "A substantial portion of Louisiana's Federal welfare money is just piling up in Washington, mainly through neglect rather than the deliberate policy choices of state officials."
Vera W. Blakes, assistant secretary of the Louisiana Department of Social Services, said the state planned to use some of the money for efforts to prevent teen-age pregnancy and to help fathers find jobs, so they could pay child support.
Just as the Federal Government gave states wide discretion to run their welfare programs, some states transferred much of the decision-making authority to county officials. Colorado is one such state. It had a surplus of $61 million in its Federal welfare account, representing 59 percent of the money it was awarded in the first three quarters of the 1998 fiscal year.
"The caseloads have gone down very quickly, a little more quickly than people expected," said Dwight Eisnach, a spokesman for the Colorado Department of Human Services. Asked why the state was not using more of its Federal money, Mr. Eisnach said, "It took time for counties to get up to speed in this brave new world that we have now."
Washington State has an unspent balance of $181 million, according to the Federal Government. Kenneth Miller, the state's welfare coordinator, said that because of the declining caseload, the surplus could grow to $200 million, or nearly half of the state's annual welfare grant of $404 million.
Douglas E. Howard, the welfare director in Iowa, said he was worried about the message he had begun to hear from officials in Washington: "If you are not spending the money, you must not need it."
Don Winstead, the welfare director in Florida, said states must be allowed to "complete the job of welfare reform." If Congress reduces the Federal grants, he said, it will not only break a commitment made in 1996, but also undermine states' efforts to help people who remain on welfare.
Prof. Richard P. Nathan, director of the Rockefeller Institute of Government, a part of the State University of New York, said, "It would be short-sighted for Congress to take back any of the Federal welfare money."
The law's work requirements will become more stringent in the next three years. Presumably, the people who found work first were better equipped for the job market. But, state officials said, the people still getting welfare have fewer skills and less work experience. Many have physical or mental disabilities, some lack basic language skills and some have a history of drug abuse or have been victims of domestic violence. States will probably have to spend more on training, drug treatment and other services to prepare them for jobs.
Candace Shively, the Kansas Commissioner of Economic and Employment Support, said, "We've been blessed with a tremendous caseload reduction" -- 48 percent since 1996 -- "but our most serious work lies ahead."
After Congress overhauled the basic welfare program in 1996, it went back a year later, at President Clinton's insistence, and provided extra money for jobs. Under this Labor Department program, states must put up $1 of state money for every $2 of Federal "welfare to work" grants.
George V. Voinovich, who was Governor of Ohio at the time, turned down $44 million in such grants because, he said, they carried too many Federal rules and requirements.
Wyoming could have obtained $2.8 million from the Labor Department, but Marianne Lee, the state welfare director, said the state "did not have enough people left on our rolls" to justify an application. The number of welfare recipients in Wyoming has plunged 84 percent, to 1,821 from 11,398 in August 1996, when Mr. Clinton signed the welfare bill.
Mississippi passed up $13 million in Federal money for "welfare to work" activities. Donald R. Taylor, executive director of the Mississippi Department of Human Services, said he understood why "the disciples of dependency, the self-styled defenders of the downtrodden," would question that decision.
But, Mr. Taylor said, the state does not need the money. "We want to be a good steward of taxpayer dollars," he said. "Why would you spend Federal taxpayer dollars to solve a problem if it's being solved without the application of those dollars?"

HEADLINE: Clinging to an Ever Dearer Habit;
People of Meager Means Find Ways to Keep Smoking

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN

 BODY:
Donald Pye's ocher-tipped fingers stubbed an unfiltered Pall Mall into the ashtray he keeps clipped to his wheelchair at the Cobble Hill Health Center, a nursing home in Brooklyn.
"The President says he wants to raise the price of cigarettes another 55 cents," said Mr. Pye, who has already seen the price for a pack of Pall Malls jump to $3.60, from $2.80, in recent weeks. "He does that, I'm going to make a gang, a wheelchair gang, and we're going to go out and steal money for cigarettes." 
 It was probably an idle threat -- though one suspects that the 84-year-old Mr. Pye, a retired Army sergeant, and the fellow smoker he calls his "gun moll," Bernice Fuller, could pull off the job if they had to. But the sentiment, echoed at homeless shelters, group homes and street corners throughout the city, is genuine.
For most smokers, the recent 45-cent-a-pack increase in the wholesale price of cigarettes was an annoyance. (It was announced in November, but its full effect was not felt in retail stores until mid-January.) But for those with little money, for whom an extra $5 or $10 a week is not a trivial sum, the sudden 20-percent rise has changed the fabric of everyday life.
Nobody, of course, is forced to buy cigarettes. Smokers could always quit, and many have. One of the goals of the 55-cent Federal tax President Clinton proposed last week -- aside from raising billions of dollars in revenue -- is to cut the smoking rate by pricing many smokers out of the market. The 45-cent wholesale price increase is also seen as a deterrent by officials in the 46 states, including New York, that reached a $206 billion settlement with cigarette makers in November to compensate for the cost of treating tobacco-related illnesses. Tobacco companies raised the price to pay for the settlement.
But in places where cigarettes often serve as nerve tonic, time-killer and food substitute rolled into one, researchers have found that the habit is painfully tough to break. Elderly people, many of whom have been smoking for 50 years or more, and the mentally ill, on whom nicotine has been demonstrated to have a particularly soothing effect, are among the most stubborn smokers.
"For some of these people, the only joy they have is smoking," said Geoff Lieberman, the executive director of the Coalition of Institutionalized Aged and Disabled, an advocacy group in New York.
So instead of quitting, many are finding ways to adapt. Several people in homeless shelters and teen-agers in high schools said more smokers are selling loose cigarettes to others -- in effect, dealing to support their habits. In Cobble Hill, Ms. Fuller has given up pineapple soda, one of her few pleasures, to keep herself in Kool 100's. Heavy smokers are negotiating discounts with local shopkeepers.
For smokers on fixed incomes, the arithmetic has been particularly unforgiving.
At the start of the year, Jill F., 49, who lives at the Ivan Shapiro House, a supervised residence for mentally ill adults on West 46th Street, got a $6 increase in her monthly Supplemental Security Income benefits, to $935 from $929. The cost of maintaining her two-pack-a-day habit, however, has gone up about $30 a month since January 1998.
"I don't want to seem ungrateful," she said, "but inflation for the poor is about 100 million times what it is for the classes above it. If you live on coffee and doughnuts and cigarettes, the ratio of the price increase to what you're going to spend and eat is enormous."
Lately, Jill said, she has been devoting more and more time to the search for a $2 pack of cigarettes. (Prices of major brands like Marlboro and Camel now average about $3.30 a pack in New York City, with considerable variation.)
"Sometimes stores sell stale cigarettes, stuff they can't move," she said. "As long as it's regular 100's, I don't care about the taste. It could be made out of shredded newspaper."
Gordon S., a resident of Shapiro House who smokes three packs on a bad day, switched to Waves, a generic Japanese import, after Jill gave him one, but decided after a couple of cartons that they were too harsh and dry. Determined to find a way to stick with Camel Lights, he cozied up to his favorite retailer.
"I kind of wined and dined the guy," he said. "Now I get $2.50 a carton off the regular price; pay $30 instead of $32.50."
Mr. Pye and some of his neighbors at the Cobble Hill Health Center would be thrilled to get an extra $6 a month from the government. The state personal-needs allowance for nursing-home and adult-home residents on Medicaid has been $50 a month since 1987, when cigarettes cost about $1.50 a pack. The same $50 that once lasted a pack-a-day smoker all month now runs out after about two weeks.
But Mr. Pye, who has been smoking for 72 years and says only cigarettes allow him a night's sleep since he broke a hip, has no plans to quit. Neither does Ms. Fuller, 64, a retired sewing machine operator.
"I enjoy drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes," Ms. Fuller said. "I enjoy drinking tea with lemon and smoking cigarettes. I do without a lot of things, like pineapple soda, food that I want, just to buy cigarettes."
Both Mr. Pye and Ms. Fuller have relatives who slip them extra money. But another resident, Barbara Dorsut, 49, often finds herself sitting on the wall outside the entrance and begging for change for cigarettes.
"I try to be discreet," she said. "I don't do anything in the building."
Mr. Lieberman, whose group has been trying to increase the personal-needs allowance, said that for many elderly and, especially, mentally ill people, cigarettes are "a really critically important issue in terms of their personal needs."
But State Senator Joseph R. Holland, the chairman of the Senate Social Services Committee, said that higher cigarette prices did not make a compelling argument to increase the allowance.
"To raise it to $75 would cost the state more than $30 million a year," said Mr. Holland, a Republican from Rockland County. "I'd rather spend that $30 million on transportation for nonpublic school students. There are so many other things that we can spend that for."
The Federal Government has predicted that higher cigarette prices will put a particularly big dent in teen-age smoking. But Gary Black, a tobacco industry analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, an investment company, said such projections were too optimistic.
"Young people are very insensitive to price increases," he said. "The brand image is the most important to them, and they smoke the least number of cigarettes per week. The people who quit when the price goes up are older people."
As school let out one day late last month, Alejandro Soto, a ninth grader at Park West High School in the Hell's Kitchen or Clinton section and a smoker for 4 of his 17 years, stood in front of a delicatessen on 10th Avenue smoking a Newport and discussing economics. Higher prices mean fewer young people can afford a whole pack, which has made his friend Mike B., who sells loose cigarettes, an increasingly big man on campus.
"I'm in a couple of classes with him, and people come looking for him," Alejandro said. "They knock on the window and show him the money and he goes to the door."
Mike, a husky, taciturn 15-year-old with stylish gold-rimmed glasses and a hardened stare, confirmed that business was good. His regular price for a single cigarette went up to 30 cents, from 25, when the pack price went up, but Mike, who refused to give his full last name, said he often demanded more, and got it.
Alejandro said: "Out here it's like jail. When you don't have the money, the price goes up. If people get desperate enough, they'll pay 50 cents for a cigarette. They'll pay a dollar."
At the same time, he said, heavier smokers who buy cigarettes by the pack are selling a few here and there.
"Nobody gives you a cigarette for free anymore," he said. "I know a lot more students now that sell loosies than when it was $2.50 or $2.85. I know a lot more of these stores that sell them too, even though it's illegal."
Outside the Atlantic Avenue Armory, a homeless shelter in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, several men, who were waiting for contractors in vans to stop and offer a few hours of minimum-wage demolition or moving work, said that their habits had changed.
"The price slowed me down a lot," said Mookie Williams, 34, who recently cut back from two packs of Newports a day to less than one. "I can't buy two packs for $5 no more. I can't afford $7 or $8 for two packs of cigarettes."
But Richie Jones, 32, a pack-a-day smoker who lives part time in the shelter, said he was not quite ready to quit.
"The price has definitely put more pressure on me to stop," he said, "but I haven't done anything about it."
He will wait, he said, until the price hits $5 a pack.
"That's going to be the best thing that ever happened to America," he said. "You'll have to be crazy to smoke then."

HEADLINE: DEATH OF A KING;
Cautious King Took Risks In Straddling Two Worlds

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER

 BODY:
King Hussein of Jordan, who died yesterday at 63, successfully straddled two worlds in more than four tumultuous decades on the throne.
Cautious by instinct and habit, King Hussein took pride in his Western impulses and his Arab roots, though he acknowledged that the combination sometimes produced policies that even admirers criticized as erratic and conflicting. 
 He was the Middle East's longest-reigning ruler, but took little comfort from mere survival. Though he once said he yearned for a "hero's death" like that of Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli enemy he ultimately embraced as his "brother" and "partner in peace," King Hussein succumbed not to the fanatic's bullet but to cancer, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, which he had suffered for eight months.
His twin legacies -- peace with his neighbors, including Israel, and a fairly tolerant, stable society at home -- would be impressive in any context. But they are particularly so given the often violent politics of the Middle East and the unpromising country whose stewardship he inherited while still a teen-ager.
Personally courageous, modest and unfailingly polite, King Hussein was known for his political tolerance, pardoning even those who had tried to kill him. Though he had made war against Israel in 1967, he was the only Arab leader secure enough to kneel before Israeli families who had lost children in a terrorist attack on his soil in 1997, offering his condolences.
King Hussein spent the final months of his life working relentlessly for peace and a succession that he hoped would insure both his immediate family's control of the throne and political stability in Jordan. Less than two weeks before his death, he stunned the world by bypassing his younger brother, Prince Hassan, 51, and designating his eldest son, 37-year-old Abdullah, as heir to the throne.
In a long, bitter letter to his brother explaining his decision and publicizing a deep family rift, King Hussein assailed Prince Hassan's performance as Regent, saying his brother's palace supporters -- climbers, he called them -- had tried to "destroy Jordan" by spreading vicious gossip about his wife and children and working to divide and politicize the army. The King also suggested that Prince Hassan, his appointed heir for 34 years, had opposed Hussein's wish that his own sons succeed his brother as King.
King Hussein said the family discord had given him many sleepless nights and prompted him to intervene "from my sickbed" at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota to end the intrigues and political jockeying for power. But he complimented Prince Hassan for his "sincere efforts" and his loyal acceptance of his demotion.
The decision not only took Jordan and the United States by surprise, but it also demonstrated that King Hussein, though ailing and in pain, remained the undisputed ruler of his kingdom until the last days of his life.
 
The King's Last Grasp At a Middle East Peace
Apart from settling the succession, King Hussein's last efforts were aimed at advancing peace between the Arabs and Israel, a goal that had eluded two generations of his Hashemite family.
Drawn and pale, and made bald by four rounds of chemotherapy, he had left the Mayo Clinic last October to attend the Wye summit talks in Maryland and help President Clinton coax Israeli and Palestinian negotiators into concluding the next phase of their peace accord.
"If I had an ounce of strength, I would have done my utmost to be there and to help in any way I can," he said in an emotional, impromptu speech at the signing ceremony.
Saying there had been "enough destruction, enough death, enough waste" during the five decades of Arab-Israeli conflict, he pleaded for accommodation. "We have no right to dictate through irresponsible action or narrow-mindedness the future of our children or their children's children," the King said.
A short man who used his deep, mesmerizing voice to maximum political effect, King Hussein was to a large extent a reflection and prisoner of his geography.
The leader of a slip of land the size of South Carolina, seven-eighths of it desert, without oil or other valuable resources, he was surrounded by far more powerful nations, many of them intermittently hostile. And over two-thirds of Jordan's more than 4.5 million people are Palestinian, many of whom feel little allegiance to him, his family or their adopted country.
Commenting on King Hussein's lack of options, former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger wrote in 1979, in his book "White House Years," that the King "had the capacity neither for independent action nor for blackmail, which are the stuff of Middle Eastern politics."
Nevertheless, by charting a mostly centrist, pragmatic course and avoiding the radical passions and fashionable political trends that destabilized or toppled several other hereditary leaders in the Middle East, King Hussein created a relatively peaceful, conservative, modern country whose citizens enjoy decent government and more political freedom than those of most other Arab nations.
 
Setbacks, Then Recovery On the Diplomatic Front
His rule was notable for both bold diplomatic strokes and strategic blunders, some of them necessary, he felt, to secure his throne. Among the latter was his decision not to join the American-led coalition that forced President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to end his five-month-long occupation of Kuwait in 1991.
And in 1967 he ignored private assurances and calls for restraint by Israel in favor of joining Egypt and Syria in their war against it. This cost him half of Jerusalem and all the territory on the western side of the Jordan River, the West Bank, which his grandfather had won in the 1948-1949 war against Israel.
But after each setback, King Hussein recovered his political equilibrium and turned adversity to his advantage. Reputed among Jordanians to enjoy baraka, or God's blessing, for dodging at least 12 assassination attempts and 7 plots to overthrow him, the King ultimately accomplished what his grandfather had been unable to do: in 1994 he secured a stunning peace with Israel, which he called his reign's "crowning achievement."
In July 1994, standing on the White House lawn beside Prime Minister Rabin, King Hussein initialed an accord that technically ended the state of war between the neighboring countries. And three months later, in an emotional ceremony in his own land, he became the third Arab leader to sign a formal peace treaty with Israel.
"I have at last carried out the will of King Abdullah," he declared on the White House lawn, referring to his grandfather.
Indeed, the legacy of political pragmatism and the fate of Abdullah, Jordan's first King, strongly shaped his rule. In the summer of 1951, when he was 15, King Hussein saw his grandfather gunned down at the entrance of the silver-domed Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem.
King Hussein said another bullet had ricocheted off a medal on the uniform he had been told to wear by his grandfather, who had become a scapegoat of Arabs furious over their humiliating defeat by Israel in 1948-49 and of Palestinians angry at King Abdullah's secret meetings with Israeli leaders.
In a memoir, King Hussein said he had learned painful, important lessons from witnessing the killing of Abdullah, a "wonderful old man" and a "man of desert ways to whom I owe more than I can say."
In an interview more than 30 years later, the King said he would never forget how Abdullah's aides, his "so-called friends," had scattered in all directions "like frightened women in the night" minutes after the killing, or how they had opened political intrigues within hours.
The first rule he learned, the King said in his memoirs, was "the unimportance of death: that when you have to die, you die," a fatalism he manifested at critical moments throughout his life.
"I also saw that rulers cannot depend on their advisers to save or guide them, that they must make their own decisions and go their own way," he said in an interview in 1993.
This determination to keep his own counsel, and to be prepared to suffer the consequences of rash actions, allowed him to brush aside the savage criticism periodically directed at him by Westerners and Arabs alike.
Though he shared Abdullah's commitment to the Arab cause, the assassination reinforced his skepticism about fellow Arab rulers. And from that day on, he carried a gun or kept one within easy reach.
Finally, the assassination taught him that if he was to pursue Jordan's strategic interest by maintaining his grandfather's dialogue with Israel, such contacts had to remain secret. Even toward the end of his life, King Hussein refused to discuss details of what Israelis estimate were more than 500 hours of talks with every Israeli leader except Menachem Begin, a series of contacts that the King initiated in 1963.
 
A Crown Prince's Son, Yet Reared in Poverty
Descended from a powerful Arabian family that traced its lineage to the Muslim prophet Mohammed, Hussein ibn Talal ibn Hussein was born in Amman, Jordan, on Nov. 14, 1935, to Crown Prince Talal and Princess Zein. His family, like his country, was desperately poor. His baby sister died of pneumonia "in the bitter cold of an Amman winter," he later wrote. The family house had no heat.
Abdullah had been born and raised among the tribes of the Arabian Desert, but Hussein, in contrast, was educated at Victoria College in Alexandria, Egypt, and at Harrow and the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst in Britain.
Indeed, his Hashemite family owed much to Britain. To protect against French encroachment on British interests in Palestine, and to reward the family for leading the Great Arab Revolt against the Ottomans, who were allied to Germany, in 1916, Winston Churchill, then the Colonial Secretary, had carved Transjordan out of Syria in 1921, agreed to finance the emirate with a modest subsidy and given it to Abdullah to rule under British mandate. In 1946 Transjordan became independent. Abdullah, who never abandoned the dream of re-creating and ruling a modern Arab empire, became King and renamed his country the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.
Unlike other Arab leaders, Abdullah -- like his grandson Hussein -- quickly grasped that he would have to deal with the Zionists. Contacts between them began as early as 1926, and in 1946 Abdullah and Jewish leaders agreed informally that Jordan would not oppose establishment of a Jewish state if the Zionists supported his rule over the Arab parts of Palestine. But after war erupted in 1948, Abdullah invaded the newborn state of Israel, winning control of half of Jerusalem and the West Bank.
After Abdullah's assassination, Prince Talal, who had been treated at a Swiss clinic for schizophrenia, took the throne. When his attacks worsened, Parliament removed him, on Aug. 11, 1952, less than a month after Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt helped topple King Farouk in a military coup. Hussein, then 16, was proclaimed Jordan's King just as intense Arab nationalism was taking hold throughout the region.
King Hussein always relished physical if not political danger. As if the extraordinary challenge of sheer survival were not sufficient, he parachuted, flew stunts in his jet planes and raced high-performance cars and motorcycles across the desert (insisting in his later years on being photographed with a helmet as an example of safety to his people). Risk became second nature, "what water is to fish," he told a journalist. Compounding the risk, he chain-smoked cigarettes, a habit he tried innumerable times to break.
King Hussein himself conceded that at first he made many mistakes as ruler. "Those early years were hard for me," he said once in an interview. "I learned late."
In 1956, when Arab nationalist passions were running high and conservative monarchies like his were a constant target of coups and assault, King Hussein tried to damp growing popular unrest by dismissing Sir John Bagot Glubb, the British general who commanded Jordan's Arab Legion. He also abandoned liberal measures that he and his father had adopted, declared martial law and called out the army against his own people.
As the immediate threat to his rule receded, King Hussein gradually replaced British protectors with Americans, whose influence was growing in the Middle East as Britain's faded. According to senior Jordanian and American officials, ties between the Central Intelligence Agency and King Hussein were cemented in 1957 and 1958, when American intelligence officials learned of a coup plot involving Jordanian diplomats and warned the King.
Relations like those, an American airlift of oil in 1958 when Jordan was boycotted by Egypt, Syria and Iraq, and monthly checks from the C.I.A. helped persuade the King that Washington was a reliable ally. (The C.I.A. payments reportedly ended in 1977, when their disclosure embarrassed the King.)
 
A Costly Decision to Go To War Against Israel
King Hussein fared less well in his second crisis: the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Although Israel had urged restraint, he flew to Cairo shortly before the war to sign a defense treaty with President Nasser, despite Nasser's earlier plotting against him.
Although the King later conceded that he had known he was taking a risk by siding with Syria and Egypt, he said he had feared the fury of his people, many of them Palestinians, more than Israel. A senior Jordanian official said most Jordanians so strongly favored the war that the King's choice, in fact, was between "war and civil war."
It was a costly decision. As a result of the 1967 war, Israel controlled all of Jerusalem and the West Bank. Thousands of Palestinian refugees fled into arid Jordan, increasing the population by about half. Three-quarters of the population of Amman was now of Palestinian origin, making it the largest Palestinian city. Unlike other Arab rulers, King Hussein offered the refugees citizenship and a passport.
In 1970, Yasir Arafat and the Palestine Liberation Organization, which increasingly viewed King Hussein as vulnerable and an obstacle to its struggle, challenged the Hashemites' control of Jordan. In despair at the prospect of a civil war, the King later acknowledged, he briefly pondered abdication, as he would again during other crises. Instead, he decided to confront Mr. Arafat.
Though Mr. Arafat subsequently maintained that the Jordanian Army killed as many as 20,000 in putting down the unrest, conservative estimates put Palestinian losses at 2,000. While King Hussein had not sought that test of wills, his legitimacy was never challenged again.
 
On the Sidelines In the 1973 War
Drawn once into an Arab war with Israel, King Hussein would not be seduced a second time. Before the 1973 war, Israeli diplomats said, he cautioned Israel that Egypt and Syria were planning to fight, but his warning was discounted. And while the King sent a Jordanian armored brigade to fight alongside Syrian forces, he avoided fighting Israel along their common border, a decision that precluded the loss of still more land.
Moreover, his quiet contacts with Israel continued even during the war. According to a recent book by an Israeli journalist, Samuel Segev, Hussein secretly persuaded Israel's Chief of Staff to divert artillery fire from a hill on the Golan Heights where the King was scheduled to address the troops he had sent to help the Syrians.
King Hussein never commented publicly on accounts like those, but friends and diplomats said such disclosures by Israeli officials infuriated him.
The King paid a high political price for his 1970 assault on the P.L.O. and his de facto abstention from the 1973 war.
At a meeting in Rabat, Morocco, in 1974, the Arab League anointed the P.L.O. as the "sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people." Since Jordan was then more than half Palestinian and had ruled the West Bank between 1948 and 1967, the Arabs had decided, in effect, that he could no longer protect what amounted to his own national interests, he said in an interview a decade later.
In his fourth major crisis, the Persian Gulf war in 1991, King Hussein in effect sided with radical Arab passions in his tilt toward Saddam Hussein. He insisted at the time -- and even later -- that he had been seeking a peaceful solution and had been neutral, saying, "I took the side of peace."
But his stance infuriated Saudi Arabia and other gulf nations, not to mention Washington, whose gifts and foreign aid had helped him to survive and Jordan to prosper.
American officials understood the King's need to placate President Hussein of Iraq, given Jordan's economic dependence on Iraqi trade and the passionate pro-Iraqi stance of most Jordanians, especially Palestinians, who saw an Iraqi victory as the first step toward regaining a homeland.
But American patience snapped in February 1991 when King Hussein gave an emotional speech condemning the air strikes against Iraq as "a war against all Arabs and Muslims" aimed at "destroying all the achievements of Iraq" and placing the entire region "under foreign domination."
The King once again paid a high price. The gulf states suspended aid, costing Jordan almost a billion dollars a year, and the influx of some 300,000 more Palestinian refugees from Kuwait and elsewhere in the gulf severely strained Jordan's economy. In Washington, the King, who owned a home in Potomac, Md., that he shared with his American-born wife, became persona non grata.
 
The King Is Returned To U.S. Good Graces
In November 1992 and even more dramatically in May 1993, the King tried to repair his relations with the United States by distancing himself from Saddam Hussein, with whom he had once enjoyed the warmest of ties -- frequent visits, nighttime barbecues and deep conversations while fishing for carp.
Saying Iraqis were suffering gravely under the American-led boycott, he concluded that it was time for the Iraqis to embrace democratic government and end Mr. Hussein's dictatorial rule.
Eventually a combination of fading American memories of the gulf war, intense lobbying in Washington on the King's behalf by Israeli leaders and Jordan's strategic role as a buffer between Iraq, Syria and Israel produced warmer relations with the new Democratic Administration. On June 18, 1993, President Clinton met King Hussein at the White House for the first time.
While proud of his family's and his country's Arab heritage, King Hussein always understood the need to maintain contact with Israel.
The first meeting between the King and a succession of Israeli leaders took place in mid-1963 at the London home of his doctor when he had yet to consolidate power. Subsequent sessions were held in Paris, in tents, in desert trailers, aboard boats, on a Red Sea island, even in a Mossad safe house north of Tel Aviv. Though widely rumored among politically well connected Israelis, the meetings were almost never discussed in public.
For King Hussein, who had few illusions about the dangerous neighborhood in which he lived or the perfidy of many of his neighbors, Israel was an insurance policy against Egyptian, Syrian, Palestinian and even Iraqi ambitions. He always promised that one day he would forge a formal peace and normal relations with Israel, a goal he doggedly and often dangerously pursued throughout his rule.
At the same time, he insisted that a peace must be comprehensive, rejecting the notion that Arab nations could make separate accommodations with Israel. For that reason, he later asserted in interviews, he opposed the Camp David peace accord between Israel and Egypt in 1978 and their peace treaty the next year.
Despite his intense misgivings about Mr. Arafat's prior history and future intentions, he was among the first Arab leaders to endorse the Madrid peace talks sponsored by the Bush Administration in October 1991. He and Osama el-Baz, an adviser to President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, were influential in persuading the Palestinians to take part in the ground-breaking talks.
To encourage the effort and keep the P.L.O. under some check, he agreed to include Palestinian representatives as nominal members of the Jordanian delegation, thus defusing Israel's objections to direct negotiations with the Palestinians.
 
A First Bout of Cancer, And a Change of Focus
But the talks between Israel and its Arab enemies, which continued in Washington after the Madrid conference, dragged on inconclusively month after month. Without the knowledge of most of the officials negotiating in Washington, Prime Minister Rabin had blessed a secret effort by his Foreign Minister, Shimon Peres, to seek a breakthrough directly with the P.L.O. in Oslo. King Hussein was not informed.
Efforts to make peace between Jordan and Israel ware given unexpected impetus from a traumatic development in the summer of 1992: King Hussein was found to have cancer. At the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, he underwent surgery on his urinary tract.
In September he returned to Jordan to a tumultuous welcome. Unable to imagine their country without him, more than a million Jordanians -- then almost a third of his kingdom -- lined the roads between the airport and the capital to welcome him home, waving banners, pictures and placards, cheering, chanting and weeping.
His illness and the fervor of his welcome intensified his determination to make peace, King Hussein said shortly before the treaty with Israel was signed in 1994. While he had been "overwhelmed by the warmth, by the feelings of the people" upon his return, he said, "I felt an element of fear -- of insecurity -- about what might happen if I was not there, so I knew that I had to do everything I could, in whatever time I had left, to achieve peace and make it work."
In October 1992, Jordan and Israel agreed in writing for the first time that their common goal was a formal peace treaty within the framework of a comprehensive Arab-Israeli settlement.
But in the summer of 1993, the P.L.O. and Israel stunned the world -- and King Hussein -- by announcing that the Oslo talks had produced a peace agreement between them. The King felt shunted aside and feared that his poor country would be frozen out economically while billions of dollars poured into the West Bank and Gaza.
Still, the King ignored those concerns and welcomed the accord. On Sept. 14, a day after the Oslo agreement was made official at the White House, Jordan and Israel signed their own agenda outlining the treaty they hoped to reach.
In November, King Hussein and Foreign Minister Peres signed understandings on economic relations and other forms of cooperation at a secret meeting in Amman. And in July 1994, Israel and Jordan ended the state of war that had existed between them for nearly half a century, signing a declaration on the White House lawn that paved the way for a formal peace.
This peace came on Oct. 26, 1994, in another stirring ceremony witnessed by President Clinton at Wadi Arava, a barren strip of desert between Jordan and Israel.
"This is without a doubt my proudest accomplishment: leaving my people a legacy of peace," the King said in an interview in Nadwa Palace in Amman shortly before the ceremony.
No Arab leader was more openly upset by the assassination of Prime Minister Rabin of Israel in November 1995 than King Hussein. Traveling openly to Jerusalem for the first time since its loss to Israel in the 1967 war, he wept openly at the funeral of his former enemy, his "brother."
"It is peace that has been assassinated," King Hussein said in his tribute as Mr. Rabin's body was laid to rest under the pines and cypresses of Mount Herzl, the cemetery of Israel's military and spiritual heroes.
 
Disillusionment Grows With New Israeli Leader
When Benjamin Netanyahu became Israel's Prime Minister in 1996, King Hussein said Arab alarm over the change of government was overwrought, and expressed confidence that the election would not undermine the quest for peace.
But he grew disillusioned with Mr. Netanyahu's leadership, which in the King's view seriously eroded support for peace within Jordan. While the King was noting that he had risked domestic discontent by overtly pursuing peace, Mr. Netanyahu was authorizing expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and housing projects in East Jerusalem, and taking other measures that offered a contrary, hawkish vision.
In a severe blow to relations in September 1997, Mossad agents sought to kill a militant Islamic leader from Hamas on the streets of Amman, but failed. The bungled affair threatened King Hussein's need to balance his inclinations toward peace with Israel against his need to keep faith with his Palestinian constituents and avoid offending Arab neighbors.
By the spring of 1998, many Jordanians were openly deriding the treaty with Israel as "the King's peace," arguing that the agreement had brought them no tangible gain. Instead of getting better, the economy turned worse. The Government became less tolerant of dissent.
The sense of crisis in Iraq also made many Jordanians fear that once again they would somehow end up paying the price. But King Hussein refused to break with Mr. Netanyahu, fearing such a step would cause greater instability, which would drive away the foreign investment that his country so desperately needs.
The King's political troubles were overshadowed by illness once again in mid-1998. In July, he told his brother, Crown Prince Hassan, in a letter made public in Jordan that a new round of tests at Mayo showed that he probably had cancer of the lymph glands, which is usually fatal.
 
An Image as a Playboy Never Quite Outlived
In a radio broadcast from the Mayo Clinic in late July, King Hussein said he had undergone chemotherapy for the first time. "My general condition is excellent, my mind is clear and my morale is high," he said, departing from the traditional secrecy that prevails in most Arab capitals when rulers fall ill. "This is a new battle among the many battles and, with God's help, we will fully overcome this problem."
In more than 46 years on the throne, King Hussein had 4 wives, fathered 11 children and adopted a 12th. Besides Prince Hassan, he had another brother, Mohammed, a sister, Basma, and 15 grandchildren.
Even in his early years as King, many women were drawn to him, and vice versa. A superb dancer who loved parties, the young King quickly established a reputation as a playboy that he never fully overcame.
His first marriage, to Sherifa Dina Abdul Hamid, a Cambridge-educated intellectual and an older, distant cousin, ended after 18 months.
Ms. Hamid, a lively, independent woman who found sleepy Amman dull, had one child, a daughter. But she and King Hussein had little else in common. Though they parted amicably, she later married a Palestinian commando who had taken part in the 1970 uprising against the King.
The King's second wife was Toni Avril Gardiner, whom the King named Muna, Arabic for My Wish. The shy daughter of an English colonel at the British Embassy, Muna had little interest in politics and refused to be designated Queen. She and King Hussein had four children, including Abdullah. The marriage ended in 1972.
The King then married Alia Baha ud-Din Toukan, the daughter of a prominent Palestinian diplomat from Nablus, on the West Bank, who had settled near Amman. He and the popular Queen had two children and adopted a daughter. Alia was killed in a helicopter accident in 1977.
In 1978, King Hussein took a fourth wife, an American, Lisa Halaby, the daughter of Najeeb E. Halaby, a Texan descended from a Syrian family who headed the Federal Aviation Administration and then became chairman and chief executive officer of Pan American World Airways. The Queen is known as Noor, or Light, in Arabic. She and King Hussein have two sons, Hamzeh and Hashem, and two daughters, Iman and Rayah.
Queen Noor and the King grew particularly close during his long fight with cancer. According to family friends, she urged him to designate her son Hamzeh as heir instead of Prince Hassan. While concluding that Hamzah, who is now 18, was still too young for the job, Hussein did pass over his loyal, long-serving brother in favor of Abdullah, his eldest son, who named Hamzeh his Crown Prince yesterday.
In an interview with Life magazine shortly before his death, King Hussein said his illness had been a "bonding" experience for him and Queen Noor, with whom relations had occasionally been strained. Expressing his love for her, the King said, "It is everything."

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS;
Utah Olympic Committee's Local Interests Interwoven

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY, Feb. 7

 BODY:
K. McCoy Livingston, a bookish flower seller here who reveres history and loves to quote the English philosopher John Locke on the burdens of liberty, bumped up against the Olympics a few years back. It nearly broke him.
Livingston, known to all as Mac, discovered that one of the small chain of florist shops he manages, called the Flower Patch, was on a downtown block that had been selected as the site for a $184 million, five-star hotel being built by a member of the Salt Lake Olympic Organizing Committee, Earl Holding, in anticipation of a flood of visitors during the 2002 Winter Games. 
 Then, while fighting in court to save his shop, Livingston found in 1996 that the three local politicians who were being asked by Holding to declare the area blighted -- and thus eligible for tax-assisted redevelopment -- all had financial relationships with Holding, who is one of Utah's wealthiest men. One had borrowed money from a company controlled by Holding, and another's family had recently sold a piece of land to Holding for the hotel project, according to court documents. The third, Salt Lake's Mayor, Deedee Corradini, received more money from Holding for her 1995 mayoral campaign ($12,000) than from any other donor, court documents showed. Ms. Corradini was also a member of the organizing committee. "It was little old Flower Patch against the world -- that's what it amounted to," said Livingston's lawyer, James R. Boud.
The Flower Patch had encountered what many people here call the Web -- a seamless, often invisible network of economic and personal relationships among Utah's leaders in business and politics that quietly influences, if it doesn't quite control, much of the state's economy and civic life. Experts in local history say the roots of the Web probably go back to the Mormon pioneer days of the 1800's, when the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was isolated, persecuted and driven west looking for refuge. For generations, a distinctive economic and political culture evolved that valued cohesiveness, cooperation and an internal focus on using resources that were at hand.
These days, though, many residents, including some members of the organizing committee, say those old patterns of self-sufficiency just look like conflicts of interest. They say that while the world's attention is directed at how Salt Lake City got the Olympics, especially the payments and tuition programs for members of the International Olympic Committee, it is how the Olympic machine has worked on the local level -- how the money is spent, who profits, and who decides -- that concerns people here as much or more than the question of bribery.
Corradini and the other officials involved in the hotel lawsuit all said that their dealings with Holding had not affected their judgment on the hotel project, and a judge later ruled that no state laws were violated. But the pattern -- relationships that raise questions about objectivity -- is repeated on multiple levels on the organizing committee's 33-member board, according to court records, annual reports and Federal Securities and Exchange Commission filings.
There are board members who have bid upon and received multimillion-dollar contracts from the organizing committee, notably Holding, who also owns the Snowbasin Ski Area, where the men's and women's Olympic downhill events will be held. There are multiple layers beyond that of meshed financial interests -- businessmen who have sat on the organizing committee while at the same time sitting on each other's corporate boards.
"It's a white male patriarchal system of authority," said Tim Funk, a spokesman for the Salt Lake Impact 2002 and Beyond Coalition, a band of religious and civic groups that has fought for greater public and community representation on the organizing committee. "That system carries over into business culture and into political culture. What it does is vest power and trust in a very few people."
 
Power Structure Remains Insulated
Utah has changed dramatically in recent years, especially with the explosion of economic growth over the last decade that has brought in many newcomers and outside businesses, particularly in computer technology. But dozens of people in business and politics say that the $1.45 billion effort to build the facilities for the 2002 Winter Games has proven all over again how much the clubby, insular world of the state's past endures.
"It left me very cynical," said Livingston, who ultimately kept his flower shop, after Holding grew impatient with the prolonged delays caused by the court fight and scaled back his hotel project. "My personal strategy succeeded, but it created a great void in me as to my trust in government," Livingston said.
The hotel, which will be one of Salt Lake City's most expensive, is under construction and is expected to be the host hotel for the members of the I.O.C. during the Olympics.
In the aftermath of the scandal over payments to I.O.C. members, however, even the Web may change. An internal Salt Lake City ethics panel report scheduled for release here on Tuesday, about how the city won its Olympic bid, is also expected to address issues about the organizing committee's structure and local contracting since then. Gov. Michael O. Leavitt of Utah said last week at a news conference that the questions about bribery had created a need and an opportunity to "rethink the whole process" of how the committee worked.
Holding declined repeated requests for an interview. A spokesman, Clint W. Ensign, said that all of the organizing committee's ethics guidelines had been followed, and that Holding had recused himself from voting on any matter that affected him. A spokesman for the organizing committee, Frank Zang, also said that any contract affecting a committee member was routinely monitored and assessed for ethical violations or conflicts of interest during the bidding.
 
Members' Interests Related and Involved
But the interrelated economic interests of the committee members, whether or not they affected the work of the committee in awarding its contracts, are unquestionably real and unquestionably complicated. Figuring out who is linked to whom is like looking at a diagram of a complex football play in which everyone is in motion.
Through most of the period in which the major contracts were signed by the organizing committee, for example, G. Frank Joklik, the committee's acting president, was also chairman of a gold exploration company partly owned by Ian M. Cumming, who owns the Park City ski resort, where about 40 percent of the 2002 Winter Games will be held, according to the most recent S.E.C. filings through late last year. Two other committee members are also linked to Cumming through their employment or membership on the board of the company that owns Park City.
Joklik and another organizing committee board member, James C. Beardall, in turn were sitting on the board of directors of the First Security Corporation, whose chairman and chief executive officer, Spencer F. Eccles, is also on the organizing committee board. First Security, one of the state's largest banks, has done extensive business with the organizing committee. Eccles and Robert H. Garff, the organizing committee's chairman, in turn have had seats on the board of Intermountain Health Care, a large not-for-profit medical provider, according to the S.E.C. filings. The president of I.H.C., as it is known, also sits on the board of First Security. Last October, I.H.C. was awarded a multimillion-dollar contract to provide health and medical care for the Games.
Another member of the organizing committee's board, Alan Layton, who is president of Layton Construction Company, received a contract to oversee construction of a $24 million roof over the arena where the Olympic speed skating is to take place. Layton said that he had followed all the required ethics procedures and that he also rejected the idea that the Olympic effort was compromised by relationships between the strongest businesses in a community, as long as a policy was followed. "The board met, and I read a statement that I have not spoken to any member about the contract, and I will respect your decision," Layton said.
 
Snowbasin Resort At Center of Contention
By far the biggest controversy over the contracts and local projects has involved Holding's Snowbasin ski resort. In 1996, Federal legislation was passed -- led by Utah's Congressional delegation -- giving Holding private title to about 1,300 acres of undeveloped public forest land near his resort, in exchange for land he owns elsewhere in the state that will be transferred to public ownership. Holding also got the Federal Government to agree to build a road at taxpayer expense, with an estimated cost of $12 million to $15 million, across the newly private land. And he received a contract from the organizing committee that will pay him upwards of $13 million in compensation for using his resort during the Winter Games. Holding in turn will invest about $73 million of his money for improvements like new ski lifts to the resort's summit for the men's downhill course. He also plans to build condominiums on the newly private land after the Olympics are over.
Snowbasin's general manager, Gray Reynolds, said he believed the Olympics, and the pressure to get competition sites prepared in time, acted as a catalyst in moving ahead discussions for the land exchange that Holding and the Forest Service had been conducting for years. Reynolds, who was a senior official at the Forest Service until his retirement in 1996, testified in Congress on behalf of the land exchange. He said that the offer to come to work for Holding came only after his retirement, after more than 30 years at the agency, and that he had checked with Government ethics officials before accepting.
Several members of the organizing committee said that the Snowbasin contracts troubled them not so much because improprieties or illegalities have been exposed, but because the various agreements have created the appearance -- and, indeed, the reality -- that the Olympics will stand to make one resort vastly more valuable than it was before, in part because the new road will shorten the trip to Salt Lake City's airport, and will make one already wealthy member of the local organizing committee much richer.
"If people want to do business with the organizing committee, then they ought to get off it," said Kenneth Bullock, the executive director of the Utah League of Cities and Towns and a member of the organizing committee's board of trustees. "It's as simple as that."

HEADLINE: OLYMPICS;
Utah's Bill for the I.O.C. Could Reach $3 Million

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY, Feb. 7

 BODY:
The amount that local Olympic officials spent on travel, accommodations, meals, cash payments, tuition aid, medical treatment and extravagant gifts for members of the International Olympic Committee and their relatives during the effort to secure the 2002 Winter Games may have reached $3 million, an investigator said today.
The investigator, who has reviewed documents and received briefings about the Salt Lake City bid, said that the $3 million figure included legitimate costs for travel and accommodations in addition to the payments and gifts at the center of the Olympic bidding scandal. But it was sometimes difficult to separate legitimate air fares from suspiciously high fares, said the investigator, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
 Air fare for trips to Salt Lake City sometimes doubled or tripled in price from one trip to the next from similar places, and a round-trip ticket exceeded $10,000 in at least one instance, the investigator said.
I.O.C. members are entitled to first-class tickets for themselves and a guest while visiting bid cities. Investigators have been examining whether members benefited financially from airline tickets through several methods, such as flying coach and pocketing the difference between first class and economy class.
"It's hard to establish what is legitimate reimbursement for air fare and what is not," the investigator said.
An internal ethics panel of the Salt Lake Olympic Organizing Committee is scheduled to make public its report on the bidding for the 2002 Winter Games on Tuesday. The Salt Lake City committee has also turned over approximately 200 boxes of documents to the United States Justice Department, which is conducting a separate investigation of the bribery scandal, the investigator said.
Richard Pound, the Montreal lawyer who headed the I.O.C.'s investigation of Salt Lake City's bid, has said that $800,000 was spent on cash payments and other lavish favors for I.O.C. members. In an interview today, Pound said that $3 million may be accurate if legitimate travel and accommodation costs are included.
Also included in the lavish gift-giving, the investigator said, were jewelry and other items from local stores that ranged in value from $1,000 to $10,000.
One of the oddest budget items of the bid committee, the investigator said, was for rabbits sent to Pound. A notation showed that the rabbits had been returned, the investigator said.
Pound said that Tom Welch, the president of the Salt Lake City bid committee, had sent him a rabbit as a joke in late 1994. The rabbit arrived after Pound said that Quebec was gaining in the race for the 2002 Winter Games and that Salt Lake City might not have any more rabbits to pull out of its hat after failing to secure the 1998 Winter Games.
"Some guy showed up at the door with a rabbit and I said, 'Very funny, take it away,' " Pound recalled.
The Salt Lake City Games are scheduled to begin three years from Monday, on Feb. 8, 2002.
In other developments today, officials of the United States Olympic Committee said they expected the Salt Lake City report would detail the business arrangement between Welch and Alfredo La Mont, who resigned last month as the United States Olympic Committee's director of international relations.
A member of the Salt Lake City bid committee, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that Welch had paid La Mont approximately $30,000, including a $10,000 bonus, for information on I.O.C. members from South America, through a company of La Mont's called Citius. La Mont has declined comment.
Also, Anita DeFrantz, an I.O.C. vice president from Los Angeles, said that she spoke to the former athletic director at the University of Southern California in the early 1990's, while Salt Lake City was bidding on the 2002 Winter Games, and asked him to consider an application for the tennis-playing daughter of a fellow I.O.C. member from Hungary named Pal Schmitt.
Both DeFrantz and Schmitt are members of the I.O.C.'s 11-member executive board. Petra Schmitt attended Southern Cal from 1992 to 1995 and was a two-time all-American.
Mike McGee, the former athletic director at U.S.C. who is now at South Carolina, said it was possible that DeFrantz called him, but that his recollection was unclear. If she had made a request, McGee said, he would have referred it to the U.S.C. tennis coach. The Schmitts could not be reached for comment.
DeFrantz, who has close contacts with U.S.C. from the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympics and as president of the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles, which gives grants for youth-related sports activities, said that the recommendation had nothing to do with swaying the elder Schmitt's vote toward Salt Lake City.
"Saying, 'Here's somebody interesting to look at,' is O.K.," DeFrantz said. "Paying for them is not O.K. She had to get into school on her own, like every other kid."
Intervening on behalf of a foreign student at an American school during Salt Lake City's bid is one of the reasons why Kim Un Yong, a powerful I.O.C. member from South Korea, remains under investigation by a commission headed by Pound. Today, however, Pound said he did not find anything troubling about DeFrantz's recommendation. He writes about 30 letters of recommendation a year himself, Pound said.
"One of your functions in life as you get older is to be a referee," Pound said.
DeFrantz said she made perhaps a dozen visits to Salt Lake City while other I.O.C. members visited, or spoke to them by telephone, as part of her job to support the bid. But DeFrantz said she never knew that the bid committee was paying for such things as scholarships and medical treatment for I.O.C. members.
Privately, investigators and Salt Lake City Olympic officials have wondered how DeFrantz could have been in such frequent contact with fellow I.O.C. members and not been aware of improper payments.
"If I had known, I would have reported it," she said.
She said she met the sons of I.O.C. members while they were traveling with their fathers, but could not recall whether she knew that several of them were attending American schools on scholarship.
"It was never told to me that the organizing committee or bid committee was funding their education," DeFrantz said.
During the bid process, DeFrantz said, she made periodic calls to Dave Johnson, who headed international relations for Salt Lake City's bid, asking whether her fellow I.O.C. members had made any requests for improper favors.
"I was worried about that," DeFrantz said. "There had been rumors from other bids."
Asked if Johnson told her of any improprieties, DeFrantz said: "Not that comes to mind. Certainly nothing of the sort that has come out." She added, "They wouldn't be going through this if they were candid with me."
Johnson, who resigned from the Salt Lake City organizing committee last month, has declined to speak to reporters.
DeFrantz said she knew that Jean-Claude Ganga, an I.O.C. member from the Congo Republic, had received medical treatment but assumed he had paid for it with his I.O.C. insurance. Ganga was expelled from the I.O.C. last month after Pound's commission determined that he had received $216,000 in illicit payments from the Salt Lake City bid committee.
Last fall, DeFrantz said, she declined a request from an I.O.C. member from the West African nation of Mali who had been seeking a graduate school scholarship for his son. She said she told the I.O.C. member, Lamine Keita, that she could not help him and said that she may have sent a letter of alert to La Mont in case the request was later deemed improper. Keita has been expelled for receiving $97,000 from the Salt Lake City bid committee for his son to attend Howard University. Keita said he asked DeFrantz only for general information.
"I pride myself on my integrity," said DeFrantz, who won a bronze medal in rowing at the 1976 Summer Olympics. "It's just not my nature to step across ethical lines."

Seattle Times Decides To Publish in Morning

BYLINE: By ALEX KUCZYNSKI

 BODY:
Seattle, a city where business warfare tends to be in the high-technology sector, is girding itself for a newspaper war, one that could make economic winners out of both the winner and the loser. In an agreement announced last week, The Seattle Times, an afternoon paper, said it expected to switch to morning publication, going head to head with The Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
The afternoon Times already outpaces The Post-Intelligencer in daily circulation, 228,000 to 196,000 -- no mean feat, given that the rise of television news adversely affected evening papers more than morning ones. The two newsrooms are competitive on beats from crime to aviation. The Times' reporters have received more recognition, winning three Pulitzer Prizes since 1990. 
 David Brewster, who founded The Seattle Weekly, said that The Post-Intelligencer boasts Seattle's leading sports columnist and "has done better at breaking news" -- a contention that Frank A. Blethen, The Times's publisher, said was "a totally bad rap."
Since 1983, the newspapers have been part of a joint operating agreement -- an arrangement common in the industry, in which separate papers in a city collaborate on many business and production operations to save money. The family of Alden Blethen, who bought The Times in 1896, owns 51 percent of that newspaper; Knight Ridder owns 49 percent. The Times runs the joint business operation and gets 68 percent of the profits. The Hearst Corporation, owner of The Post-Intelligencer, gets the remaining 32 percent. (They publish jointly on Sundays.)
A major expense was looming, however. Traffic congestion was making it harder for The Times, printed north of the city, to reach subscribers in the south. New presses south of Seattle would cost $150 million, Mr. Blethen said, and would cut into everyone's profits.
With careful scheduling, the four presses in the plant to the north could print both newspapers overnight.
Mr. Blethen also noted that the newspapers face competition from The Everett Herald (owned by the Washington Post Company) in the north and The Tacoma News-Tribune (owned by McClatchy Newspapers Inc.) in the south, and that the Seattle newspapers can better compete by publishing in the morning.
So the parent companies have asked the Justice Department to allow morning publication of The Times within two years. Hearst's share of the profits would increase to 40 percent and it would have the first right to buy The Times.
"It's being characterized as a good old-fashioned newspaper war," Mr. Brewster said. "But the P-I goes to battle with civil war rifles."
The agreement also permits The Post-Intelligencer to provide breaking news on its Internet site.

HEADLINE: Ringling Goes Upscale Under the Little Top;
After 42 Years, a Tent Again, but Just One Ring

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

DATELINE: SARASOTA, Fla.

 BODY:
Clowns wept. The ringmaster actually sobbed. A thousand roustabouts, aerialists and equestrians began looking for work. When "The Greatest Show on Earth" played under canvas for the final time on July 16, 1956, it was a front-page story in newspapers across the land, including this one.
But here in the city that was its winter home from 1927 to 1959, the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus has raised its tent for the first time in 42 years. 
 In a parking lot at the Sarasota Fairgrounds right off Ringling Drive, flameproof polyvinyl has superseded canvas. Traditional circus fare like popcorn and cotton candy will be supplemented by designer sandwiches and cappuccino. And the new show will be performed in but one 38-foot-wide circus ring.
This is not intended to replace the three-ring extravaganza that shed its tents and began performing in air-conditioned arenas after the circus regrouped in 1957. The year before, the tented show was a victim of television, red ink, labor difficulties and bad weather.
And instead of being the greatest show on earth, the new show will qualify as one of the coziest: an intimate, upscale circus in a million-dollar custom-made Italian tent, tentatively titled "Barnum's Kaleidoscape: The Magical One-Ring Experience From Ringling Brothers." Previews begin here on Feb. 26.
"This is not a sure thing," said Greg Parkinson, a circus historian who is the executive director of the Circus World Museum in Baraboo, Wis. "In a tent of this size they'll have to have a high percentage of sales to break even. And there will be competitors."
One of them, Paul Binder, the founder and artistic director of the Big Apple Circus, warned that "the economics of a one-ring tent are tight and very nasty." Nevertheless, Mr. Parkinson said, "it's a historic moment for this circus, given the words of John Ringling North," referring to the legendary 1956 statement by Mr. North, then the show's president and board chairman, from his private railroad car that "the tented circus as it now exists is in my opinion a thing of the past."
Paraphrasing those words, Kenneth Feld, Ringling's producer and chief executive, said that for his show, "tented entertainments will be a thing of the future." He added: "Ringling's statement was valid in its time, but the tent now gives us the ability to practically deliver circus to the door of people who ordinarily can't, or won't, come to arenas. We want to reach new suburban and exurban communities."
But Ringling also seems to be trying to capitalize on the growing audience for one-ring circuses, "a large market as demonstrated by the popularity of the Cirque du Soleil and the Big Apple Circus," said Mr. Parkinson. Mr. Feld acknowledged that "it's hard to say that we've ignored Cirque du Soleil," adding, "If a market is out there, we feel we should get more of our fair share."
Mr. Feld estimated the new show's initial production cost at $8 million, but several circus veterans put it closer to $10 million.
It is quite a gamble.
"It's scary to put such a big bet on the power of circus to move people in an era of virtual entertainment," said Tim Holst, the Ringling vice president for talent and production.
Another risk is that the new show could cannibalize demand for Ringling's traditional three-ring extravaganza, which will continue to crisscross the country with its two separate touring units. "We see the shows as complementary," said Mr. Feld, "and we think the new circus will augment our basic business," which brought revenues of $500 million last year into his privately held company.
 
'Balsamic Vinegar Of Circus'
In 1872 P. T. Barnum's circus went to two rings. (His three rings came along in 1881; the Barnum and Ringling troupes became a single show in 1919.) "In the 1920's Ringling had five rings," Mr. Parkinson said, adding that with the new show Ringling was trying to upgrade the circus in a different way, countering negative preconceptions about "the traditional carnival or tent show."
Or as Mr. Holst said, "We want this show to be the balsamic vinegar of circus."
And so "Kaleidoscape" is attempting to lure an affluent audience of mall mavens into its new champagne-colored tent with its red stars and stripes, free of obstructed views and offering the comforts of roomy crushed-velvet padded seats with backs. To protect audience members' shoes from mud, the tent will have red-carpeted hardwood flooring. The traditionally seedy, disheveled carnival ticket takers and part-time ushers will be replaced by fresh-faced, costumed full-timers who will travel with the show.
And because market research showed that ticket holders at artsy tent circuses are dismayed by the porta-potty experience, Ringling has designed two sleek bathroom trailers that will be staffed with attendants.
Mr. Feld said he would be targeting 30-year-old parents who were more affluent than the typical audience at its mass-market three-ring shows. Mr. Feld estimated that premiere "couch" seating would be in the $40 range, and other ticket prices would average in the mid-$20 area. (At the three-ring show in Manhattan, most tickets cost $10 to $22.)
It was to Sarasota that the silver 80-car Ringling train -- forever dubbed by circus folk "the funeral train" -- returned 42 years ago with its folded tent and grieving cargo of circus veterans after ending its annual run four months early.
But these days an international company of 48 performers is rehearsing the new tent's 2-hour 15-minute show with an 8-member live band, inhabiting highly stylized red-and-gold Art Deco-ish sets. The show is a potpourri of trapeze flyers, acrobats, variety performers and animals that include 27 geese, 10 horses, 4 ducks and 2 foxes.
"This is an all-star show, and we hope it will create a sensation in the world of the circus," said Alex Petrov, a 26-year-old second-generation wire walker.
The intimacy of the single ring, said Mr. Parkinson, the historian, "enables audiences to focus on one act at a time, and to better identify with performers who are human beings doing extraordinary things."
"For two hours we want to throw a party for the audience," said Raffaele DeRitis, 32, the show's Italian director, who has created circuses, theatrical productions, operas and magic shows in Europe. The show is a narrative that introduces the audience to a group of "ordinary" people who become performers in the ring before the ticket holders' eyes. They appear again as ordinary people who bid them farewell after the show's finale. "And we want to encourage the audience to wonder about what happens behind the scenes, to imagine the characters in the show, their romances and their hatreds."
"Barnum's Kaleidoscape" was coined by Mr. Feld, 50, a kaleidoscope collector who wanted to build a quirky show about a circus that was a tribute to P. T. Barnum. The name is also a reference to "an escape from everyday reality," Mr. Feld said.
David Larible, 41, the new show's featured performer, said, "The audience will get to meet me as a person, before the show, then witness my transformation to David the Clown in the ring." Mr. Labrible has spent eight years as the star clown on the Ringling Red Unit, one of the circus's two touring shows that crisscross the country and arrives at Madison Square Garden, site of its traditional opening night, on March 26.
Oddly, the new show is "a breakthrough for a generation of seasoned American circus people who have never performed in a tent, or even a one-ring circus, like me," said Jon Weiss, 36, a former clown and juggler who spent seven years being shot from a Ringling cannon: always in an arena. He is now not only a manager of the show but also will play himself, as the Manager.
One creator of the new show is a living link to the old tent. In 1955, as an 11-year-old in Butte, Mont., Brian Liddicoat, now the show's general manager, was hired with dozens of other boys as a day laborer to help put up the 12,000-seat, three-ring Ringling tent in Stodden Park.
His fee? "A free pass to see the show," he said with a laugh. "I'll never forget how thrilling it was to be part of that."
After its Sarasota debut the circus will head to Austin, Tex., and then to Irvine Meadows in California. If it proves to be a critical and financial success, Ringling hopes to recreate it around the country and abroad.
 
Competitor Offers Hopes for Success
As modest, traditional one-ring shows still tour about the country, Ringling's largest competitor in the tented world was magnanimous toward the interloper. "We wish them a lot of luck, and we respect them as serious people," said Jean David, vice president for marketing at Cirque du Soleil, which has become the worldwide one-ring phenomenon to which Ringling aspires. "But you know, I think Cirque du Soleil competes more with 'The Phantom of the Opera' than with other circuses."
But a smaller competitor was less sanguine about the increased competition. "My sense is that Ringling will borrow more from us than from the Cirque du Soleil, and that Kenneth's show will appeal more to family audiences, like our show does," said Mr. Binder of the Big Apple Circus, which began in 1977 in Manhattan.
"If Kenneth decides he wants to come into our markets, there will be a competitive situation," Mr. Binder added. "Audiences will have to decide, 'Which one do I go to?' "
If Cirque du Soleil provides Ringling with a business model for one-ring success, it has demonstrated that the rewards can be immense. Since 1984 more than 18 million people have bought a ticket to one of Cirque du Soleil's productions (there are currently six worldwide), and the company has founded an empire of multimedia souvenir merchandising. Published reports have estimated that the privately held Montreal company's revenue exceeds $119 million, with profit averaging 15 to 20 percent a year.
Cirque du Soleil's tents seat 2,500 people with an average ticket price of more than $50, selling out 93 percent of the time. Big Apple has an average ticket price of $23 during its multistate tour in a 1,980-seat tent (except at Lincoln Center, where the average ticket costs $36.)
Since many circus performers live permanently in Sarasota, there has been tremendous interest here in the new show. All the curiosity was rewarded on a recent Sunday, when passers-by witnessed a sight no American has seen for four decades: a Ringling crew putting up a tent.
Ten workers, including performers like Mr. Weiss and Mr. Petrov, toiled where once 200 strained to "fly," or raise, the three-ring tent. And instead of work elephants hauling away, electric winches whined as they ratcheted the new tent upward on four 60-foot steel masts.
As roustabouts leaped to install the tent poles, Mr. Weiss surveyed his handiwork. Smiling triumphantly, he said, "I think Ringling's back in the tent business again."

HEADLINE: New Findings Help Balance the Cosmological Books

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD 

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
In a kind of summit conference on the universe, the world's leading cosmologists have assessed their theories and pronounced them healthy, saying that a wealth of new research that at first seemed puzzling turns out to strengthen the intellectual framework that has shaped decades of debate about the origin and evolution of the universe.
The astonishing discovery last year that the universe's expansion is not slowing down, as assumed, but seems to be speeding up jolted theorists of the Big Bang whose concept for the explosive beginning and expanding evolution of the universe had, as Sir Martin Rees of Cambridge University in England put it, "lived dangerously for 30 years." 
 An indispensable corollary, introduced in 1981 and known as inflation, had breathed new vitality into the theory with a plausible explanation of how, in its first microseconds, the universe made the transition from initially featureless conditions to the ripples out of which mighty galaxies would grow. But scientists had been short on evidence to support the reality of inflation.
So, in a six-day meeting that ended here on Wednesday, the cosmologists were relieved to find their inflationary Big Bang theory more robust than ever.
"Two years ago, we couldn't have had this meeting," said Dr. Michael S. Turner of the University of Chicago, who organized the Pritzker Symposium and Workshop on the Status of Inflationary Cosmology. "We didn't have the data. Now we do, and the data say we have a flat universe."
Flatness is the large-scale geometry for the universe predicted by the inflation concept. It means that the expanding universe will not collapse or thin out into infinity, but should maintain a gravitational balance between the two alternatives through a coasting expansion.
The cosmologists were also a little surprised by the outbreak of good feelings over issues that used to provoke intellectual donnybrooks. No one questioned the Big Bang itself, which would not have been the case earlier in the decade.
Only a few entered mild objections when Dr. Alan Guth of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, originator of the first inflation concept, proclaimed, "Everything about inflation is incredibly solid," adding, "It's hard to imagine any alternative."
Yielding to this triumphal spirit, some of the bolder theorists seemed eager to crack even grander cosmic mysteries, like the possible existence of many more universes. Perhaps believing that cosmology abhors a vacuum of dispute, these bold ones stunned their colleagues by recommending the controversial anthropic principle be applied in determining the nature and properties of forces and matter in the universe. In anthropic reasoning, simply put, the physical laws of the universe must be such that they allow for the existence of humans.
The primordial spurt of inflation would seem to meet the anthropic standard. Inflation was supposed to leave on space an imprint of ripples, temperature fluctuations as microwave signatures of slight density variations.
The Cosmic Background Explorer spacecraft detected these signatures in 1991, and more detailed observations recently have convinced scientists that these are the seedbeds of all the large structure that eventually appeared in the universe, the stars and galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Without them, there would be no intelligent life.
Cosmologists had thus traced the ultimate origin of galaxies back to the first instant after the Big Bang, and inflation, they said, had passed a critical test.
They also felt they were coming close, or close enough, to knowing the age of the universe: probably somewhere between 13 billion and 15 billion years old.
Two teams of astronomers still feud over differing calculations, with Dr. Wendy Freedman of the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena, Calif., preparing refined data for a report in June.
But at least new research shows that, contrary to earlier reported estimates that were paradoxical and highly embarrassing, the oldest stars are not older than the universe.
All could agree that the evidence of a low-density universe is overwhelming.
There is not enough mass in ordinary matter, the stuff of stars, planets and people, or even the hypothesized exotic particles called cold dark matter to stop the universe from expanding forever.
 
A Matter of Density
Revival of a Concept Einstein Discarded
 If standard models of inflationary cosmology are correct, a universe that does not eventually collapse on itself (a closed universe) or expand forever into infinity (an open one) should have a critical density, expressed as omega equals one, and a flat geometry. The gravity of a critical density should slow expansion to a kind of coasting equilibrium between collapse and vanishing infinity.
By most measures reported at the meeting, based on studies of the light and motions of galaxy clusters, the density of mass in the universe may be no more than 20 to 30 or at most 40 percent of the theorized critical density. Only 5 percent is in the readily observed form of luminous stars, and perhaps another 10 percent is composed largely of the interstellar clouds of hydrogen gas. The rest is presumably mostly cold dark matter, unknown and so far undetectable.
Even the discovery, reported last year, that pervasive subatomic particles known as neutrinos have a slight mass does not add enough to the cosmic density to be significant, scientists said.
This shortfall in matter density has led theorists to revive a concept that Einstein had entertained and discarded, a kind of hypothesized vacuum energy known as the cosmological constant. No one has detected it or been able to explain its properties, except that the cosmological constant must be evenly distributed energy that exerts a negative pressure to counteract the restraining gravity of matter.
As a result of evidence for an accelerating universe, Dr. Rees said, "Stock in the cosmological constant has gone up enormously."
Early last year, two rival astronomy teams reported observations of supernovas, or exploding stars, both near and far. The measure of their velocities provided the first direct, if tentative, evidence of an accelerating expansion of the cosmos.
Dr. Turner called this the "smoking gun" for something else in the universe besides matter, ordinary or exotic, and that something must be the "missing energy." This could be the unvarying cosmological constant or some other form of repulsive energy in empty space, like the hypothesized quintessence, which supposedly varies over time.
In this case, the standard model for an all-matter flat universe is dead -- but lives on among cosmologists as a matter-plus-exotic-energy flat universe. Still, some scientists cautioned against writing off the possibility of an open universe -- what if there is not enough vacuum energy to reach critical density? Though the original inflation models hinged on a flat universe, theorists have now suggested ways to have an open universe within the framework of inflation.
With so many important questions still unanswered, Dr. P. James E. Peebles of Princeton University worried about premature celebration of a theory triumphant. "This is a wildly healthy field, but still in its early days," he said. "We've got a lot to do yet."
 
Blossoming of the Universe
From St. Augustine To Dr. Hawking
Comforted by the congruence of data and theory, nonetheless, the cosmologists took a break one evening for a festive dinner. Breathtaking manifestations of the current epoch of cosmic evolution spread about them. The full moon, an infrequent blue moon, cast a path of shimmering light on the waters of Lake Michigan, and the sparkling towers of the city skyline loomed in the distance, perhaps evoking anthropic speculation.
The after-dinner speaker was an astronomer, one of the searchers of the sky whose observations inspire or confound the theorists. This time he brought them to laughter, and a moment of humility. Even Dr. Stephen W. Hawking of Cambridge University, mute and paralyzed in a wheelchair nearby, managed a broad grin.
The astronomer, Dr. Allan R. Sandage of the Carnegie Observatories, was a protege of Edwin P. Hubble, whose 1929 discovery that distant galaxies were moving apart as the entire universe expanded led eventually to the Big Bang theory. Dr. Sandage reached deeper into history than Hubble in reminding the cosmologists that at least in broad outline, their scenario of cosmic history was a lot like St. Augustine's 1,600 years ago.
"The universe was brought into being in a less than fully formed state," Augustine wrote, "but was gifted with the capacity to transform itself from unformed matter into a truly marvelous array of structures and life forms."
Though they laughed at hearing how Augustine had anticipated their work, the cosmologists were not appreciably humbled. They knew they had at their command instruments of exploration, telescopes and spacecraft and particle accelerators, to fill in many of the details of cosmic history unimagined by Augustine. And they expected to make more progress in the next few years.
 
Scientific 'Methods'
Chess Players Vs. Mud Wrestlers
As in the past, different but complementary styles of practicing science will be brought to bear in approaching the mysteries of the universe: the grand pursuit of the big picture and the plodding collection and evaluation of data. In one example, Dr. Rees of Cambridge divided today's community of cosmologists and astrophysicists into chess players and mud wrestlers.
The chess players, many of them particle physicists, practice fundamental cosmology, trying to define initial conditions and the origin and nature of the early density perturbations that seeded all subsequent structure in the universe. They also strive to characterize the amount and properties of matter and energy shaping the universe.
The mud wrestlers have what Dr. Rees called the messier job of environmental cosmology. They seek to explain the dynamics of how and when stars and galaxies and galactic clusters came to be a billion years or less after the Big Bang.
Dr. Rees predicted that in two years the chess players may pin down the densities of dark matter and ordinary matter in the universe. Then scientists should be able to concentrate on understanding the composition of both matter and energy in the universe: what exotic particles constitute dark matter and whether the vacuum energy component is in the form of a cosmological constant or something even more mysterious.
For the mud wrestlers of environmental cosmology, some of their breakthrough insights may have to await the development of even more powerful telescopes, like the Hubble Space Telescope's successor being planned for 2007. So far, telescopes peering deeper into the observable universe have yet to glimpse the dawn of star and galaxy formation.
Much is yet to be learned, Dr. Rees said in an interview, about the complex gas dynamics over large scales and feedback processes that are responsible for matter coalescing into stars and galaxies, without which there would be no universe as it is known today. Understanding this is "like weather prediction," he observed, "and we know how hard that is."
If Dr. Sandage introduced the element of humility, Dr. Peebles of Princeton ended the symposium on a note of introspection about how successful science, particularly physics, is done. His division of the community was between classicists and romantics, defining the two with a musical analogy: Bach was a classicist, inventive but following a sharply defined paradigm, and Wagner a romantic, unbounded, soaring from conventional forms.
"The parallels with our present situation are absolutely uncanny," Dr. Peebles said.
The Big Bang, to his way of thinking, "was discovered in a romantic way, a brilliant philosophical idea that has been remarkably successful because it is spectacularly simple."
Soaring chords of theory were followed by long interludes of experimentation and observation, the work of classicists. When this raised sticky questions, the romantics stepped in with new concepts like inflation and then dark matter. Even if recent empirical evidence from classicists did seem to fortify standard inflationary cosmology, Dr. Peebles was troubled that inflation theory was being so readily accepted, without being fully tested, mainly in the absence of a viable alternative. "I find that distasteful," he said.
Dr. Peebles's skeptical tone did not seem to upset other cosmologists. "He's half enthusiast, half curmudgeon who wants to keep us honest," said Dr. Turner of Chicago. "He wants us to slow down the train before it goes over some cliff."
 
Alternate Universes
Worlds Reproducing Like Rabbits
Soaring again above the playing fields of hard-won data and interpretation, the irrepressible romantics of cosmology gave their colleagues a start by proposing that serious thought be given to the anthropic principle and the possibility of countless parallel universes.
"The romantics see inflation as a done deal," Dr. Turner said in an interview. "Now they're dreaming about the most expansive implications of inflation."
Astrophysicists have generally dismissed the anthropic principle as unscientific, either obvious and proving nothing or hopelessly mystical. At the symposium, they greeted some references to it with mock hissing and hoots and cracked jokes about the A-word. But the credentials of the advocates guaranteed them a hearing.
Speaking through a computerized voice-synthesizer, Dr. Hawking acknowledged that inflation "does a good job" solving some of the problems with the Big Bang model, but noted that by itself inflation places no limits on matter, the energy vacuum or the amplitude of the density fluctuations out of which galactic structure grew.
"We might as well use the anthropic principle for fine-tuning problems of the hot Big Bang," he said. "I doubt very much we will find a nonanthropic explanation for the cosmological constant."
The British cosmologist Dr. Brandon Carter coined the term anthropic principle in 1974 as astrophysicists began contemplating the concept. Since life exists in at least one place in the universe, the physical laws governing the universe, the fundamental forces and particles and so forth have to be such to account for the evolution of stars and galaxies or anything else essential to the emergence of intelligent life.
Dr. Andrei Linde of Stanford University, a leading inflation theorist, cautioned that the principle should be invoked with care, but that it seemed sensible to assess all cosmic parameters, all elements brought to bear in support of theories, with one view in mind, namely, "what allows us to be here."
"Only the anthropic principle plus inflation will explain the universe as we see it," Dr. Linde concluded.
Both Dr. Linde and Dr. Guth of M.I.T. have taken another romantic plunge with the idea of "eternal inflation."
If an explosive event like the Big Bang, followed immediately by a brief phase of rapid cosmic expansion, happened once, they posit that it could happen an infinite number of times, and may well have.
Conceiving of an inflation that cannot reproduce bubbles of new universes many times, Dr. Guth said, seemed "as implausible as discovering a species of rabbits incapable of reproduction."
He paused. "So universes reproduce like rabbits."
From the front row, Dr. Rocky Kolb of the University of Chicago piped up, "You mean, pull it out of the hat."
"O.K., I'll look for a different analogy some other time," Dr. Guth responded.
If there are parallel universes elsewhere, each would have started with its own big bang, grown from a separate inflationary bubble and probably acquired entirely different laws of physics.
Ours may not be a typical universe. Instead of the four dimensions of space-time in this universe, Dr. Linde suggested, other universes could have as many as 11 dimensions; some could be dimension-challenged, with only 3. Some universes could be stillborn, or unstable and short lived, thus lacking the time to evolve stars and planets where life might emerge. It could be, invoking anthropic reasoning, that a universe must have, say, a cosmological constant of precisely the right value and properties to support intelligent life.
The romantics may have outdone themselves with their eternal inflation and a multiverse instead of a universe.
Even if scientists established sound reasons for their existence, parallel universes would be discrete and widely separated entities, beyond communication with each other. No one in this universe, cosmologists said, would be able to gain any direct knowledge of other universes, though in time the theorists might make a persuasive case for their existence.
Human beings would then have discovered the ultimate limit to their knowing what is out there. They might find solace, though, if there is anything to the anthropic principle, in thinking that theirs is a defining presence in the one universe they know and are trying to comprehend.

HEADLINE: Arranged Marriage Gives Way to Courtship by Mail

BYLINE: By ERICA GOODE 

 BODY:
They are deeply felt and extravagantly phrased: "To my dear, my dearest, dearest love," a 22-year-old man writes to an 18-year-old woman, "from your lover who is always, always drowning in your love and remembrances, I send love and remembrances forever that, like a river, can never dry up and break."
"Life is an infinite circle," writes another man, 21. "I'm offering you an invitation to love. If you are capable of accepting it, then accept; otherwise, in this my time of suffering and life's last moment, please return this revealing letter." 
 Written in New York or Paris, such avowals of affection may be dismissed as adolescent passion, and stowed safely in a bottom dresser drawer. But in the small Nepalese village 100 miles southwest of Katmandu, where these words were laboriously penned, a love letter is much more than just a love letter: It is a hand reaching out to grab the future, ready or not.
The letters exchanged between young village residents, often as a prelude to elopement, are reweaving the fabric of a centuries-old culture, gradually changing everything from kinship bonds to the basic definitions of love and matrimony, said Dr. Laura Ahearn, a University of South Carolina anthropologist who for the past 17 years has been studying marriage practices in the village. "They are fundamentally reshaping village life," Dr. Ahearn said.
Until recently, the majority of marital unions in "Junigau" -- a fictional name used by Dr. Ahearn, who wishes to protect the village from curious tourists -- were arranged by parents. Marriage traditionally has been seen as the joining of two families, and the suitability of a match has been decided largely on the basis of complicated kinship and caste relationships: Marriage between certain types of cousins, for example, is deemed highly desirable, while marriage to "the wrong type of cousin," is frowned upon, Dr. Ahearn said. Becoming espoused to someone from a caste below the Magars, who make up bulk of village residents, is out of the question.
In arranged marriages, husband and wife sometimes speak for the first time on their wedding day. It is not uncommon for a bride to wail piteously throughout the marriage ceremony, and for the stunned groom to perform his part of the rituals -- including anointing the part in his bride's hair with red powder in a symbolic deflowering -- with grim resignation.
And the bride, who moves in with her husband's family, looks forward to an immediate decrease in status as the newest daughter-in-law -- a family position that by tradition lands her with the worst chores and the heaviest labor.
Traditionally, a wife also washes her husband's feet every morning and drinks the wash water -- though some women have stopped the practice.
In the past 15 years, the outside world has begun to make itself felt in this settlement of thatched-roof huts, nestled in a valley three hours' walk from Tansen, the district center. Electric lights came to Junigau in 1996; television sets and CD players will not be far behind.
And, as in other parts of Nepal, literacy, education and exposure to media like music and film are all on the increase: Many village young people, including women, attend college in Tansen, and even those not in college rarely miss an opportunity to see the Hindi romances at the cinema hall there.
At the same time, a growing number of young men are eschewing the subsistence farming, which has traditionally supported the village, in favor of careers with the British or Indian armies as Gurkha soldiers, jobs that take them away from Junigau for extended periods but also make them less financially dependent on their families.
The impact of such changes is inevitable, and nowhere is it felt more keenly than in the realms of love and marriage. Between 1963 and 1983, 73 percent of all first marriages in Junigau were arranged, with elopements accounting for only 15 percent, according to a survey conducted by Dr. Ahearn. But between 1983 and 1993, the number of elopements jumped to 35 percent of all first marriages and arranged marriages dropped to 54 percent. Since 1993, 9 of 10 marriages have been elopements, Dr. Ahearn said. Villages in other parts of Nepal show similar increases in self-initiated unions.
Since dating is still taboo in the village, and meetings between young men and women are viewed as inappropriate, the courtship that precedes these self-initiated unions is often carried out in love letters. The correspondence is begun by the man, who prevails upon a messenger -- often a younger sibling or young relative who is sworn to secrecy -- to deliver a declaration of his undying love to the woman he has chosen.
Suitors put great effort into the crafting of these letters. "It's a distinctive genre," said Dr. Ahearn, "very different from spoken Nepali and from written Nepali." Stores in Tansen and Katmandu sell how-to books, although no one the anthropologist spoke to in Junigau admitted to having used one. Tips on what to say -- and what not to say -- are passed among friends.
Many young men sprinkle their letters with English or Hindi expressions, or with references to well-known figures, in an effort to impress. "Love is the sort of thing that anyone can feel -- even a great man of the world like Hitler loved Eva, they say," asserts one letter. "And Napoleon, who with bravery conquered the 'world,' united it, and took it forward, was astounded when he saw one particular widow."
Yet the ideal of romantic love expressed in most Junigau love letters differs substantially from the notion of romance familiar to most Americans, Dr. Ahearn said. Not only are the letters more serious from the start, but they view love as inextricably entwined with economic development, progress and appearing educated and modern. A suitor may explain to his beloved, for example, that their love equals "life success."
For a young woman, the path of romance is considerably more tricky than for the man who courts her. If she answers a suitor's letter, she is all but committed to marrying him, though he may be someone she does not know or knows only slightly. If the courtship becomes public knowledge and the woman does not marry her correspondent, she will be disgraced, her courtship life over. "There's a lot at stake for a young woman," Dr. Ahearn said.
Both lovers are likely to make attempts to check one another out, making furtive inquiries among acquaintances, or sending out feelers in the letters themselves, a collection of which Dr. Ahearn has studied. Without face-to-face contact, misunderstandings frequently occur: "Why did you beg forgiveness from me? What have we done wrong?" asks one young woman of her petitioner.
And trustworthiness and honesty are topics that recur repeatedly: "Let's neither of us engage in deceitful actions," writes one young man. "My true thoughts are none other than that."
If the correspondence goes well, a wedding plan is agreed upon. The couple elopes, and a brief ceremony is performed by a Brahman priest at the house of the groom's family -- providing his parents accept the marriage. If the marriage goes against caste or kinship restrictions, the bride's parents may refuse to accept the couple, a father telling his daughter, "Don't come crying 'Daddy, Daddy' to me if something goes wrong," Dr. Ahearn said. But often, the bride's parents come to accept the union, inviting her back to their house for a feast, and allowing her to visit when she wishes.
Still, few members of Junigau's older generation applaud the practice of choosing a marriage partner out of love, and many long for the days when they had more control of their children. Elopement, they say, shows a lack of respect, and the marriages are often inappropriate -- playing havoc with traditional notions of kinship and caste.
Dr. Ahearn, too, said she believed that the decline in arranged marriages would ultimately end in "hierarchies flipped on their head, shaking the society to its core." In Junigau, after all, kinship not only determines marriage partners, but dictates who repairs the roof and who comes to family celebrations.
"Everything is connected in this village," she said.

China Seeks Delays in Aircraft Deliveries

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Feb. 8

 BODY:
The Chinese authorities announced today that they were asking suppliers of commercial aircraft to delay deliveries to the nation's airlines.
After years of breakneck growth that could barely keep up with surging demand, China's airlines now suffer from serious overcapacity. Fare wars and half-empty flights, unknown in China until recently, are now common headaches for China's two dozen airline companies. 
 As a result, China's official media reported today, the authorities are taking several steps to limit growth in airline capacity. With 43 new commercial aircraft scheduled to be delivered this year, about 40 older planes will be sold, leased or taken out of service.
An unspecified number of aircraft scheduled to be delivered in 2000 and 2001 will be delayed, Wang Zhi, a senior official at the Civil Aviation Administration of China, told China Daily. Although Mr. Wang did not say so explicitly, it seems unlikely that any new orders will be made this year.
The delays are bad news for Boeing and Airbus Industrie, the world's leading aircraft makers, which eagerly compete for business in China. Executives at each company seemed surprised, even skeptical, of the announcement.
"It is likely they won't order new planes, but we do not expect they will postpone aircraft already ordered," Ray Bracy, president of Boeing China, told Reuters.
Dong Yuguo, a spokesman for Airbus China, referred to today's report as he said, "You could say we're very curious."
Just two years ago, Boeing projected that China would spend $140 billion on more than 2,000 aircraft by 2014. Yet now, China's economy is gradually slowing, and the deeply uncertain economic outlook that hangs over Asia makes it impossible to project aviation growth accurately.
Aviation executives often complain that their business, with such enormous price tags on each aircraft, is particularly vulnerable to shifting politics, domestic and international.
For instance, large orders for aircraft are often timed to coincide with visits by American or European leaders. Of the orders for 57 aircraft Boeing has received from China over the last two years, 27 deals were formally ordered during President Clinton's visit to Beijing last June.
With China's economic growth rate slowing, Chinese officials wrestling with how to deal with overcapacity in today's airline market are balking at all the orders already made for new aircraft. Planned expansions in Chinese airports are also being scaled back.
Liu Jianfeng, director of the General Administration of Civil Aviation of China, announced in January that China would cut in half its planned spending on airport renovation, aviation equipment and new aircraft in 1999, to roughly $1.5 billion from nearly $3 billion.
China's aviation traffic grew by more than 30 percent in 1994 and 1995. In 1996, the growth rate slowed to 12 percent, then to 7.5 percent in 1997 and to 6.3 percent last year, Mr. Wang said. Yet capacity grew faster than that, creating an oversupply of passenger seats.
"Setbacks last year taught Chinese aviation a lesson," Mr. Wang was quoted as saying. "In a sense, it is a good thing."
The 43 passenger aircraft scheduled for delivery this year include 15 Boeing 737's, 3 Boeing 757's, 19 Airbus 320's, a Boeing 747 and 2 Boeing 777's, China Daily reported.
Airlines will try to sell or lease some of their aircraft, Mr. Wang said. They will also shift air routes to try to improve passenger loads. Meanwhile, some old passenger aircraft will be converted into freight carriers, Mr. Wang said.
"If any foreign buyers want to buy airplanes from Chinese airlines, these airplanes will be sold," Mr. Wang said.

China Power Generator Calls Off Stock Issue

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Feb. 8

 BODY:
The Shandong International Power Development Company shelved a $285 million initial public offering, the third major Chinese company in a month to call off an overseas stock sale.
The state-controlled power-generating company said it canceled the sale "after considering the recent highly volatile market conditions." 
 The sale's failure underscores how deeply investors' confidence has been shaken by the collapse in October of China's second-biggest investment firm, Guangdong International Trust and Investment. The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which tracks 41 Chinese state companies in Hong Kong, has lost a quarter of its value since the beginning of the year.
Shandong International first received permission to sell shares overseas in 1994. Its sale has already been postponed twice.
The company has two power plants in Shandong province in eastern China, totaling 3,625 megawatts, or 20 percent of the province's total power capacity. It has planned to increase its operating capacity to 5,200 megawatts by the end of 2002.
Shandong International's decision also leaves in doubt plans by the Southern Company of Atlanta to buy a 9.9 percent stake. A spokesman for Southern in Hong Kong said the big American utility company was "reviewing the situation."
Goldman, Sachs, which coordinated the sale, did not receive orders from the six investment banks it hired to help sell the shares.
"The withdrawal reflects investors' caution toward emerging markets worldwide," said Peter Rose, a Goldman, Sachs spokesman. "During our road show, there were no concerns about the company itself."
In the last month, the Heilongjiang Agriculture Company, a state-run agribusiness concern, scrapped plans to sell shares overseas and China World Trade Center Ltd., a Beijing property firm part owned by Shangri-la Asia Ltd., turned to China's domestic A-share market, having applied for a Hong Kong listing two years ago.

HEADLINE: 3 Markets Join in Electronic Options Trading

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Feb. 8

 BODY:
In yet another signal that technology and globalization are changing the way that financial markets operate, three large financial exchanges said today that they would form an alliance to offer electronic trading in futures and options across three continents.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Bourse in Paris, which operates Matif, the French derivatives exchange, and the Singapore International Monetary Exchange said they had signed an agreement that would allow futures and options to be traded as part of a global electronic network that would operate around the clock in Asia, Europe and North America. 
 The agreement is the latest effort by big markets to find cheaper and more efficient ways to trade stocks, bonds and derivatives in an increasingly electronic financial world.
In recent years, several large exchanges have merged or formed alliances as a way to share in the cost of developing new technology and to offer customers a broader range of financial products. The exchanges also aim to create technology platforms that may some day supplant the traditional "open outcry" system, where traders shout out bids on a cluttered trading floor.
The new venture that was announced in Paris today is being called the Globex Alliance, after the electronic trading system called Globex, which was founded in 1992 by the Chicago Merc and Matif.
The vast majority of trading here in Chicago is still done in trading pits. But electronic trading of derivatives, like futures on interest rates and currencies, is growing on the periphery of that activity, and many of those financial products already trade after hours on the electronic Globex system.
Officials at the three exchanges -- which expect to begin trading together in the third quarter -- said they might ask other markets to join the alliance, while also looking at alliances independent of one another.
M. Scott Gordon, chairman of the Chicago Merc, said that his exchange had been in partnership and alliance talks with just about every other major market, particularly with regard to technology.
"You just can't do this alone; it's too costly to build a proprietary system in a world that wants connectivity," Mr. Gordon said. "Given that we are going to expand our electronic platforms, it's important we have partners. This is all about creating efficiencies and lower costs for our customers."

HEADLINE: Experts Find No Arms Chemicals at Bombed Sudan Plant

BYLINE: By JAMES RISEN and DAVID JOHNSTON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Chemists who examined soil, sludge and debris samples from a Sudanese pharmaceutical plant destroyed in August by American cruise missiles found no traces of chemical weapon compounds, according to a scientist hired by the owner of the plant.
The findings, although prepared privately for lawyers for the owner, who is now seeking redress from the United States, raise new questions about the Government's reliance on tests of soil samples from the site obtained clandestinely by the Central Intelligence Agency. The American officials had said the samples contained traces of Empta, a precursor used in the production of deadly VX nerve gas. 
 The United States attacked Al Shifa pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum and suspected terrorist training camps near Khost, Afghanistan, on Aug. 20 in an effort to curb the activities of the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden after the bombings of two American embassies in East Africa. American officials have said that the bin Laden terrorist network was behind the bombings of the diplomatic missions in Kenya and Tanzania. Mr. bin Laden has denied any role in the bombing.
At the heart of the new evidence are 13 carefully catalogued samples taken from the wrecked plant and its grounds late in October. The sampling project was designed and supervised by Prof. Thomas D. Tullius, chairman of the chemistry department at Boston University.
"The point of what we did was to carefully and scientifically collect samples from a variety of locations and have them analyzed by one of the top laboratories in the world for this kind of work," Professor Tullius said in an interview. "What they found was that in those samples, to the practical limits of scientific detection, there was no Empta or Empa, its breakdown product."
In response to the new findings, Clinton Administration officials said they stood by their decision to strike the plant. The officials dismissed the findings of chemists working on behalf of the plant's owner, Salih Idris, noting that their soil samples were taken long after the United States obtained its soil from the site and long after the bombing and rains could have dispersed incriminating evidence.
Moreover, while they acknowledged that they did not know that Mr. Idris owned the plant at the time of the attack, other American officials say they now have strong evidence linking him to Mr. bin Laden.
"We stand by our evidence indicating the presence of a chemical weapons precursor at this plant," said P. J. Crowley, a spokesman for the National Security Council at the White House. "We stand by our evidence linking this plant to Osama bin Laden's network. We continue to believe that this was an appropriate action to pre-empt Osama bin Laden from further attacks against the United States."
Several ground locations at the plant were surveyed, along with interior sites in the plant that were covered by debris and partly protected from rain. One location, a septic tank, was found intact and provided what Professor Tullius said was a historical record of the chemicals flushed through the plant drains.
The lab analysis found that none of the samples contained detectable levels of Empta, nor did they find Empa, the subsidiary compound into which Empta rapidly breaks down. Empta, Professor Tullius said, breaks down within days, but Empa remains in the soil, and even in small quantities would be detectable for weeks or months after contact with the ground.
In addition to the evaluation of the new soil samples, an international security company, Kroll Associates, was hired by Mr. Idris's lawyers to conduct a detailed review of the Shifa controversy. In their report, made available to The New York Times, Kroll Associates found no evidence of a direct link between Mr. Idris and Mr. bin Laden.
The scientists and investigators were hired by the law firm of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, which represents Mr. Idris, a Sudanese-born Saudi businessman. The law firm has a long-held reputation of influence in Democratic circles with partners like Robert Strauss, the former Democratic Party chairman, and Vernon E. Jordan Jr., a close friend of President Clinton.
But its credentials have not benefited Mr. Idris. The firm's lawyers have been flatly rebuffed in their efforts to present their findings to the White House, National Security Council or the Justice, Treasury and Defense Departments.
"We've been confronted with the problem of proving a series of negatives that there was no Empta at the plant and that Idris was not a terrorist," said Mark J. MacDougall, a partner at the law firm. "We think we've done that with evidence that can be admitted in court. But to date responsible officials, including at the White House, have flatly refused to look at the facts. We're sorry about that."
The lawyers have not yet decided whether they will sue the Government, in what would probably be complex litigation with an uncertain outcome. But nevertheless, Mr. MacDougall said Mr. Idris wanted to clear his name and unfreeze millions of dollars in bank accounts at the Bank of America that the Treasury Department's office of foreign assets control that were blocked after the Shifa attack. In addition, Mr. Idris is seeking millions of dollars to replace the plant.
In interviews with Western consultants to the factory, employees and others, the Kroll investigators said they had found no evidence that the plant had been heavily guarded or that there had been secret areas in the factory off-limits to outsiders, where chemical weapons might have been produced or stored. The report concluded that the plant produced only veterinary medicines and pharmaceuticals for human consumption. While Al Shifa did export to Iraq, Kroll found no evidence of a chemical weapons link to Baghdad.
But the Kroll investigation did provide new details about Mr. Idris and confirmed his commercial links to Sudan's Military Industrial Corporation, the Government entity that produces weapons for the Sudanese Army. The United States charged that the corporation was also responsible for chemical weapons production in the country, and that Mr. bin Laden had provided financing for the agency.
The Kroll report determined that Mr. Idris did have links to the corporation, through his other business interests in Sudan, but not through Al Shifa. Kroll investigators said the corporation was a powerful military-based organization that reaches into many parts of the Sudanese economy, including Mr. Idris's business empire.

Rethinking The Meaning Of 'Winner'

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
FIRST, a political trivia question that some may find a curiosity:
Which winning citywide candidate got the fewest votes in the 1997 municipal elections? 
 If you guessed Rudolph W. Giuliani, give yourself a gold star. The Mayor's 783,815 votes on the Republican and Liberal lines, a 16 percent drop from his 1993 total, put him well behind Public Advocate Mark Green, who had the most with 871,305, and Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi (866,572).
Of course, all this means nothing. (That's why it is called trivia.) As you know, Mr. Giuliani still finished far ahead of his Democratic opponent, Ruth W. Messinger, who after two decades as a City Councilwoman and Manhattan Borough President found herself through with electoral politics -- and vice versa, in all probability.
Even though she lost big, it did not seem like an affront to democracy to call on Ms. Messinger yesterday to find out what she had been up to.
It turns out that, unlike so many former politicians, who concentrate on doing well for themselves, she has been doing good. Since last summer, she has been president of the American Jewish World Service, a group based in New York that supports development programs in third-world countries, along with promoting Jewish education in the former Soviet Union.
One aim is to teach the poorest of the poor how to fend for themselves, not just wait for the next plane carrying relief supplies. That point was underscored two weeks ago when Ms. Messinger, freshly inoculated against typhoid, tetanus and hepatitis, visited Nicaragua and Honduras to examine reconstruction operations in the aftermath of the devastating Hurricane Mitch.
"A woman who runs a community-building project said to me, 'Nicaragua es un huracan permanente' -- Nicaragua is a permanent hurricane," she said. "This is a country with fierce poverty, with large numbers of people without adequate housing or decent health care. And in many parts of the country, those were the people hit the worst."
"Yet as much as we would love to help them raise money to build houses," she said, "we're also going to work with them on doing sustainable agriculture: giving families the technology and the funds they need to change the way they use the land. If there was any arable soil, it's not there now."
It is not often in this city that you run into an ex-politician who feels that life after government can include something other than a big bank, a high-fee law firm or a connected real-estate concern.
Cynics would say that none of those businesses were about to hire Ms. Messinger, whose politics fall squarely on the left, and they might be right. Her job search did not go smoothly at first.
But Ms. Messinger, 58, is by training a teacher and a social worker, not a lawyer, and her new work -- which includes part-time teaching posts at Hunter and Queens Colleges -- suits her fine.
"AM I sorry I didn't win the election? Sure," she said in her organization's office off Herald Square. "Am I very satisfied that I found another place to make a difference and continue to pursue justice? Yes."
Inevitably, the conversation turned to local politics. You will be shocked -- shocked! -- to learn that Ms. Messinger thinks Mr. Giuliani could be doing better, that he has unfairly pummeled the City University, that he has "squandered" opportunities created by his budget surpluses, focusing instead on items like "imaginary stadium plans."
But she referred to the Mayor with respect. If anything, she was tougher on senior figures in her own party -- especially the men -- who will never get a chapter in any update of "Profiles in Courage." These are men who sat out the tough races, letting others be pounded by Mr. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki while waiting for easier pickings in the next go-round.
Much has been written about the general lack of success among New York women seeking citywide and statewide office. But Ms. Messinger said:
"Over the last 10 or 15 years, several women who have run and lost have been women who were ready to give up the offices they held in order to pursue offices from which they thought they could make more of a difference." She cited Bella S. Abzug, Elizabeth Holtzman, Carol Bellamy -- and herself.
"There are not a lot of men in politics who do that," she said. "That's what I call rolling the dice. I knew that was the gamble I was taking."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasury Prices Hold Steady, Ending 5-Day Losing Streak

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Bond prices were little changed yesterday, after five consecutive trading days of declines, as the Treasury's planned sales of $35 billion of new debt offset demand for bonds, even with yields at three-month highs. 
 The benchmark 30-year bond gained 4/32 , to 98 21/32 , pushing its yield down a basis point, to 5.34 percent.
Bonds gave back early gains as the Treasury's planned debt auctions weighed on the market, traders said. The Government will sell $16 billion of five-year notes today, $12 billion of 10-year notes tomorrow and $10 billion of 30-year bonds on Thursday.
Debt sales by corporations are also expected soon, including one by Merrill Lynch & Company. Those sales may sap demand for Treasuries as corporate debt offers a higher-yielding alternative.
Bonds have slumped in recent days as traders braced for the Treasury auctions and speculation grew that the Federal Reserve might lean toward raising rates in the months ahead after having made three quarter-point cuts since late September. The speculation followed several statistical reports last week that pointed to strength in the United States economy.
Individuals who bought 30-year bonds at the start of the year have lost 2.7 percent on their investment, taking accrued interest into account. Still, some analysts say bonds are attractive now, given the recent rise in yields and the fact that inflation is not picking up much, even with the economy's strength.
Results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of new three-month and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)
