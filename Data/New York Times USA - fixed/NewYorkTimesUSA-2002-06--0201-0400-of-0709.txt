The Boom Was Real. But So Were Its Mirages.

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
IT may be hard to remember, but less than two years ago Tyco International and Enron were code words in corporate America for something very different than smoke and mirrors. They were, or so it was thought, the antithesis of the dot-com bubble. They made and sold real goods, be they burglar alarms and syringes in Tyco's case or oil and gas in Enron's, and they reported what everybody assumed to be real profits. As part of a wider boom in profits across corporate America, the two companies said they earned almost five times as much in 2000 than they had two years earlier.
 Last week, however, Tyco, a manufacturing conglomerate, joined Enron as a national symbol of corporate scandal. Tyco's chief executive quit on Monday, he was indicted the next day for tax avoidance, and investors sent the stock down to $10, about one-sixth what it had been when the year started. 
 Many people now fear that at least some of the difference between how Tyco performed in 2000 and in 1998 stemmed from how it accounted for its business, rather than how much business it did.
That, combined with the Enron mess and suspicions that other companies are about to join the scandal list, has raised a frightening question that now hangs over the American economy and the world's investment markets: Just how much of the broader New Economy was an illusion after all?
If the profit surge that stretched all the way through the 1990's rested to any significant degree on accounting sleights of hand, the nascent economic recovery of 2002 could be meager. Stocks and the dollar might both start to look overvalued.
Most economists agree that it is highly unlikely that the entire boom of the 90's will eventually be considered a mirage. Still, they say, it is not too early to begin separating the parts of the boom that remain vulnerable to debunking from those that seem solid.
Companies really did make vast new investments in factories and offices. Those did play a role in making businesses more efficient, and such increases in productivity are the ingredients for long-term improvements in living standards, since they let an economy produce the same number of goods with less effort.
The efficiency gains have continued even through the recession of the last year, making unlikely a quick return of the malaise that was common from the mid-70's through the early 90's, when many Americans thought of stagnation as the norm. 
"What's happening now is very serious," said Alice M. Rivlin, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, referring to the accounting questions. "But I don't think it calls into question the boom of the 90's."
The continuing stream of revelations do raise doubts, however, about whether the economy can revert any time soon to the relative bliss of late 90's, which stand as the best economic period in more than 30 years.
Even if they continue to become more efficient, many long-admired companies like General Electric are suddenly facing a newly skeptical audience. They have lost some of their favorite financial-engineering tools, making it more difficult to raise money for new projects and to keep stock prices rising.
These difficulties cannot erase the progress of the late 90's, but they have made that progress less likely to continue. Stocks will not rise, or even keep their current levels, so easily. New investments, and the jobs they create, may not be so common.
Investors are clearly spooked. After dropping by more than 300 points last week, the Dow Jones industrial average is 10 percent below a high it reached after both Sept. 11 and Enron's downfall. The value of the dollar has also been generally declining for weeks, suggesting that the United States economy has lost a little luster in other countries too.
The most tangible fear stems from what is only now being learned about the long profit surge that helped bring about so much of the expansion.
In the final years of the boom, many companies now appear to have overstated their profits, based on the wave of recent restatements and on the inconsistencies between corporate and government statistics.
I T was a classic case of bubble psychology," said Dean Baker, the co-director of the Center for Economic Policy and Research, a liberal group in Washington, who expressed doubts about the sustainability of the good times well before many others. "You had really strong profit growth in '94, '95, '96, '97, and that became the norm."
Executives knew that to keep their company stock prices rising, they had to keep profits growing. They also knew that their pay came largely in the form of stock and that a few dollars difference in the stock price equaled millions of dollars in their bank account.
Some companies, like Tyco, went on an acquisition binge, adding to their earnings by getting larger. Tyco also placed relatively low values on the hard assets of the businesses they were acquiring, thereby helping its own profits, based on current accounting rules, according to some investors. Many other companies classified inconvenient pieces of bad news as one-time events and tried to exclude them from profit numbers.
"We rely on the markets to reward the companies that are doing well and punish those that are not," Ms. Rivlin said. "You have to know the difference, and recently it's been hard to tell the difference."
Of course, the inflated estimates did have some positive effects, pumping money and jobs into the economy. The various bubbles probably helped the unemployment rate fall to its lowest level in 30 years, giving many people important new work experience.
But few aspects of this chain of virtuous events seem likely to be repeated in the current atmosphere. Many people are looking at their 401(k)'s and wondering whether the excesses caused a decade or so of stock-market growth to be compressed into a few years. Companies are reluctant to make new investments because they still have much more capacity to produce goods than they can profitably use. And a falling dollar, which increases the price of imports, could bring an end to the very low inflation of the last few years.
No economic expansion can last forever, of course. With its gains in productivity, however, the recent boom had the potential to create a solid foundation for its successors. But now, it has begun to appear, the widespread inflation of profits -- at Enron and Tyco and also at companies with far fewer problems -- has made that foundation far more wobbly than it once seemed.

HEADLINE: The Nation: Lessons From Enron; 
Greed Is Good, but Only Later

BYLINE:  By CHARLES R. MORRIS; Charles R. Morris is the author of "Money, Greed and Risk: Why Financial Crises and Crashes Happen."

 BODY:
LET's take another look at Enron. Sure, it may have phonied its books, possibly bilked California ratepayers out of billions of dollars, wiped out employees' life savings to manage its stock price, misdirected millions of shareholders' dollars into senior executives' pockets. Though capitalism's apologists hate to admit it, historically that's the way raw markets work.
 Enron was one of the first companies to see that the energy industry was on the brink of tectonic change. Energy is arguably the world's largest business, with annual revenues and investment in the trillions of dollars. It may also be the world's most inefficient business, riddled with subsidies, politics and protection. Local monopolies obstruct technological advances, sheltering expensive, polluting plants behind captive utility commissions. The national electric power grid is often called a creaky disgrace. 
 But the market liberalization process that Enron helped unleash will forever alter the current energy dispensation and replace it with something else, as yet undefined. And in the course of doing so, it will surely waste many, many times more money than California did, and undoubtedly give rise to even more staggering scams than Enron tried to pull off, over and over, probably for at least the next 10 years.
Nevertheless, the past suggests that consumers will ultimately be better off.
Recent examples of market shake-ups are all around. AT&T's technologically retrograde monopoly was known, not so affectionately, as Ma Bell. The centrally switched, one-line-to-a-caller AT&T telecom model has a lot in common with the centralized storage-and-distribution model of the power industry, and faced the same problems of capacity and high cost when communications needs accelerated.
Deconstructing AT&T has hardly gone smoothly. The implosion of the tech-stock bubble is probably best understood as the most recent chapter in the saga of telecom deregulation. Free markets offered vast new opportunities in Internet, wireless, broadband and fiber optics, and this touched off a mad scramble to get in on the bonanza.
Entrepreneurs like Gary Winnick of Global Crossing and Bernard J. Ebbers of WorldCom were able to leverage the public's enthusiasm into vast new network investments. Along the way, they apparently discovered many of the same accounting tricks that were used at Enron. Inevitably, there are thousands of miles of unused fiber and warehouses stuffed with high-tech boxes that were supposed to keep the networks humming. And consumers will probably have to put up with years of confusion about whom to call when phone lines go down.
But who would want to go back to the old ways? The seamless linking of voice and data networks have led to major improvements in business productivity that are stunning even without all the exaggerations. Meanwhile, schoolchildren take Internet access and surfing the Web for granted.
Or consider the revolution in real estate finance. Deregulation turned mortgage finance into a viciously competitive industry, helped cause the great savings and loan debacle and led to the great property bust of the early 1990's.
BUT look at what happened along the way. Independently of all the other factors that brought mortgage rates down, consumers now save more than $20 billion a year in lower mortgage interest and servicing costs, according to the best academic estimates. At the same time, deregulated markets have financed the relocation of what seems like half the country to the Southeast and Southwest. Compared to the gleaming office towers in cities like Charlotte, N.C., and Dallas, with their sprawling mega-malls and wooded apartment complexes, the $150 billion or so loss in the savings and loan wind-down looks like a minor overshoot.
The same applies to Michael Milken's decade of greed. Waste and abuse there was aplenty, but the junk bonds and the raiders they financed helped blow away a corporate old boy network that had proved unable to cope with competitive challenges from Asia and Europe. Without the violent brush-clearing of the 1980's, it is hard to imagine how America could have become the lean, mean, competitive machine that dominated the industrial world of the 1990's.
The important point out of all this is that it takes the excesses of an era like Milken's for markets and regulators to build the structures and rules to accommodate an advance in economic innovation. And so with Enron. Freer energy markets can lead to the kind of market rigging that may have happened in California, or to vast new economic efficiencies. The key is to keep them from running amok.
It has been ever thus. In just 20 years after the close of the Civil War, America laid down 50,000 miles of railroad track -- essentially the entire rail infrastructure that is in place today -- catapulting the United States into industrial leadership of the world. The cleanup that followed, masterminded primarily by J. P. Morgan, led to one of history's first de facto sets of rules for corporate governance and issuance of securities. Many of Morgan's reforms were later incorporated into New Deal securities regulation, yet another great market reform born out of chaos.
The path for market reform in the energy industry is clear. It will be in the direction of freer markets, greater technological diversity, more decentralized generation and active trading (or price discovery, as the professionals call it). Many of those things are happening now. The energy trading market is sufficiently deep that it survived the collapse of Enron with hardly a price ripple. Companies like Caterpillar have been generating their own cheap power for years, removing pressure from the grid, and are reportedly considering making decentralized industrial power generation a major business line. 
Uncharacteristically, Europe is moving even faster than America to break up the old national cartels. Newly freed gas and electricity markets in Britain are reported to save consumers $2 billion a year. There is no stuffing that genie back in the bottle.
Paradoxically, freer energy markets will succeed only under conditions of tight regulation -- but regulations that police the industry's honesty and transparency, with the teeth and the vigilance to swoop in on market spoilers of the Enron variety. And the depredations of the Enrons and their progeny will point the way, finally, to a truly modern energy market regime.

Ratings for Unrated Farmer Mac Debt Create Confusion

BYLINE:  By ALISON LEIGH COWAN 

 BODY:
ELEVEN days ago, Moody's Investors Service took the unusual step of issuing a news release to clarify that it does not rate Farmer Mac's debt and never has. It also said that Farmer Mac was the largest issuer of unrated debt in the United States, with $3.2 billion outstanding, $2.3 billion coming due within a year.
 Nonetheless, confusion persists. In filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Fidelity Investments, which holds Farmer Mac notes in five of its mutual funds, said that the paper had the highest rating, Aaa, even though Farmer Mac has never been rated by a major agency. 
 Fidelity acknowledged last week that the rating was only the assessment of its own researchers, and it said it would provide fuller disclosure in future reports.
On Friday, Bloomberg market terminals also showed Farmer Mac's discount notes as having top ratings from Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings. They have neither. Chris Taylor, a spokeswoman for Bloomberg, said the company would look into the problem. 
Part of the confusion stems from Farmer Mac's status as a government-sponsored enterprise. Created by Congress in 1988 to build a secondary market for farm loans, the company, whose official name is the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, reaps various benefits in exchange for carrying out its mission. 
One is the ability to borrow almost as cheaply as the government does because of a perception of government backing that emanates from a single section in its charter. That provision allows the Treasury, in certain circumstances, to provide up to $1.5 billion in loans to Farmer Mac to support the guarantees the company extends on farm loans. 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which support the secondary market for home mortgages, have similar language in their charters. But they have sought ratings from Moody's to assure investors of their financial strength. In both cases, Moody's has rated the senior debt Aaa.
Farmer Mac, alone among the big government-sponsored enterprises, has never submitted to an outside rating. In a recent conference call with investors, Henry D. Edelman, the company's chief executive, said that it saw no need for one. 
Investors have suggested that the company has been holding out because it might not like the answer. Ratings can cost anywhere from $25,000 to $300,000. But a top rating can pay for itself by lowering borrowing costs, assuring investors that the notes are ultrasafe. 
Jennifer Engle, a Fidelity spokeswoman, said the fund company has assigned an Aaa designation to Farmer Mac's notes based on the research staff's conclusion that the notes were "of equivalent quality."
"We conduct our own research," Ms. Engle said, adding that "the critical component of our rating" is that Farmer Mac is a government-sponsored enterprise. 
To be sure, the $15 million of Farmer Mac paper in the five Fidelity funds amounts to a tiny fraction of their overall holdings. The Puritan fund has the biggest holding, with $8 million of its $20.2 billion invested in Farmer Mac as of Jan. 31.
Ms. Engle said she did not know how many other debentures sprinkled among Fidelity's 323 mutual funds carried ratings that are just internally generated opinions.
Right now, the five Fidelity funds' annual and semiannual reports describe Farmer Mac's medium-term notes as rated Aaa by Moody's. 
A footnote indicates that Standard & Poor's credit ratings are used "in the absence of a rating by Moody's." 
Shareholders have to pull up an entirely different report -- known as the Statement of Additional Information -- to learn that the source of published ratings may be Fidelity's own researchers. That document contains a proviso that "a debt security is considered to be investment grade if it is rated investment grade" by Moody's, Standard & Poor's or Fitch, "or is unrated but considered to be of equivalent quality by FMR," Fidelity's parent. 
"We don't view this as an error," Ms. Engle said. 
But, she added, "there's concern that it's not clear, so we are going to be clarifying the ratings in future shareholder reports." 
In contrast, Fulcrum Trust, a much smaller fund company whose June 2000 filings described its Farmer Mac notes as Aaa, said the information was supplied by a third party, Investors Bank and Trust. Andrew Joseph, a lawyer for Investors Bank, declined to comment. 
In 1990, Treasury officials made a proposal that would have have minimized the chances for such confusion. They advocated that government-sponsored enterprises be required to seek a credit rating to be eligible for government financing. Their plan was never adopted.

Global Partners: One in Hauppauge, One in Tonga

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH 

DATELINE: HAUPPAUGE 

 BODY:
HIS Royal Highness Crown Prince Tupouto'a of Tonga, dressed in a lightweight double-breasted suit with a decorative pocket square, walked through Globecomm Systems' headquarters in the Hauppauge Industrial Park on Monday, his aides several steps behind.
 Stopping at a conference room, David E. Hershberg, who founded the company in 1994, introduced the prince, who shook hands with half-a-dozen executives and technicians. 
 The prince cedes most royal duties in Tonga, a three-island kingdom in the South Pacific, to his younger brother these days, so that he can concentrate on business ventures and travel. He and two aides, who had arrived in New York on May 26, were driven in a limousine from Manhattan to a hotel in Hauppauge to rest and freshen up before they were whisked away to a reception at Bedell Cellars, in Cutchogue. 
The prince, a son of King Taufa'ahau Tupou, was visiting in his capacity as the chairman of Shoreline Communications, a private Tongan enterprise that last year won the right to compete with the state-owned telecommunications company. Shoreline then chose Globecomm as its partner in a $9 million project that, Mr. Hershberg said, could soon expand throughout the South Pacific.
"Telephone service in Tonga is deplorable," the prince said. "There is substantial room for improvement."
But his new partner has set its sights beyond Tongan telephones. Globecomm says it can provide top-quality data transmission, mostly by satellite, for telephone, Internet and television service, not just on Tonga but on scores of South Pacific islands ranging from Fiji to New Zealand.
In a news release sent out a few days before the prince arrived, Globecomm noted that "as recently as the 1950's, the only link between the kingdom of Tonga and the outside world was a monthly banana boat to New Zealand." The release promised that by July, "Tonga will boast one of the most advanced wireless communications networks in the world."
By all accounts, the key figure behind this transformation is the prince himself. After all, it was the prince who e-mailed Globecomm last year after visiting its Web site.
The prince, who regularly travels around the world on both pleasure and business -- he is currently filming a documentary in Mongolia about farmers who hunt wolves with trained eagles -- said he was in town to meet the people behind the project. 
"Oh, I do like Long Island," he said during his Globecomm tour. "I try to visit often, and I very much like the Hamptons. I stay in a delightful little inn in Quogue. I don't usually get out as far west as we are today, though."
The prince speaks with a decidedly upstairs English accent picked up during his years of schooling in England. Like all visitors to the Globecomm building, he abided by the security policy and dutifully pinned on a badge that identified him as H.R.H. Crown Prince Tupouto'a. 
After a presentation of charts intended to demonstrate Globecomm's technical prowess and rosy future, Mr. Hershberg, the chairman and chief executive, was joined by the company's president, Kenneth A. Miller. They led the royal entourage through more than a dozen rooms, with a demonstration of some sort in most of them. The prince watched attentively as his hosts opened cabinet after cabinet containing control and monitoring equipment and discussed their inner workings in detail.
With a population that is just a shade over 100,000, Tonga is an unlikely business target for a Western technology corporation. But Globecomm, a publicly traded company that does about $100 million a year in sales, has set its sights far beyond balmy Tonga.
"This is really a pilot project for us," Mr. Miller said. "It can show what we can do for other countries through the South Pacific."
On Monday, the emphasis was on showing the prince just how close Tonga was to inaugurating what Globecomm called "state-of-the-art telecommunications." As the prince walked through the building, he was greeted by managers eager to demonstrate how the new technology would improve telephone service, Internet access and television and radio reception. 
Donald M. Gutman, the company's chief technology officer, shook hands with the prince, then began loading a 60-second trailer from a forthcoming Warner Brothers movie onto a desktop computer. As the trailer, a characteristically loud promotion laden with special effects, began, the prince remained on his feet. An aide raced over with a chair borrowed from a nearby desk, and the prince sat down.
The prince watched attentively, then asked, about halfway through: "Is this how it will appear to someone viewing this at home in Tonga?"
Mr. Gutman, looking a little surprised, acknowledged that in fact the trailer would be a little slower to load and the picture would probably not be quite as crisp. 
The prince quickly banished anyone's "King and I" preconceptions and peppered Mr. Gutman with a series of technical questions. Mr. Gutman looked relieved a few moments later when Mr. Hershberg led the group to another room for a demonstration of satellite-based telephone service.
When the tour was well into its second hour, the prince began to look a bit tired. Around noon he asked for a glass of water, and the party took a detour to the executive cafeteria. The prince sat down at a table, opened a pack of Dunhills and lighted one. When Suffolk County's no-smoking regulations were mentioned, the prince held out the pack and said with a smile, "Care for a cigarette?"
He seemed pleased when lunch was announced about 12:30. Regaining his stamina at the table, he was soon regaling his hosts with anecdotes from his travels, providing insights into the India-Pakistan hostilities, reciting a bit of dialogue from "Fiddler on the Roof" and recounting an obscure epigram attributed to Oscar Wilde.
His hosts, naturally enough, were eager to discuss telecommunications.
As a region of mainly undeveloped countries with users separated in some cases by thousands of miles, the South Pacific presents an ideal potential market, said Mr. Miller, Globecomm's president. "It isn't really economically feasible for a traditional phone company to build fiber optic for a relatively small number of users," he said. "For us, it's much easier and less costly to add users to our existing network."
Mr. Hershberg said he hoped the prince's company would take on the role of Globecomm's distributor, bringing in such neighbors as Fiji, Samoa and possibly New Zealand as its customers. That, in turn, would make Globecomm's South Pacific operations that much more profitable.
"The whole point of Monday was to show the prince our capabilities, and let him see the kind of people he's dealing with at Globecomm," Mr. Hershberg said.
And what did the prince think?
"He told me," Mr. Hershberg said, "that he was satisfied."

Prices Are Rising For Second Homes

BYLINE:  By Vivian Marino 

 BODY:
Looking for a vacation home or investment property? Don't expect to find too many bargains.
 The market for second homes appears even stronger than the market for primary residences, and with millions of baby boomers poised to retire over the next couple of decades, prices are likely to climb even more. 
 The National Association of Realtors reported last week that the median price for a second home, new or existing, was $162,000 in 2001, a 27 percent increase from 1999, the last time the trade group surveyed second-home buyers.
The second-home median price was 10 percent higher than the $147,800 median for all homes in the United States last year, the association said.
Sales of second homes, though, were down. About 359,000 were sold last year, off 4.8 percent from the record 377,000 in 1999. "The mild recession in 2001 had a dampening effect on discretionary spending, resulting in a slight pullback," said David Lereah, the chief economist for the group. "Market specialists tell us that by the end of the year, the second-home market turned around and sales began to rise."
Mr. Lereah says buying was spurred by many factors, including low mortgage rates, averaging just under 7 percent, and limited inventory of available property, especially in coastal markets. In addition, he said, many aging baby boomers are investing in real estate rather than Wall Street. They apparently have decided that real estate will offer a better return -- and that they'll enjoy it more anyhow. Vivian Marino

A Cloth Man With an Iron Will on Trade Policy

BYLINE:  By JANE TANNER 

DATELINE: SPARTANBURG, S.C. 

 BODY:
A FEW months ago, Jim DeMint expected an easy path to a third term in the House from a western section of South Carolina. Instead, he is facing a tough Republican primary on Tuesday. 
 What changed was simple: the textile billionaire Roger Milliken put his considerable weight behind Mr. DeMint's challenger, Phil Bradley, a Greenville real estate broker and former state lawmaker. 
Mr. DeMint's mistake, in Mr. Milliken's view, was a single vote he cast in late December. Minutes before final consideration of a bitterly contested measure to give President Bush expanded trade negotiating authority, Mr. DeMint switched to a yes from a no, providing the swing vote in a 215-214 outcome. Fellow Republicans and Mr. Bush promised him concessions for the textile industry. Most important was a provision that some garments imported from the Caribbean and South America must use American fabrics dyed and printed in the United States -- though the prospects for that concession now appear uncertain. 
Mr. Milliken says he was doubtful from the start about the promised concessions, and he has not softened on that vote on the "fast track" authority. "He betrayed us," he said of the congressman in late May, two days before presiding over a fund-raising event for Mr. Bradley in Spartanburg.
Mr. Milliken, 86, the chairman and chief executive of Milliken & Company, the textile and chemical maker that is the nation's 36th-largest private business, is still an adversary to be reckoned with. Since the 1960's, he has wielded significant influence in Washington.
He is a die-hard traditionalist. His critics even call him an isolationist -- defiantly fighting the tide of trade history and picking as his main battleground the trade deals that have gutted much of the textile industry in the Carolinas and sent hundreds of thousands of jobs overseas. In the process, he has found himself with an unusual mix of bedfellows, from Senator Strom Thurmond and Pat Buchanan to Ralph Nader and a prominent labor leader.
A gathering of his allies "would look like a bar scene in a 'Star Wars' movie," said Jock Nash, Mr. Milliken's longtime Washington lobbyist.
It seems a distinctly quixotic battle. Mr. Milliken, a staunch conservative, is going toe to toe against the Bush administration, most of the nation's business leaders and heavy spending from the retail and apparel lobbies, which were once allies against competition from low-wage countries. His adversaries, though, are not writing him off. 
"Milliken ultimately is going to create a lot of havoc," said Erik Autor, international trade counsel for the National Retail Federation. But, he added, "I don't see how he is going to prevail in the end." 
It will not be for lack of trying. Mr. Milliken has already elevated this Congressional race into an event of national interest. Mr. Bush appears daily in campaign spots for Mr. DeMint and has stumped for him. The president has also dispatched his senior adviser, Karl Rove, to South Carolina. 
Whether Mr. DeMint wins or loses, Mr. Milliken figures that he has managed to shake up lawmakers facing re-election.
HIS efforts in the South Carolina primary are part of a push to defeat the expanded trade authority. Although the measure passed the Senate last month after eight weeks of debate, significant hurdles remain, and a change of one vote in the House could create a snag.
In addition to Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Milliken's longtime allies include another Republican stalwart, Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, and Senator Ernest F. Hollings, a South Carolina Democrat, who has been fighting fast-track authorization.
Mr. Milliken acknowledges that his influence will diminish when the two Republicans retire this year. With import quotas on textiles and apparel set to be removed at the end of 2004, and Chinese goods expected to flood in, pressure on American industry is high. In April, Mr. Milliken formed the American Textile Trade Action Coalition with Bruce Raynor, a textile union leader, and George Schuster, chief executive of Cranston Print Works in Rhode Island, the oldest textile company in the country. 
At stake could be the very heart of the textile industry. Since the enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994, the industry has lost 700,000 jobs. One of the largest American rivals of Milliken & Company in textile manufacturing, Burlington Industries of Greensboro, N.C., filed for bankruptcy protection in November.
Since the end of World War II, when the United States helped Japan set up a strong textile industry, textiles and apparel have been a favorite pawn in global negotiations, said Ellen I. Rosen, a Brandeis University resident scholar. Her book, "Making Sweatshops: The Globalization of the U.S. Apparel Industry," will be published in October. 
Not much has changed. After Sept. 11, in return for cooperation with the American military, Pakistan asked for concessions on textile imports; Mr. Bush granted about a third of the $1 billion it requested. 
Mr. Milliken is skeptical. "I'm totally convinced that the American government told Pakistan, 'Ask for $1 billion, and then we can give you something,' " he said, calling the move an attempt to save face with the textile industry.
Not true, said Grant Aldonas, under secretary of commerce for international trade, who negotiated with the Pakistani government. "What the president did was try to strike a balance between the very real need to support one of our main allies in the war on terrorism and the interest of a lot of hard-working men and women in the American textile industry." 
Industry experts like Ms. Rosen say Mr. Milliken's latest efforts are futile in light of the industry's growing globalization. But Mr. Milliken's coalition is undeterred. Its main goals are to defeat expanded presidential trade power, to bolster enforcement against illegal textiles and clothing shipments and to cut the trade deficit by opening foreign markets to more American goods.
The coalition is promoting a House resolution aimed at forcing other nations to put their tariffs and import charges in line with those of the United States. "If we ship finished fabric to India, there are 40 percent to 80 percent tariffs and charges that keep it out," said Mr. Schuster of Cranston Print Works. "If India ships the same fabric to us, the tariff is 16 percent." 
Mr. Schuster has been criticized because Cranston buys some unfinished textiles from Pakistan and China. But he says the dyeing and finishing done by his United States employees are the real added value. 
Despite Mr. Milliken's conservatism -- he was an important contributor to Mr. Buchanan's 2000 presidential campaign -- many liberals agree with his attempts to thwart the export of jobs to low-wage countries. One of Mr. Milliken's more improbable allies is Mr. Raynor, head of the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees. Mr. Raynor first became familiar with the Milliken operations in the early 1980's, when he went to the South to organize unions. Mr. Milliken resisted, and no union has ever operated in his American plants.
In 1982, after a legal battle lasting a quarter-century, Mr. Raynor began overseeing distribution of $5 million in court-ordered back pay to workers from a plant in Darlington, S.C., that Mr. Milliken shut in 1956 -- just days after a union was voted in.
At this point, though, Mr. Raynor is more concerned about saving jobs. He says that while he and Mr. Milliken have had their share of battles, he has not even discussed unionization with him.
Another unlikely partner is Mr. Nader, who accompanied Mr. Milliken in the early 1990's to cultivate allies against the World Trade Organization. Mr. Nash, the Milliken lobbyist, works hand in hand with Lori Wallach, head of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch, a Nader spinoff that is fighting the fast-track measure. 
Mr. Milliken offers a quick response to anyone baffled by his alliance with Mr. Nader: "They don't know me." Indeed, many people are surprised to learn about this very private billionaire. 
He was a French history major at Yale, and is now a voracious reader who quotes the economic theorists Friedrich List and Adam Smith while tracing the demise of empires like Spain and Britain to their allowing their manufacturing bases to wither. 
He has intense affection for trees and gardens and talks just as passionately about a coral bark Japanese maple in the yard of his modest Spartanburg bungalow as he does about trade issues.
Nina Utne, co-founder of The Utne Reader, praised the Milliken family in the magazine's May issue for environmental sensitivity at its 100,000-acre forest property in Maine. Mr. Milliken's son Roger Jr. runs that operation. (None of the elder Mr. Milliken's three children work directly for the company.) Mr. Milliken would not disclose if the longtime president, Thomas J. Malone, who is 61, would succeed him. Mr. Milliken, in fact, divulges little about the company, whose sales were estimated by Women's Wear Daily at $3.5 billion for last year. 
The Spartanburg headquarters are filled with laboratories that have produced 1,600 patents and allowed the company to branch into chemical products that provide a hedge against textile losses. The company has 65 facilities with about 14,000 employees. 
Seth Milliken, Mr. Milliken's grandfather, was a co-founder of the business in 1865 in New York City. Roger Milliken, born and raised in the city, joined the company in 1941 and took over in 1947. 
Milliken & Company's materials are used in products as varied as automobile upholstery, hotel carpets and the balloons in the Macy's Thanksgiving parade. 
Mr. Milliken said he had never considered taking the company public. He has poured a much of his own money into research and development and invested heavily in employee training, people in the industry say.
Another compelling reason to stay private is to protect trade secrets. "They scrap their used equipment because they don't want competitors to see what they do," says Blanton Godfrey, dean of the textiles college at North Carolina State University.
Mr. Milliken is a micromanager. When he donated money to construct a science building at Wofford College in Spartanburg, he sat in on sessions with the architects. "He'd ask us, 'Where are trash cans located, and how do they get the trash out?' " Ronald Smith, one architect, said. 
On trade, though, Mr. DeMint says Mr. Milliken is out of touch. "My approach has been, 'Hey, what we're doing is not working,' " Mr. DeMint said. "What we need to do is recognize that trade is essential to the American economy. The reality is that just sitting on the sidelines and sniping at an administration that has demonstrated that it will help us is counterproductive." 
Mr. Milliken sees it differently. "DeMint is a nice guy, but DeMint is going to vote for fast track and Bradley is going to vote to save manufacturing jobs. That's the whole difference."

Scoring Points While Connecting the Dots

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IT took a few months, but the war on terrorism now seems on the verge of giving America a semblance of wartime politics. 
 Political life had almost gone back to normal. Congressional Democrats had begun a drive to refocus voters on their traditional issues, like Social Security, health care and prescription drug benefits. And President Bush was visiting key electoral states and sounding once again like the "compassionate conservative." 
 But all of that evaporated in a flash with the revelation in May that Mr. Bush had received a C.I.A. briefing in August that terrorists were interested in hijackings.
By last week Capitol Hill was consumed by Congressional hearings and investigations into missed signals by the F.B.I. and C.I.A., and by warnings that America still faced the possibility of devastating attacks.
It's an unfamiliar politics, involving life-or-death questions reminiscent of the cold war, when voters weighed whose finger they wanted on the nuclear button and presidential debates would linger long over questions of arms control and a missile gap. 
Each party has responded uncertainly to this new political landscape. The White House first launched a withering attack on Democrats for asking questions, and suggested that the questioning itself was somehow unpatriotic. Then the president took a new tack and criticized the C.I.A. and F.B.I. 
By Thursday night, in an attempt to overshadow the F.B.I. whistleblower Coleen Rowley's appearance before the Senate, Mr. Bush was on prime time television calling for a vast reorganization of the government, similar to Democratic plans that his administration had been resisting.
Democrats too bobbed and weaved, moving from Watergate-era questions of "what did he know and when did he know it," to less partisan calls for a full examination of the nation's intelligence agencies. Some strategists fretted that their party was deviating from its poll-tested emphasis on domestic issues. But rebellious lawmakers said they could not shrink from the most significant issue of the new era.
"The notion that Democrats shouldn't be talking about world affairs and the war on terrorism is crazy to my way of thinking," said Representative Howard L. Berman, a California Democrat. "If the Democratic Party looks like it is not up to dealing with these grave international issues we're doomed to defeat."
While few strategists were able to say how much security issues would define the 2002 elections, they expected them to be a central theme of 2004, when Mr. Bush's challengers will have to persuade the nation that they have the leadership abilities to handle the terrorist threat. For his part, Mr. Bush will have to show that he met the challenge.
"Terrorism is very much going to be on the next presidential ballot -- who can do a better job at security and who stands for better modernization," said Mark Penn, a Democratic pollster. "No one can run in the next presidential election without having strong profile on these important issues and that will make the election very different from the last election."
No wonder Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader and possible presidential contender, delivered a speech last week setting out the framework of a national security agenda, criticizing the administration for "moving too slowly to develop a homeland defense plan that is tough enough for this new war."
So far polls show that Mr. Bush has the confidence and approval of an overwhelming majority of the country. But strategists of both parties say there are new warning signs of anxiety and discontent in the electorate, with a rising and significant number of Americans now saying the country is on the wrong track.
"It's starting to deteriorate for a lot of reasons," said Carter Eskew, who had been a strategist for Al Gore, " as varied as the states' fiscal conditions, the economy generally but also a sense of real concern that the world is a dangerous place right now."
This erosion of confidence is a warning sign for Mr. Bush since a president's approval rating is usually tied to confidence that the nation is on the right track.
Strategists are waiting to see whether the president's announcement that he wanted a thoroughgoing reorganization of the government to meet the terrorist threat will reassure the public that he is in command. "The way people are going to look at this is did George Bush do the right things in terms of evaluating what had gone wrong and did he take the proper actions?" said David Winston, a Republican pollster. "People say yes. Look at the job approvals."
But some Democrats said Mr. Bush's decision to push a homeland security department was risky, in part because it will be difficult and because he initially resisted just such plans from Capitol Hill. "It's such a flip-flop," said one Democratic strategist. 
Congressional hearings will be going on for weeks, and Republicans as well as Democrats are asking sharp questions about what went wrong before Sept. 11. Part of what makes these hearings interesting is the palpable sense, beyond the usual political jockeying, that this is urgent national business.
"We're in a race with the terrorists to shut them down before they shut us down," said Representative Christopher Shays, the Connecticut Republican who is chairman of a national security subcommittee. "There is nothing normal about what we're dealing with." 
Still, Democratic aides also quietly acknowledge that their party has an interest in probing the performance of an administration that until now faced no criticism of its handling of terrorism.
"Politics works two ways," said one senior Democratic strategist. "You try to fight the fight on your turf, but it's also important to mitigate the strength of the other guys. To the extent that the party is raising questions about the Bush administration's competence that has a real long term payoff."
Democrats said they must move carefully and they face a difficult balancing act. Their party activists are longing for Congressional leaders to be more confrontational with Mr. Bush. But the country at large is not in the mood for any hint that anyone is seeking partisan advantage out of Sept. 11. Thus far, Democrats are simply asking somber questions about what went wrong and how to fix the government.
Republicans say that the president's call for homeland security should help them because it's an issue that plays to their base without alienating independent voters. Moreover, issues of security are usually Republican strengths.
"If I were Democrats I'd be trying to get off this issue as fast as I could," said Representative Thomas M. Davis III of Virginia, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee.
But with Congressional hearings just starting, no one knows what will unfold.
"Nobody knows where this is going to go," said Senator Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican."Not just the political consequences but the realistic consequences. What if there is another terrorist attack?"

HEADLINE: Taboo Against Nuclear Arms Is Being Challenged in Japan 

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 8 

 BODY:
Alarmed by the rising power of China and anxious about the effectiveness of security guarantees from the United States, some of Japan's most powerful politicians have begun to consider breaking with a half-century-old policy of pacifism by acquiring nuclear weapons. 
 In comments that stunned many here, Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's top aide told reporters last week that what Japan calls its three non-nuclear principles could soon come under review. 
 "The principles are just like the Constitution," Yasuo Fukuda, the chief cabinet secretary, was quoted as saying. "But in the face of calls to amend the Constitution, the amendment of the principles is also likely."
The Koizumi government was particularly embarrassed by the timing of the controversy. The first news stories about Mr. Fukuda's comments appeared while he was in South Korea attending opening ceremonies of the World Cup, for which Japan is a co-host, and came at the same time as Japan's foreign minister was calling upon India and Pakistan to pledge not to use nuclear weapons against each other. 
Amid a wave of criticism, Mr. Koizumi's government initially denied that the remarks had been made. Then came a belated admission by Mr. Fukuda, who insisted, however, that his comments were not intended to signal a policy shift. 
Mr. Koizumi went even further, saying his government has no intention of obtaining nuclear weapons.
Mr. Fukuda's comments came barely a week after another senior official, the deputy chief cabinet secretary, Shinzo Abe, said publicly that Japan could legally possess nuclear weapons, so long as they were "small." As a result, for many political analysts Mr. Fukuda's words became much more than a gaffe.
In one of his many attempts to explain away his remarks, Mr. Fukuda, one of Japan's most sober and sure-footed political figures, said he was merely trying to get "young reporters" to begin thinking differently about their country's future. 
Despite the denials of an imminent change, remarks like these indicate that a major shift in Japanese security thinking is under way.
Japan's official pacifism is more than a simple policy. Since the country's defeat in World War II with the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki -- the only time atomic weapons have been used in a conflict -- it has been an integral element of the national identity. The three non-nuclear principles -- never to own, produce or allow nuclear weapons on Japanese territory -- were overwhelmingly ratified in a parliamentary vote in 1971, reflecting the strong national consensus on the issue. The principles supplement the explicitly pacifist Constitution, which does not refer directly to nuclear weapons.
The comments by officials in Mr. Koizumi's government, however, come against a backdrop of other recent statements that show an erosion of support for pacifism, at least among the political class. Barely a month ago, an influential opposition leader, Ichiro Ozawa, all but predicted Japan's nuclear armament.
"If China gets too inflated, the Japanese people will become hysterical in response," he said. "We have plenty of plutonium in our nuclear power plants, so it's possible for us to produce 3,000 to 4,000 nuclear warheads."
Mr. Ozawa was pressured to retract his remarks. But then, according to the newspaper Tokyo Shimbun, Tokyo's mayor, Shintaro Ishihara, called Mr. Fukuda to congratulate him for his comments about nuclear weapons. Mr. Ishihara, a nationalist and one of Japan's most popular politicians, is widely seen as a possible successor to Mr. Koizumi.
All this was in telling contrast with the last time a prominent politician entertained such an idea. In October 1999, Shingo Nishimura, then the new vice minister of defense in the cabinet of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, said in an interview that Japan's failure to consider nuclear armament left it open to "rape" by China. 
The chorus of criticism that followed became so shrill that Mr. Nishimura was forced to resign.
"What we are seeing is vastly accelerated change post 9/11," said Robyn Lim, a professor of international relations at Nanzan University, in Nagoya. "Japan has watched how nifty Putin's diplomacy has been, deciding that Russia will cooperate on missile defense with the United States, and the effects of this will be transmitted here through China. China will build up even faster than they might have.
"You have to wonder then," she said, "how long Japan can remain the only non-nuclear power among the major countries in the region?"
The nationalist-leaning Mr. Koizumi came into office just over a year ago promising sweeping economic reforms, which he has largely failed to deliver, earning him unfavorable ratings. But he has used the alarm raised by the Sept. 11 attacks and the hawkish sentiments of Japan's politicians to push through big changes in Japan's defense posture.
Japan's neighbors have always regarded its non-nuclear status with skepticism. Japan spends lavishly on nuclear energy, promoting nuclear fuel enrichment programs that have produced stockpiles of weapons-grade uranium. Japan's space program, meanwhile, has developed rockets that could be converted into missile launchers. Japan's mastery of these two technologies already makes it a "virtual nuclear power," arms control experts say.
Japanese conservatives have long been frustrated by a Constitution that was written by the United States during the postwar occupation, from 1945 to 1952. The Constitution prohibits Japan from having an army or using force to settle disputes. Revising this clause would require a two-thirds majority in both houses of Parliament. Such backing would be difficult to achieve because pacifism enjoys continuing popular support.
Rather than try to revise the Constitution, Mr. Koizumi has simply decided to reinterpret it liberally. With little opposition, he dispatched warships overseas for the first time in the postwar period, to the Indian Ocean in support of the American campaign in Afghanistan. 
This month, he is pushing a bill before Parliament that would give Japan's armed forces much broader powers in an emergency.
"During the 1990's we had almost constant cabinet changes, and you could describe the process as one of drifting or being carried by the currents," said Yasuhiro Nakasone, a former prime minister who has supported a more assertive defensive posture for Japan. "What the Koizumi cabinet has been doing is trying to recover the lost ground."
North Korea, an ally of China, first set off reappraisals of Japan's defense needs when it test fired a ballistic missile over Japan in 1998.
That missile launching also served to renew doubts here about American guarantees of Japanese security under a longstanding mutual defense treaty. Japanese complained bitterly that Washington failed to share its reconnaissance intelligence and gave the country no warning of the North Korean launching.
In response, Japan accelerated development of its own costly spy satellite program, and politicians began discussing the need for something beyond American guarantees to defend their country.
"Simply put, we doubt that the United States would sacrifice Los Angeles for Tokyo," said Taro Kono, a member of Parliament. Mr. Kono does not support nuclear armament, but he is one of a growing number of young Liberal Democratic politicians who favor constitutional reform to allow Japan to defend itself with conventional arms.
Bush administration officials said they did not yet see any substantial shift in Japan. "We see no change in Japan's policy," said Sean McCormack, a spokesman for the National Security Council. "The U.S.-Japan alliance has never been stronger."

HEADLINE: TRACES OF TERROR: THE REACTION; 
Hopes and Doubts Over Bush Plan

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
Many people in the transportation industry welcome President Bush's proposal to create a cabinet department for domestic security, even though it will certainly be the subject of pitched political battles in Congress.
 Transportation company officials said on Friday that they hoped the creation of a single umbrella department would eliminate the inefficiencies that plague agencies operating at airports, border towns and other points of entry into the United States. But they also remain wary of how effective the department will be, pointing out that it is too early to know how it will function. The department's creation should be carefully monitored, they said. 
 President Bush has suggested placing 22 federal agencies under a new Department of Homeland Security, which would have an initial annual budget of $37.5 billion. The agencies would include the Customs Service, the Secret Service, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Transportation Security Administration, which is taking over security at airports. Legislators will almost certainly battle over the proposal because Congressional committees and subcommittees have jurisdiction over the various agencies.
But the airline industry, for one, is praising the president's move. Many airline executives said that the federal government is handling airport security with all the delicacy of a grizzly bear. Inefficient searches are driving customers away and slowing operations, they said. The new department could smooth that out and coordinate security efforts by all government agencies operating at airports, including the Customs Service and the I.N.S., the airlines said.
"Bringing these scattered agencies together under one centralized department is a wise decision that I expect will enjoy widespread support," said Michael Wascom, a spokesman for the Air Transport Association, an industry trade group in Washington. "More sophisticated coordination, intelligence gathering and information exchange is essential to ensuring true homeland security. The president's plan takes a major step in that direction."
The proposed reorganization will most likely affect airlines, airports, shipping companies and border areas. Federally supervised searches have become customary within the transportation industry, and the efficiency of the procedures has been criticized widely. In some cases, old women are pulled aside to be swiped with magnetometers, baby strollers are run through X-ray machines and airline pilots are asked whether they have access to plane cockpits.
"The Port Authority supports and endorses measures that strengthen security," said Pasquale DiFulco, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which manages the three major airports in the New York area, in addition to various bridges and tunnels. "We look forward to reviewing the details of this important initiative."
From January to March, almost 17 million passengers passed through the three airports, and virtually all of those taking departing flights had to go through security. Travelers arriving into the country have to deal with immigration and customs agents.
The United Parcel Service, which handles 12.4 million packages and letters within the country each day, said it intended "to take a thorough look at any legislation that is introduced." The company makes 1,062 domestic flights each day and has 88,000 delivery cars, vans, tractors and motorcycles worldwide. It said it did not have many complaints about the way the government has handled security so far, if only because it has tried to work closely with federal officials after the Sept. 11 attacks.
"We want to make sure there's a streamlined transition between any department or agency," said David A. Bolger, a company spokesman. Mr. Bolger said his company was also waiting to see whether all the responsibilities of the various agencies fell under the proposed department, or only security duties.
Officials at the largest ports in California also praised the president's proposal, saying they hoped that the department will make sure their security concerns are not overshadowed by those of airports. The Coast Guard, which patrols many ports, would fall under the new department. The Port of Long Beach, the country's second-largest cargo container port, said any additional money for security would be welcome. "We're encouraged the president is keeping the issue in the forefront and making sure that ports are part of that mix of what needs to be protected," said Richard D. Steinke, executive director at Long Beach, which moves about 12,000 containers a day.
But more than 120 miles to the south, at the border with Mexico, some Californians wondered whether the new department's creation would result in cumbersome border crossings. That could stifle the economy of nearby towns, they say, where business dropped by up to 90 percent immediately after Sept. 11 because of snail's-pace lines to cross from Mexico. As many as 8 out of 10 businesses along that border depend on the daily flow of Mexicans who come seeking blue jeans, designer clothes and Nike sneakers.
The proposed agency's "chief goal is to keep people out, while our goal is to keep the legal people coming across," said Representative Bob Filner, a San Diego Democrat. "We have trouble getting attention from Washington now. Imagine if we have to deal with Secret Service and the Coast Guard, too."
Business owners near the border say that it does not matter how long the actual wait is, because even the belief that there will be a serpentine line could scare people away. "If people sense they're going to have to wait two hours, they're not even going to make the trip," said Steve Otto, executive director of a business association in San Ysidro, Calif.
But many businesses said it is hard to tell how the new department would affect their day-to-day operations. After all, it is rarely easy to make sense of the intricate workings of the federal government. Those who have toiled within it understand this better than anyone.
"I hope there's follow-through to make this work," said George J. Weise, the federal commissioner of customs from 1993 to 1997. "Hopefully it's more than just rearranging boxes on an organization chart."

Former Crew of Excite Revisits the Bygone Days

BYLINE:  By ERIC HELLWEG 

 BODY:
Joe Kraus does not fidget as much as he used to. His words are often delivered after long, thoughtful pauses, and he has slimmed down since he resigned as senior vice president for content at Excite@Home in April 2000.
 Mr. Kraus, now 30, was one of more than 240 former executives and employees who gathered last Wednesday at the Portofino Grill in Foster City, Calif., for a reunion of Excite.com, as the company was known before its ill-fated merger with At Home in January 1999. Excite.com was once a formidable competitor to Yahoo but became one of the more spectacular flameouts of the dot-com era. 
 "Excite was me, and I was Excite," Mr. Kraus recalled. "It took me a long time to work through that." Mr. Kraus, a company co-founder, arrived at the party in his Jeep Cherokee, which has a license plate reading EXCITE. He was accompanied by his fiancee, Melissa Walia, a former Excite public relations executive. 
Former employees immediately gathered around Mr. Kraus. Hugs were exchanged, and some people proffered baby photos. Mr. Kraus chatted with one former co-worker who was clearly happy to see him but broke off to take a call on his cellphone 30 seconds into their conversation. Cocktail glasses, cellphones and, in some cases, baby bottles cluttered the tables on the waterside deck where Mr. Kraus stood.
Unlike many of the partygoers, some of whom are still searching for jobs, Mr. Kraus was able to cash out of his dot-com shares before the stock collapsed and came away with enough money -- he declines to say how much -- that he does not need to work. Not content to relax, however, he runs DigitalConsumer.org, a nonprofit company that aims to protect consumers' rights. 
The evening held all the potential for combustion: a couple hundred ex-employees, many of whom went down with the ship as Excite@Home filed for bankruptcy in October 2001 amid bitter board infighting. But the theme of the night seemed to be variations of Mr. Kraus's opinion that the Excite years were the best time of their lives.
Brian Murphy, who worked in the company's content division, stood a little farther down the deck, away from the chatter. He said he had not known Mr. Kraus. Nor did he share Mr. Kraus's financial good fortune. Mr. Murphy is now training to be a pastry chef in Oakland while drawing unemployment checks.
"I'm willing to chop vegetables for free, if I can learn about what I really want to do," Mr. Murphy said. "Getting laid off was a perfect opportunity to do that." ERIC HELLWEG

Political Gridlock Halts Changes in Accounting Law
Six months after the collapse of Enron, the wave of enthusiasm for overhauling the corporate and accounting laws has ebbed and the toughest proposals for change have been thwarted. A consortium of lobbyists, exploiting partisan disagreement in Congress, appears to have killed the most far-reaching proposals, and the jockeying has begun over how to manage that outcome in the fall elections.
 Bills imposing more stringent accounting standards, changing the tax and accounting treatment of employee stock options, and setting tougher conflict-of-interest rules for stock analysts and accounting firms that perform nonauditing consulting services have all fallen victim to political gridlock. Section A. 

Private Effort to Fight Digital Theft
Antifraud companies, like CardCops.com, are part of a growing number of private organizations acting as digital security against thieves. Bob Tedeschi: E-Commerce Report. C7.

A Spokesman With Attitude, Almost
Gary Winnick, left, the chairman of Global Crossing, was said to be enthralled last year with an ad campaign that positioned James Gandolfini, the actor who plays Tony Soprano, as a company spokesman. But the plans were scrapped, in part because executives had concerns about the wiseguy image of a TV character who was under F.B.I. investigation. C3.

Trying to Cash In on Patents
A number of patent boutiques are popping up, hoping to help large companies transfer idle patents into royalties or arrange technology swaps. Royalties from inventions now earn an estimated $150 billion a year, an amount that is expected to climb 30 percent a year for the next five years. Patents. C2.

A Rift Among Webloggers
Five years ago, programmers pioneered Weblogs, or blogs, a form of hyperlinked online journal. Then came war bloggers, people who used Weblogs to vent their anger about the terrorist attacks. These days, many consider Weblogs to be inherently political, something that has angered Weblog veterans. C4.

HEADLINE: You Kidding Me? How Global Crossing Pursued Tony Soprano 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
The F.B.I. is investigating the business practices of both men, leaders who depend on street smarts to run their respective organizations.
 One emerged from a modest Long Island upbringing to become a billionaire investor, the other from a dysfunctional Mafia family to command a New Jersey-based organized crime syndicate. 
 Gary Winnick, the real-life chairman and founder of Global Crossing, and Tony Soprano, the fictional New Jersey mobster of the HBO series "The Sopranos," might have been linked through a national advertising campaign, had things worked out differently.
Mr. Winnick was enthralled early last year with a campaign conceived and developed by a New York advertising agency that positioned James Gandolfini, the actor who plays Tony Soprano, as a tough-speaking spokesman for the communications company Global Crossing, several current and former Global Crossing employees said last week. 
But the plans were scrapped a few months later, as Global Crossing's financial problems were mounting, the advertising budget was cut and other executives at the company concluded that Mafia wiseguy imagery might not be the wisest course.
Global Crossing's accounting practices and business dealings are now under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the F.B.I. Some of its executives, including Mr. Winnick, amassed fortunes before the company's financial collapse resulted in the loss of 12,000 jobs. Creditors of the company, which is now operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, are owed more than $12 billion.
Global Crossing was riding high, however, when Mr. Winnick was presented with the idea of Mr. Gandolfini serving as the company's spokesman at a meeting in March 2001. The campaign, which included mockups of print ads and story boards for commercials, was created by the advertising agency Gotham Inc., a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
Mr. Winnick, who declined to comment for this article, liked the concept so much that he promptly called the producers of "The Sopranos" to inquire about Mr. Gandolfini's availability, said David Archer, the former head of global advertising at Global Crossing.
"They weren't interested, so we continued to pursue it through our agency, Gotham," Mr. Archer said. "We even discussed an offer that combined cash and stock, but it wasn't successful."
Stan Rosenfield, a spokesman for Mr. Gandolfini, said discussions did not evolve beyond a preliminary stage. "There was no offer to refuse," Mr. Rosenfield said. "It probably wasn't something he would have been interested in doing."
The reticence of Mr. Gandolfini's representatives was not the campaign's only obstacle. Several employees at Global Crossing expressed concern over ads that would portray the company, in the words of the campaign's creators, as "opportunistic," "relentless," "fiercely competitive," "street smart" and "ruthlessly efficient."
"Some of us looked at it and said they must be kidding," said Irene Dinolfo, a former marketing executive at Global Crossing. "It conveyed images of negative power and negative associations of Italian-Americans."
F. Stone Roberts, Gotham's chief executive, did not respond to requests for comment.
Rebecca Yeamans, a Global Crossing spokeswoman, said the company's advertising ambitions diminished significantly between January 2001, when the ad budget was set at $30 million, and this past January, when the company made its Chapter 11 filing.
"In early 2001, Global Crossing planned a significant branding and advertising campaign and reviewed plans presented by its advertising agencies," Ms. Yeamans said. "The company's plans were adjusted during the year by the marketing department, based on what they thought was appropriate at the time."
Several of the campaign's slogans had been particularly aggressive. One designed for outdoor venues read, "Speak softly, and carry a big fiber-optic pipe," in reference to the fiber optic cables fortifying Global Crossing's 27-country network. (Actually, the word "big" was embellished with a vulgarism.)
"Wireheads developing technology that kicks butt," proclaimed one television ad that concluded with this tagline: "Yeah. That's how it's done when it's gotta get done."
Nearly all the officials at the company who had worked on the advertising campaign lost their jobs after John J. Legere was named chief executive in October and implemented a series of cost-cutting measures.
Mr. Winnick, meanwhile, who remains chairman of Global Crossing's board, continues to care about public perceptions. He recently replaced Sitrick & Company, a public relations firm in Los Angeles, with Rubenstein Associates, a New York-based crisis management company, to manage his personal image.
Howard Rubenstein, Mr. Winnick's current spokesman, sought to put a positive spin on his client's Sopranos flirtation. "The idea was presented on a story board by the advertising agency," he said. "After some preliminary research on this and many other concepts, it was rejected. In any case, Gary was not the decision maker on any advertising campaign."

HEADLINE: U.N. Hunger Meeting Opens Today, Minus Most Top Leaders 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: ROME, June 9 

 BODY:
Most of the world's top leaders will skip the opening of the United Nations conference on hunger on Monday, undermining hopes that the meeting will resuscitate efforts to dramatically reduce world hunger.
 While dozens of leaders from developing countries have flocked to Rome, including Zimbabwe's shunned president, Robert Mugabe, only the heads of two wealthy Western countries -- Italy and Spain -- are expected to attend. 
 Jacques Diouf, the director general of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, said bitterly before the four-day meeting that this was "a good indication of the political priority that is given to the tragedy of hunger." 
Many affluent countries grouped in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development will be represented by their agriculture ministers, who are expected to resist United Nations demands to pump more cash into the war on hunger.
The Rome summit meeting follows a 1996 event at which delegates vowed to cut the number of hungry people from 840 million to no more than 400 million by 2015. But in the past six years, the number has only dropped to 815 million.
In order to hit the 1996 goal, the F.A.O. is seeking an additional $24 billion a year in agricultural and rural investment. At present, overseas development assistance from wealthier countries totals some $68 billion, of which only $11 billion is earmarked for agriculture. 
The conference is also likely to revive heated debate over the development of genetically modified crops, which is being pushed by the United States but is opposed by non-governmental organizations meeting on the sidelines in Rome.
United States and European Union officials will also come under pressure over the substantial subsidies paid out to their farmers, which the F.A.O. says depress world commodity prices at the expense of third world producers.
The absence this week of top world leaders means that Mr. Mugabe, who has managed to sidestep an European Union travel ban to attend the conference, might steal the limelight. Western governments say Mr. Mugabe is partly responsible for food shortages affecting millions of people in Zimbabwe following the invasion of productive, white-owned farms over the past two years by militants loyal to the president.
The European Union has banned Mr. Mugabe from traveling in its countries because of his treatment of political opponents, but is obliged to make an exception for the food conference because it is under the ausices of the United Nations.

HEADLINE: Harlem Neighborhood Competes For a Stretch of Riverfront Turf 

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
The strip of land was once a vibrant waterfront, with a breezy recreational pier that provided an escape from the sweltering streets. In the days before the George Washington Bridge and the Henry Hudson Parkway, it was also an important transportation center, where you could catch a ferry for Northern New Jersey or Coney Island, or board a Hudson River Day Line boat heading for Albany.
 But today, the city-owned property between St. Clair Place and 135th Street, one of the last segments of undeveloped Manhattan shoreline on the Hudson River, is a litter-strewn stretch of asphalt that is used for fishing and as a parking lot for the Fairway Market across the street. 
 Over the years, developments ranging from hotels to housing have been proposed for this piece of waterfront, which is still known as the Harlem Piers even though the piers were torn down long ago. None of the proposals went anywhere. 
These days there are two competing, and largely incompatible, proposals for the piers: one, put together by the city's Economic Development Corporation after years of discussions with the community, would use the waterfront primarily for recreation; the other, being promoted by Representative Charles B. Rangel, the powerful Harlem Democrat, would turn the piers into a tourist-driven entertainment center. Both proposals would restore ferry service.
In recent weeks, Mr. Rangel has been meeting with state and city officials to talk up his vision for the piers, and a slick booklet prepared by the Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce and outlining a three-phase development plan for the waterfront has been circulating. Mr. Rangel's chief of staff, Jim Capel, said that the congressman's model was Chicago's Navy Pier, a tourist attraction with rides, restaurants, museums and theaters that was completed in 1995.
Mr. Rangel has said he would like to help finance the project through the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, a federal, state and city program in which he plays a key role. The president of the empowerment zone, Terry C. Lane, said the piers should serve as an anchor for economic development in the area. "We will take a leadership role in developing the pier, working closely with E.D.C.," he said. 
Many people in the community say that this scrap of land -- a mere two acres in size -- cannot serve two purposes. "The community wants the area across from 125th Street to look more like a park," said George Goodwill, the chairman of Community Board 9, which represents the neighborhood near the piers. "The community has said that strongly, over and over again,"
In their view, a park would help offset the annoyance of having a sewage treatment plant, waste transfer station and bus depot nearby. (The nearby Riverfront State Park does not compensate for these liabilities, some people say, because it sits on top of the sewage plant.)
"The issue becomes, who is the waterfront being developed for?" said Peggy M. Shepard, the executive director of West Harlem Environmental Action, an advocacy group. "Is it a community benefit, for a community that has been disproportionately affected by pollution by the waterfront, or is it for someone else? Historically, this community has been opposed to the notion that the waterfront is for someone else."
The city's plan for the waterfront is an outgrowth of a process that began in 1999, when the Harlem on the River Committee -- made up of residents, planners, local officials, Ms. Shepard's group and representatives of Columbia University, which owns a number of properties in the area -- met to generate ideas for reviving the piers.
In December, the Economic Development Corporation presented a preliminary master plan -- from the piers to Broadway -- to the community board. Under the plan, the strip along the waterfront would be an esplanade, with piers for fishing, kayaking and ferry boats. It would be maintained with revenues generated by a waterfront restaurant. The plan also calls for retail development under the Riverside Drive viaduct and perhaps the addition of high-tech businesses to the existing small businesses on Broadway.
The other plan, which Mr. Rangel supports, was worked out by the Chamber of Commerce and would include a Mississippi riverboat permanently moored along the piers. The boat, to be operated by Circle Line, would have a restaurant and banquet hall and would be able to accommodate 2,000 people, said the chairman of Circle Line, Karl G. Andren.
Ms. Shepard said that the riverboat proposal was inconsistent with the neighborhood's goals. "This is a very small space," she said. "To have a boat there could detract from kayaking and other recreational pursuits, and cut off views to the waterfront." Mr. Goodwill said there was concern that the boat would ultimately be used for gambling.
Mr. Andren, however, said the riverboat would create jobs. "That would be a unique thing to have up there," he said.
The Chamber of Commerce plan also calls for an elevated viewing platform and a floating stage. (A proposed floating garage for 300 cars has been deleted from the proposal because it is certain to be met with hostility from the community, Mr. Andren said.) 
Less likely to meet with resistance is the Circle Line's proposal to create a stop for excursion and charter boats, in keeping with the piers' historic role. From the late 19th century until the 1930's, the Harlem Piers were a major transportation hub, said Eric K. Washington, the author of "Manhattanville: Old Heart of West Harlem." Ferry boats took families to the Palisades Amusement Park near Fort Lee, N.J. Large steamboats traveled up the Hudson, making stops at 129th Street, Bear Mountain and West Point on the way to Albany and Troy. Smaller paddle-wheel boats took beachgoers to Brooklyn.
The piers and their surroundings were also a thriving industrial area, home to many meatpacking plants. Today, the gritty neighborhood is still zoned for manufacturing, with a few small meatpacking and cleaning businesses operating.
When economic development officials in the Giuliani administration began working on their master plan for the piers, they optimistically announced that waterfront construction would begin this summer. Economic Development Corporation officials in the Bloomberg administration say there is no specific timetable.
According to the preliminary plan, about $20.2 million in public funds would be needed to redevelop the waterfront, with another $4.7 million in private investment. City officials say that given the current budget crisis, more commercial uses than those outlined in the plan may be required to get the project going. In this view, even the Chamber of Commerce proposal may be inadequate, the officials say privately. (The empowerment zone does not invest in private ventures, but it can provide multimillion-dollar loans at below-market rates that lower the developer's risk.)
Public officials are loath to criticize Mr. Rangel, but privately some say that his plan is impractical.
Kevin Corbett, the executive vice president of the Empire State Development Corporation, the state's development agency, said the Pataki administration would like to see the area improved. But he suggested that the piers were unlikely to support much commercial development.
"Using the piers to draw people to the waterfront and using the waterfront to draw people to 125th Street makes a lot of sense," he said. "But the majority of economic development would likely be inland."

HEADLINE: Antiterror Fight: Why the Philippines? 

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: MANILA, Monday, June 10 

 BODY:
When rebels in the southern Philippines kidnapped an American missionary couple more than a year ago, it was not the first time the Abu Sayyaf group had seized Americans.
 But after Sept. 11 there was a new determination to go after terrorists, and American troops went to the Philippines. 
 Philippine soldiers came upon the rebels late last week, in an encounter that killed one of the American hostages, wounded the other and also killed a Filipino hostage. It looked like the botched ending to one chapter of the American effort against terrorism. 
American and Philippine officials disagree. But the episode raises many questions about the American military role here.
Bracing for criticism, the officials have heaped praise on the operation and the United States military mission here in general.
"This was a successful operation" declared Roilo Golez, national security adviser to the Philippine president. "Enormously successful," said a senior American official.
If Washington does not want to be the world's policeman, this official argued, then it "should find satisfaction" in the fact that the Philippines took responsibility for rescuing the hostages and trying to destroy Abu Sayyaf, a small group that sometimes spouts militant Islamic slogans but is more a criminal gang than anything else. 
Indeed, Manila would not let the United States play a more aggressive military role.
The larger question is why the Bush administration chose the Philippines for its first major military foray after Afghanistan; it sent 1,200 troops, including 160 Special Forces who operated on the island of Basilan, where Abu Sayaf has its base.
The answer ranges from the the desire for a quick victory over terrorism to, more broadly, the wish to reassert American power in Southeast Asia.
The current American-Philippine military exercises are scheduled to end on July 31. But officials from both countries say the mission may be extended, particularly the civic action aspects -- soldiers building schools and roads and carrying out other community projects.
The "world's policeman" concept aptly fits what the American military has been doing in the Philippines for the last four months, in that its campaign was like a police action against a band of criminals who terrorized and kidnapped for profit. 
If the United States is going to go after groups like Abu Sayyaf, whose links to Osama bin Laden are tenuous, the list of further targets is potentially long.
Publicly, the mantra recited by American and Philippine officials was that the American soldiers were here to "train and assist" the Philippine armed forces to combat terrorism. 
Privately, officials on both sides acknowledge that the real purpose was to rescue Martin and Gracia Burnham, the missionary couple, who came from Kansas, and to deal a decisive blow to Abu Sayyaf.
But Mr. Burnham and a third hostage, Ediborah Yap, are dead. Abu Sayyaf has not been wiped out, and its hard-core leaders appear to have escaped.
Leaving Manila today for home, Mrs. Burnham called her abductors "common criminals" and thanked the soldiers, American and Filipino, who she said had "risked and even gave their lives to rescue us."
While brutal, Abu Sayyaf is a relatively small outfit in the world of international terrorism, and its commitment to a militant form of Islam is questionable.
In the early 1990's the group received money from Muhammad Jamal Khalifi, brother-in-law of Osama bin Laden, who channeled money to militant Islamic groups through various aid organizations here.
Also, Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, the mastermind of the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center, trained some Abu Sayyaf members in explosives.
Abu Sayyaf never had more than several hundred members, though, and by the time the American forces arrived this year, there were fewer than 200 armed guerrillas. Whatever ideology the group once had, American officials say, the members now are basically thugs who kidnap for profit and spend some of the proceeds on arms.
At one time the Philippine military probably used Abu Sayyaf against other Islamic groups to sow discord, Marites Danguilan Vitug and Glenda M. Gloria, investigative journalists, wrote in "Under the Crescent Moon: Rebellion in Mindanao," published in Philippines in 2000. The book is a definitive study of the Muslim rebellion in the Philippines.
The Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which wants an Islamic state on Mindanao, the second-largest island in the Philippines, is far more powerful than Abu Sayyaf. 
It has at least 25,000 members and over the years has wreaked much more havoc on Philippine society and the economy. But it recently began peace negotiations with the government and has never kidnapped Americans.
If Washington's objective is to wipe out the international terrorist organizations that pose a threat to world stability, the Islamic terrorist groups operating in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir would seem to be a higher priority than Abu Sayyaf. 
The members of many of those groups were trained at Al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan, and they have carried out numerous terrorist attacks in India, all but inciting a war.
The Bush administration may have selected Abu Sayyaf because it looked like a chance to win a relatively easy battle early in the war. And for spite, the group was holding Americans hostages and sometimes beheaded its captives.
In a broader sense, the United States may have wanted to strengthen its military presence here, and across Southeast Asia, which declined after the cold war, especially after the American military left two big overseas bases, Clark and Subic, in the Philippines a decade ago. 
Adm. Dennis C. Blair, until recently the commander of American forces in the Pacific, was the architect of the training mission in the Philippines. Like many Asia experts, he expressed concern about the increasing lawlessness in the Philippines, the rise of extremist groups, and a sharp decline in the military's professionalism.
If the United States does extend the military mission, the American Embassy has drawn up a plan to extend the military's civic action program to two small islands.
But historically, it has been easier to get Congress to approve money for big military items than for nation building. The Philippines may offer that lesson once again.

HEADLINE: North Dakotans to Vote On Bank Privacy Rules 

BYLINE:  By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: FARGO, N.D., June 6 

 BODY:
North Dakota voters on Tuesday will be the first in the country to make their own choice about how to regulate financial privacy. A statewide referendum will decide if banks and other financial institutions can continue to share or sell data without obtaining customer permission.
 A disparate coalition seeking tighter privacy restrictions, reaching from labor and the American Civil Liberties Union to a small conservative organization, the Constitution Party, forced the referendum on the ballot. There are unusual allies on the other side, too: the banks and credit unions, which often fight each other on financial regulation. 
 A previous state law required financial institutions to obtain permission before sharing data. But last year the legislature voted for a new system that allows banks and credit unions to sell data. It does not require them to obtain permission. Customers can prevent the distribution of data by objecting. 
The referendum allows voters to keep the new system by voting yes, or to return to the stricter system by voting no. 
As part of a general overhaul of banking laws in 1999, Congress allowed financial institutions to share data without obtaining permission. That law did allow states to impose stricter rules. A handful of states, including Vermont, Alaska and Illinois, have retained strict rules, known as opt-in. 
In a debate here last week, Charlene Nelson, head of the Constitution Party and a group favoring the stricter rules, Protect Our Privacy, made the emotional case for tighter privacy. "If you believe, as I do, that your private information belongs to you, that it is your private property and you have a right to protect it without taking extraordinary measures," she said, "then vote no."
Gov. John Hoeven, a Republican and a former banker, outlined an argument, which he conceded was complicated, for keeping the 2001 law. He said in an interview in Bismarck that the difficulty of attracting business to this remote, cold state, especially the financial businesses that have provided many new jobs, would be further complicated by banking laws that differ from regulations in most of the country.
Privacy advocates in Washington see Tuesday's vote as very important. The A.C.L.U. gave $25,000 this week to help the campaign for stricter privacy rules. Evan Hendricks, editor of the newsletter Privacy Times, said: "It's huge. It's the first time Americans have had a chance to vote" on the issue. If the "no" side wins, he said, "I think it's going to lead to petition drives in other states." 
Paula Bruening of the Center for Democracy and Technology said North Dakota was a leader in an effort spurred by the perception that the federal law "didn't address consumer concerns adequately."
Under the basic federal privacy protections in place in most states, financial institutions send out descriptions of their privacy policies annually and provide customers an opportunity to opt out of having their information shared.
Since the majority of those notices are ignored by customers, the default position, which allows information sharing here and in most states, dominates. As Heidi Heitkamp, a Democratic former attorney general whom Mr. Hoeven defeated in 2000, asked, "Why should every person in North Dakota have to watch their mail with an incredible diligence to protect their privacy rights?"
In the debate here, each side is making its case on what even its opponents concede are rational fears.
North Dakota bankers insist that they do not sell consumer information, and that to do so would immediately lose them customers. State Representative Jim Kasper, who fought the new law in the legislature, recently said at a Rotary lunch in Jamestown Tuesday that he did not believe the state's banks were selling data. But he said he did not want to rely on promises, any more than a bank would loan him money for a car if he said: "Hey, I promise I'll pay the loan. What do I have to sign documents for?"
A poll taken for bankers showed that most North Dakotans trust their own bankers. The state's population of 650,000 makes it possible for managers and tellers to know customers personally. But many voters also know that U.S. Bank, a Minnesota institution that does a lot of business here, paid several million dollars in 2000 to settle lawsuits charging that it violated customers' rights by selling data to telemarketers.
Many who oppose tighter privacy restrictions concede that they do not know for sure that such rules would hurt the state's economy.
But State Senator Deb Mathern, who runs a 2,388-member credit union with $15 million in assets here, said that because "we work very hard to make this an attractive place for business to thrive," no chances should be taken. Even though she got a $25 check in the U.S. Bank settlement, she said, the privacy issue does not trouble her. She argued that very little privacy is left, and that most of the information she has on customers, including loan applicants, could be found elsewhere by determined marketers.
About four months ago, the North Dakota Bankers Association arranged through the Financial Services Coordinating Council, a Washington-based alliance of financial trade associations, to have a poll taken. The poll found that about half the voters opposed the new law, with its looser privacy protections, while about three-tenths favored it and one-fifth were undecided.
But according to defenders of the law who have seen the data, which they would not release, the poll also showed opportunities. It found that North Dakotans feared being isolated economically. That finding led to one widely broadcast television commercial, showing a suddenly advancing wall cutting off the state's boundaries, even slicing through bridges.
The poll also suggested that North Dakotans might distrust banks in general, but not their own bankers. So bank employees have been writing to customers, talking up the issue at work. State Representative Bob Martinson, now the paid chairman of Citizens for North Dakota's Future, closes his debate appearances by saying:
"Go down to your local bank, go down to your local credit union, go down to the person who has helped your son get his first car loan, your daughter get a little extra money for college, the person that has helped you with your checking account when it has been a little off kilter. Ask that person, ask the person you have done business with for the last 10, 15 or 20 years, ask them what they feel about this issue. Then I believe that you will vote yes -- not to make North Dakota an island, not to build a wall around us."
The poll, which has been kept secret here, provided the major outside help for the law's defenders. They see no advantage in tying the issue to the outside banking interests that have been devil figures in North Dakota politics for many years, and indeed led to the creation in 1919 of the North Dakota State Bank, which Governor Hoeven used to head.
For weeks the defenders had the only advertising campaign going, although radio personalities like Ed Schultz, a talk-show host heard statewide, argued hard for "no" votes, to throw out the less restrictive law. Mr. Martinson said he expected the campaign to cost $150,000 or $160,000.
But when the American Civil Liberties Union contributed $25,000, a sum in the same ballpark as the cost of the poll taken for the bankers, Protect Our Privacy began a heavy radio advertising campaign.
"Banks can legally sell your private records without even asking you," one commercial says. "Voting no on Measure 2 cancels Senate Bill 2191 and gives your privacy rights back to you. Protecting your privacy won't build any walls around North Dakota, but it might help you get through supper without a telemarketer trying to sell you something."

HEADLINE: For Jobless, Time and Aid Are Almost Up 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
Over the next two weeks, as many as 100,000 jobless New Yorkers will lose their economic lifeline: temporary unemployment benefits.
 Congress created the benefits in March to help unemployed workers who had used up six months of regular state unemployment payments and had not found a job. The federally financed program gave them an additional 13 weeks of benefits. 
 But for the first New Yorkers who signed up for the program -- 100,300, according to federal data -- those 13 weeks are almost up. New York has the largest number of people coming off the rolls but, unlike other economically depressed states, including California, it does not qualify for an additional federal extension that gives the unemployed up to a year of payments. 
The prospect of thousands of unemployed New Yorkers suddenly losing their income is alarming food banks and social service agencies, and concerning economists who track the region. It has caught the attention of some lawmakers in Albany. And it promises to become an issue in the state's gubernatorial race.
But the people most deeply concerned about the loss of benefits are the unemployed themselves, people like Miriam Engstrom of Queens. Mrs. Engstrom, who worked in the Internet division of a financial firm, has been jobless for a year, despite a diligent search and a willingness to take pretty much any job. 
She said that like many of her friends in their 30's, 40's and 50's, she has been living off her savings and unemployment insurance payments, which will run out within weeks.
"We've always saved for a rainy day, but I think this could very well go into next year," she said. "Then what?"
Congress created the unemployment insurance system after the Great Depression, to help people who lost their jobs through no fault of their own. The regular programs are run by each state and financed by taxes on employers; in New York, the unemployed receive a maximum of $405 a week for up to 26 weeks.
But during recessions, Congress has often created a temporary, emergency unemployment insurance program, as it did in March. That program gave 13 weeks of federally financed benefits to the jobless in every state.
In New York, 137,000 people are now enrolled in the temporary plan. A State Department of Labor spokesman, Robert M. Lillpopp, said officials believed that at least some people who signed up for temporary benefits eventually found jobs, but he added that they did not now how many.
Roughly 191,000 people are receiving regular benefits and will be eligible for the temporary program if they exhaust them. Half of the New Yorkers who go on unemployment have been exhausting their benefits this year, according to data from the federal Department of Labor.
Congress also said states could become eligible for 13 more weeks, but only if the number of people receiving unemployment benefits rises sharply and averages 4 percent of the labor force.
In Oregon, which got the second extension, the "insured unemployment rate" is 4.7 percent and the regular unemployment rate has been about 7.8 percent.
In New York State, by contrast, the unemployment rate is 6.1 percent and 3.3 percent of the labor force is receiving unemployment, according to the federal Department of Labor. State officials do not think it will go high enough to qualify for an extension, Mr. Lillpopp said.
Unemployment in New York is heavily concentrated in New York City, where in April the unemployment rate rose to 7.7 percent, after seasonal adjustments. But in the rest of the state, the rate is just 5 percent, significantly below the national average, 6 percent.
Congress is unlikely to come to the rescue of unemployed workers in states that do not qualify for the automatic extension, said Wendell Primus, director of income security for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research group. One reason is that in May, the states received $8 billion from the federal unemployment fund, money that could be used to extend benefits.
But New York has spent its share -- $491 million -- to pay for regular benefits and to repay a $189 million federal loan it took out in January when the unemployment fund ran out of money, Mr. Lillpopp said. Any effort to extend benefits at the state level would "immediately undermine the integrity of the U.I. trust fund, which has already been negatively impacted by Sept. 11," he said. 
Employers would also vigorously oppose a state extension, said Matthew Maguire, a spokesman for the Business Council of New York State.
Nevertheless, legislators are working on a bill that would use state money to extend benefits to those who have exhausted the federal program. "We're trying to get our ducks in a line as quickly as possible," said Catherine T. Nolan of Queens, chairwoman of the Assembly's Labor Committee. The legislative session is to end in about a week.
Advocates of a state-financed extension say that New York could spend money now in the fund -- about $800 million -- take out another loan, or enact a temporary tax increase, as Minnesota did. 
"It's a matter of priorities," said Maurice Emsellem, director of public policy at the National Employment Law Project.
Andrew M. Cuomo, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor, said on Friday that he supported an extension, and criticized Gov. George E. Pataki for allowing the unemployment fund's reserves to fall to very low levels during the economic boom. "Since being in office, the governor has done nothing less than mismanage the state's unemployment insurance fund, and the consequences are severe," Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. A spokesman for H. Carl McCall, Mr. Cuomo's Democratic rival, did not respond to a request for comment.
In response to Mr. Cuomo's comments, Mr. Lillpopp said: "Andy sat at the right hand of his father as they drove New York's jobless rate up to 7.8 percent, lost hundreds of thousands of jobs and borrowed more than $715 million for the federal U.I. trust fund in the last two years of their administration alone."
History suggests that people who exhaust their emergency benefits during a recession have a hard row to hoe. In the early 1990's, almost a quarter of those whose benefits ran out were unable to find a job within three years, said Walter Corson, who directed a study of emergency benefits by Mathmatica Policy Research Inc. for the federal Department of Labor.
A study done in 1994 by the New York State Department of Labor after the last recession found that about 6 percent of people whose benefits ran out filed for bankruptcy, and 26 percent said they were receiving some kind of public assistance.
That may well happen again, said Mark Levitan, a senior policy analyst for the Community Service Society of New York. "The first safety net, unemployment insurance, is ripping apart," he said. "Next comes the welfare system."
Food pantries are already experiencing a surge in demand from the unemployed, said Lucy Cabrera, president of Food for Survival, the city food bank. "We're worried about what we're going to be seeing in the next few months," she said.
And the presence of so many workers without income could affect the city's economic recovery, said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Economy.com, a firm that specializes in regional studies. "It suggests that the city's economic adjustment still has a way to go, and that the drag on the economy really hasn't been felt yet," he said, adding that he expected the city's unemployment rate to continue to rise for most of the year.
That's bad news for Krystyna Walter, a consulting engineer who just turned 60 and was laid off Nov. 1. Ms. Walter has about nine weeks of temporary benefits left, but said she would like an additional three months to get through the slow summer hiring months.
"Nothing is happening in the city -- this is really scary," she said. "Time is running out extremely fast."

HEADLINE: Wider Military Ties With India Offer U.S. Diplomatic Leverage 

BYLINE:  By CELIA W. DUGGER 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, June 9 

 BODY:
When Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld arrives here this week, he will have the ear of India's senior political leaders in a way that would have been hard to imagine for most of the past three decades.
 Military cooperation between India and the United States has remarkably quickened since Sept. 11, with a burst of navy, air force and army joint exercises, the revival of American military sales to India and a blur of high-level visits by generals and admirals. 
 The fledgling relationship between American and Indian military leaders will be important to Mr. Rumsfeld in talks intended to put to rest fears of war between India and Pakistan.
"We can hope this translates into some influence and trust, though I don't want to overstate it," a senior American defense official said in an interview on Thursday. "I don't want to predict this guarantees success." 
The American diplomatic efforts yielded their first real gains on Saturday when India welcomed a pledge by Pakistan's military ruler to stop permanently the infiltration of militants into Kashmir. India indicated that it would soon take steps to reduce tensions, but a million troops are still fully mobilized along the border -- a situation likely to persist for months -- and the process of resolving the crisis has just begun.
India has linked the killing of civilians in Kashmir to a Pakistan-backed insurgency there and has presented its confrontation with Pakistan as part of the global campaign against terrorism.
India itself made an unstinting offer of support to the United States after Sept. 11, and Washington responded by ending the sanctions placed on India after its 1998 nuclear tests. With that, the estrangement that prevailed between the world's two largest democracies during the cold war, when India drew close to the Soviet Union and the United States allied with Pakistan, has eased.
India, for decades a champion of nonalignment, seeks warmer ties with the United States in hopes of gaining access to sophisticated military technology and help in dealing with Pakistan.
From the start of President Bush's term, some influential officials in his administration saw India as a potential counterweight to that other Asian behemoth, China, whose growing power was seen as a potential strategic threat.
But since Sept. 11, the priority has been terrorism. The United States is hoping its deeper military and political ties with India will give it some measure of leverage to prevent a war between India and Pakistan that could lead to a nuclear holocaust and would play havoc with the hunt for Al Qaeda in Pakistan.
The military relationship has certainly accelerated in recent months. "We've moved from crawling to walking and we're preparing to run," said an American military official.
American warships have been docking in the Indian cities of Bombay, Cochin and Madras. The first major sale of military equipment to India -- $140 million of artillery-finding radar made by Raytheon -- has been approved by Congress. Aircraft engines, submarine combat systems and helicopter parts are in the pipeline.
In the largest-ever joint ground and air operations, American and Indian paratroopers jumped last month from the same aircraft over the city of Agra. Later this year, for the first time, Indian troops will venture to the United States for exercises in Alaska.
American and Indian naval ships are jointly patrolling the Strait of Malacca to protect commercial shipping, while the number of Indian military officers training in the United States has jumped to 150 this year from 25 in 1998.
A parade of military brass has been marching through each other's capitals. "The current level of military to military cooperation between our nations is unprecedented," Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said upon arriving in New Delhi in February.
Mr. Bush took office determined to bring the United States and India closer together, an undertaking that began under President Bill Clinton. The Bush administration's approach to India was conceived as part of a broader geopolitical strategy in Asia.
Some senior officials saw a close American military relationship with India, a developing, democratic nation of a billion people with a million-member army, as a factor that would give pause to a rising, autocratic China, if not now, then a decade or two down the road when India has become richer and more powerful, American officials say.
By most accounts, Robert D. Blackwill, the American ambassador here and a China expert who taught at Harvard, is a proponent of this school of thought. He has used his contacts in the White House and the Pentagon to speed up United States-India military collaborations. He was a foreign policy adviser to Mr. Bush during the presidential campaign and the boss of the current national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, when both served at the National Security Council under the president's father. Mr. Blackwill declined to comment.
In public remarks, American officials have been careful not to depict the warming relations with India as having anything to do with China for fear of alarming China or offending India.
But the senior American defense official said in the interview on Thursday, "Given our strategy in Asia, the more sober view of China, and Russia no longer being a competitor, there were objective strategic reasons the India-U.S. relationship would improve."
Analysts are more direct. George Perkovich, a South Asia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said some Pentagon officials see the military relationship with India primarily as a way to make China nervous.
"The joint patrol of the Strait of Malacca is a great example," Mr. Perkovich said. "The administration says it loves India in its own right and is not trying to contain China, but when officials say this, they then mutter under the breath, 'Of course, India is a neighbor of China and if China draws certain conclusions, this is O.K.'
"At this point, it is too early for U.S. military or defense officials to see India as a potential military ally and the Indians themselves don't want an alliance," Mr. Perkovich went on to say. "Americans still regard India as prickly, Indian politics as too volatile and the Indian military as too hamstrung by civilian bureaucracy and technical limitations to be of great current value.
"That said," he added, "the U.S. would probably welcome access to Indian ports or military bases down the road."
India has its own objectives in the relationship. By threatening a war with Pakistan over terrorism that could jeopardize American interests in Pakistan, India has forced American diplomats to say plainly and publicly something they used to say only privately: that Pakistan must stop sponsoring terrorism against India in Kashmir. The United States is now using the weight of its power to exact such a commitment from Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf.
India also sees American investment, technology and influence as crucial to the realization of its great power aspirations.
"That is the essential engine that drives the U.S.-India military relationship," said Lt. Gen. V. R. Raghavan, a retired director general of military operations in the Indian Army. "India requires technological development, economic development and military growth in terms of technology."
If India had had the radar systems it is acquiring now during its 1999 Kargil war with Pakistan in Kashmir, India could have much more quickly destroyed Pakistani artillery and charged up the mountains to retake the heights, Indian officials say. "Without any doubt whatsoever," Jaswant Singh, India's foreign affairs minister, said in an interview.
India and Pakistan have been fighting over Kashmir since 1947, and the bloody competition drives their military spending higher. This year, India has increased military spending 13 percent, or $1.45 billion, and most of that will go for capital expenses to modernize the military. American companies are now contending for a share.
But India is not going to allow itself to become dependent on American military hardware anytime soon. Its primary supplier was the Soviet Union and is still Russia. The United States, with its ready use of sanctions, is seen as an unreliable supplier. For example, after the 1998 sanctions were imposed, India was unable to get spare parts for its Sea King helicopters.
Mr. Singh said the small-scale American military sales to India were still not much more than "a kind of diplomatic lubricant." The Indian emphasis is on self-reliance.
"It doesn't matter if it is not the best," he said, "but we must have it as our own, as something that we produce for ourselves."
Still, India wants the high-technology weaponry that American companies produce and that the United States has been leery of selling India because of its nuclear program.
"We are looking forward to closer relations both in technology as well as in procurement," India's defense minister, George Fernandes, said in a recent interview.

Rumsfeld Headed to India Aiming to Ease War Fears
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld is on a visit to India intended to put to rest fears of war between India and Pakistan. India, for decades a champion of nonalignment, seeks warmer ties with the United States in hopes of gaining access to military technology and help in dealing with Pakistan. Cooperation between India and the United States has quickened since Sept. 11. A1

Mr. Rumsfeld crossed the Kuwaiti desert to an American base near Iraq and issued a warning to any state that acquires weapons of mass destruction and plans to strike a bargain with terrorists. Kuwait is the first of three stops in Persian Gulf states that would be critical in mounting any military operation against Iraq. A13

Pakistan's information minister welcomed reports that India was considering easing the military standoff. Pakistan has already begun to stop the infiltration of Islamic militants into Indian-controlled Kashmir, fulfilling a key condition by India for a military reduction. Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage, who visited with the leaders of the two countries, said that tensions had already begun to ease. A13

Arafat Compound Surrounded
Israeli forces moved into Ramallah before dawn today, surrounding Yasir Arafat's headquarters and putting the whole city under curfew. Israeli tanks moved through the streets with loudspeakers warning people that anyone who left their homes would be shot. House-to-house searches were under way and the army reported that it had arrested suspected terrorists. The Israeli move came just hours before Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel was to meet with President Bush. A1

Chemical Traces on U.S. Base
Traces of nerve agents and mustard gas have been found in three locations at a United States military base in Uzbekistan. No soldier has reported symptoms of exposure to the contaminants. The traces are suspected to have come from chemical weapons once stored by Soviet troops at the base. A10

Soccer Riot in Russia

HEADLINE: 44,650-Acre Deal Guards Land Without Ignoring Economics 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

DATELINE: TUG HILL PLATEAU, N.Y., June 7 

 BODY:
A stretch of this northern New York highlands larger than Manhattan and the Bronx combined will remain forever wild, open to the public for recreation but preserved from development, under an agreement reached by Gov. George E. Pataki, the Nature Conservancy and a timber company.
 The complex $9.1 million deal, to be announced Monday, covers 44,650 often stunning and ecologically important acres between the Adirondacks and Lake Ontario. It is New York's second-largest land preservation pact since the 1980's, and by far the largest outside Adirondack Park. 
 The agreement is a significant step toward conservationists' dream of creating an almost unbroken swath of wilderness across the Great Northern Forest, the mountainous region stretching from northern New York, across much of Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine and into Quebec. Tug Hill Plateau encompasses the westernmost edge of that forest, and the largest part of it west of Maine that remains largely unprotected.
The deal also typifies a trend in wilderness preservation in the last few years, with states and conservation groups moving away from buying tracts outright. Instead, they are blending public and private ownership, paying for the land in some cases, and in others, paying for the right to restrict its use -- a less expensive approach that allows the same number of dollars to cover many more acres.
Learning from conflicts from previous land deals, the state and the Nature Conservancy worked closely with local communities and won their support for the project by accommodating their concerns about hunting rights and economic development in this depressed region. The state will provide a $1.5 million grant to the Tug Hill Commission, a local agency, to develop a plan to manage the property. The northern tradition of hunting camps -- rustic cabins on land that hunters have leased for years from timber companies -- will be preserved. Some logging will continue, protecting an important source of jobs.
Officials say they hope that opening the area to recreation will provide new sources of income. Winter sports enthusiasts regard the plateau, with its extraordinary snowfall and relatively flat terrain, as one of the best places for snowshoeing, cross-country skiing and snowmobiling. It is gaining a reputation as a place for bird-watching, and also hiking and canoeing, in addition to hunting.
Vast quantities of water shape every feature of the landscape across Tug Hill Plateau, in swamps, dense forests, and spectacular river gorges where layered stone walls rise as high as 300 feet. As storms sweep off Lake Ontario, this is the first obstacle they meet, and where they drop 21 feet of snow a year, plus heavy rains in the warmer months.
It is the snowiest place east of the Rockies, and it set a national record in 1997, with more than six feet of snow in 24 hours. All the precipitation supports a profusion of life, from trees to rare freshwater mussels.
"Tug Hill is a unique and wonderful place," said Mr. Pataki, who has made land preservation a priority of his administration.
The plateau first drew conservationists' attention for its glamour fauna like black bears, eagles, ospreys, bobcats, martens (a relative of the mink), the beavers that help create the swamps, and the occasional moose. But the closer they looked, the more they became intrigued by less obvious wildlife.
They found the plateau a breeding ground for a wide range of migratory songbirds that winter in the tropics, including several species of warblers, bobolinks, and the red-eyed vireo, whose persistent six-note call -- "Here I am, where are you?" -- is the background music in many stands of trees. Waterfowl like the black duck, the wood duck, and the great blue heron, with its six-foot wingspan, also thrive here. The swamps and rivers provide homes for many aquatic plants, the eastern pearl shell mussel that lives in rocky stream beds, as well as trout, chub and even salmon in the lower reaches of the rivers.
"It's like a big sponge, soaking up and releasing an enormous amount of water, feeding a huge system of rivers, streams and wetlands," said Henry Tepper, state director of the Nature Conservancy in New York.
Loggers who have made heavy use of the area since the 19th century have profoundly changed the forest. Dividing it with roads, they created invasion routes for raccoons, cats and other predators that raid birds' nests. The logging roads also have provided access for all-terrain vehicles that chew up the earth, and which conservationists hope to banish from the area.
Nothing remains of the old-growth forest that settlers found here, but there are balsam fir, sugar maple and red maple trees, along with red and black spruce, alder and others.
"The bear and moose have mostly been driven out, but as the forest matures, you'll see far more of them here," said Doug Thompson, the Tug Hill-Eastern Lake Ontario project director for the Nature Conservancy. Now, he said, moose appear only in the fall, when young bulls wander widely in search of mates. "This is some of the best moose habitat there is, so a year-round population should get established."
Hancock Timber Resource Group, a subsidiary of John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, bought the property six years ago. Under the pact to be announced Monday, which took three years to piece together, GMO Renewable Resources of Boston is buying 30,300 acres, one of a small group of timber companies that specialize in low-intensity logging, harvesting only as much as is replaced by new growth. New York State will buy a conservation easement on that property, limiting logging and prohibiting development.
The Nature Conservancy, with support from other conservation groups, will buy 13,000 acres that include the major swamps and the headwaters of the East Branch of Fish Creek, the Mad River and the Salmon River, which drain into Lake Ontario.
The group will give the state a conservation easement on that property. The state itself will buy 1,350 acres along the corridor of the East Branch of Fish Creek. In all, the state will spend $4.6 million and the Nature Conservancy will spend $4.5 million.
"Not only will the land be protected for future generations, but the majority of it will continue to be a working forest, providing jobs, and it will become a prime recreation area," Mr. Pataki said. "Everybody wins."

How They Brought the Open to the People

BYLINE:  By BILL PENNINGTON 

 BODY:
Beginning Thursday, the United States Open, the national championship of the august United States Golf Association, will be contested for the first time on that bastion of the weekend duffer: the publicly owned golf course. Since 1895, the Open has been welcome annually at the country's best and most exclusive private golf clubs, but never at what is known as a muni: a public course owned by a town, a county or a state, where the clubhouse carpet may be threadbare but the door is open to all.
 Golf, however, is seeking a new populism embodied by Tiger Woods, a product of public courses and the most visible golfer ever. So the sport's leadership, opting for symbolism, selected the renowned, if long-neglected, Black Course at Bethpage State Park in Farmingdale, N.Y., a Depression-era public works project. The event has been called the People's Open. 
 Playing the Black, one golfer said upon discovering it for the first time, was like finding a vintage Thunderbird abandoned in the woods. But after a $3 million renovation by the U.S.G.A., the makeover is complete. 
How the 102nd United States Open descended upon the unkempt Bethpage course is a tangled tale, one that curiously centers around a strange but influential cadre of public golf advocates: a rabbi, a stable master's son and a sofa-bed queen.
The saga begins at the Black Course on the unseasonably muggy morning of May 1, 1995, and all of the principals who would launch a seven-year march to golf history were there: Rabbi Marc Gellman, a part-time talk-show host and longtime Bethpage Black patron; David Fay, the executive director of the U.S.G.A., whose trademark bow ties make him appear to be a vested golf pooh-bah when in fact he grew up on an estate as a horse trainer's son; and Bernadette Castro, scion of the Castro Convertible sofa fortune who is New York State's parks commissioner.
On this May day, Fay and a dozen U.S.G.A. staff members had arrived unannounced to play the Black Course, a recognized masterpiece buried under decades of neglect. 
"I have this nutty idea," Fay told his handpicked group. "Maybe you can tell me if I'm crazy."
Fay had hoped to visit the course unceremoniously, proposing originally that someone from the golf association, even himself, sleep in his car overnight, as the average duffer often does, to secure a prized tee time. But when Fay was greeted at the clubhouse door by Gellman, Castro and other state officials, he knew his secret was out.
Gellman had been tipped off to Fay's outing and spilled the beans. A year earlier at the U.S.G.A.'s centennial celebration, it had been Gellman who helped plant the seed that Fay should consider the Black Course as a site for the United States Open.
"The average golfer is not wealthy, and the idea that the national championship was being played every year on courses groomed and reserved for only the rich was outrageous," said Gellman, who along with Msgr. Tom Hartman is host of a cable television program called "God Squad."
While the United States Open has occasionally been held on courses that are open to the public, like Pebble Beach in California and Pinehurst in North Carolina, these are privately owned, lavish resorts where a single round can cost as much as $375 and tee times are frequently reserved for guests at the resorts.
"What I wanted was a way to honor the working-class golfer," Gellman said. "They are the ballast of the ship of golf and deserve their own Open. I call them golf rats, people who get up at four in the morning to get their weekend tee time at the muni. I was a golf rat playing the Black. I just asked David Fay to consider it."
Fay knew of the Black, having played it a handful of times as a teenager growing up in Tuxedo Park, N.Y., about 70 miles from Bethpage. Though Fay now holds a regal position in international golf, he was brought up on municipal courses. His father tended the horses on an estate, and Fay's time on the adjacent private golf course was spent mostly with the maintenance crew.
"Those of us who didn't play the great private courses in the area, Ridgewood or Baltusrol or Winged Foot, well, we had the Black," Fay said. "That was the gold standard of public golf."

A Mixed First Impression
 Gellman had not been the only one pitching the course, one of five at Bethpage. Also occasionally whispering into Fay's ear was Jay Mottola, the executive director of the New York area's Metropolitan Golf Association, who worked on the Tuxedo grounds crew with Fay as a youngster.
Then there was Rees Jones, a member of the first family of golf course architects and labeled the Open Doctor for his work on a number of previous United States Open courses. Jones was a childhood friend of Castro's; their families were friends. Jones went to play the Black Course that day in May 1995, too.
So it was quite the chummy assembly that ventured off the first tee. Things got grumpy in a hurry.
It did not take long for several golfers to find one of the Black Course's mammoth sand traps, the hallmark of the design of the celebrated architect A. W. Tillinghast in 1936. It was one thing to be in a bunker; it was another to find your ball, as Jones did, in a footprint eight inches deep.
"We were all in these traps where it was impossible to get the ball out," Jones said. "Some pretty good players were taking two or three swings and not hitting sand, not hitting a ball."
Once he finally extracted his ball, Jones went looking for a rake to repair the trap. There was none. In other traps, trees and bushes were growing in the sand. The rough was weedy, the fairway grass was occasionally no more than tufts here and there. The greens were uneven. Some tee boxes were half dirt.
Thirty minutes into the flight of fancy he had orchestrated, Fay was aware of the quiet cussing going on around him. Fay said, "I've heard some staffers were mumbling, 'There's no way we're going to host anything here.' "
The Black Course was showing its wear. Situated near the epicenter of Long Island's postwar population boom, the course had attracted 30,000 to 45,000 golfers every year since the late 1940's, twice the number who play on most private courses. Operated on a slim state budget, one harshly slashed during the fiscal crisis of the 1970's, the Black Course had little irrigation, the staff was spread over the park's five golf courses and maintenance was limited.
Fay bit his tongue until the foursomes reached the fourth hole, which offers a sweeping panorama from tee to green: the 517-yard hole, surrounded by thick trees, offers a dramatic vista incomprehensibly close to the congestion of the Long Island Expressway just four miles from the Bethpage grounds.
"I think right there, some people stared off that fourth tee and said, 'Ah, I get it now,' " Fay said.
By day's end, Fay said there was not a single naysayer to his once far-fetched idea.
Fay met with state officials that afternoon and began hammering out the initial details of an agreement. The course would have to be closed for months, roads rerouted, security and transportation issues resolved and mountains of dirt, sand and sod moved and shaped. The renovations for the course alone would cost nearly $4 million.
Jones had offered his design services free, but he would have to revive and replicate the 66-year-old roots of the Black Course without the original plans, which had been lost. All Jones had was a 1938 aerial photograph of the course.

Little Red Tape
 Driving back to his New Jersey home from Bethpage that day seven years ago, Fay knew it was far from a done deal.
"Look, I grew up as a resident of New York State," he said. "We all know what New York State is like. We would have to deal with people on local, county and state levels. It could have become a political football."
As Gellman said recently: "Enter the unique pressure tactics of Bernadette Castro. She made sure there were few bureaucratic obstacles. And there could have been."
Once the state understood that the U.S.G.A. was serious, Castro and Gov. George E. Pataki pressed the golf association for a commitment. In fact, New York had wanted the 2001 Open, but Fay had to persuade the association's executive board members, most of whom had never heard of Bethpage State Park. The only board member who had played the Black, Eric Gleacher of Manhattan, consistently defended the course.
"The U.S.G.A. is over 100 years old and doesn't move quickly," Fay said. "But this was something long overdue."
What figured to be the biggest hurdle -- who would pay for the renovation -- turned out to be the easiest to negotiate.
"I knew the state couldn't pay for it," Fay said. "Some guy in Syracuse wasn't going to feel warm and fuzzy about the state dumping $3 million into some golf course on Long Island. We had to pay for it."
Fay considered the restoration of the course a service to public golf, and the golf association knew it would still make a multimillion-dollar profit from the 2002 Open at Bethpage. A record number of tickets have already been sold (more than 42,000 each day), and the Open will most likely be the most widely watched television golf event of the year, precisely because it is being contested on a public course.
In 1997, as Castro and Fay were completing their negotiations, Fay had a last, pivotal request. He wanted the state to promise not to raise the economical Black Course greens fees -- $31 on weekdays and $39 on weekends -- for at least three years after the 2002 Open.
"As David said at the time, 'When the circus leaves town, let's return the Black to the regular golfer,' " Castro said. "In all of this, I don't think anyone forgot our first customer: the guy coming up the 18th fairway, lugging his bag, sweaty but smiling after enjoying a treasure of a golf course."
But the regular golfer lugging his bag (no motorized carts are allowed on the Black) will not be returning to the municipal course he remembers from the mid-1990's. Virtually every square foot of the course has been transformed. It began with Jones, with the 1938 aerial photograph in hand, walking the course as he tried to divine the original architect's intent hole by hole.

Unearthing a Jewel
 Sometimes, on his hands and knees, Jones would uncover abandoned traps, seeking their original outline by poking at the grass that had enveloped them. As the park superintendents David Catalano and Craig Currier joined the project, tees were rediscovered and former bends and swales in the fairways unearthed. Jones did it to understand the style, even if every bunker was relocated in some manner.
"This is sacred ground in golf, and what we've done is very much like restoring a great painting," Jones said. "At the Black, there were all those rounds and the soot of 50 years of passing cars. You thoughtfully chip away at layer after layer."
The course was plied with 18 million pounds of sand for its newly sculptured bunkers, hundreds of trees were planted and more than one million square feet of sod laid.
Every tee box was rebuilt and every green refurbished. The weedy rough is now sprouting with blond, gnarly fescue grass. New irrigation lines were dug and nearly 400 sprinkler heads installed.
"I walk the Black Course now and I remember back to when we came here in 1995 and it seems like a dream sequence," said Tom Meeks, the U.S.G.A.'s director of rules and competition. "One day we're here searching for grass on the tees and all of a sudden the U.S. Open is coming here. And the neatest thing is that golfers all over the world will watch on television and say, 'You mean to tell me, I can go play this course?' "
Gellman takes that thought one step further.
"I have this vision of a working-class guy sitting on a couch watching the U.S. Open and he turns to his son or daughter and says, 'Tiger better watch out because I know that putt, and it breaks to the left,' " Gellman said. "That could not have happened in any other U.S. Open ever."
It will likely happen again, though, because of the collective vision that brought the 2002 Open to Bethpage. Torrey Pines, a public course outside San Diego, is in line for the 2008 Open, and the U.S.G.A. anticipates keeping Bethpage Black in its informal rotation of Open courses, an honor once reserved only for the country's pre-eminent private courses.
"I don't see this as a one-and-done deal," Fay said. "What we've done at the Black is too majestic and important. People better be asking when we're coming back."

HEADLINE: The Plan From PEOC 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
To be presidential is to be bold. To be presidential is to plot your surprise in secret, to reverse course with panache, and thereby to bestride the news cycle like a Colossus, asserting leadership in one bodacious swoop. 
 I learned that in the Nixon economic shokku of 1971, when a handful of us met secretly at Camp David, imposed wage and price controls, slammed down the gold window and slapped on a protective tariff. The powerful package turned out to be a historic blunder, but it sure won points for boldness. 
 Here we go again. President Bush had dismissed the prescient proposals of former Senators Gary Hart and Warren Rudman for a conglomeration of homeland security agencies. When put in a bill by Democrat Joe Lieberman, the dramatic plan was brushed off by the Bush-appointed "czar" and all the president's men. 
But meanwhile, down in the bombproof bowels of the White House -- in PEOC, the Presidential Emergency Operations Center, compared to which the Situation Room is like the front lawn -- a little band of ruthless reorganizers, with no constituency but the man a hundred feet up in the Oval Office, huddled over diagrams with little boxes and dotted lines to create what was to be billed as "the most far-reaching modernization of our government since Truman's day." 
The secretaries of State and Defense were kept in the dark lest they blab. The unconsulted Treasury secretary will be remembered as the man who gained a rock star and lost the Secret Service. To the White House staff, far more important than cabinet or congressional or expert input was the element of surprise.
Bold it was, and politically shrewd. Democrats can't complain because the amalgamation of internal protection agencies is what they have been demanding. The press can't kick because it has been deriding the toothlessness of the homeland security "czar." Those who do object will be zapped as protectors of bureaucratic turf or, as the attorney general will charge as November elections draw near, aiders of terrorism.
But set aside the bold-leadership factor, as well as the cleverness of changing the subject from F.B.I.-C.I.A. warfare and the need to stampede Congress into another hasty "U.S.A. Patriot" Act. Consider the substance: is reshuffling a good idea?
Most of it makes sense. For example, the Secret Service comes under Treasury because its original purpose was to combat counterfeiters. Now we have a billion one-dollar coins with an Indian woman on them that nobody uses, and nobody cares if they're counterfeit. Today it's a bodyguard force whose protective mission should be related, as Bush proposes, to that of federal marshals and disaster crews, customs and immigration agents and the Coast Guard.
The questions to be asked by Congressional committees, armed with expert managerial advisers, is: How will this un-scattering be more effective? Unions will holler and lobbyists will defend their Congressional contacts, but as we add a huge new mission of terror prevention, shouldn't we drop old missions, retrain or replace their government work forces and put new oversight in place?
One danger, however, is to fall for the notion, already being discredited in private industry, that bigger is better. This merger-happy administration, weak on antitrust, is tempted to grow fat. Bush claims his proposals are "budget neutral," and we should hold him to that. 
He suggests we strip the Department of Transportation of the Coast Guard and the Transportation Security Administration, assigning them to the new department. Fine; why not distribute the rest of Transportation's activities and do away with that cabinet post, with its attendant superstructure? (Disconnect the D.O.T.!)
Some management-neatness freaks will use Bush's plan to push for a subsequent merger of C.I.A., F.B.I., N.S.A. and military intelligence into a Ministry of the Interior. Better coordination of intelligence is necessary -- and the dismal failure of Congressional oversight calls for the House and Senate to hold their own Intelligence and Judiciary Committee staffs accountable -- but such a concentration of police and surveillance power would be dangerous to our freedoms. 
Here's how to judge the plan bubbling up from PEOC: the reshuffling should increase the puissance of our protection but not the size of our government. Enforcing that discipline calls for boldness on the part of conservatives in Congress.

HEADLINE: ARTS IN AMERICA; 
. . . Starring The Original Houston Cast

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: HOUSTON 

 BODY:
It has been some time since all the big musicals started on Broadway and then filtered out to the hinterland. Now the trend -- becoming stronger and perhaps permanent -- is for them to open first in cities like this one and then move to New York. 
 Mounting a new musical in New York has become so expensive that producers are loath to take the risk of failure. They prefer to wait until shows are proven at places like Theater Under the Stars in Houston, which has just moved into a dazzling $100-million home designed especially to stage lavish musicals. 
 A new musical called "Some Like It Hot," based on the 1957 film of the same name and starring Tony Curtis, who was also in the film, is having its world premiere here. In October there is to be another first, "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?" Both shows are scheduled to go from Houston to other cities, and then perhaps to Broadway. 
"These days Broadway is doing revivals and leaving the new shows to us," said Frank M. Young, who has headed Theater Under the Stars since it was founded in 1968. "It's all about economics. We can produce a show for one-third of what it costs in New York, and we have other theaters that will partner with us. Shows that we do that are good will be picked up for Broadway."
Mr. Young's plans for "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?" reflect the pattern that has made Theater Under the Stars one of the country's pre-eminent centers for the production of new musicals.
"We'll do the world premiere, and since I do everything over the top and this new theater allows me to do absolutely anything I can dream up, it will have effects no one has ever seen on Broadway," he said. "It will go on tour in the summer of 2003, and then maybe to New York. It may be a disaster, but I can afford to take that risk. Broadway can't. The costs there are unbelievable, and corporations own most of the big theaters. You don't have a David Merrick who gets a hunch and goes with it and can eat the losses if it doesn't succeed. That era is past and done."
In some senses Mr. Young has emerged as a David Merrick of the provinces. 
He said he regularly received scripts from well-known writers and composers who claim there is no one on Broadway today who is eager to consider new musicals. Each season he presents a mix of world premieres, touring shows and new productions of classics. In January he will open a new "My Fair Lady" that is being billed as the most expensive regional production of this show ever.
"Even if we don't have a hit, we don't lose," Mr. Young said. " 'Jekyll and Hyde' started here, in partnership with two other theaters. It cost $2.1 million to produce, which was $700,000 for each theater. Between the three of us, we have 80,000 subscribers. So 'Jekyll and Hyde' was in the black before the curtain went up." 
He added, "From our three theaters it went national, then to Broadway and then to video." 
Houston is hardly the only city that sends musicals to Broadway. Of shows now playing in New York, "Aida" comes from the Alliance Theater in Atlanta; "Into the Woods" from the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles; "The Full Monty" from the Old Globe in San Diego; and "Thoroughly Modern Millie" from the La Jolla Playhouse in Southern California. The next big musical scheduled to open on Broadway, "Hairspray," is coming from the Fifth Avenue Playhouse in Seattle.
The new theater in Houston, called the Hobby Center for the Performing Arts, considerably increases Mr. Young's ability to mount splashy new productions. It has a 2,650-seat hall designed for musicals, with a pit that can accommodate twice as many musicians as most pits on Broadway, a stage that can be removed in whole or part for special effects, and large spaces for dressing rooms and rehearsals. There is also a 500-seat hall that will be used to develop new work as well as for small-scale concerts, spoken-word performances and children's shows.
Theater Under the Stars has come a long way from the days when it presented shows in an auditorium that was also used for rodeos and where some patrons had to sit under plastic sheets to protect them from rain leaking through the roof.
The Walt Disney Company, which has become a major backer of large-scale musicals, has taken a special interest in Theater Under the Stars. One of its biggest hits, "Beauty and the Beast," had its world premiere here in 1993. Two years later it decided to open "Lion King" here, but since the old auditorium did not have special features for such an elaborate show, the premiere was moved to Minneapolis.
That episode shocked city officials and corporate donors into agreeing to build a new hall especially for musicals. Disney's chief executive, Michael Eisner, signaled his interest in producing shows here by flying in for the gala opening on May 18.
Former President George Bush was also in attendance. Kenneth Lay, the fallen chairman of the Houston-based energy giant Enron, was a co-chairman of the committee that organized the gala, but did not appear. Enron pledged $500,000 to the fund-raising drive and delivered $400,000 before it collapsed into bankruptcy.
The new Hobby Center, designed by Robert A. M. Stern, has a soaring glass facade and a high-ceilinged lobby dominated by a colorful wall drawing by Sol LeWitt. It looks daringly modern from outside, but the interior has old-fashioned touches designed to evoke the music halls of bygone days. There are gently curved railings, gold-leaf columns and ceiling panels, private boxes decorated with intricate plaster lattice work and hand-carved wooden ornaments on the walls. 
The ceiling has a dome featuring 2,000 fiber-optic stars that are designed to evoke the open-air origin of Theater Under the Stars.
There is enormous private wealth in this city, despite the collapse of Enron and several other local corporations. When corporate leaders unite behind a project wallets open with remarkable speed.
The city provided just $13 million toward the cost of the Hobby Center, with the rest coming from private sources. Nearly $40 million of the $87 million in private contributions was raised from about 20 donors in the space of a few months. 
"When we were raising money for this building, we were riding an economic boom," said Bud Franks, president and chief executive of the Hobby Center. "Foundations were looking to give money away because of huge increases in portfolio value. But if we were setting out to raise this money today, I think we could still do it. This is such a unique community. The spirit of generosity in the corporate community and the leadership they show is amazing. We raised what I would consider quite a large sum of money, but we have not even scratched the surface of wealth in this community."
The show that will open the new theater, "Some Like It Hot," is typical of what Theater Under the Stars does best. It has appeal based on a beloved and light-hearted film, new songs, imaginative sets and star power in the person of Mr. Curtis. He portrays the aging roue played by Joe E. Brown in the film.
"How privileged I am that 40 years after I was in one of the greatest comedies in movie history, I get to come back in the play," he said during a break in rehearsals. "I don't want to get hokey or metaphysical, but when I look out into this wonderful hall, I feel Sinatra and Lemmon and all the other old guys sitting there. It can't help but pop into my mind."

 CORRECTION:
An Arts in America article on Tuesday about the development of new musicals in Houston and other cities for tours and perhaps eventually Broadway misidentified the Los Angeles theater that originated the current Broadway production of "Into the Woods." It is the Ahmanson Theater, not the Mark Taper Forum.

HEADLINE: Bonds Return to Southeast Asia 

BYLINE:  ByWAYNE ARNOLD 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, June 10 

 BODY:
International capital markets are offering Southeast Asian borrowers interest rates so low even Communists can't resist.
 The Socialist Republic of Vietnam, its Communist Party fresh from victory in last month's single-party elections, is now shopping for investment bankers to help it sell up to $500 million in government bonds to global investors later this year. 
 In preparation, it hired Standard & Poor's to rate its creditworthiness and ability to repay; last week, the agency gave Vietnam a BB-, a somewhat speculative rating on a par with Bulgaria and Belize, but above Turkey and Indonesia. That Vietnam is willing and able to borrow American dollars is a sign of how far the country has come since 1986 in opening its economy. 
Sovereign bonds are Wall Street's yardstick for a government's survival: the more confident investors are that a government will be around to pay them back, the less they generally charge to lend the country -- and its companies -- their money by buying bonds. 
On that yardstick, Southeast Asia seems healthier now than it has been in a long time. The difference, or spread, between what Southeast Asian governments have to pay lenders and what the United States Treasury pays has narrowed to levels unseen since the period before the 1997 regional financial crisis.
"To some extent, it's a vote of confidence in these economies -- they've come a long way," said William C. Belchere, head of economics and fixed-income strategy at Merrill Lynch in Singapore.
Attracted by the narrower spreads and the fact that American interest rates are themselves near 40-year lows, Southeast Asian governments and companies are issuing a deluge of new dollar- and euro-denominated bonds, some to refinance old higher-rate debt and some to gear up for the surge in export demand that should come as the United States economy recovers. So far in 2002, nearly $7 billion in such debt has been issued, after a total of a bit over $9 billion for all of last year, according to Barclays Capital. 
The trend began in Singapore and Malaysia, two fairly stable economies where investors, frustrated by poor returns last year in bearish stock markets, could dabble in higher-yielding Asian bonds without losing too much sleep.
Last month, the Malaysian state oil company Petroliam Nasional sold $2.7 billion in 10-year dollar and euro bonds, the biggest corporate Asian bond issue on record outside Japan. Most of the bonds were sold with an interest rate just 1.75 percentage points higher than comparable United States Treasuries.
"They got the appetite right," said Alan Greene, a director and credit analyst at Barclays in Singapore. "There is pent-up demand for Asian paper."
Now the region's riskier issuers are joining in. An Indonesian instant-noodle company, Indofood Sukses Makmur, plans a $200 million bond issue that would be the largest in dollars from Indonesia since the financial crisis. The Thai government is also weighing its first dollar bonds since the crisis.
But economists and analysts like Mr. Belchere and Mr. Greene say the hunger for Asian bonds may not be entirely healthy. Much of the demand, they say, is coming from Southeast Asia's banks, which are hesitant to make new loans while they still have problems with nonperforming old ones; they are buying bonds as an alternative parking place for deposits.
This "domestic bid" is heating up the region's bond markets and pushing down yields, to the point where some foreign investors question whether the low rates on the growing supply of Southeast Asian bonds adequately reflects the region's risks.
The Philippines, for example, has sold more than $2.5 billion in debt this year and plans to issue $1.6 billion more. But the government is falling short of its targets for shrinking its budget deficit, causing the bonds' prices to fall in secondary-market trading and yields to climb.
Mr. Belchere said there was also considerable demand for Asian bonds from investors who worry that global economic recovery may be weaker than expected, a concern that has depressed regional stock markets in recent weeks.
What does this mean for how Vietnam's bonds will be received? In explaining its rating, Standard & Poor's cited Vietnam's high savings rate, low levels of foreign debt and the bright potential for investment and exports in the wake of last year's bilateral trade agreement with the United States.
At the same time, the agency expressed concern about Vietnam's own budget deficit and its banks, which have their own troubles with nonperforming loans. Vietnamese state-owned companies are weak, its tax system is leaky and its monetary policy is too rigid, Standard & Poor's said.
Still, Mr. Greene at Barclays thinks the issue will find plenty of ready buyers, especially from its former enemy, the United States. 
"There's a certain intrigue," he said.

HEADLINE: Tristar Is in a Group That May Bid for KirchMedia 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, June 10 

 BODY:
German executives confirmed today that Columbia Tristar Television, owned by Sony, is part of a consortium that wants to bid for KirchMedia, the bankrupt company that controls Germany's biggest commercial television broadcaster.
 But despite the attraction of getting a major foothold in the German television market, possibly at a bargain-basement price, the potential pitfalls of acquiring KirchMedia are substantial. 
 Industry executives here say that potential buyers need to be on guard for hidden obligations and commitments inside the inscrutable organizational structure of its parent, the Kirch Group of Munich. 
In addition, there are big disagreements about the value of KirchMedia's film library, which is thought to be the company's second-biggest asset after its television networks.
KirchMedia, the major business unit of the Kirch Group, was forced to seek bankruptcy protection from creditors in May, in large part because the News Corporation walked away from a deal to inject $800 million into the company.
The bid now being discussed would be led by the WAZ Group, a large German newspaper publisher in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, and by Commerzbank, a major German bank. The Germans would acquire 40 percent of KirchMedia, with Columbia Tristar acquiring the remaining 20 percent.
German newspapers reported today that the bidding group might offer 2 billion euros, or about $1.8 billion, for the company. But several executives contacted today said the amount of the offer was still under discussion.
A spokesman for WAZ confirmed today that negotiations were taking place but that the amount to be bid remained unsettled.
KirchMedia owns 52 percent of ProSieben/Sat1, which in turn owns two of the biggest commercial television networks in Germany.
Columbia Tristar already produces several half-hour comedy shows for the German market, and the company is eager to develop a bigger outlet.
Because Columbia is owned by a Japanese corporation, it cannot follow the path of rivals like Walt Disney, the News Corporation or Viacom, which bought American television networks to secure distribution. Ownership of American broadcast licenses is limited by law to American citizens and companies.
That means Columbia has a somewhat greater interest than other Hollywood producers in bidding for outlets overseas like a partial stake in ProSieben/Sat1.
Even so, Columbia would be nothing more than a minority partner in KirchMedia, and would own only 11 percent of the broadcasting operations, under the bid being discussed.
KirchMedia's plight stemmed primarily from its ties to Kirch's money-losing pay television operation, Premiere. KirchMedia supplied much of the programming that is broadcast over Premiere, but Premiere was losing nearly $1 billion a year, in part because of high fees it agreed to pay for other programs, like sports and feature films.
KirchMedia's other problem was Germany's slumping economy, which caused a steep slump in advertising revenue the last year.
Nevertheless, KirchMedia's networks have a big share of the German audience, and they provide a potentially valuable platform for companies that want to sell programming in Germany.
"KirchMedia is a very interesting proposition," said one industry executive who is not involved in the talks now under way.
The market value of ProSieben/Sat1, whose preferred shares are traded publicly on the Frankfurt stock exchange, has plunged from about 2.5 billion euros a year ago to less than 1.5 billion euros today, he said. The shares rose about 7 percent today on news of the possible bid, closing at 10.29 euros.

 BODY:
Passenger Traffic Fell At Airports in 2001
 Last year, passenger traffic at the world's top 700 airports was down 3 percent over 2000, and off 6 percent in North America, reports the Airports Council International, a trade group.
 Still, airports in the United States continued to lead rankings of the world's busiest. Atlanta Hartsfield International handled the most passengers in 2001, 75.8 million, down 5.4 percent from 2000. Next in the top five were O'Hare International in Chicago, 66.8 million, down 6.9 percent; Los Angeles International, 61 million, down 8.3 percent; Heathrow International in London, 60.7 million, down 6 percent; and Haneda Airport in Tokyo, 58.3 million, up 4.1 percent. 
 Among the top 20 world airports, San Francisco International had by far the biggest annual drop in 2001, with passenger traffic at 34.6 million, off 15.7 percent.

Browsing Offers Little To Corporate Fliers
 Consumer Reports Travel Letter is getting a lot of attention with its current cover article comparing online travel-booking sites. The stop-the-presses conclusion: You can save a few dollars by shopping around.
The newsletter, which is mostly read by leisure travelers, found that the three top Web sites, Expedia, Travelocity and Orbitz, outperformed smaller competitors in delivering the lowest fares. 
The travel letter's editor, William McGee, said that airline consumers "are clearly price driven," with little regard for which airlines they fly.
Time being money, though, business travelers may not find much value in spending an hour or so browsing the Internet to save $10, especially when the fire-sale-level cheapest fares often require inconvenient layovers on unfamiliar airlines, travel agents countered. Besides, Internet bottom-feeding is not always the cheapest way to fly, especially for corporate travelers.
At a conference of the Association of Corporate Travel Executives in Montreal last month, travel agents presented an independent audit done in April showing that corporate clients could save an average of 27 percent buying airline tickets through a travel agent rather than booking themselves online. (Since airlines have eliminated travel agent commissions, agents usually charge a booking fee of $25 or so a ticket.)
Blake Fleetwood, the president of Planetarium Travel in New York, said that travel agents who routinely compared their fares with Internet offerings had been finding that the widespread perception that the Internet fares were invariably cheaper was unfounded, especially for travelers like businesspeople and vacationers with schedules that aren't especially flexible.
"My customers generally won't use" Internet travel-booking sites, he said. "They find they don't have the flexibility or the time to spend browsing. But if you're a 20-year-old student who can fly anytime you want and don't mind stopping one or two times, and don't mind taking no-name airlines, they're great."

Study Finds Reduction In Business Air Travel
 Major airlines fervently hope that business travelers will return to the fold in full force and at full fare once the economy perks up, but the Business Travel Coalition has more bad news for them on that front.
Throughout May, the group surveyed more than 400 of the most frequent business travelers, people who anticipate buying an average of 38 round-trip airline tickets this year. The findings: An expected overall reduction of 10.6 percent in air trips; growing inclination to book well in advance for cheaper fares, even at a cost of some scheduling inconvenience; and more use of low-fare carriers. About a fifth suggested the changes in behavior were permanent, no matter what the major airlines did. Also, 40 percent said they had already replaced some air travel with car or train trips.

Complaint Phone Line On Airport Screening
 Got a complaint about the way you were treated at the security gate? The Transportation Security Administration has a Consumer Hot Line number to hear complaints about the airport screening process. It is open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Eastern time on weekdays and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday. The number is (866) 289-9673. In a spot-check yesterday, the line was answered promptly and courteously. JOE SHARKEY

HEADLINE: After a 'Dirty Bomb' Explodes 

 BODY:
The age of terrorism is forcing all of us to learn a whole new vocabulary that describes potential threats and their consequences, if for no other reason than to calibrate how terrified we should be as each new menace emerges. The latest worry came yesterday with the revelation by Attorney General John Ashcroft that an American terrorist associated with Al Qaeda has been planning to explode a radiation-laced "dirty bomb" in the United States. We can fervently hope that no such weapon is ever exploded here. But should one ever be detonated, it is important to know that the number of fatalities would probably be small. The chief impact would be psychological and economic. Dirty bombs are not mass killers, they are weapons designed to inspire panic and cause disruption. 
 What makes dirty bombs one of the more worrisome threats is that they would be relatively easy to make from materials that are widely available. Such a bomb could consist of a conventional explosive surrounded by radioactive materials that are used in tens of thousands of industrial and medical devices in this country. Although these materials are supposed to be under some degree of control, their ubiquity makes it hard to guarantee that some won't be stolen or bought by a terrorist. 
 The conventional explosives in a dirty bomb can kill people or destroy buildings in the immediate vicinity. But their signature consequence would be release of a radioactive cloud that could contaminate a significant area with low-level radiation.
Mr. Ashcroft overstated the likely damage when he said a dirty bomb could cause "mass death and injury." Experts who testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in March suggested that the number of fatalities would be small, possibly measured in the dozens. The impact would be nothing like a crude nuclear weapon that might kill tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people. But the radioactive material dispersed by the blast could contaminate a large swath of a city, force residents to evacuate, and cost billions of dollars to clean up and additional billions in disrupted economic activity. The radioactivity might not be as dangerous as anthrax, but it would be every bit as disruptive, if not more so.

HEADLINE: Must You Have the Bags They Say You Must Have? 

BYLINE:  By CATHY HORYN

 BODY:
Mombasa -- not the East African seaport but the chic Saint Laurent handbag -- arrived in stores last December and immediately sold out. Bergdorf Goodman, which had cautiously ordered only 60 of the $700 bags because of concern about the economy, asked for another 500, received 420 and ran an ad for the horn-handled Mombasa as the must-have accessory for spring. On March 6, under the headline "Mombasa's the One?" Women's Wear Daily reported that demand for the bag "had reached a fever pitch" and noted a waiting list at the Saint Laurent boutique in New York.
 All this persuaded Tom Ford, the creative director of Saint Laurent and its parent company, Gucci Group, that he had a hit. And it was not the first time Mr. Ford had seen one of his bags take off. In 1999, he re-introduced the Jackie bag at Gucci (named after -- who else? -- Jacqueline Kennedy), and it sold more than a million of them. But this was the first time he had succeeded with Saint Laurent, which had no accessories image when Gucci acquired the brand three years ago. And now, thanks to one hot bag, accessories represent 26 percent of Saint Laurent's sales, about $90 million last year, said Domenico de Sole, the chief executive of Gucci Group. 
 As Mr. Ford, who astutely gave the coveted Mombasa to Gwyneth Paltrow as well as to a few prominent editors, said, "Having a strong bag at Saint Laurent was very key."
Ever since Prada made black nylon chic in the early 1990's, handbags have been fashion's big wheel, churning out profits -- and profit margins -- exceeding 40 percent. One can think of any number of hit bags, all memorably named and all gathering impressive numbers: at the top, the Fendi baguette (600,000) and the Prada bowling ball bag (160,000). That bag was also given out to editors -- 50 in New York alone. 
But is the Mombasa really in that league? Indeed, has the phenomenon of the hit bag begun to cool just as the Mombasa arrives? Mary Alice Stephenson, the fashion director at Harper's Bazaar, said she loved the Mombasa Mr. Ford sent her in December -- wore it, too. But the other day, she said: "My Mombasa is retired. It was laid to rest right after the March collections."
Michelle Kessler Sanders, the accessories director at Vogue, was also on Mr. Ford's gift list. But while she felt Mombasa merited news coverage ("It was news," she said), she chose not to automatically carry the bag herself, sticking instead with a Gucci favorite or one by Carlos Falchi. As Ms. Sanders said, "I knew they had sent the bag to other editors, and I didn't want what they had."
And what about those much-ballyhooed waiting lists for the Mombasa? As recently as two weeks ago, Ronald L. Frasch, the president of Bergdorf Goodman, was quoted in an article as saying, "You can't get ahold of that bag now." Yet anyone shopping in Bergdorf's last Thursday had a choice of at least a dozen Mombasas. 
Mr. Frasch did not return this reporter's phone calls, but Robert Burke, the store's fashion director, said the end-of-season surplus did not present a problem; after all, the store had sold more than 500 of the style at full price. Still, Mr. Burke said, with any hot product, "as quickly as it goes up, it can just as quickly drop off." And after seeing Saint Laurent's resort line, with its variations on the Mombasa, he wondered if the bag has legs to go beyond another season or two.
Another retailer who voiced similar doubts was Majed al-Sabah, who owns Villa Moda in Kuwait. He sold 150 Mombasas and ordered 250 more. But yesterday, Mr. Sabah said: "I was in the Saint Laurent showroom, and it was full of Mombasas. I happen to be at the point where I'm sick of it. The first thing that drives a bag is its shape. But once you own it in leather, in canvas, or with an oxidized handle, you don't need another. We need to see some new silhouettes."
Mr. Ford will not say how many Mombasas were sold, citing company policy. But he disputes the suggestion that his bag -- designed with Simonetta Ciampa, who used to be at Prada -- does not have staying power. He said the Mombasa was meant to accomplish a larger goal. "It gives us a vocabulary that we can translate into a much broader range of products," he said. "What bamboo is to Gucci, horn is now to Saint Laurent."
One thing Mr. Ford does agree with -- and it might seem a curious contradiction coming from one of the industry's chief pacesetters -- is that the notion of a hit bag may be finished. "I think people want something that's more individual," he said.
No one holds this paradoxical view more stubbornly than Miuccia Prada. "Well, I hate bags because I'm a snob," Ms. Prada said with a laugh as she and her husband, Patrizio Bertelli, spoke over lunch last month in Milan. "We retired two bags from the market because they were hits. One was a kind of Chanel bag in nylon, which was a joke for me. The other was a minimalist nylon bag. Any time a bag is selling too much, it can destroy your image."
Fabio Zanbernardi, who works with Ms. Prada on accessory design, pointed out that Prada's top-selling bag this season, a moon-shaped shoulder bag with a large buckle closure, received scant attention from fashion editors. Nor was it featured in Ms. Prada's spring runway show. Nonetheless, the bag has generated sales of 69,630. "It probably sold more than Mombasa," Mr. Zanbernardi said.
Ms. Prada added: "We weren't crazy about that bag. It's a great commercial bag, but it's not really important from a fashion point of view. We put a bag in the show because we believe in it. The bowling ball bag was relevant for that collection. And when we have that combination, with the clothes, we're really successful."
In fact, in the last decade, bags have swung from hard to soft, minimalist to ornate, as clothes have changed. The embellished Fendi baguette, designed by Silvia Venturini in 1996, supplanted the chaste Prada backpack. It also dramatically lifted the fortunes of the Fendi, which, as Ms. Venturini said modestly, "was a little bit sleeping, with striped logo bags that were selling in duty-free shops."
What set the baguette apart was its neat ladylike shape, which could be adorned in countless way -- and the fact that editors were given first crack at Fendi sample sales, where bags that might sell for $1,000 were reduced to less than $100. "Girls were running in, grabbing 10 bags each," Ms. Stephenson recalled. "That created a huge frenzy for the bag." 
Yet it has proven hard to duplicate the success of the baguette, which still accounts for about half the bag sales in Fendi's Rome store and has developed a collector's following for its handmade model, the Lasio, which costs about $12,000. 
This spring, Ms. Venturini brought out an oyster-shaped bag called the Ostrik, which has generated sales of 21,000. She and her staff worked on the design during a period that coincided with Mr. Bertelli's ownership of Fendi (with LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton). Concerned that the bag's design might find its way to Prada, Ms. Venturini kept it from him until the day of the show. "We hid it in a box in the toilet," she said. 
As Mr. Ford suggested, though, consumers may be of a different mind these days. Mr. Burke pointed to the revival of Mr. Falchi, while editors invariably mention the word-of-mouth success of the Balenciaga bag. Last week in New York, store buyers were viewing Gucci's resort line, praising the novelty of a large drawstring bag covered with grommets that will sell for $3,900. 
That collection, especially the new logo canvas bag, made Mr. Sabah croon, too. "They've done them with leather and suede and all new hardware," he said. "It's the same stupid canvas, but it's so fashion-driven. It will be big."

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Urged to Be Selective on Terrorism Insurance 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
An executive of a leading consumer advocacy group called yesterday for the government to take a highly selective approach to protecting businesses against big losses from terrorist attacks, saying that terrorism insurance was widely available from commercial carriers.
 Only in cases of prominent buildings in New York and other large cities should the government back terrorism insurance policies, J. Robert Hunter, the director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America, said in an interview. 
 The group, which says it is speaking on behalf of taxpayers, is taking a stand at a time when the Senate is considering legislation that would have the government pay 90 percent of the financial losses in a terrorist attack in excess of $10 billion. Such a broad plan, Mr. Hunter said, would place too high a burden on taxpayers. 
Besides calling for only selective government intervention, he said his group was urging Congress to make it easier for businesses to form insurance cooperatives to provide terrorism coverage at lower cost than commercial insurers charge.
"I think there is a terrorism insurance problem, but it's a very sort of targeted problem," Mr. Hunter said. "Taxpayers should not be asked to pay for coverage that businesses themselves can buy."
Insurers, bankers and real estate businesses that are lobbying for government intervention insist that adequate coverage is still not available. "Everything we see says there is a minimal amount of coverage available," said Julie Rochman, a spokeswoman for the American Insurance Association, a trade group in Washington.
But some insurance brokers tell a different story. Several say that outside big cities, the vast majority of businesses -- those with annual revenue of $500 million or less -- have been able to arrange for terrorism coverage along with their general property insurance, although it often comes at an extra cost.
Even in New York, the picture has improved sharply from the immediate aftermath of Sept. 11, when insurers simply refused to provide coverage for terrorist attacks.
"It is available, for the most part, at a price," said Walter L. Harris, the president of Tanenbaum-Harber, a brokerage firm providing coverage for big New York City buildings.
Still, several owners of big buildings in New York said that they were unable to obtain as much coverage as they wanted and that prices for terrorism coverage often equaled or exceeded the cost of their general insurance coverage.
Brokers also said that companies with large concentrations of employees were having difficulty obtaining workers' compensation coverage. Regulators require that workers' compensation insurance include protection against terrorism. As a result, some carriers simply refuse to sell workers' compensation coverage at all, said Damian Testa, a senior executive at Kay Insurance Associates in Manhattan.
Moody's and Fitch Ratings, two big bond-rating agencies, have begun reviewing terrorism coverage on about two dozen big buildings, mainly in New York. If they find the coverage lacking, they say, they may downgrade their ratings of the debt on the buildings. Yesterday, however, the other big rating agency, Standard & Poor's, said the status of terrorism coverage would not affect its ratings. 
Legislation on terrorism coverage has been stalled in the Senate since late last year. Many senators say they favor helping businesses on terrorism coverage, but Democrats and Republicans disagree on the extent to which victims of terrorism should be able to bring lawsuits. Republicans tend to favor tighter restrictions. Last Friday, Senate Democrats said they were pushing ahead to bring the terrorism insurance issue to a vote even without agreement from the Republicans. 
Yesterday, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and other top economic officials in the Bush administration spoke in favor of a broad terrorism insurance program. But they warned against permitting "predatory lawsuits."
And some business executives said they feared that the wrangling might in effect kill the legislation.

PERSON: John J. Gotti 

HEADLINE: John Gotti Dies in Prison at 61; Mafia Boss Relished the Spotlight 

BYLINE:  By SELWYN RAAB 

 BODY:
John J. Gotti, who seized control of the Gambino crime family in a murderous coup, flaunted his power during a flamboyant reign as a Mafia boss, and then spent the last years of his life locked away in a maximum security penitentiary, his gang in shambles, died yesterday at the federal prison hospital at Springfield, Mo. He was 61.
 The cause was cancer. In 1998, Mr. Gotti was operated on for neck and head cancer. He had been re-admitted to the hospital several times since then for treatment. 
 Traditional Mafia leaders led publicity-shy lives. Not so Mr. Gotti, who reveled in media attention as the boss of the nation's largest and most influential organized crime group. He cut a colorful figure in New York City, wining and dining in elegant restaurants and nightspots surrounded by a coterie of bodyguards. 
From late 1985, when Mr. Gotti engineered the assassination of his predecessor, Paul Castellano, to 1992, when he was sent to a federal prison for life, Mr. Gotti's swagger and seeming immunity from punishment earned him mythic gangster status.
In tabloid argot, he was the Teflon Don, evading successful prosecution, or the Dapper Don, for his smart appearance. At the peak of his power, his silvery hair was styled in a swept-back coiffure, and he favored $2,000 Brioni double-breasted suits accessorized by $400 handpainted floral silk ties.
Salvatore Gravano, the right-hand man to Mr. Gotti as the underboss of the Gambino crime family before he defected to become a government witness and helped bring down his boss, said Mr. Gotti viewed himself as Robin Hood, admired and respected by the world. Mr. Gravano, known as Sammy the Bull, once asked him if he disliked people staring at him. "No, no," Mr. Gotti replied. "This is my public, Sammy. They love me."
"He was the first media don," said J. Bruce Mouw, a former F.B.I. agent who supervised the unit that uncovered the evidence that ultimately convicted Mr. Gotti. "He never tried to hide the fact that he was a superboss."
But when he was put on trial, Mr. Gotti never acknowledged that he was a Mafia leader. Outside the courtroom he responded to questions about being a mob kingpin by replying with a grin, "I'm the boss of my family, my wife and kids."
Mr. Gotti's penchant for public contradiction -- the image of the hard-working family man who nonetheless seemed to lead the life of a Hollywood celebrity -- was famously transparent. He claimed his income derived from a $100,000-a-year salary as a plumbing supply salesman and a job with a garment accessories firm.
Mob turncoats and investigators asserted that Mr. Gotti received $10 million to $12 million in cash every year as his share of the proceeds from the Gambino family's criminal activities. Mr. Gravano testified that he personally gave Mr. Gotti more than $1 million a year from shakedowns in the construction industry.
Mob defectors said that Mr. Gotti boasted that his role model was Albert Anastasia, the founder of Murder Incorporated, a group of killers used by the Mafia in the 1930's and 40's to carry out gangland executions. Mr. Gotti, according to Mr. Gravano, said that he had acquired his gift for guile and ruthlessness by reading Machiavelli's "Prince."
In contrast to the amiable personality Mr. Gotti displayed in public, secretly recorded tapes and testimony from former mobsters painted a picture of a narcissistic tyrant with a furious temper who betrayed allies and who ordered the slayings of Gambino loyalists he suspected of being informers or who he thought had not shown him proper respect. 
Those who prosecuted him said Mr. Gotti's need for absolute authority and his lust for vast wealth led to a recklessness that contributed to his downfall and undermined the entire Gambino family. By insisting that his lieutenants meet frequently and directly with him, he provided prosecutors with evidence to obtain court-authorized bugs that helped to convict the entire Gambino hierarchy in the 1990's.
On the day of Mr. Gotti's conviction for murder and racketeering, James M. Fox, the head of the F.B.I. office in New York, proclaimed: "The Teflon is gone. The don is covered with Velcro, and all the charges stuck."
John Joseph Gotti was born in the South Bronx on Oct. 27, 1940, the fifth of 13 children raised by his father, John, and his mother, Fannie, both children of immigrants. Mr. Gotti's father, an often unemployed day laborer, led a hardscrabble life. The Gottis moved often before settling in the blue-collar East New York section of Brooklyn when John was 12.
East New York was then a battleground for rival youth gangs. Mr. Gotti, a strapping adolescent with fast fists, became the leader of a gang called the Fulton-Rockaway Boys. During his teenage years in the 1950's, storefronts in the neighborhood were hangouts for mobsters, and Mr. Gotti ran errands for members of an underworld club in the neighborhood headed by Carmine Fatico, a capo (captain) of a crew in the Gambino family. It was through club members that Mr. Gotti was introduced to Aniello Dellacroce, his future mentor in the Gambino family.

Trading School for Crime
 A poor student with disciplinary problems, Mr. Gotti dropped out of Franklin K. Lane High School in Queens when he was 16. By 18, he was ranked by the Police Department as a low-level associate or "wannabe" in the Fatico crew.
In the next eight years, Mr. Gotti's arrest record described a path of petty crimes from street fighting to public intoxication to stealing cars. Several of his nine recorded arrests in that period were in the company of a boyhood friend, Angelo Ruggiero, a nephew of Mr. Dellacroce. None led to penalties of more than six months in a county jail.
Mr. Gotti's first major arrest came in 1968, when he, his brother Gene and Mr. Ruggiero were charged by the F.B.I. with committing three cargo thefts and truck hijackings near Kennedy International Airport. The three men pleaded guilty to reduced counts and John Gotti served a three-year sentence.
While Mr. Gotti was in prison, the Fatico gang moved from East New York to a storefront in Ozone Park, Queens. The new headquarters was incorporated -- perhaps sardonically -- as a nonprofit association, and named the Bergin Hunt and Fish Club. The name apparently was a misspelling of Bergen Street in East New York.
Soon after Mr. Gotti's release in 1972 on the hijacking conviction, his underworld career got some help. Mr. Fatico, facing a prison sentence for loan-sharking, decided on temporary retirement and designated Mr. Gotti to run the gang temporarily.
As an acting crew chief, Mr. Gotti met frequently with Mr. Dellacroce, the underboss of the Gambino crime family, who took a shine to him. In 1973, a nephew of Carlo Gambino, the family leader, was abducted and murdered. The family's intelligence network determined that a stick-up man, James McBratney, had been one of the kidnappers. According to investigators and informers, Mr. Gotti was handed the important assignment of exacting revenge.
Mr. McBratney was shot dead outside a Staten Island bar in an ambush by three men. But it was hardly a flawless crime; witnesses picked out two of the men, Mr. Gotti and Mr. Ruggiero, from rogues' gallery photographs. Mr. Gotti was arrested in 1974 after evading capture for a year.
Carlo Gambino hired Roy M. Cohn to represent Mr. Gotti and Mr. Ruggiero. Although both defendants had been indicted on murder charges and identified by witnesses, Mr. Cohn negotiated a remarkable deal with the Staten Island district attorney's office. In exchange for reduced charges of attempted manslaughter, Mr. Gotti and Mr. Ruggiero pleaded guilty, and each received a prison term of four years.
Mr. Gotti spent the term lifting weights and obtaining unusual perquisites. He was taken from prison in upstate New York for visits to his new home in Howard Beach, Queens, and to restaurants in New York City, where he met with criminal friends. State investigators later determined that prison authorities and guards had been bribed.
In 1976, while Mr. Gotti was still in prison, Carlo Gambino died. By normal rights of succession, the family's underboss, Mr. Dellacroce, should have been elevated. But Mr. Gambino had anointed his brother-in-law, Paul Castellano, as heir. As a consolation prize, Mr. Castellano allowed Mr. Dellacroce to remain as underboss and to control 10 of the gang's 23 crews. By creating two factions, Mr. Castellano planted the seeds of his own destruction.
Paroled in 1977, Mr. Gotti left prison a muscular, barrel-chested, broad-shouldered figure, 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighing about 200 pounds. Returning to the city, he was promoted by Mr. Dellacroce to full-fledged capo of the Bergin crew.
Mr. Gotti was a popular figure in Howard Beach, where he lived in a modest home with his wife, Victoria, and their two daughters and three sons. In March 1980, one of his children, 12-year-old Frank, steered his bicycle into the road and was killed by a car driven by a neighbor, John Favara. Frank's death was ruled accidental, but four months later, while Mr. Gotti and his wife were in Florida, witnesses saw Mr. Favara being clubbed over the head and then shoved into a van that sped away. Mr. Favara, not seen since, is presumed to have been murdered. Mr. Gotti denied any knowledge of Mr. Favara's disappearance.

Becoming a Target
 By the early 1980's, Mr. Gotti's prominence in the Gambino family had turned him into a major target for federal and city prosecutors. The Queens district attorney's office installed a concealed microphone and a telephone tap in the Bergin club in 1981.
The eavesdropping revealed Mr. Gotti's ruthless control over a crew that included his younger brother, Gene, and Angelo Ruggiero.
In 1985, major federal indictments exploded against Mr. Gotti and his closest associates. He and Mr. Dellacroce were accused of racketeering charges that carried penalties of life sentences. Gene Gotti and Mr. Ruggiero, in a separate case, were indicted on heroin trafficking charges. The narcotics charge infuriated Mr. Castellano, who as the Gambino family boss prohibited drug deals under penalty of death. Mr. Castellano feared such deals would unleash government crackdowns and result in long prison sentences that might induce convicted traffickers to become informers. Under Mr. Castellano's rules, John Gotti was responsible for the misdeeds of his crew members.
Mr. Gotti asked Mr. Dellacroce to intervene with Mr. Castellano, but before any resolution was made, Mr. Dellacroce died of cancer in December 1985. Two weeks later, on the evening of Dec. 16, 1985, Mr. Castellano and his new underboss, Thomas Billotti, were gunned down by a team of assassins in front of Sparks Steak House on East 46th Street near Third Avenue in Manhattan.
Mr. Gravano later testified that he and Mr. Gotti had watched the shootings from a parked car. He said Mr. Gotti had arranged the killings as a pre-emptive strike to prevent Mr. Castellano from killing him and his allies.
As the new head of the Gambino family, Mr. Gotti immediately faced two trials from old criminal complaints. In 1984, a refrigerator repairman, Romual Piecyk, accused Mr. Gotti of slapping him and taking $325 in cash from him during a parking dispute in Queens. When he identified Mr. Gotti, Mr. Piecyk was unaware of his reputation as a mobster. On the witness stand, a tense Mr. Piecyk could no longer recognize Mr. Gotti, and a state judge dismissed the charges.
The second trial began in August 1986 in Brooklyn, with Mr. Gotti, his brother Gene and five others accused of federal charges that they had violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act by being members of a criminal enterprise. But the government's case was handled by a prosecutor who had never tried a complex Mafia case before. Mr. Gotti was defended by Bruce Cutler, a former assistant district attorney in Brooklyn.
The jury acquitted Mr. Gotti and the other defendants on all counts of racketeering and conspiracy. Gene Gotti, however, was subsequently convicted of the charges that he had trafficked in heroin, the allegation that had so angered Mr. Castellano.
The verdict against John Gotti may have been tainted. The foreman of the jury was later convicted of accepting a $60,000 bribe arranged by Mr. Gravano to vote for acquittals and to prevent a unanimous verdict, as required for convictions.

Appearing Invincible
 It was the most stinging courtroom defeat suffered by the Justice Department in its campaign against the Mafia. Law enforcement officials grudgingly conceded that Mr. Gotti's back-to-back legal victories had wrapped him in a cloak of invincibility. 
Mr. Gotti became organized crime's most significant symbol of resistance to law enforcement since Al Capone in Chicago 60 years earlier. If he spotted detectives on stakeouts, he was known to taunt them by rubbing one index finger against another and mouthing the words: "Naughty, naughty."
Usually, he began his working day at noon at the Bergin club. He installed a barber's chair where he sat while his hair was cut, washed and blow-dried every day.
In late afternoon, he was driven to his main headquarters in Little Italy, the Ravenite Social Club on Mulberry Street, which had been Mr. Dellacroce's base. The top members of the Gambino hierarchy were required to report to him four or five times a week. According to Mr. Gravano, these appointments allowed the F.B.I to videotape, identify and compile a who's who of the family's leaders.
Mr. Gotti assumed command of the family when it had 23 active crews, about 300 made (inducted) members and more than 2,000 associates (men who hoped to become made members and who cooperated in criminal enterprises). The Gambino organizational structure was similar to that of New York City's four other longstanding Mafia groups: the Bonanno, Colombo, Genovese and Luchese factions.
Mr. Gotti found himself at the center of a cornucopia of illegal profits, with all members and associates funneling shares of their loot to him.
Investigators estimated that the Gambino family in the mid-1980's grossed about $500 million a year, primarily from illegal activities in the New York area and Florida. Under the direction of Carlo Gambino and Paul Castellano, the family had expanded from a gang specializing in gambling, loan-sharking and stealing into more sophisticated operations, like extorting money from unions, garment manufacturers, garbage-carting companies and food suppliers; stealing gasoline excise taxes; and engaging in stock fraud. Unlike Mr. Gambino and Mr. Castellano, Mr. Gotti also met openly with known narcotics traffickers.
Law enforcement efforts persisted against him, and Mr. Gotti found himself in court again in 1990. He was tried in Manhattan on a New York State indictment charging that he had ordered the shooting of a carpenters' union president after a labor dispute. Again, he was acquitted despite evidence from tapes secretly recorded at the Bergin club in which he was heard discussing preparations for the shooting and despite testimony from a participant in the plot.
Later, a New York City police officer assigned to the investigation was arrested and convicted on charges that he was in the employ of the Gambino family and supplied the names and addresses of the jurors to the gang. But no charges of jury tampering in that case were brought.
In early 1990, while the state trial was proceeding in Manhattan, F.B.I. technicians in a separate investigation installed eavesdropping equipment in an apartment above the Ravenite Social Club. For several months, the bugs recorded conversations that implicated Mr. Gotti, Mr. Gravano and the family's consigliere, Frank Locascio, in crimes like murder, bribery, loan-sharking, gambling and obstruction of justice.

A Final Trial as Boss
 Mr. Gotti and his co-defendants were arrested at the Ravenite Club in December 1990. This time the authorities had a trump card. Mr. Gravano had made a deal with the prosecution to testify.
On April 2, 1992, Mr. Gotti and Mr. Locascio were convicted by a jury in federal court; Mr. Gotti on all 13 counts against him, including a racketeering charge that cited him for five murders, and related charges of murder, conspiracy, gambling, obstruction of justice and tax fraud.
Arms folded and smirking, Mr. Gotti declined to say anything before he was sentenced to life imprisonment. Mr. Gravano received a five-year sentence.
The same day he was sentenced, Mr. Gotti was put aboard a plane and flown to the maximum-security federal prison in Marion, Ill.
Soon after his conviction, Mr. Gotti, according to federal prosecutors, appointed his eldest son, John A. Gotti, known as Junior, the acting boss of the Gambino family. In 1999, his son pleaded guilty to federal racketeering charges involving the Gambino family and was sentenced to six years and five months in prison.
Mr. Gotti is survived by his wife, the former Victoria DiGiorgio, his son John A., and his brothers, Gene, who is serving a 50-year sentence for heroin trafficking, and Peter. Mr. Gotti is also survived by another son, Peter, two daughters, Victoria, a successful author of mysteries, and Angel Gotti Forca; three other brothers, Richard, Vincent and Dominick; and 11 grandchildren.
In the last decade, the declining fortunes of the Gambino family have been reflected, in some measure, by a reduction in the power wielded by the city's other four traditional Mafia clans.
Beginning in the 1980's and gaining momentum in the 1990's with the defection of Mr. Gravano and other high-level mob figures, federal and state authorities focused on the mob's control of certain industries and corrupt unions. From garbage carting and construction to the garment center and the waterfront, the authorities improved their use of racketeering laws to loosen the mob's control.
After Mr. Gotti's imprisonment, investigators said they believed that he was trying to cling to power through his brother Peter. But by 1999, the authorities said, the family was down to about 11 crews and its influence was waning. Peter Gotti, his brother Richard, and seven others were indicted last week in Brooklyn on federal racketeering charges involving extortion and money-laundering on the New York waterfront.
From 1992 until 2000, Mr. Gotti was kept in virtual solitary confinement, restricted to his cell except for an hour of daily exercise.
"He was obsessed with his own importance," Mr. Mouw said of Mr. Gotti and his fall. "He gave his own status a higher priority than Cosa Nostra. He was convinced that no jury would ever convict him because he was John Gotti, a caesar, an emperor."

HEADLINE: Splitsville's Sad Song: 'I Said I Do but Now I Don't' 

BYLINE:  By SARA RIMER 

DATELINE: TIPTONVILLE, Tenn., June 7 

 BODY:
In the small office on Main Street that houses Tiptonville's city hall, chamber of commerce and history museum, Fran Hearn, the treasurer and water clerk, was speaking up for marriage this afternoon.
 "In July we'll celebrate our 33rd anniversary," said Mrs. Hearn, 52, who is married, happily, she says, to James Hearn Jr., 54, a retired Chevrolet dealer. "I'm in a dinner club with nine other women, and they've all been married 25, 30 and 35 years." 
 The recreation director, Tony Wallace, 41, walked in to pick up his paycheck. As Mrs. Hearn and everyone else at city hall know, Mr. Wallace's marriage was shaky from the start, and after a divorce, he is raising his three children alone.
"Used to be everyone got married, stayed married," he said. "It don't work that way anymore."
Marriage and divorce, love and heartbreak were the talk of Lake County, a corn-and-cotton region of some 8,000 people on the banks of the Mississippi, as new Census Bureau statistics were publicized this week. As the weekly Lake County Banner reported on its front page, Lake County in 2000 had the highest proportion of divorced people in the state: 14.1 percent. (San Juan County, Colo., had the highest in the nation: 19.13 percent.)
Experts say the numbers here were almost certainly skewed by the two state prisons, with their 2,000 inmates counted by the Census Bureau. Even without the inmates, the experts say there are so many variables in divorce statistics that the census figures do not mean much, other than that there are a lot of divorced people in Lake County, as there are in a lot of other places.
Still, the story in The Banner had people here and in the surrounding counties asking the same questions posed by a thousand country-music songs: What wears love down? Why do people get divorced?
"When I married, I thought it would be for keeps," said the Lake County sheriff, Danny Tippit, 49, seated behind his desk, across the street from Fran Hearn's office.
He and his wife called it quits five years ago, after nearly 18 years of marriage and one son. "Law enforcement, the hours, wearing a badge," Sheriff Tippit said, listing the strains.
"If I had it to do all over," he said, "I wouldn't put my career before my family."
People marry younger here than in big cities, and looking back on her first marriage, Renee Bledsoe, who was 18 then, 37 now, says she was too immature and scarred by her own parents' breakup to make it work.
"All I wanted to be was somebody's mother and somebody's wife," said Mrs. Bledsoe, who runs the Southern Style day spa in Ridgley (population 1,670), a 20-minute drive south from Tiptonville (population 2,440). "I was going to fix everything. When you're broken, you can't fix anything. Two broken people don't make a whole. They make a mess."
Mrs. Bledsoe was talking at the Abundant Life Pentecostal Church, where she is a member. She ended her first marriage after three years because her husband, she said, besides being irresponsible, was unwilling to accept Christ.
This is the Bible Belt, where preachers blame a dissolution of morals for divorce and tell couples to work harder at staying together. 
"My aunt said, 'You do not have a scriptural right to divorce,' " Mrs. Bledsoe said. "I told her, 'You're not living with him.' "
Twelve years ago, she married Rob Bledsoe, an electrician. "I met him at a party. He was drunk and needed a ride home. He asked me out. I said, 'I'll make you a deal. I'll go out with you if you go to church with me on Sunday.' "
"There's days you might not want to be married," Mrs. Bledsoe said. "But you're committed. Everyone doesn't bloom roses every day."
Seventeen miles south on Highway 78, James Mooring, 24, who lives in Tiptonville and works at the Caterpillar plant in Dyersburg, was on dinner break at the Grecian Steakhouse.
"I want a family so bad I can't stand it," said Mr. Mooring, who is known as Bubba. "I was brought up in a tight family. We did everything together. I was blinded, I wanted it so bad."
Three years ago, he married a woman he had been dating for a few months because she was pregnant. "I loved her, I just wasn't totally in love," he said. "But I said, I'm just going to make the best of it. As long as she's happy, I'll be happy."
As it turned out, neither of them was happy. "We were arguing, both partying and doing things we shouldn't have," he said.
Their divorce was final in December. He has custody of their daughter, Madison Jane.
"You've got to know someone before you say, 'That's who I want to spend my life with,' " he said.
Lake County, where Mr. Mooring is from, is hurting economically, with the two prisons and a plastics factory the largest employers around. There are more factories in Dyersburg, but people there are also struggling.
Money problems and more show up at the office of Skip Riley, the biggest divorce lawyer in Dyersburg. While he views commitment as the key to making marriage work, Mr. Riley, who is himself divorced, understands that some marriages should end. "I don't think anybody deserves hell here on earth," he said.

HEADLINE: Some in Yonkers Say Ballpark Plan Would Unfairly Take Their Turf 

BYLINE:  By WINNIE HU

DATELINE: YONKERS, June 7 

 BODY:
In his City Hall office here, the deputy mayor keeps a cherished Norman Rockwell picture that reminds him of growing up in northeast Yonkers: three rosy-cheeked boys, toting a baseball bat and mitt, plead with developers not to bulldoze their neighborhood ballpark.
 But these days, the deputy mayor, Philip Amicone, looks at the framed image with frustration. Dozens of Yonkers residents have been protesting at City Hall not because they might lose a ballpark but because Mr. Amicone and others want to build one in their downtown neighborhood. 
 Mr. Amicone and the mayor, John D. Spencer, announced plans in April for a 6,500-seat stadium that would be the home for a new minor-league baseball team in the Atlantic League and anchor redevelopment in this faded city on the lower Hudson. The $42 million project would include sky boxes, concession stands and 100,000 square feet for restaurants, bars and stores. 
But to make way for the stadium, the city would demolish two blocks of New Main Street off Getty Square, displacing 20 businesses including a Korean dress store, a Chinese gift shop and two Mexican restaurants, as well as an apartment building. These business owners and their supporters have organized rallies, signed petitions and made tearful pleas to the City Council.
Their neighborhood hardly resembles a Norman Rockwell painting -- a bustling, motley warren of tired brick walk-ups, where colorful storefronts bear handmade signs in several languages. But as Yonkers, like many other aging cities across the New York region, tries to lure back well-to-do patrons who long ago decamped to the suburbs, the protest has forced a debate about whether redevelopment is fair to the people who never left.
Mr. Amicone and others say a stadium would provide inexpensive family entertainment and generate up to $80 million a year in revenues within the city. But their opponents say it would devastate the businesses already there and turn a diverse immigrant neighborhood into a sterile showplace for high-end chain stores and restaurants. "Everyone likes baseball, but this is not the right spot," said Jose Rodrigues, adding that he spent $360,000 last year to renovate his sports bar on New Main Street and could not afford to move. "If they do this, they're going to cut my legs. I'll have to sell everything I have and start from zero."
For now, neither side is backing down. The seven-member City Council, which has final say on the project, is holding public hearings and conducting an environmental review that could take months to complete. "I have concerns and reservations," said Councilman Gordon A. Burrows, the majority leader. 
Further complicating things, the project has become mired in the partisan politics that dominate city government here. Supporters of Mr. Spencer, a strong-willed mayor with no shortage of critics, have accused "anti-Spencer forces," including some council members, of trying to derail the stadium to thwart him. Others have said the mayor is foisting a bad project on an unwilling city.
The stadium proposal is the latest in a string of redevelopment projects along the downtown waterfront. In the last five years, more than $200 million in public and private money has been spent on new construction (including a $54 million library and education center), renovations of historic buildings and a Victorian-style pier, and parking and street improvements. An additional $200 million in private development is planned for the next year.
"We're recreating what downtown Yonkers used to be," Mr. Amicone said on a recent tour of the waterfront. "For years, it had deteriorated and it was seen as a city in failure."
Yonkers officials began negotiating more than two years ago with Mary-Jane Foster and her husband, Jack McGregor, who helped found the Bridgeport Bluefish in Bridgeport, Conn., to start a team in Yonkers. The Bluefish are one of eight teams in the Atlantic League, which includes the Newark Bears and the Long Island Ducks.
The Yonkers ballpark would be paid for by leasing the space to the baseball team and retail businesses, and by drawing on the city's non-tax revenue sources, state development grants and private investors. It would occupy 12 acres known as Chicken Island, in memory of a long-defunct chicken processing plant that was bounded by the Saw Mill River. A city-owned parking lot covers most of the site, and the city would buy or seize the rest through eminent domain.
Mr. Amicone said that other locations had been considered for the stadium, including Tibbetts Brook Park and Yonkers Raceway, but that the downtown site offered the best mix of transportation, parking and economic benefits. Besides minor-league games, he said, the stadium would feature Little League championships, concerts and perhaps even a circus in the off-season.
Many downtown residents and workers share this vision. At the Emerald Diner, more than 50 people signed a petition last week in support of the project. "There's an Italian saying, 'In order to make an omelet, you have to break some shells,' " said George Rodriguez, a waiter. "Nothing is easy in life, and sometimes you need to make sacrifices. The idea is to improve the community and the area."
But Peter Leibowitz, a computer consultant, said he would rather see the city fix existing buildings on New Main Street. "I think it would be a great loss to Yonkers to lose the flavor of this neighborhood," he said.
While the city has seized other downtown property for redevelopment, this is the first time in recent years that it would affect so many businesses. The city previously relocated about 100 residents -- paying the difference between their old and new rents for five years -- and six businesses, including a deli and a dentist's office. "Some of them resisted, but eventually they moved," Mr. Amicone said.
He said the city would hire independent appraisers to ensure that property owners on New Main Street got a fair price, and offer money and assistance to businesses that have to relocate. "We're not trying to move them out and shut them down," he said. "We're trying to relocate them so that when we rebuild the downtown, they will also benefit from the influx of people."
But these business and property owners say that they took a chance on the downtown in the years when no one else would. Attracted by low rents, they opened stores and cultivated a loyal clientele. Now they say that they cannot afford to move to another downtown location because rents have risen so much with the redevelopment. "I work hard and I bought this for my retirement," said Suzy Jung, who opened Suzy's Fashions here in 1985. "Now my retirement plan is all gone. I can't sleep."
Martin Goldman, who owns the C. H. Martin department store chain, has taped newspaper stories about the stadium to his glass doors and given petitions for customers to sign. "We have nine other stores, but this is like a child to me," he said. "I take it personally."
As word of the stadium has spread, the embattled businesses have been showered with advice, prayers and encouraging words from their regular customers. Some have pledged to boycott the new stadium and stores. Others just want to snatch up the bargains here while they last. "Customers ask you: 'When are you going out of business? When are you having a big sale?' " said David Mahabal, an immigrant from Guyana whose department store draws more than 1,500 customers a week. "I say: 'I'm still here. I try to survive.' "

HEADLINE: Cities and States Clamor to Be Bio Town, U.S.A. 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TORONTO, June 10 

 BODY:
Michigan is spending $1 billion to create a "life sciences corridor." St. Louis bills itself as the BioBelt, while Hawaii boasts of its biodiversity. 
 Cities and states across the United States are committing billions of dollars to become centers of the biotechnology industry, just as they once tried to attract computer and microchip companies to emulate Silicon Valley. 
 "This used to be a bicoastal phenomenon," said Walter H. Plosila, a vice president of the Battelle Memorial Institute, a technology research and development organization in Columbus, Ohio, referring to the fact that most biotechnology companies are on the East and West Coasts. "But clearly you're seeing bioscience as a much bigger focus across places that people wouldn't think about." 
The recruitment of biotechnology companies reached a fever pitch at the industry's annual convention here. And, with the conference this year being held outside the United States, it seems the fever, and the sloganeering, has spread internationally. The Netherlands has its Bio-Delta; Switzerland has the BioAlps near Geneva and Basel's BioValley; Singapore claims to be "the Biopolis of Asia"; and even Saudi Arabia is laying plans for Jeddah BioCity. 
In the United States, 41 states have some program aimed at spurring development of the life sciences, according to a survey last year by Battelle for the Biotechnology Industry Organization, the trade group that is sponsoring the convention. At least 16 states are spending part of the money they received from the tobacco lawsuit settlement on items like research and commercial development. 
For BIO, as the trade group is called, the efforts mean more than money. "It extends our political reach," said Carl B. Feldbaum, the group's president. In some states, industry leaders are fighting proposed restrictions on therapeutic cloning or genetically engineered crops by arguing that such legislation would make the state inhospitable to the industry. 
The reason for the state interest is clear. Biotechnology is perceived to be an industry of the future with high-paying jobs, especially now that the Internet bubble has burst. 
"You go where the money is," the commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development, Tony Grande, said recently. 
But luring such industries will require new economic development strategies for many states, which have focused on attracting large factories like Nissan's auto plant in Tennessee, which employs nearly 5,000. "Now we're trying to make our incentives apply to companies that might be bringing in only 50 people," Mr. Grande said. 
Some economic development experts say that many places trying to become biotechnology centers will fail. "The apparent scale of research funding required for becoming a biotechnology center may be beyond the reach of most metropolitan areas," according to a report being issued this week by the Brookings Institution. The report says that nine areas, all on the coasts, account for three-quarters of the biotechnology companies formed in the last decade. 
The Boston and San Francisco areas, where the industry had its start in the 1970's, are the leaders, the report said, with San Diego, Seattle and Raleigh-Durham in North Carolina having developed substantial industries. The other four are New York and Philadelphia, the homes of the pharmaceutical industry; Washington-Baltimore, which benefits from being near the National Institutes of Health; and Los Angeles, home of Amgen, the largest biotech company. 
The nine areas accounted for more than 60 percent of spending by the National Institutes of Health, which finances medical research, the report says. Another necessary ingredient is venture capital, the report says, and eight of nine venture capital dollars invested in biotechnology in the last six years were in the nine centers, the report said. 
Even for places that succeed, biotechnology might not be the economic salvation some envision because the industry does not employ many people, especially blue-collar workers. The biotech industry in the United States, with 1,457 companies, employs 191,000 people, according to a report by Ernst & Young.
The Brookings report notes that even in the nine major centers, the sector accounts for only 3.5 percent of all manufacturing employment. 
Because of their concentration, the biotech centers can attract companies even though costs are higher there. Novartis recently said it would build a research headquarters near Boston to tap into the activity there. 
IDEC Pharmaceuticals, a San Diego company, considered building a plant in San Antonio, where land was less expensive than in California. But it decided to build 20 miles north of its headquarters, so it could monitor the project better, said the chief financial officer, Phillip M. Scheider. 
Still, officials in many states say the industry is in its infancy with many opportunities. Some say they will focus on specific niches, like agriculture for St. Louis, marine biotechnology for Hawaii and genetically modified tobacco for Kentucky. 
Kentucky has been trying to lure academic stars to the universities by supplementing their salaries with its "Bucks for Brains" program. Wisconsin has directed that about $65 million of its public employee pension funds be invested in young life-sciences companies. 
Perhaps the most prominent effort is in Michigan, which is spending $50 million a year for 20 years, or $1 billion, from the state's share of the tobacco settlement to nurture a life sciences corridor from Detroit to Grand Rapids. The money supports academic research and commercial development. Douglas Rothwell, president of the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, said 22 companies had either started up or moved to the state last year, up from almost none before the program began a few years ago. 
One company, Asterand, which supplies tissue samples for biomedical research, set up in the middle of Detroit at Wayne State University, from where burnt-out buildings are visible. 
Randal Charlton, the chief executive of Asterand, who had been working in Florida, said he had misgivings on his first visit to the proposed site. "I went down with my wife and I said, 'Don't stop, Honey, just drive straight by.' It was terrible."
But Mr. Charlton said laboratory space cost a quarter of what it did in Boston, and Wayne State provided a faculty member to work for the company for a reasonable fee. 
Pennsylvania says it will spend $2 billion of its tobacco money. It recently committed $100 million to set up incubators to help companies start. 
New York State this year allocated $225 million for the Gen*NY*sis program to support biotech research. In New York City, a business incubator to house fledgling companies is being set up at the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn. Other incubators are proposed, including one for Lower Manhattan. New York City has leading medical research centers but has not been considered a good place to start companies, in part because of the expensive real estate. 
So far, there has been little opposition to state and local efforts to spur biotechnology development. But experts say it will take 10 to 20 years for the efforts to bear fruit. But governments may have trouble sustaining support for the bio industry, especially during budget squeezes like the ones many states and municipalities are now enduring. 
Faced with more immediate needs or competing demands, officials or various interest groups have proposed cutting back biotech financing in several states. New York State's Gen*NY*sis program is getting less than half the money initially envisioned.

HEADLINE: Poll Finds New York Fearful, But Upbeat Over Future, Too 

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY and MARJORIE CONNELLY 

 BODY:
Nine months after the destruction of the World Trade Center, New Yorkers say they are struggling with the psychological fallout from the attack, with many avoiding visits to skyscrapers, landmarks and stadiums, and reporting persistent anxiety and sleeplessness, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News poll.
 And while most New Yorkers say their daily routine has returned to normal, an overwhelming number say they are "personally very concerned" that their city will be struck again by terrorists, the poll found. 
 Still, for all that, New Yorkers remain, over all, extraordinarily optimistic about the immediate health of New York and its long-term future. The number of people who think that New York will be a better place to live in 10 or 15 years is higher than it was the month before the attack.
Nearly two-thirds of respondents said that given a choice, they would prefer to be living in New York City four years from now than anyplace else. And notwithstanding the fact that the city is facing its worst budget crisis in at least 20 years, with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg warning of tougher times ahead, most respondents said they considered the city economy to be in good shape. 
And in one striking change in attitude, two-thirds of respondents, including half of black New Yorkers, said racial relations were generally good in New York -- the highest percentage since The Times began asking that question in 1988.
The departure of Rudolph W. Giuliani and the election of Mr. Bloomberg seem to account for a good deal of that shift in attitude. Mr. Bloomberg gets much higher ratings in dealing with race relations than his predecessor. He is also more popular among black New Yorkers than Mr. Giuliani was at the same point in his first term in office.
Even in this time of overall anxiety, education has, more than ever, emerged as the clear top concern of New Yorkers. An overwhelming majority of New York City parents who were polled said they were unhappy with the condition of New York City schools, and this is the one area in which Mr. Bloomberg did not receive good marks.
The poll, however, was taken just as Mr. Bloomberg negotiated successfully with Albany leaders to overhaul the way the school system is managed; that could change New Yorkers' perception of his handling of the issue.
More than that, the Times/CBS News poll suggested that New Yorkers are not quite sure what to make of their new mayor. Nearly half of all New Yorkers said they approved of the way Mr. Bloomberg was handling his job, but a quarter said they did not have an opinion of him six months into his first term. (By contrast, 85 percent of respondents said they approved of the job Mr. Giuliani was doing as mayor when the question was asked last October; just 5 percent were unable to offer an opinion.)
The Times/CBS News telephone poll, which began Tuesday and was completed Sunday, involved 940 adults in New York City. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
The poll was awash in contradictory sentiments, a portrait of a city that is going through traumatic times, trying to balance optimism and hope for the future with a clear sense of fearfulness and resignation to a belief that New York City will again be the subject of an attack.
On one hand, New Yorkers expressed deep confidence in their city; nearly 85 percent of respondents said they were very or somewhat confident that New York's economy would recover from the terrorist attack. Yet 60 percent said they thought that the threat of a terrorist attack in New York City was greater than it was in any other big city.
There were a number of indications in the poll that New Yorkers are feeling less secure than they did just 10 months ago. Last August, nearly 60 percent said they thought New York City was a safer city than it had been four years ago. In this latest poll, barely 40 percent of respondents said that.
Although that question was originally intended to measure fear of crime, it has clearly come to encompass a fear of being the victim of terrorism as well.
"I'm always looking around," James P. Brickley, 38, a managing director at a human rights consulting firm who lives on the Upper West Side, said in a follow-up interview. "When I hear a plane, I'm always looking up. When I'm on the subway, I'm always wondering if someone's going to do something crazy."
The sense of insecurity found in the poll might have been heightened because it was taken just as the White House was issuing alerts about potential future terrorist attacks. Whatever the cause, an undercurrent of nervousness was evident in many of the responses. Half of the respondents said that security at New York City airports, bridges and tunnels and nuclear plants was not sufficient.
One in three said that attacks made them less likely to attend crowd events, such as baseball games, which have been identified by federal officials as possible targets of terrorist attacks. More than one-third of subway riders said they were uneasy while riding underground, while one-quarter of New Yorkers who visit or work in skyscrapers said the experience left them on edge.
"I think twice about going to crowded areas," Arlyne Schneiderman, 56, an administrative assistant in an oil company who lives in Morris Park in the Bronx, said in a follow-up interview. "When the crowds go into New York, I go out. I think twice about going to a concert. I think twice about going to a parade. I used to go to Yankee games and football games, and now I don't."
Respondents seemed to think that an attack was almost inevitable, and likely to happen in New York: 70 percent said that an attack on the United States in the next few months was somewhat or very likely. And 60 percent said they thought the likelihood of an attack in New York City was higher than it was in other cities.
Nearly one-third said they felt nervous or on edge since the attacks; another third said they had felt that way, but no longer did. And 16 percent said they were still having trouble sleeping.
"I don't think anything in history compares to this," said George Timm, 40, who works as a caterer. "This is a whole new chapter and it's a very dark chapter."
For all that, though, the poll was filled with indications that New Yorkers are feeling confident about the city on a variety of fronts.
Most strikingly, given the past 20 years in the city, was the favorable attitude on racial relations. Most New Yorkers said they approved of how Mr. Bloomberg, who has proven to be much less confrontational than Mr. Giuliani, has handled race relations in New York; 4 in 10 blacks said they approved of Mr. Bloomberg's performance on this front.
That is one of the biggest differences in the perceptions of the former mayor and the current one. In June 1994, six months after Mr. Giuliani took office, 70 percent of white respondents said they approved of his performance, compared with just 25 percent of blacks. Although there is a racial gap for Mr. Bloomberg as well, it is nowhere near as great: 56 percent of whites and 39 percent of blacks expressed approval of his job performance.
Still, Mr. Bloomberg remains something of an undefined figure. For example, half of all New Yorkers said they were undecided or had not heard enough about their new mayor to say whether they had a favorable opinion of him. 
Of the remainder, 36 percent did express a favorable opinion of him; just 12 percent said they had an unfavorable view.
Mr. Giuliani is viewed more positively than he has ever been. Nearly three-quarters of New Yorkers said they held a favorable opinion of him, including nearly half of all blacks.
If there is one issue on which Mr. Bloomberg's performance was questioned it involves the public school system. One-third of respondents said that improving public schools should be the No. 1 priority of the mayor; Mr. Bloomberg's relentless focus on the issue over the past six months suggests that he might have been reading similar polls.
Still, 40 percent said they were unhappy with Mr. Bloomberg's performance in this area, and 21 percent said Mr. Bloomberg was not doing as good a job with schools as his predecessor.
The concern about public schools is particularly acute among parents: 70 percent of parents of school-aged children said they were unhappy with the quality of education in the public school system. Almost 30 percent of parents said that attracting and keeping good teachers was the biggest challenge facing the school system. About 15 percent said the problem was a lack of funding.

How the Poll Was Conducted
The latest New York Times/CBS News poll is based on telephone interviews of 940 adults conducted June 4 through June 9 in all parts of New York City.
Interviews were conducted in English or Spanish. 
The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of city exchanges. The exchanges were chosen to ensure that each area in the city was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus permitting access to listed and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the survey respondent.
The results have been weighted to take account of household size and the number of telephone lines into the residence, and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to borough, race, sex, age, education and Hispanic descent.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all adult New Yorkers.
For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error. Differences in the wording and order of questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat varying results.

HEADLINE: TRACES OF TERROR: NEWS ANALYSIS; 
A Message In an Arrest

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 10 

 BODY:
The Bush administration's announcement today that a man had been arrested in an alleged plot to build a "dirty" radioactive bomb seemed to reinforce its repeated warnings that the brain of Al Qaeda, and thus the threat, were still alive. 
 The arrest of the man, Jose Padilla, raised the possibility that some dispersed and hidden terrorist command is still actively trying to strike the United States, and that it was focused as recently as last month on some of the most fear-inspiring weapons, like radiological bombs -- literally, bundles of dynamite or other explosives strapped to containers of radioactive material. 
 For the president, the drama of the dirty-bomb threat and its successful interdiction also sent a clear warning to those Congressional leaders who are preparing to focus a long political season on how the nation's intelligence-gathering system broke down during Mr. Bush's watch. 
Today's disclosure may well galvanize Americans once again behind the president and the notion that the country remains at war, even as Congress moves ahead with its review of American intelligence failures that allowed Osama bin Laden and members of his Qaeda terrorist network to attack the country on Sept. 11.
It seems all but certain that the inevitable collision of war and politics will be at the forefront in Washington for some time. Since Congress began its inquiry into intelligence lapses, the White House has pursued a more muscular strategy to demonstrate it is moving aggressively to deal with the continuing threats. 
There was Mr. Bush's abrupt decision last week to create a cabinet-level Department of Homeland Security, an idea he had previously resisted. And there were White House leaks showcasing new investigative leads and new connections between the terrorists who plotted the unsuccessful 1993 attack on the World Trade Center and those who finished the job so ruthlessly last September.
The president's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said no political considerations were involved in timing today's announcement of the dirty bomb plot. But to underscore its importance, the disclosure by Attorney General John Ashcroft was broadcast from Moscow, where he was visiting on unrelated business. 
Politics aside, today marked the latest -- and perhaps most frightening -- episode in a sequence of terrorist acts or threats.
First, there was the alleged Dec. 22 attempt by a suspect, Richard C. Reid, to detonate explosives loaded into the soles of his shoes while flying on a commercial flight from Paris to Miami. On April 11, a truck bomb in Tunisia killed 19 people -- 14 of them German tourists -- in an attack that French and German intelligence officials believe was directed by Al Qaeda. Then, on May 8, a bomb in Karachi, Pakistan, killed 11 French naval engineers, a blast also believed to be the work of Al Qaeda.
Senior administration officials never tire of saying they remain deeply troubled that another major attack on the United States is inevitable, raising concern enough. But just suggest "nuclear," and the alarm needle lurches across the meter.
Indeed, the whole affair -- what little could be learned about how the C.I.A. and F.B.I. detected it in Pakistan and shadowed Mr. Padilla, who took the name Abdullah al-Muhajir, all the way to O'Hare International Airport in Chicago -- appeared to take the nation's breath away. The details of the alleged plot were especially sparse on whether the suspect had any prospect of carrying out a mission that depended on something he conspicuously did not have: access to radioactive material.
Paul D. Wolfowitz, the deputy secretary of defense, did not overstate the threat from Mr. Padilla.
"This was still in the initial planning stages. It certainly wasn't at the point of having a specific target," Mr. Wolfowitz said, adding that it was the job of Mr. Padilla, an American citizen, to return to the United States to conduct reconnaissance for Al Qaeda.
"But it does underscore, I think, the continuing importance of focusing particularly on those people who may be pursuing chemical or biological or nuclear weapons," Mr. Wolfowitz said. "This is but one such individual."
James R. Schlesinger, the former secretary of defense who also served as director of central intelligence during the Nixon administration, said the prospect that Mr. Padilla was likely to build a dirty bomb was "not realistic." 
"He would have to be a lot smarter than the average Al Qaeda member to build a radiological weapon," Mr. Schlesinger said.
Even so, Mr. Schlesinger considered the administration's effort to billboard its success to be proper. Not only would it disarm critics, he noted, but, more important, it could deter future bombers.
"The intent was there, the threat was there," Mr. Schlesinger said. Thus, "it was a criminal act."
"If we feel we can constrain stalkers," he added, "then I think we can also constrain people who want to build radiological bombs."
Such weapons have long been dismissed as having no military utility. But in the new age of terror, the notion is back of a non-nuclear radiological weapon, one that uses the poisonous effects of radiation to spread panic and disrupt the economy. 
Such a bomb could contaminate a wide area, and though it would probably not cause many deaths, the cleanup costs and the fear of exposure would result in a devastating psychological and physiological impact on the affected population -- as happened after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster of 1986.
In a season of security jitters, where the failure to apprehend Osama bin Laden now competes with new concerns about nuclear war between India and Pakistan, Mr. Schlesinger said the administration was "quite right" to sound the alarm.
Yet there was little escape from the sense that a daunting array of threats remain. 
"This is going to be around for a long time," Mr. Schlesinger said. "It is not like Grenada."

HEADLINE: Tentative Pact for City Teachers Increases Pay, and Workweek 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and New York City's teachers' union announced a tentative contract yesterday that calls for raises of 16 percent to 22 percent over 30 months, putting the city in a better competitive position to hire the 10,000 teachers the mayor says it needs by September.
 The settlement, while giving the teachers a much larger raise than other city workers have received, will add 100 minutes to the teachers' workweek, time that can be used for instruction or training. The settlement also eases -- but not nearly as much as the mayor had hoped -- some of the longstanding work rules he wanted changed, like restrictions against assigning teachers to keep order in school cafeterias. 
 Some education experts say that Mr. Bloomberg's failure to gain more sweeping changes in work rules will limit his ability to improve instruction for the city's 1.1 million children in public schools, even with the recent agreement by state legislative leaders giving the mayor political control of the schools system. 
With an annual cost of about $950 million, the teacher raises will undoubtedly complicate Mr. Bloomberg's efforts to erase a projected $5 billion budget deficit. The mayor has often complained that the state has provided only a one-shot infusion of $275 million to help finance recurring raises for teachers. The double-digit raises could also pressure the city to be more generous to the two major municipal unions that remain without a contract, the police and firefighters.
Still, the agreement -- which expires on May 31, 2003 -- ends the biggest labor dispute facing the mayor. The old contract for the city's 80,000 public school teachers expired 19 months ago.
Compared with New York City's other recent labor agreements, the teachers' raises are unusually large. With the city needing 10,000 new teachers by September, the United Federation of Teachers had argued that a raise of 20 percent or more was needed to make teacher salaries competitive with higher-paying suburbs and to enable the city to recruit and retain enough teachers.
Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy said the double-digit raises were key to improving teacher quality. "Let the word go out that the New York City school system pays competitively and has solid professional development and is eager to hire top-quality teachers," he said.
The tentative agreement will raise the city's teacher salaries to nearly the level of those in some nearby school districts, including Newark and Mount Vernon, but salaries will still lag behind those in many wealthy suburbs, like Scarsdale.
The pay increases, much of them retroactive, will raise the pay for new teachers to $39,000 from the current $31,900, a 22 percent increase, and will raise the pay for the most experienced teachers to $81,231, from the current $70,000, a 16 percent increase.
For fifth-year teachers with a master's degree, pay will rise to $45,506 from $38,598, an 18 percent increase. In Newark, a fifth-year teacher receives $45,900 and in Scarsdale, $58,913.
In Newark, starting pay is $40,000 and the top of the scale is $80,108. In Scarsdale, the starting salary is $41,488 and the maximum, $106,305.
Randi Weingarten, the union's president, said, "For the first time in at least a decade the city has taken a major step to solve the teacher shortage, and although this is not perfect, this agreement has made a great stride toward ensuring teacher quality and making the job of teaching in New York City more attractive."
Mayor Bloomberg repeatedly asserted that it would be hard for the city to afford a pay increase above the 9 percent given to most other city unions. But city officials said yesterday that they were pleased that in exchange for the increase, the teachers had agreed to a school day that is 20 minutes longer on average.
The city agreed to the teacher raises after the state promised the $275 million to help finance them and after a state fact-finding panel recommended a 16 percent increase in exchange for a longer school day. City officials said they had already set aside nearly $500 million to pay for the contract.
At a City Hall news conference last night with Gov. George E. Pataki and Ms. Weingarten, Mr. Bloomberg acknowledged that it might be difficult to finance the contract, but he insisted that the raises were the right thing to do.
"Long-term the best thing that we can do for the economy is the same thing that we can do for humanity, and that is to educate our children," he said.
The union's delegate assembly is to vote on the settlement tomorrow, and mail ballots are to be sent out late this week.
District Council 37 and most other city unions received raises of 9 percent over 27 months in contracts that averaged a 4 percent annual raise. They said the accord gave a 10 percent raise over 30 months, and added an additional 6 percent in exchange for increased productivity in the form of a longer school day.
Officials with the city and the teachers' union said repeatedly that the agreement called for a 16 percent raise across the board. They were reluctant to acknowledge that about 45 percent of teachers -- those with less than seven years experience -- would receive raises of more than 16 percent with the aim of slowing the exodus of new teachers. One-fourth of new teachers leave before their second year.
In one of the most difficult issues, the two sides split the difference over what to do with the additional 20 minutes. Mayor Bloomberg said most of the extra time should be used for classroom instruction, while the union wanted the time split between instruction and teacher training.
Under the accord, schools can either add 20 minutes a day or allocate the time into two weekly 50-minute blocks. The decision will be up to the superintendents of the city's 32 school districts.
In schools that add 20 minutes a day, that time is to be used for classroom instruction, city officials say. In schools that add 50-minute blocks, the time can be used for teacher training or for small-group instruction, like tutorials.
Mr. Bloomberg obtained only a modest change in a provision known as Circular 6, which he wanted to eliminate. That provision frees teachers from patrolling corridors or cafeterias and from taking nonteaching assignments, like working as a college adviser. Under the old contract, teachers had to do those jobs only if 75 percent of the teachers at the school voted to allow it.
The settlement will make it slightly easier to have teachers handle those responsibilities by requiring a vote of only 55 percent.
The agreement would also make it easier for the school system to dismiss incompetent teachers, after offering help to improve their teaching. In cases of misconduct involving sexual abuse or the sale or use of drugs or firearms, teachers may be suspended without pay for up to two months if a hearing finds probable cause that the charges are true.
"We've improved dismissal procedures," Mr. Levy said, "so that arbitrations and grievance procedures will no longer take three years, but from three to six months."

HEADLINE: EarthLink Will Acquire Corporate ComputerSeller 

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
PeoplePC, which briefly won acclaim during the Internet bubble as a model for how companies could encourage workers to get online, will be acquired by EarthLink, a leading Internet service provider, the two companies said yesterday.
 EarthLink will pay $10 million to $14.3 million and will be liable for roughly $35 million in services to existing PeoplePC customers. The price amounts, at most, to less than 2.45 cents a share in cash -- a substantial discount to the 10 cents a share at which PeoplePC finished trading Friday on the Nasdaq small-capitalization market. Yesterday, the shares fell 50 percent, to 5 cents. 
 The price reflects PeoplePC's tumble to the verge of bankruptcy since it went public in August 2000 at $10 a share. Softbank of Japan, the venture capital firm that controls about 70 percent of PeoplePC's stock, said yesterday that it supported the sale of the company. PeoplePC has just 560,000 subscribers compared with EarthLink's 4.9 million. 
"Scale is everything in just about any service business," said Charles G. Betty, chief executive of EarthLink, who said that the merger should allow PeoplePC to continue its services and cut costs while investing more in marketing.
EarthLink, for its part, is acquiring subscribers at a cost of roughly $80 each, just over half what the company pays to sign up new dial-up subscribers, according to analysts at Salomon Smith Barney. PeoplePC will become its brand for pursuing customers who want low-cost Internet access (PeoplePC's basic rate is $15.95 a month for individuals; EarthLink's is $21.95.).
PeoplePC will also give EarthLink another channel through which to reach companies and big groups like the Veterans of Foreign Wars, which recently chose PeoplePC to set up an Internet package for its members. In addition, PeoplePC's technology for finding the least expensive phone route to connect a caller to its network could help EarthLink cut operating expenses.
EarthLink investors seemed unimpressed, though. The company's shares fell 15 cents yesterday, to $6.32, a new 52-week low that is about 90 percent below the stock's peak in 1999.
PeoplePC is one of the last survivors of a group of ventures founded in the 1990's on the belief, now discredited, that a profitable business could be built by quickly attracting large numbers of Internet subscribers with free or near-free computer hardware and Internet access. 
PeoplePC's twist on the strategy was to focus on agreements with companies like Ford Motor, Delta Air Lines and The New York Times Company to offer tantalizing deals to their employees. Ford employees in the United States and the Philippines received personal computers, printers and unlimited Internet service for as little as $5 a month. More than 165,000 of the 188,000 eligible Ford workers signed up, and 158,000 of them became PeoplePC subscribers, a Ford spokesman, Paul Wood, said. 
By signing up subscribers in bulk, PeoplePC was able to negotiate bargain prices for the hardware it provided. In addition, its corporate partners subsidized the programs in the hope that putting computers in employees' homes would allow the companies to communicate with them economically.
Delta, for example, followed up the program by eliminating much of the paperwork involved in keeping pilots and flight attendants aware of their assignments.
As it turned out, though, relatively few companies saw value in subsidizing home connections to the Internet. The far more popular approach was to negotiate corporate discount agreements with equipment vendors like Compaq and Dell and make those discounts available to employees, according to Mark Margevicius, an analyst for the Gartner Group.
In addition, although PeoplePC counted on gaining revenue from online merchants who advertised products to its hundreds of thousands of subscribers, that stream slowed to a trickle as the Internet bubble burst.

HEADLINE: The Rove Doctrine 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Some months ago an academic colleague -- a man with strong Democratic connections -- urged me to write a couple of columns praising the Bush administration. "What should I praise?" I asked.
 There was a long pause -- funny, isn't it, how "balance" becomes a goal in itself? -- but eventually he came up with something: "How about its commitment to free trade?" 
 Ahem. In fact, George W. Bush has turned out to be quite protectionist. The steel tariff and the farm bill attracted the most attention, but they are part of a broader picture that includes the punitive (and almost completely unjustified) tariff on Canadian softwood lumber and the revocation of Caribbean trade privileges. When it comes to free trade, the Bush administration is all for it -- unless there is some political cost, however small, to honoring its alleged principles. 
Which brings me to the story that has Washington's political groupies twittering: that Esquire article in which the White House chief of staff, Andy Card, frets that with the moderating influence of Karen Hughes gone, the hard-liner Karl Rove will run the show. If the past 18 months have been what policy looks like with Mr. Rove only partly in control, one shudders to think what comes next. 
For the most distinctive feature of Mr. Rove's modus operandi is not his conservatism; it's his view that the administration should do whatever gives it a political advantage. This includes, of course, exploiting the war on terrorism -- something Mr. Rove has actually boasted about. But it also includes coddling special interests. 
One of Bill Clinton's underappreciated virtues was his considerable idealism when it came to economic policy. The Berkeley economist Brad DeLong lauded Mr. Clinton's "record of being willing to take major political risks in order to do what he thinks is right for the country as far as international economic policy is concerned." What he had in mind was the way Mr. Clinton went out on a limb, defying the polls and reaching across party lines, to pass the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993, and the even bigger risks he took to rescue Mexico from its financial crisis in 1995. Like Mr. DeLong, I know some of the key players in both of those decisions, and I'm sure that they were taken on the merits: the Clintonites really, truly believed they were doing the right thing. 
That scrupulousness continued to the end. If Bill Clinton had given the steel industry the tariffs it wanted, Al Gore would probably be living in the White House. But administration officials actually worried about the consequences -- for the nation, and for the world economy -- of giving in to special interests.
Mr. Rove's administration has no use for such niceties. The deals don't stop with trade and farm subsidies. As analysts at the Cato Institute point out, the Bush-Cheney energy plan may have been conservative in the sense that it was anti-environmentalist, but otherwise it was stuffed full of things free-marketeers are supposed to abhor: expanded government power to seize private land (for transmission lines), large tax incentives for energy sources that don't pay their way at market prices (nuclear power in particular). The energy plan wasn't about principles; it was about payback.
And if the administration won't take a stand on principle, who will? I was particularly struck by a story in the newspaper The Hill titled "Unions taking fresh look at G.O.P." It quoted the U.A.W. spokesman saying his union was "looking beyond party labels" to where politicians stand "on certain issues." In other words, his union will go with whoever caters to its special interests.
To some extent we've been here before. Paula Stern, the former head of the International Trade Commission, matter-of-factly describes Ronald Reagan as "the most protectionist president since Herbert Hoover," and says that he "legitimized efforts by powerful industries to use political muscle -- not necessarily economic merit or legal criteria" to get what they wanted. So in a way Mr. Bush is following in Mr. Reagan's footsteps. 
But it seems to me that it's worse this time -- that we are witnessing a race to the bottom in interest-driven politics, taking us to depths not seen since before the New Deal. And if that Esquire story is to be believed, it's about to get even worse. Smoot-Hawley, anyone?

HEADLINE: Clarifying the Bush Mideast Plan 

 BODY:
A good host caters to his guests. We hope, then, that it was hospitality, not a failure of leadership, that caused President Bush to offer such different messages in public appearances with Hosni Mubarak of Egypt on Saturday and Ariel Sharon, Israel's prime minister, yesterday. In President Mubarak's company at Camp David, Mr. Bush said the United States must start working immediately toward establishing a Palestinian state. In the Oval Office yesterday with Mr. Sharon, the president said that until there was sweeping reform of the Palestinian Authority there could be no progress on Mideast peace. 
 Reforms are indeed essential, but the United States must resist Mr. Sharon's demand that until they are in place there can be no negotiations on a Palestinian state. 
 Mr. Bush said late last week that he would soon address the American people on how he plans to move forward on the Middle East. His aides say that a statement, expected in the next week or two, will call for parallel movement toward three goals: improved security to end anti-Israel terror, rebuilding Palestinian institutions to establish a Palestinian state, and political negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians on all outstanding issues. A regional conference of foreign ministers planned for this summer should go ahead focused on these goals. Mr. Bush needs to make clear in his upcoming statement that all three processes will move forward at the same time.
If it were up to Mr. Sharon, there would be no discussion of Palestinian statehood until Palestinian terror attacks ceased, Yasir Arafat was no longer in power and a new, democratic Palestinian government had taken over. We too would be happy to see those changes, but making them preconditions for negotiations will only feed cynicism among Palestinians who believe that Israeli calls for reform are nothing more than delaying tactics.
In fact, there have been increased Palestinian calls for internal reform. Prominent Palestinians have publicly said that the competing security services should be consolidated, the judiciary made independent and corrupt economic officials fired. The Bush administration is rightly seeking to build on indigenous Palestinian efforts rather than imposing its own arrangements from outside. 
The administration has also correctly decided to steer away from the question of whether Mr. Arafat stays in power by focusing on ways to help the Palestinians restructure their institutions into more democratic and responsible ones. Turning Mr. Arafat into the central issue would make it impossible for other Palestinians to step forward. If all the concerned parties turn their attention to institutional reform, the outcome may be that Mr. Arafat finds himself without the power he has so badly abused.

HEADLINE: Effectiveness of Grants to Keep Jobs Downtown Is Questioned 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The American Stock Exchange is the latest company to get a cash grant from the state and city for remaining downtown.
 The exchange, which will get $3 million, was in no danger of leaving the city. In that sense, the exchange, which has 536 employees, is not unlike most, if not all, of the roughly two dozen other companies that have been designated so far for about $70 million in grants under a program using federal money to retain big employers or to attract them to Lower Manhattan after the attack on the World Trade Center. 
 The grant to the American Stock Exchange, and others like it, has spurred increasing criticism of the grant program by urban planners, good-government groups and economists who question whether the money could be better spent. That money, $500 million in federal funds designed to revitalize Lower Manhattan, has been designated for retention grants for 145 downtown companies with 200 or more employees. 
One critic is Christopher Jones, director of economic programs for the Regional Plan Association, who contends that the grants amount to corporate gifts. The grants are not large enough to persuade any company to remain downtown if it is already looking elsewhere, critics say. Yet the program does not focus on new industries that might relocate downtown and expand. In short, Mr. Jones said, there is no overall strategy.
The money, he and others said, could be better used to rebuild and improve the subway and PATH commuter systems downtown, projects costing billions of dollars.
State and city officials reject the criticism, saying that it is critical that they do everything they can to stabilize the economic base downtown, where tens of thousands of jobs have been lost because of the recession and the trade center attack. They said that companies receive an average of $3,500 per employee, but in return they commit themselves to maintaining a certain number of workers in Lower Manhattan for an average of nine years. If that promise is broken, the company is required to pay back as much as twice the amount of the grant.
"By providing financial incentives that include recapture provisions if they move jobs out of the City," said Andrew M. Alper, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, "we hope to tie these companies financially and emotionally to Lower Manhattan."
Critics said the ultimate beneficiaries may be companies like Lehman Brothers and downtown landlords who have space for rent. Those landlords can tell companies looking at vacant space to apply for government incentives, which are valued by brokers at about $10 a square foot, rather than lowering their rents to attract potential tenants.
"It seems to me the main effect of giving a grant to every large business downtown is to boost real estate values," said David Dyssegaard Kallick, senior fellow at the Fiscal Policy Institute. "There needs to be a focused economic development strategy that includes the creation of new jobs up and down the economic spectrum."
William Rudin, a downtown landlord, agreed that transportation, as well as electrical power, was critical to the future of Lower Manhattan. In the meantime, he said, that with Lehman Brothers, Salomon Smith Barney and other investment banks moving thousands of employees to Midtown and New Jersey, "you've got to stop the hemorrhaging" with cash grants, accelerated depreciation and tax breaks.
But critics focus on the recipients. Six months after American Express announced it would return to its headquarters at 3 World Financial Center with 4,000 employees, state and city officials announced in June that they had decided to give the company a $25 million grant. Tony Mitchell, a spokesman for American Express, said that the company based its decision not on cash grants, but on assurances that government would rebuild the transportation network and address its security concerns.
In contrast to past policies, the city has also granted incentives to law firms, like Cahill Gordon & Reindel and Stroock & Stroock & Lavan. 
The state and city are also in talks with Deutsche Bank and with the Bank of New York, which are determining how many employees they will keep downtown and how many they will move to Brooklyn or to New Jersey. The decision has nothing to do with downtown incentives, real estate brokers said, but rather with decisions to disperse their operations, rather than concentrating in one location, like Lower Manhattan.
Benjamin F. Needell, a lawyer at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, who has negotiated on behalf of many corporate clients, said: "If people are really thinking about moving, they won't take the grants. It's not enough money."
Still, Mr. Needell sees a purpose to the grant program.
"The companies commit to keeping jobs in Lower Manhattan," he said. "That's an insurance policy."
Richard Diver, chief operating officer of M&R Capital, a small downtown investment firm, said he altruistically refused to apply for benefits, in part because of widespread problems downtown and the city's $4 billion budget gap.
"Companies should be willing to takes less of a sweet pot, because Bloomberg has a tremendous budget gap," he said. "Will they?" Mr. Diver asked with a chuckle. "No."

HEADLINE: 6 Years of Talks End in Pact For Labrador Nickel Project 

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

DATELINE: TORONTO, June 11 

 BODY:
Capping six years of often acrimonious negotiation, the Toronto-based Inco Ltd. and the provincial government of Newfoundland signed an agreement today to develop one of the world's richest nickel and cobalt deposits, at Voisey's Bay, Labrador.
 Inco already supplies about one-quarter of the world's nickel, which is mainly used in making stainless steel, and it has another big new mine under construction on New Caledonia in the South Pacific. 
 Today's deal seeks to balance Inco's quest for an attractive return on the 4.3 billion Canadian dollars (about $3.2 billion at 1996 rates) that it paid for the Voisey's Bay deposit in 1996 with Newfoundland's insistence that the ore be processed locally to bolster the economy there, in Canada's most impoverished province. 
Scott M. Hand, Inco's chairman and chief executive, said during a conference call today, "We are confident that we have found solutions that are technically innovative and financially sound."
Mr. Hand said, however, that his company, founded in 1902, will probably take a significant second-quarter write-down on the Voisey's Bay deposit, which it now values at $3.7 billion.
Ronald Coll, a mining analyst at Thomson Kernaghan in Toronto, said the write-off would reflect the difference between Inco's investment in Voisey's Bay and "what they can get out of the project."
Mr. Coll said that nickel prices had fallen since the deposit was acquired, and that Inco paid a premium after a bidding war with its archrival, Falconbridge. Inco's share price fell 4 percent today, closing at $21.56 in New York.
Roger Grimes, the province's premier, told a signing ceremony in St. John's that the negotiations had been "quite an odyssey," but that "we had to strike a balance and make it happen." His predecessor, Brian Tobin, had denounced an Inco offer two years ago as having "more off-ramps than the 401," Canada's busiest highway.
Newfoundland is in a bad way economically, in great part because of the collapse of its mainstay industry, fishing, as cod stocks have all but disappeared from the North Atlantic. Despite a recent offshore oil boom, unemployment stood at 16.8 percent in May, more than double the national average of 7.7 percent.
Under today's agreement, Inco will spend about $1.9 billion to develop the Voisey's Bay mine and build an ore processing plant at a disused American naval base at Argentia on the south coast of Newfoundland. Production is expected to start in 2006.
The processing plant will initially be a small demonstration operation to test new hydrometallurgical technology for separating metal from ore. For the first two years, most ore concentrate from the mine will go to smelters in Ontario and Manitoba for processing.
In a crucial part of the deal, Inco has agreed that once Argentia is a full-scale refinery, it will bring in an equal volume of ore from elsewhere to process there.
Mr. Coll said he did not expect the simultaneous development of the New Caledonia and Labrador projects to depress world nickel prices.
"There are no other major nickel projects coming onstream in that time frame," he said.

Bondage's Load: Heavy Bricks, and Crushing Debt

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND BONNER 

DATELINE: MANZOORABAD, Pakistan 

 BODY:
In the full light of the sun, already blazing unmercifully so early in the morning, the women sat on their haunches, slapping moist clay and sand into large hunks, which they rolled over to their husbands. The men worked the stuff into a rectangular mold, and dumped it out as it hardened.
 Small children then loaded the unbaked bricks onto donkey carts to carry to the kiln. Covered with sweat and grime, the teen-age boys and old men who stoked the kiln were working almost literally in an inferno as they lifted the cover off a small hole and dropped in coal. 
 This is what bonded labor looks like in Pakistan. The practice, in which employers give high-interest loans to workers, whose entire families must then labor in an effort to pay off ever-mounting debt, is illegal, having been banned in 1992. It is also pervasive.
The use of bonded child labor is punishable by a $900 fine and five years in prison. The law has rarely, if ever, been enforced.
The 80 workers here -- men, women and children in 17 families -- have never been to school. They cannot read or write or count. They are not even sure how old they are, or how many hours a day they work.
What they do know is that they are in debt to the brick factory's owner, a debt from which they are unlikely to escape. Some may have borrowed money years ago, to pay for a special event like a wedding or funeral, or simply life's necessities. Others are paying off their parents' debts. 
Mazhar Husain, who thinks he is about 30, took over the debt from his parents, and now owes about 100,000 rupees, or roughly $2,000. He, his wife and three small children together earn about 3,000 rupees a month, or roughly $50.
"He can carry water," he said, pointing to his 3-year-old son, Taswar, explaining that the entire family works here at the Chaudhry Naseer Bricks Company. His daughter Rajan, who appears to be about 5 or 6, used to carry water. Now she sometimes molds clay alongside her mother.
The United States State Department, in its most recent human rights report on Pakistan, said, "Conservative estimates put the number of bonded workers at several million," despite the ban on the system a decade ago. "Strong social ties between employers and public officials at the local level further undercut the law's effectiveness," the report added.
Bonded laborers can be found on fishing boats and on farms. But most work in Pakistan's brick factories. Smokestacks like the 75-foot one belching black smoke here are a jarring sight throughout the country, rising out of rice paddies and wheat fields, wherever there is an ample supply of clay.
The owners of these brick factories know very well that bonded labor is illegal, said Naseer Ahmed Gondal, who owns this one. "It's a crime," he acknowledged. "The government says it is forced labor."
But, he said, he and other factory owners have no choice, given the harshness of the work. "It's very difficult to find workers," he said. "We give them loans so they won't go away."
Still, he insisted, the workers hold most of the advantages. They know, he said, that the owner cannot go to court and enforce the loan contract -- precisely because it is illegal -- which means they can run away without fear of being forced to come back. "Everything is against us," Mr. Gondal said.
Mr. Gondal, 65, along with four other men, bought the brick factory about two years ago because, he said, he had been told it was a good way to make money. But the factory was selling only 4,000 bricks a day, on the best days, and he was not making any profit, he said.
His manager, Fazal Abbar, 20, told a different story. He said the factory sells 20,000 to 25,000 bricks a day, for 1 rupee each, or about $450 a day. The factory could sell many times more, Mr. Abbar said, if it had the capacity.
Most of the bricks are sold locally, to people who use them to build very modest structures as well as to a handful of people who have used money sent back from relatives working abroad to build large two- and three-story houses, with pillars and balconies. 
One man bought 200,000 bricks to build a 50-room house, said Wasim Anjum, who sells auto parts in Mandi Bahauddin, an agricultural center nearby that has grown considerably in the last five years, increasing the demand for bricks.
As for the workers who make the bricks, they live in a tiny rooms, not bigger than 12 feet by 12 feet, with dirt floors. A small cut in the thick walls serves as a window.
One of the brickmakers, Khizar Hayat, when asked how long he worked each day, said five or six hours. He elaborated: From 5 a.m. until about 4 or 5 p.m.
Asked how old he was, he laughed. "How can you ask me how old I am?" he said. "I don't know." Friends said he was about 50.
The workers say they expect to stay here -- unless another factory owner buys out their debt. Then they will move to the new workplace.
At the kiln's edge, where the temperature was hellish, Muhammad Inyat was loading finished bricks onto a cart. He was sweating, his grizzled beard caked with dust. He said he earns 24 rupees, less than 50 cents, for every 1,000 bricks he loads.
Asked why he keeps at it, he answered simply, "For my stomach."

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
Betting That Chicago Needs New Office Space

BYLINE:  By JILL SCHACHNER CHANEN 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, June 11 

 BODY:
After a decade-long hiatus, construction of new high-rise office buildings in the Loop, this city's central business district, is back in full swing.
By the end of 2003 four new towers are scheduled for completion, adding nearly four million square feet of commercial office space to the Loop. Developers here say it is likely that ground will be broken for two more high-rise buildings within the year.
 The new buildings are arriving when Chicago's commercial real estate market is struggling by some measures. Availability in downtown office buildings hovered near 19 percent in the first quarter, the highest rate on record, according to the most recent statistics from the Chicago office of Insignia/ESG, a national commercial brokerage firm. 
 In addition, the amount of sublease space on the market has increased sixfold, to 7.3 million square feet, or 28 percent of the total available space, according to Insignia/ESG, as many businesses closed their doors or pulled back on expansion plans in the economic doldrums.
Despite this abundance of available office space, the developers of the new buildings have had little problem in securing tenants at market rates. Nearly 75 percent of the space in the four new buildings has already been leased, said Michael Klein, executive vice president for Insignia/ESG's Midwest region. Only one of the new buildings is ready for occupancy.
Brokers here say two crucial forces are driving the new construction. The first is that large blocks of contiguous office space available for long-term lease have been virtually nonexistent. The second is that commercial real estate tenants in Chicago tend to lease space for 15 years. A number of large tenants whose leases are expiring in the next three years are in older buildings that cannot accommodate the technological needs of businesses today, said Drew Nieman, a principal of the John Buck Company, a commercial real estate developer based in Chicago.
Older buildings sometimes lack the high ceilings and up-to-date electrical and air-conditioning systems necessary for computerized offices.
In light of these factors, John Buck and Lend Lease Real Estate Investments made a bet three years ago that the Chicago office market could absorb an ultramodern 50-story, 1.2-million-square-foot glass-and-steel tower that they developed. The $350 million project, at 1 North Wacker Drive, was begun almost speculatively, with only one commitment to lease a small amount of space. 
The building, completed late last year, has now leased more than 80 percent of its office space, Mr. Nieman said.
Mr. Nieman said that his company had studied the Chicago office market five years ago and believed that an improving economy would also generate a need for additional new office space. While the economic forecasts proved to be overly optimistic, the new office space turned out to be needed even though total office demand was not rising. After construction began, several large companies, including UBS and PricewaterhouseCoopers, wanted to consolidate their Chicago operations. They could not find the necessary space in any existing buildings, Mr. Nieman said. 
UBS, which took 453,000 square feet of office space, is the building's anchor tenant and received naming rights to the building, and PricewaterhouseCoopers has taken 230,000 square feet.
Another major developer, Hines Interests, based in Houston, did not take the risk of speculative development when it decided to build the 37-story, 700,000-square-foot tower now nearing completion on the corner of Wacker Drive and Lake Street.
Calpers, the California state pension fund, financed construction of the $175 million building, which is to be capped with a 44-foot-high glowing lantern. Occupancy is to begin this October.
According to Gregory Van Schaack, a Hines vice president, it began making plans to construct the building at 191 North Wacker Drive in 1998 when tenants were rapidly absorbing vacant office space in downtown Chicago and no new office buildings were planned. "We knew that if the absorption continued at the same rate," he said, "we would see low vacancy rates, especially with all of the hurdles in building in downtown Chicago."
Hines was able to secure financing after it persuaded the Chicago law firm of Gardner, Carton & Douglas to move from another of its buildings to the new Wacker Drive property. More tenants have since signed leases, committing 65 percent of the building's office space.
Despite the soft office market, Mr. Van Schaack remains optimistic about leasing the rest of the space. "Tenants now cannot find space that works for them," he said. "Companies now are very conscious of efficiencies of space."
The Dutch financial services company ABN Amro is building a 1.3-million-square-foot high-technology center for its exclusive use at Madison and Clinton Streets to put its back-office operations under one roof. The 30-story green-glass and stainless-steel building will have a seven-story base, with 38,000-square-foot floors to accommodate the bank's technology needs, Mr. Van Schaack said. Hines is the development manager for the bank.
The property also has room for a second tower if needed. The first tower is expected to be completed next year.
Like ABN Amro, the Bank One Corporation of Chicago found its operations spread throughout several office buildings in the Loop. It decided to consolodate most of its high-technology operations in the new Dearborn Center on the corner of Adams and Dearborn Streets. The bank's lease of 525,000 square feet was the catalyst for the financing and construction of the 1.5-million-square-foot 37-story building, which should be completed this year.
"The building would not have happened without the Bank One deal," said Louis. G. Conforti, co-president and chief financial officer of Prime Group Realty Trust in Chicago. Prime Group is developing the building in a joint venture with the J. Paul Beitler Development Company of Chicago. "As a publicly traded company," Mr. Conforti said, "it would have been imprudent for us as fiduciaries to take on a speculative development project."
The Chicago office of Holland & Knight, a national law firm, has also signed a lease for space in the building, as has the Citadel Investment Group. The building is now more than 60 percent leased.
Despite the surfeit of office space these new high-rises will create, Mr. Klein of Insignia/ESG and others say that more new towers are on the way. Three developers are actively marketing sites in the Loop for new buildings that would be completed in 2005. "We are seeing a real anomaly in the market," Mr. Klein said. "The availability rate is ticking up, absorption is down, and yet, we may see even more buildings."
According to Mr. Klein, three large law firms and several large businesses have leases that will expire in 2005. "You have to look three years ahead," he explained. "Firms have to make a decision now to move to a new building or stay, or the new buildings will not be done by 2005."
John Buck has already unveiled plans for a tower of at least 950,000 square feet just a block away from its new building on Wacker Drive. But this one will not be built speculatively, Mr. Nieman said. 
Asked about published reports that Deloitte & Touche was negotiating for a large amount of space in the planned building, a report that a Deloitte spokesman disclaimed any knowledge of, Mr. Nieman said: "We are in discussions with a large anchor tenant, but until we reach a final conclusion on those negotiations, nothing is definite. This is not the time or the environment to build speculatively."

HEADLINE: Senate Votes To Increase Debt Ceiling 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11 

 BODY:
The Senate voted today to increase the government's legal borrowing limit, taking a step toward resolving a partisan dispute that has threatened to set off a financial crisis at the end of this month.
 By a vote of 68 to 29, the Senate approved a measure that would increase the ceiling on the national debt by $450 billion, to $6.4 trillion. The Treasury Department has had to scramble several times in the last few months to avoid breaching the current limit of $5.95 trillion, and has warned that it will be unable to hold its borrowing below that level beyond June 28. 
 The increase in the debt limit would be enough to allow the government to continue financing its operations without any problem at least until the end of the year. The measure was offered by the Senate's Democratic leaders and was passed without debate after Republicans agreed not to oppose it.
But it is not clear that the House will pass similar legislation. The House majority leader, Representative Dick Armey, Republican of Texas, said he did not have the votes to pass the legislation on its own. Many Republicans want instead to avoid a direct vote by inserting the debt limit provision into other legislation, most likely a supplemental spending bill providing money for the military and antiterrorism programs.
President Bush has repeatedly urged both parties to put aside politics to deal with the issue. Left unresolved, the problem could upset the financial markets and create a situation in which the federal government could be considered in default on some of its obligations.
Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary, told reporters today, "The president urges the House to follow the Senate's action on this matter."
Democrats say the debt-limit rise is necessary because Mr. Bush's tax cut last year largely wiped out the budget surplus and halted progress in paying down the part of the national debt held by the public. 
Republicans say the rise is largely a result of growth in the government's obligations to pay future Social Security benefits.

HEADLINE: Treasury Official Is Optimistic on Economy 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: PARIS, June 11 

 BODY:
The Treasury's under secretary for international affairs, John B. Taylor, said today that the American economy would be growing at a rate of more than 3 percent by the end of 2002, with a very good outlook on inflation, which would hover from 1 to 2 percent. 
 "By the end of the year it should be above 3 percent," Mr. 
Taylor said about the economy's growth prospects. He said he expected second-quarter growth of 2 to 3 percent. 
 "What we are seeing now," he said, "is that the U.S. recovery is on track, growth is increasing this year compared to last year and that is beginning to have an effect in the global economy."
Mr. Taylor also said that Japan needed to tackle deflation and that the rate of growth in the first quarter there looked unsustainable.
Mr. Taylor was in Paris to discuss the world economic outlook with colleagues from the other 29 mainly industrialized countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. 
He was speaking ahead of talks later this week among finance ministers from the Group of 7 industrialized nations in Canada and a meeting on June 26-28 involving Russia and the G-7 nations.

HEADLINE: Senate Leader, in Surprise Move, Opens Debate on Estate Tax Repeal 

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 11 

 BODY:
The majority leader Tom Daschle abruptly opened Senate debate today on a Republican plan to repeal the estate tax permanently, complicating lobbying efforts by those on both sides of the issue. 
 With just a few hours notice, the Democratic leadership initiated debate on a proposal to rescind the tax as of 2010. Under tax cuts adopted last year, the value of assets exempted from the tax would be gradually increased until 2010, and then the tax would be eliminated for one year before it returned to 2001 levels. 
 "We view this as a moral issue," said Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, the co-author of the Senate bill. "We think death taxes are fundamentally wrong. We think death should not be a taxable event." 
Opponents of the repeal say inheritances, not death, are taxed. 
The House, with some Democratic support, voted last week to rescind the tax permanently, and Mr. Daschle, a South Dakota Democrat, agreed earlier this year to allow a vote before the end of June in exchange for getting a vote on a separate energy bill.
Interest groups on both sides of the issue were caught off guard by today's decision. Advocates and opponents of repeal had planned lobbying events for Wednesday and immediately went to work to try to influence the debate after Mr. Daschle put forth the timetable.
"That was his one big strategic advantage that he always had in his back pocket," said Marty Reiser, vice president of public affairs at Citizens for a Sound Economy, about Mr. Daschle's ability to control the schedule.
Mr. Reiser's group sent emergency e-mail messages to about 60,000 people urging them to contact about two dozen senators to push for permanent repeal.
Democrats said they believed they had the 40 votes needed to block the permanent repeal, particularly since they planned to offer amendments that would increase the amount exempt from the tax.
Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, offered a proposal today to raise the exemption to $3 million as of next January.
Senator Jean Carnahan, a Missouri Democrat whose Republican opponent this year has emphasized the issue, said she and others were drafting an amendment that would increase exempt assets to $4 million. Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, said that plan could attract substantial support.
Republicans said that nothing less than full repeal would suffice. "They will pick and choose between groups of people and they will favor some and they will disfavor others," said Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona. "And then they will argue that they actually voted for a form of repeal, but it will not be a repeal of the estate tax for everyone."
Mr. Daschle said it was "no coincidence" that he brought the issue to the floor the same day that the Senate voted to increase the federal debt ceiling by $450 billion. He sought to juxtapose the need to increase federal borrowing authority with the cost to the treasury of the repeal, which he put at $600 billion over 10 years.
"So while we increase the debt limit $450 billion right now, the question before the Senate immediately following that is, do we want to benefit the top one-half of one percent of taxpayers in this country with a $600 billion tax cut?" Mr. Daschle said. "I can't imagine that the answer for any senator would be yes."
Coalitions on both sides of the issue were still gearing up their activists when the vote, which is now expected Wednesday, was scheduled. Americans for a Fair Estate Tax planned to release a poll on Wednesday that showed that a majority of voters favored adjusting but not repealing the estate tax.
The National Federation of Independent Business, a major proponent of permanent repeal, was to open its Washington conference on Wednesday with more than 500 participants who would fan out to lobby lawmakers.
Ed Frank, a spokesman for the group, said its leadership did not expect such a quick Senate vote but was not totally surprised that Mr. Daschle would act "as soon as he thought he had the votes."
Both sides are focusing their efforts on 12 Democrats who last year supported the tax package though some, like Mr. Breaux, have already said they would not support permanent estate tax repeal.
"I don't think anybody in good conscience can argue that they really only wanted to repeal it for one year," Mr. Kyl said. 
Opponents and proponents said the pending vote on repeal was not likely to be the last word on the issue.
"If the Senate doesn't get it done this time, the next tax vote will be Nov. 5 at the ballot box," Mr. Frank said.

HEADLINE: Rumsfeld, in India, Offers Linked Ideas but No Peace Plan 

BYLINE:  By THOM SHANKER 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, June 11 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld arrived here tonight saying he was not a peace negotiator but only carried some American ideas for calming a dispute that seemed just days ago to be drawing India and Pakistan toward large-scale war.
 Mr. Rumsfeld declared that tensions between the nuclear neighbors had leveled off, but he warned that unanticipated incidents could still lead to broader conflict. 
 "We are not going in with a single proposal, nor am I a mediator as such," Mr. Rumsfeld said tonight aboard his airplane en route to India after a visit to three Persian Gulf states. He will hold talks on Wednesday in New Delhi, and then travel to Islamabad. 
Mr. Rumsfeld said his proposals would not be delivered as an American ultimatum. 
"It isn't this or nothing," he said. "It is a set of linkages and it is a whole series of things, any one of which might be helpful in leading to a step-by-step de-escalation of the situation."
He complimented both India and Pakistan for "saying things that are helpful and behaving in a responsible way."
The secretary has declined to comment on any of the proposals now part of the public debate over how best to ease tensions between India and Pakistan.
Among the ideas voiced in recent days were establishing monitors along the Line of Control, which divides Indian and Pakistani sections of disputed Kashmir, and sharing American intelligence data with both sides to avoid miscalculation and war.
Mr. Rumsfeld said his latest review of "all the intelligence indicators" showed the situation on the ground between the two militaries had neither deteriorated nor improved."
"I cannot say that I see a trend line that it's getting better or worse," Mr. Rumsfeld said. "It feels to me like it's roughly level."
But he cautioned that "an incident can occur that can cause a reaction" and imperil positive gestures by both sides. "People can be surprised," Mr. Rumsfeld said.
Although Mr. Rumsfeld repeatedly refused to discuss the contents of his private messages to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee of India and President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan, he made no secret that he would argue that both will be better off if their leaders marshal their nations for economic growth, and not combat.
More than any defense secretary in recent memory, Mr. Rumsfeld uses a broad economic equation -- including foreign investment, tourism and trade -- in his calculation of national security. It is a theme he struck repeatedly, and with success, during talks with the Russian defense minister, Sergei B. Ivanov, in the tense months before Moscow accepted, with only slight protest, the American withdrawal from the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty.
Just as Mr. Rumsfeld argued that the treaty would in the future bring fewer national security benefits to Russia than would a broadening relationship with America and world investors, so Mr. Rumsfeld is likely to say here that both nations and their leaders could only emerge shattered from an armed conflict.
"There is no reason in the world why those two countries on that important subcontinent cannot get on a track going forward that would be enormously beneficial to them," he said. "And our country has an interest in their economic success."
Mr. Rumsfeld, who had a successful and lucrative career in the corporate world before returning to the Pentagon with the Bush administration, added: "Even the tension, even the threat of war, makes people making decisions all over the globe say, 'No, that's not where I want to invest right now.' "
The defense secretary flew to New Delhi tonight after greeting Air Force personnel at the vast air base in Al Udeid, Qatar, that has become a significant hub in the American-led campaign against terror.
At the base now are a fleet of Air Force KC-10 and KC-135 refueling tankers to keep attack jets and bombers, based elsewhere in the region, in the air as they carry out the war over Afghanistan. Also there are teams of Air Force construction engineers and a smattering of Army personnel.
Qatar was Mr. Rumsfeld's final stop in the gulf after visits to Kuwait and Bahrain. The capital, Doha, is home to Al Jazeera, the Arab-language satellite channel that has broadcast messages from Osama bin Laden and has been a frequent target of administration frustration.
When an Al Jazeera correspondent identified himself at Mr. Rumsfeld's news briefing in Doha, the defense secretary asked him, "How'm I doing?"

HEADLINE: Railroads Raise Freight Rates 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: OMAHA, June 11 

 BODY:
The Union Pacific Corporation and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation, the largest railroads in the nation, have raised some rates as much as 13 percent as shipments increase because of the strengthening economy.
 Prices will rise as much as $150 per shipping container or trailer starting Aug. 1 for cargo in the West Coast, Midwest and Southwest regions and for freight carried in conjunction with Eastern railroads, according to the companies' Web sites. 
 North American rail shipments rose in May for a second month, led by increases of 9.8 percent for mainly retail cargo carried by a combination of train and truck and of 5.3 percent for chemicals, the Association of American Railroads said last week. Union Pacific led in the United States, rising 4.2 percent.

Nasdaq 100 Closes Below Its Low Point Of September

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The Nasdaq 100, once the hottest stock index there was, fell to its lowest level in more than four years yesterday as technology issues continued to suffer.
 The index, composed of the largest companies traded on the Nasdaq market, thus became the first major American index to fall below the levels it reached in September after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. 
 Since then, a recession has ended and the economy has begun to recover. But the stock market, after rallying strongly in the fourth quarter of last year, has stumbled. 
The Nasdaq 100 fell 34.65 points, or 3 percent, to 1,100.97, its lowest close since Jan. 30, 1998, and 2.3 percent below its closing level of Sept. 21, when the stock market bottomed in the wake of a bout of selling after the attacks.
To be sure, the Nasdaq 100 is no longer the hottest index there is, and part of its problem is that investor attention has shifted away from the technology stocks that dominate the index. It is now down 77 percent from the crazy peak it reached in March 2000, when the bubble was at its peak.
Those days of early 2000 are long gone. But perhaps more important is just how far the index has fallen since its recent high of 1,720.91, set last Dec. 5. In a little more than six months, the index is down 36 percent.
The broader stock market is not in such difficulty. In fact, within the Standard & Poor's 500, which is still 5 percent higher than it was at the Sept. 21 bottom, the majority of stocks have done much better than that would seem. About 390 of those 500 stocks are up over the period.
The Nasdaq composite index, which is dominated by the stocks in the Nasdaq 100, is also 5 percent higher than its Sept. 21 level.
Broadly speaking, these days the stock market is penalizing three categories of stocks. The first is technology stocks, which even after the fall from 2000's lofty levels were selling at substantial price-to-earnings multiples. Investors are becoming more doubtful of an early recovery, even if business has stabilized, and multiples are starting to come down.
The second group is telecommunications companies for which the news keeps growing worse. The fiber optic bubble, on which more money was lost than on the Internet bubble, continues to surprise people with its severity.
The final group is companies whose previous results are now deemed questionable. Enron has been joined by Adelphia Communications, where assets now appear to be smaller than reported and debts far larger. Tyco International is ridiculously cheap if the company's profit forecast is even remotely close to accurate. Few seem to be in the mood to believe that just now, though the stock could rally if it succeeds in selling its CIT finance company to the public.
To a lesser extent, it is now bad to be big. Not so much because large companies will do poorly but because they were so popular during most of the boom. Smaller companies, other than those with hot technology stories, tended to be overlooked when the market was hot.
The different view of the entire market can be seen in the performance since Sept. 21 of two indexes that include the great majority of stocks traded in the United States. The Wilshire 5000 is up 8 percent, while the Value Line composite is up 24 percent.
The difference is in how they are computed. The Wilshire 5000 is capitalization-weighted, meaning that General Electric, the most valuable stock in the country -- and one that is trading below its Sept. 21 close -- counts more than any other stock. The Value Line counts all stocks equally. So if a tiny stock goes up 1 percent, that move could offset a giant stock falling by the same amount.
Before the bubble burst, the Value Line was a laggard for years. But if you follow it as your stock market indicator, things don't look so bad. It rose in both 2000 and 2001 and this year is down far less than the Wilshire 5000.
If it is good to be small these days, it is also good to be solid. The Dow Jones industrial average, many of whose companies seemed a bit boring in the boom, is still 15.6 percent higher than it was last Sept. 21. That is not as good as the 22.1 percent increase in the Russell 2000 -- an index composed of the stocks ranked 1,001 through 3,000 in terms of market value -- but it is much better than most other indexes.
In the aftermath of Sept. 11, it was easy to think that the future was bleak. The fact that one index has fallen below the post-attack closing low probably indicates that the post-bubble effects are still being felt. But for stocks that were not inflated by the bubble, the stock market still seems to see considerable opportunity.

HEADLINE: Curb on Gas Emissions Is Stalled in California 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 11 

 BODY:
A bill to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles has stalled in the California State Assembly, the latest legislative setback for environmental groups.
 If passed, the measure would be the first to restrict automotive emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases thought by many scientists to be linked to global warming. The bill directs the California Air Resources Board to develop a plan for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by January 2005, to be put into effect for the 2009 model year. 
 The bill has met with staunch opposition from the auto industry, which is concerned that it could be used as a template by other states.
"It's ultimately going to cost consumers more if this passes," said Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. "The way you do this is to make cars lighter, smaller and less powerful, and that's not what California consumers want."
The bill was passed by the Assembly in January, but it was sent back after the Senate added amendments. This time, an advertising campaign by the auto industry has helped derail the proposal.
"We're a couple votes shy," said Julia Levin, California policy coordinator for the Union of Concerned Scientists. "The auto companies have definitely managed to peel off a few votes." 
The bill does not offer specific goals on how far state regulators should go in cutting emissions, nor does it propose ways to do it. Instead, it tells the air resources board to come up with a plan for the "maximum feasible reduction" in emissions. 
That open-ended mandate has led the auto industry, in advertisements, to suggest a number of possible outcomes. One ad, headlined "Who Decides What You Drive?" said the measure could result in higher gasoline taxes, lower speed limits, surcharges for sport utility vehicles and even fees for every mile driven.
Proponents say that less severe steps are likely, like requiring automakers to make improvements by using more fuel-efficient technologies or measures to expand public transportation. 
John Dutra, a Democratic assemblyman from Fremont, outside San Francisco, said he voted for the bill the first time but was opposed this time. He said he had expected the Senate to add an amendment requiring approval by the Legislature of any plan the air resources board developed. "I don't think that decision should be made by a five-member appointed body," Mr. Dutra said, adding, "It's a decision that could have a serious economic impact."
Fremont is home to a large assembly plant that is a joint venture of Toyota and General Motors. 
Fran Pavley, the sponsor of the proposal and a Democrat whose Southern California district includes Malibu, said the bill did give lawmakers a year to review the proposal but did not require a vote to approve it. 
Referring to the air resources board, she said, "We put that gap in there to shine the light on A.R.B. and say 'we're going to pay attention to these regulations and make sure they're cost-effective and achievable.' "

HEADLINE: 9 More North Koreans Seek Asylum in Seoul Embassy in Beijing 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Wednesday, June 12 

 BODY:
Nine more North Koreans sneaked into a South Korean diplomatic building here on Tuesday, bringing to 17 the number of asylum seekers now trapped inside and adding fuel to a tense diplomatic flare-up between China and South Korea over their fate. 
 The latest group entered the South Korea consulate, initially posing as Chinese citizens applying for visas to attend the World Cup, a Korean diplomat said. The huge crowds of Chinese soccer fans lining up at the consulate each day provided cover for the nine until they dashed out of the line and into a building, breaking a pane of glass in the process. 
 In the past three months, 38 North Koreans have successfully obtained political asylum and passage to Seoul by first seeking safe haven in foreign embassies and consulates in China. Three more have been in the Canadian Embassy since Sunday and are awaiting a decision on their future. 
Despite increased Chinese security around the compounds, the stream of asylum seekers is likely to accelerate, experts say. An estimated 100,000 to 300,000 North Koreans are living illegally in China.
They use endless ploys to gain access to diplomatic missions, from vaulting over a wall or pushing through a gate to posing as a Chinese citizen applying for a visa. Some of the illegal North Koreans, like the ones who entered the South Korean consulate on Tuesday, have lived illegally in China for nearly five years and have purchased fake Chinese identity papers that will at least get them through an embassy gate.
Also on Tuesday, four North Koreans who had been living in China arrived by ferry from Dalian, a Chinese coastal city, at Inchon, South Korea, demanding political asylum, according to Yonhap, the South Korean news agency. 
China has already allowed 38 North Korean asylum seekers in diplomatic missions to leave its soil this year "for humanitarian reasons." But the 17 who are now in the South Korean consulate raise more complicated issues, and some have been stuck there for over two weeks.
Previous successful asylum seekers here had sought refuge at diplomatic compounds of countries that had no direct stake in their fate -- the United States, Spain, Japan, Canada and Germany. 
The situation is far more complicated when the refugees go directly to the South Korean mission, since it requires China and South Korea to deal with an irreconcilable diplomatic dispute that they had previously avoided by sleight of hand.
According to its Constitution, South Korea is obligated to offer safe haven and citizenship to those who request it from the North. But China's longstanding policy is that illegal North Koreans living within its border are economic migrants, not political refugees who merit asylum; diplomatic agreements with North Korea require that those who are caught be sent back. 
To sidestep the issue and to avoid offending North Korea, its longtime ally, China has not allowed previous asylum seekers to fly directly to Seoul. All 38 have officially departed for either Singapore or Manila -- where they have all quickly changed planes and headed to South Korea.
After the latest break-in, the South Korean Embassy requested talks with the Chinese Foreign Ministry but got no immediate response.

HEADLINE: Governor's Task Force Is Divided on Plans to Reduce Greenhouse Gases 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 11 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki's task force on global warming is weighing ambitious recommendations for reducing greenhouse gases, ideas that go far beyond what any other state has done.
 But the task force is divided over those proposals, as are administration officials, who say that some of them could survive to become state policy, while others clearly will not. 
 The recommendations were drafted by a consulting firm, not by the task force the governor appointed last year, which has been unable to achieve unanimity on any of the issues. A member of the task force who favors the recommendations gave a copy to The New York Times. 
The central proposal is to limit power plant emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, to 40 percent below 1990 levels, by 2010. That would reduce carbon dioxide far more over the next decade than all the other measures combined. Other steps would include requiring that 6 percent of new electric power production come from renewable sources like solar and wind power.
Another recommendation, to limit carbon dioxide from vehicle tailpipes, will not be adopted, state officials said, because of what everyone involved agrees are technological and legal obstacles.
Task force members say all sides were surprised by the aggressiveness of the plans produced by the consultant, the Center for Clean Air Policy, a group based in Washington that is widely used and respected by Republicans and Democrats, industries and environmental groups. The results elated the environmentalists on the panel and dismayed most of the business representatives, who include officials of Ford Motor Company, Alcoa and Reliant Energy, a major power plant owner.
By setting the bar so high, the report has left the Pataki administration in an uncomfortable position. It is clear that any policies the state adopts will be less ambitious than the consultant's report, and the administration has asked the Center for Clean Air Policy to draft a less far-reaching version for public release in the next few weeks. Administration officials have all but given up on the idea of recommendations from the task force itself because there is no consensus.
Aides to the governor fear that as Mr. Pataki runs for re-election, Democrats and environmentalists will accuse him of retreating from the recommendations under pressure from business -- even if in the end, he makes New York a national leader on global warming. The aides were not pleased to learn that the original report had been leaked to a reporter.
"This is not a consensus document, and it is not a final document," said John P. Cahill, the governor's chief of staff and chairman of the task force. "A lot of this will be doable and achievable."
Environmental groups are mounting a public relations campaign to pressure the governor to adopt firm limits on carbon dioxide from power plants, timed to coincide with the task force's deliberations.
In the last three years, Mr. Pataki has moved toward requiring reductions in pollution from power plants, but he has resisted calls to include limits on carbon dioxide. Only two states, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, have capped carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, and neither has gone as far as a 40 percent reduction.
Pataki aides said the governor might adopt a cap, but it would probably be less stringent than 40 percent, and his preference would be a regional approach by all the Northeast states. The recommendation that 6 percent of power come from "renewables" has a better chance of becoming state policy, they said.
In appointing the task force last year, the governor said he wanted New York to lead the nation in combating global warming. But administration officials on the task force are nearly as divided on the issues as the other members are. They say that getting too far ahead of other states would harm the ability of New York businesses to compete economically.
Mr. Cahill said a crucial question is this: "What can New York do on its own without being placed at a complete competitive disadvantage?"
But environmentalists contend that the clear message from the consultant's research is that deep cuts in carbon dioxide emissions would be easier to achieve than anyone previously suspected. New York, they say, has an opportunity to be a model that the nation would follow.
"Our view is if you don't do a carbon cap on the power industry, you haven't done much," said Anne Reynolds, project director at Environmental Advocates and a member of the task force. "It's the single most important thing New York can do on global warming."
An industry representative on the task force said, "We think the recommendations are unrealistic and damaging, and we've made that view plain to the governor's office."
No practical way has been developed to capture carbon dioxide emissions from power plant smokestacks -- or, for that matter, from vehicle tailpipes. So, other than conservation, the only ways to reduce the carbon dioxide output are to make the machinery more fuel-efficient and to move away from dirtier fuels like coal and toward cleaner ones like natural gas. That process is already under way, as new plants are built and older ones are overhauled.
As a result, the Center for Clean Air Policy concluded, power plants' output of carbon dioxide will drop to 28 percent below 1990 levels by 2010, even without any further state action -- indicating that 40 percent is within reach. Without a state mandate, the center found, emissions would begin to rise again after 2010.
"What the analysis in this report really shows is that New York is capable of going even further than we thought," said Ashok Gupta of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a member of the task force. "And that's what we should do."

The Other Role For the Schools

BYLINE:  By Richard Rothstein; E-mail: rrothstein@nytimes.com

 BODY:
IN Los Angeles, 75,000 students are bused to school daily. Half travel in buses operated by the district, the rest in buses run by companies under contract. 
 This spring, drivers for one of the companies, Laidlaw Education Services, went on strike in an effort to gain parity with the district's own drivers, who earn an average of $22.56 an hour and, unlike most Laidlaw drivers, get full benefits. After a month, the union settled with Laidlaw for a raise of about 25 cents, to bring the company's drivers up to an average of $9.25. That enabled the company to keep its costs low enough that it remained cheaper for Los Angeles to contract for some busing than to transport all children itself. 
But the bargain has a downside. Laidlaw's wages for most of its drivers are below what they need to join the middle class. For the district, contracting may be good fiscal policy. But it is questionable public policy.
Management theorists say an organization should focus on its core business and farm out support services to companies that specialize in such work. When schools take that advice, administrators spare themselves the distractions of bus repair, school cleaning or food purchases. Further, the cost savings that typically accrue can be used by districts for educational purposes, like reducing class sizes or increasing teacher pay.
Yet the gap between wages paid by contractors and those paid by municipal agencies like school systems has led many cities to adopt "living wage" rules requiring contractors to offer pay that, if not as high as municipal wages, is higher than that provided by the private market as a whole. New York City, where all school buses are privately run, is now debating such a law, which would expand on one enacted in 1996.
So far, the debate has overlooked the way a second role is woven into the history of urban schools. The schools' essential function, of course, has been to educate. But for immigrant and minority workers, they have also been an important source of better jobs, a first step to the middle class.
They have fulfilled this function even to a fault. Indeed, for most of the last 150 years, urban schools have been consumed less by controversies about instruction than by issues like payroll-padding. School reform has usually concerned not academic standards but curtailing patronage and nepotism in the hiring of teachers, principals, clerks and janitors.
A century ago, Irish and German immigrants got a lift to the middle class from jobs in municipal agencies. Wages for the jobs they did were higher there than in the private sector, and ward bosses who ran big cities hired workers in return for votes. 
Once those immigrants moved up the economic ladder, they were followed into public jobs by Italians and Jews. Getting hired often had more to do with whom you knew than what you knew, and schools employed more workers than necessary.
There is a widely held belief that early waves of immigrants achieved middle-class status solely by studying or getting menial industrial jobs and then climbing the ranks to become foremen and craftsmen. While that was true of many, others also had the benefit of public policies that prevented the private labor market from keeping immigrants at the bottom. Union drives, an increasing minimum wage and political patronage (much of it in urban schools) played big roles through the 1940's and 1950's.
Today there are still school jobs with an important social role. African-American and Hispanic workers, many of them women hired as classroom aides or cafeteria helpers, are usually the only employees who actually live in the neighborhood of the urban school where they work, and whose children typically attend that school. These women have little access to private-sector jobs that pay wages above the poverty level.
It is hard to justify some of this work on educational grounds alone; in fact, federal education law now requires new school aides to have two-year college degrees. That makes sense educationally, but will force schools to recruit from outside their immediate neighborhoods.
For bus drivers, cafeteria workers and janitors, money spent on above-market wages could be used instead to improve education. But educational benefit is not the only consideration. It would be nice if private labor markets could, on their own, provide the hand up that low-wage workers need to begin a climb to the middle class. But the private sector has never done this on its own, and is not doing so now.
As a result, schools share responsibility for creating good jobs. There may be a point to insisting that immigrants, like Los Angeles's bus drivers, should now strive for upward mobility without taxpayers' subsidizing their wage scales. But that is not how previous generations began to climb.

HEADLINE: The Best of Enemies? 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Iran 

 BODY:
Quick quiz: Which Muslim Middle East country held spontaneous candlelight vigils in sympathy with Americans after Sept. 11? Kuwait? No. Saudi Arabia? No. Iran? Yes. You got it! You win a free trip to Iran. And if you come you'll discover not only a Muslim country where many people were sincerely sympathetic to America after Sept. 11, but a country where so many people on the street are now talking about -- and hoping for -- a reopening of relations with America that the ruling hard-liners had to take the unprecedented step two weeks ago of making it illegal for anyone to speak about it in public. 
 No matter. Despite the official ban, Iran-U.S. relations are still the No. 1 political subject here, and are still being openly discussed in Parliament and in the reformist press. And no conversation between an Iranian and a visiting American seems to be complete without some variation of the question: "When do you think we will have relations again?" 
 What's fueling this discussion? To begin with, there's an overall sense, probably unrealistic, that everything that ails Iran today and frustrates average Iranians -- from the widespread unemployment to a sense of isolation from the world, to a lack of foreign investment, to a general political malaise -- would somehow be reversed if Iranian-U.S. relations were restored and the U.S. embargo on Iran were lifted. 
But what is striking is how much President Bush's branding of Iran as part of an "axis of evil" (along with Iraq and North Korea) intensified this discussion. At first, reformers in Parliament and the media were embarrassed by Mr. Bush's statement, which hard-liners used against them as "proof" that America would never have ties with the Islamic Republic. But since then, reformers have retaliated by pointing to the "axis of evil" accusation and saying to the hard-liners: "Look where your policies have led us." 
Add to this the reduction in U.S. visas for Iranians since Sept. 11, which has dispirited many Iranian college students, and the shock the Iranians had two weeks ago when Russia, their longtime backer, effectively joined NATO, and you can understand why a lot of people here are rethinking ties with Washington.
What's striking is how much the debate within Iran mirrors that in Washington. There are three schools in Washington: the Engagers, who argue that since America helped to ignite this debate in Iran, we should now pour fuel on it by actively seeking diplomatic ties; the Embargoers, who see Iran's clerical regime as an overripe fruit that will fall from the tree if the U.S. just keeps isolating it; and the Rollbackers, who would like to force a regime change in Iran, just as they would in Iraq. 
In Iran there are also Engagers, who see American ties as the key to Iran's modernization; Isolators, who distrust America and believe Iran is better off going it alone; and Provokers -- conservatives who believe they would be strengthened by a confrontation with the U.S.
Diplomats here insist that even Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's hard-line spiritual leader, is no longer against relations with the U.S. -- he can smell the mood here too and he knows how badly Iran's economy needs U.S. investment and trade -- but he wants to find a way to do it whereby he, not the reformers, gets the credit and controls it, so that any U.S. opening doesn't end up as a boost to his political opponents.
For now, though, the different factions in both countries each have just enough power to block the others from any fundamental move that would really make relations better or worse. 
It's too bad, because the silent majority in both countries is for engagement. Last year the Iranian hard-liners decided to completely renovate the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, which had not been touched since Iranian students took it over in 1979. The idea was to turn it into a museum for the revolution. The museum opened last Nov. 4, but nobody came, so now it's closed again. Most Iranians don't want a U.S. Embassy museum. They want a U.S. Embassy.
In short, I don't know what the final outcome will be, but I do know this: If Secretary of State Colin Powell were to announce tomorrow that he was ready to fly to Tehran and put everything on the table -- an end to sanctions, Iran's nuclear program, its support for Palestinian terrorists, diplomatic relations -- he would light this place on fire.

City Tech Has a Name Alteration

BYLINE:  By Karen W. Arenson 

 BODY:
 When New York City Technical College was founded in 1946, it was called the New York State Institute of Applied Arts and Science, and its aim was to meet the postwar economy's need for highly trained technicians. In the years since, the college shifted its sights and its name as the economy changed. 
Last week, with the approval of the State Legislature and the governor, the college, which is in Brooklyn and has more than 11,000 students, became the New York City College of Technology. "In today's educational marketplace, technical colleges are generally two-year schools offering vocational programs," said FRED W. BEAUFAIT, the college's president, noting that the college, which is part of the City University of New York, offers 12 baccalaureate degree programs, as well as 28 associate degree programs, in fields like health care, hospitality and engineering, and more are planned. One thing that will not change is its nickname, City Tech. Karen W. Arenson

HEADLINE: Honda Takes Up Case in U.S. for Green Energy 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 11 

 BODY:
When it comes to fuel economy and the environment, there is Honda and there is the rest of the auto industry.
 The difference has come into sharp relief as battles rage over how to curb the nation's swelling appetite for oil. 
 Honda is the only major automaker that has not joined the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, the industry trade group that has led the fight against tougher fuel and emissions standards.
Earlier this year, Honda was the only big automaker that did not back an industry advertising campaign that helped defeat a Senate proposal to raise gasoline mileage standards for the first time since the 1980's. Honda is also not taking part in an industry campaign against a California bill to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
In a stand that amounts to heresy in much of the industry, Honda has told federal regulators that most sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks and minivans should meet the much higher fuel standards required of passenger cars. 
And the company, based in Japan and ranked fifth in sales in the United States, has led the industry in the development of fuel-saving technologies.
"They've sensed there's a market allure to being green, and they've worked at it," said Peter Pestillo, a former vice chairman of Ford and now chief executive of the auto supply giant Visteon.
General Motors, Ford and Chrysler say their profitability depends largely on selling sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks because they lose money on the cars they sell. By contrast, Honda is making money in the United States and elsewhere selling mostly passenger cars. Indeed, the company's profit was four times that of G.M., currently the most successful of the Big Three, even though its worldwide revenue was less than a third of G.M.'s last year. 
The average new vehicle sold by Honda in the 2000 model year got nearly 30 miles a gallon, about 6 miles more than the average American-made automobile and more than any other automaker.
Until recently, Ford and Toyota were favorites of environmental groups. Ford's chief executive, William Clay Ford Jr., often spoke out on issues like global warming; Toyota advanced fuel-efficient technologies. But watching the two companies support the industry's latest lobbying campaigns, which have gone so far as to portray the sport utility vehicle as a species endangered by regulatory meddling, has embittered some groups.
"The only hope I can see for a future with cleaner cars is Honda," said Daniel F. Becker, director of global warming policy for the Sierra Club and an outspoken critic of the auto industry. 
"They have repeatedly led the way on technology," he said. "They started the race for hybrids. They put on vehicles fuel-saving technologies that Detroit only keeps on the shelves."
Honda recognizes it has disagreements with other producers. "We cannot agree with the alliance on several issues," said Tom Elliot, an executive vice president of American Honda. "It could be CAFE," he said, using official shorthand for the corporate average fuel economy standards required by the federal government. "It could be emissions; it could be trade. There are several issues."
Koichi Amemiya, chief executive of Honda's American operations, said in a recent interview that "business and some social obligation have to be equally applied to the whole company."
Despite its origin as a maker of motorcycles, Honda does not embrace rebellion, and its executives play down their differences with competitors. "We don't get on the bandstand about it," Mr. Elliot said. 
But a bandstand is hardly needed. Consider automakers' responses last month to a request from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for feedback on ways to improve fuel economy. A contentious issue was the regulatory definition of a truck. When fuel economy standards were introduced in the 70's, a category called light trucks, encompassing pickups, was set up for work vehicles used on farms and construction sites. Light trucks are permitted to burn 33 percent more gasoline, on average, than passenger cars.
But the light truck category includes the since highly popular sport utility vehicles and minivans. The change has led to a 7 percent increase in the consumption of oil used for gasoline, even after significant advances in fuel-saving technologies, according to an estimate by the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental advocacy group, among other things.
"The functional distinction between cars and trucks (cars for personal use and trucks for work cargo use) has broken down," the safety agency said in a statement.
But the idea of coming up with one standard for cars and trucks is anathema to many automakers. G.M., in a 336-page report, argued that federal fuel standards had not led to improvements in national energy security, gasoline consumption, climate change or air pollution, and added that imposing significantly higher standards for trucks would be a great disadvantage for the Big Three.
Honda said it would support a combined standard, even though the company sells a popular minivan, the Odyssey, and two small sport utilities, and is adding two larger sport utility models this year.
"There has been a fiction about what a light truck is that has evolved," said Edward Cohen, Honda's top Washington lobbyist. "No one intentionally created the fiction, but the definition that was created many years ago no longer fits."
Honda can maintain enviable profits from smaller vehicles for several reasons. First, it ranks higher in quality than other American-made cars in surveys of buyers, meaning that the buyers are willing to pay a little more. Second, it costs Honda less to produce a car because of manufacturing efficiencies, the company's nonunion status and favorable currency exchange rates. 
Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, argues that Honda would not be at a disadvantage if fuel standards were tightened, while companies selling a higher percentage of light trucks would be. Light trucks account for about a quarter of Honda's American sales. The Big Three each now sell more light trucks than passenger cars in thias country. 
Part of Honda's stance also has to do with an inventive corporate culture. Its top executive, Hiroyuki Yoshino, is an engineer who helped develop an engine for the Civic in the 1970's that could meet new emissions standards without a catalytic converter. More recently, Honda has embarked on such eclectic enterprises as building a humanlike robot that was so lifelike that the company consulted the Vatican for ethical guidance in the late 90's. 
"Honda is a superb technical company, they have very strong principles, and they're very honest," said James Olson, the top lobbyist for Toyota. "They've always been a maverick."
But, he added, "Somebody in the Japanese industry has to get involved with American politics and get their hands dirty." 
"Toyota and Nissan made the decision to get involved," he said, referring to the recent debate over a Senate proposal to raise fuel economy standards by 50 percent over 12 years. "While Honda stood on the sidelines and while the environmentalists were yelling out there about the dirty automakers, we worked with the Senate and the House." 
"I have great respect for Honda," Mr. Olson added, "but I think they're wrong in this case."
Though the Senate voted down the proposal, it did support a measure backed by the industry to direct the traffic safety agency to take some action. But environmental groups think that the agency will do little under the Bush administration. Andrew H. Card Jr., G.M.'s former top lobbyist, is President Bush's chief of staff.
Toyota presents a green image in advertisements and is the only company besides Honda to sell cars that use hybrid engines powered by gasoline and electricity. But to some, the company is increasingly looking and sounding like a full-line manufacturer, in the mold of G.M., Ford or Chrysler.
"It was surprising in some ways that Toyota's lobbying tactics and statements did seem to be stronger this year and a little closer to the alliance's messages," said David Friedman, an engineer and analyst with the Union of Concerned Scientists. "That was disappointing."
But Honda is hardly a stalwart ally of such groups. In reality, the company has navigated a third way between industry and environmental groups. It did not support the failed Senate proposal, saying it was too ambitious. Nor does Honda support the California bill to cut greenhouse gas emissions, preferring a federal policy to state-by-state variation in regulations.
But Honda did help the cause of environmental groups during the Senate debate by financing research that showed higher mileage requirements would not necessarily lead to more highway deaths.
The automobile alliance, supported by the National Academy of Sciences, has argued that fuel economy standards spurred lighter-weight cars, making them less safe and leading to thousands of additional deaths. 
Honda's research found that previous data was years out of date and did not reflect that many mileage gains are now achieved through improved technology as opposed to making cars lighter.
Mr. Ford, who once spoke frequently on issues like global warming, has been largely silent since becoming chief of the struggling company last October. 
"We were against CAFE," he said at a news conference in May. "I know that disappointed some people, but we've always been against CAFE."
"Nothing we've said on the environmental agenda has changed," Mr. Ford added. The company has promised to introduce a hybrid sport utility next year. Still, environmental groups bitterly criticized Mr. Ford after the Senate vote, as they criticized most automakers.
"It was discouraging to see them use all the old 'business versus the environment' arguments on Capitol Hill, instead of seizing the moment to work for what's possible," said Debra Hall, the accountability director for the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies, a coalition of environmental groups and corporations, including G.M. and Ford.

HEADLINE: Enron Agrees to Increase Severance by $30 Million 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, June 11 

 BODY:
The Enron Corporation has agreed to pay nearly $30 million in additional severance to about 4,200 former employees who were laid off after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last December.
 The company said today that after long negotiations it had reached a tentative agreement with the largest creditors in the bankruptcy case and a group of former employees who had been pressing the company for a larger severance package. 
 The proposal is expected to be filed with the bankruptcy court in the next few days. If the federal judge in the bankruptcy case approves the deal, Enron will pay former employees up to $7,900 in additional severance. Many former employees have already received as much as $5,600 in severance pay. 
According to Enron's severance program, a laid-off employee would have been entitled to about a week's pay for every year of service and a week of pay for every $10,000 in salary, said Mark A. Palmer, a company spokesman.
Because of the bankruptcy filing, Enron officials said they were unable to even approach making such large severance payments.
A group of former Enron employees, however, declared victory today after months of pressing the company to further compensate the thousands of employees who were laid off after the company collapsed.
"This is a good deal for former employees," said Richard Rathvon, a former Enron worker who is co-chairman of the employee committee in the bankruptcy case. "But this is just one issue."
Enron and its creditors also agreed to allow the employee committee to investigate and try to recover some of the huge retention bonuses the company paid to some high-level employees just ahead of the bankruptcy filing last December.
Enron may have paid as much as $100 million in retention bonuses just before it filed for bankruptcy protection. The employee committee, which was appointed by the bankruptcy trustee, thinks the retention bonus process was unfair and that some employees left the company soon after accepting the money. 
Former employees said their effort to win larger severance packages was bolstered by the Rev. Jesse Jackson; Representative Sheila Jackson-Lee, a Democrat from Houston; and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. The coalition helped organize former employees in the wake of Enron's downfall and has held several town hall meetings nationwide in recent months.
Today, Mr. Jackson, Ms. Jackson-Lee, several former Enron employees and a small group of placard-waving A.F.L.-C.I.O. members held a news conference in a park across the street from the Enron corporate headquarters in downtown Houston.
"Enron workers demanded what was rightfully theirs and did not take no for an answer," said Linda Chavez-Thompson, executive vice president at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "They were victimized and they have now triumphed over corporate greed."
Mr. Jackson said that over the last few months he had pressed Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's former chairman, and Stephen F. Cooper, the acting chief executive, to help win additional compensation for workers who had been laid off. He applauded their cooperation.
Now that an agreement has been reached, Ms. Jackson-Lee said there could be momentum on Capitol Hill to create legislation intended to help protect workers in the event of a bankruptcy.
"There could be legislative action making employees secured creditors," she said.
If the severance agreement is approved by Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez, who is presiding over the bankruptcy case in New York, former employees would be given the option of accepting a severance package worth up to $13,500 in total or pursuing their own legal remedies.
Katherine Benedict, a former employee who has been searching for a job for six months, said she was pleased with the outcome. She had worked at Enron for seven years.
"This is a very happy day," Ms. Benedict said. "It was the money I should have gotten. I was out of work for six months.
Ms. Benedict, 34, said she recently found a job in Houston. She starts on Wednesday. --------------------

Enron Offshoot Bankrupt
By Reuters
NewPower Holdings, a struggling energy marketer founded by the Enron Corporation, filed for bankruptcy protection yesterday, one day after it dropped services to about 80,000 customers in Texas.
NewPower and two subsidiaries, TNPC Holdings and the New Power Company, filed petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Georgia. 
NewPower, which once sought to become the first nationwide provider of electricity and natural gas to residential and small commercial customers in a deregulated energy market, said in April that it might liquidate its business because of a cash squeeze. 
NewPower said on Monday that it had signed agreements to transfer all its Texas customers to units of two of the state's largest utilities, Reliant Energy and the TXU Corporation.

HEADLINE: New York's Unemployed 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 A key problem facing the unemployed in New York City is the fact that extended unemployment insurance benefits are triggered by the statewide share of the work force receiving benefits, which tends to be much lower than that of the city (news article, June 10). This is especially the case now, when the city's jobless have the most pressing need for extended benefits. 
 One solution is to allow our largest cities to trigger extended benefits based on their own unemployment rate, not on that of the state. While this approach raises some administrative and data challenges, these are not insurmountable, and it has the benefit of treating cities like New York and Los Angeles as the separate economies they are. Most important, at a time like this, it would raise the likelihood that those beset by long-term unemployment would get the benefits they need and deserve.

HEADLINE: TRACES OF TERROR: THE TERROR TRIAL; 
German Chancellor Hopes To Release Evidence Soon

BYLINE:  By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: BERLIN, June 11 

 BODY:
Germany and the United States will soon reach an agreement on how Berlin can supply evidence in the American trial of Zacarias Moussaoui, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder said today.
 Mr. Moussaoui is facing a possible death sentence, accused of six counts of conspiracy in the Sept. 11 attacks. Germany has some evidence of his connection to Al Qaeda that could help convict him. 
 But Germany has a constitutional ban on the death penalty and on providing evidence that could lead to a conviction that results in execution. Officials of the two countries have been negotiating about how the Germans can aid the Americans without breaking German law.
Mr. Schroder was responding to a report in this week's issue of Der Spiegel, which said Germany had been refusing to hand over evidence in the case that could prove that Mr. Moussaoui received bank transfers from Ramzi Muhammad Abdullah bin al-Shibh, who is wanted internationally for a part he is suspected of having played in the attacks.
Mr. Shibh was a Hamburg-based associate of Mohamed Atta, who was instrumental in planning and carrying out the attacks. Germany has two bank transfer documents to Mr. Moussaoui with Mr. Shibh's fingerprints but has provided Washington only with copies, which would be harder to admit as evidence in court.
"It's exclusively to do with legal systems that are different," Mr. Schroder said.
"I think that a common solution will be found very soon," he added. "Effectively combating terror must be in the foreground, but it's well understood in the United States that constitutional norms must be respected."
The death penalty is outlawed throughout the European Union. France had earlier taken the same position, refusing to provide evidence against Mr. Moussaoui, a French national of Moroccan origin, as long as he faces the death penalty. The Council of Europe, which comprises 40 countries, also forbids the death penalty, even in wartime.
Mr. Moussaoui is the first person charged in the Sept. 11 attacks, and four of the six counts against him carry the death penalty.
American officials said that this was not the first time Europeans had withheld evidence because of the death penalty but that the prominence of Mr. Moussaoui made the issue appear sharper.
For years, European Union countries have refused to extradite to countries with the death penalty unless assured that the suspects will not face execution. German efforts to get such assurances about Mr. Moussaoui failed, Der Spiegel said. German officials are now trying to find a way to provide evidence that cannot be used to justify the imposition of the death penalty. Der Spiegel called the suggestion "comical."
One reason the Germans have not extradited the Islamic militant known as the Caliph of Cologne to Turkey is because Turkey has the death penalty. The militant, Metin Kaplan, is charged with involvement in a failed 1998 plot to fly a plane filled with explosives into the mausoleum of Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the Turkish republic. 
Senior German officials say the United States knows everything that Germany has discovered about Mr. Atta and his associates in Hamburg, including their connections to Mr. Moussaoui. But there is a difference between exchanging information to understand what happened and providing evidence of a capital crime, the officials emphasized.
Mr. Schroder called a news conference today with his foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, to emphasize their foreign policy successes. Their coalition is running behind the conservatives in polls for the Sept. 22 election. But German elections, like American ones, are largely decided on domestic issues, and Mr. Schroder is suffering because of a stagnant economy and high unemployment.

HEADLINE: Back From the Edge on Kashmir 

 BODY:
The danger of nuclear war between India and Pakistan is receding, and American diplomacy deserves much of the credit, along with parallel efforts by Britain, Russia, the European Union and China. Yet with a million troops still poised on either side of the border and the two countries as far apart as ever in their views on Kashmir, the crisis is scarcely over. 
 In the past, America has generally confined its high-level involvement in the subcontinent's affairs to short-run crisis management. Now there is an opportunity and a need for a more sustained role. Washington's relations with New Delhi are better than they have been in decades. Building on foundations laid during the Clinton years, the Bush administration has worked hard to build constructive new economic, diplomatic and military ties with the world's most populous democracy. Relations with Pakistan, once a close ally, have also rebounded from severe recent strains, largely thanks to the decision by the country's military dictator, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, to support American military efforts in Afghanistan. 
 Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld arrived in New Delhi yesterday to resume the shuttle diplomacy begun last week by Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage. Mr. Armitage persuaded General Musharraf to carry out his pledges of a complete halt to the infiltration of men and arms into the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir. Then he got New Delhi to overcome its distrust of the general and accept his commitment as genuine. On Monday India ended its five-month-old ban on commercial Pakistani aircraft overflying Indian territory and withdrew naval vessels from Pakistan's coast. In the coming weeks, Pakistan will have to take further steps to demonstrate that it has permanently cut off support for Kashmir-related terrorism. India has to understand that peace also depends on responding to the political discontents of Kashmir's Muslim majority.
The underlying quarrel dates back to 1947, when the subcontinent was partitioned between a secular India and a Muslim Pakistan. Both sides claim Kashmir, but after two wars, India controls most of it. In recent years Pakistan has accelerated infiltration of men and arms across the de facto border, known as the Line of Control. Mr. Rumsfeld must persuade Pakistan to seal its side of the Line of Control, empty terrorist camps on its territory and close staging areas and infiltration routes. America can provide India with intelligence data confirming that this is being done. 
Once India is satisfied that Pakistan has acted, it should begin pulling back troops from the border. The large military presence on both sides increases the risk of a conflict starting by accident. New Delhi also has to see to it that the elections to be held in Kashmir later this year are more honestly conducted than the previous round, and must live up to the promises of autonomy the state is entitled to under India's Constitution. Military repression of Kashmir's civilian population should end. New Delhi rejects the idea of international mediation on Kashmir. That is all the more reason for Washington to encourage direct talks between India and Pakistan on the issue. 
Both countries have paid a heavy economic and human price for their 55 years of confrontation over Kashmir. With nuclear weapons now in the picture, it is time for America to help nudge India and Pakistan toward a peaceful resolution.

HEADLINE: The Education Mayor's Big Win 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael Bloomberg has won the first crucial rounds in his war to improve New York City's public schools. The negotiations for a teachers' contract, stalled for 19 months, finally concluded with a tentative settlement on Monday. Yesterday the State Legislature put the final touches on an agreement that gives Mr. Bloomberg substantial control over the city schools. Now comes the hard part. Having achieved enough of what he wanted from the Legislature and the teachers, the mayor has to produce what he promised -- better education. 
 The new teachers' contract, with healthy raises of 16 to 22 percent, should help the city hire and retain good instructors. The contract also adds 100 minutes to teachers' official workweek, an educational bonus to be used for student instruction or professional development for the teachers. It is critical that superintendents and principals make the best possible use of this extra time. If we had a single priority, it would be for mentoring and training new teachers to get them through the crucial first five years in the classroom, when so many drop out of the profession. 
 In the critical matter of assigning and hiring teachers at each school, Mr. Bloomberg and his new education establishment will have to find a way to work with union rules that are only incrementally less restrictive than before. With such a good pay offer, the city should have gotten more flexibility in work rules. Negotiators will have to try again in the next round of contract negotiations that start in the spring.
Despite all the political celebration at City Hall and in Albany, this teachers' contract creates enough financial problems to give pause even to the normally sanguine Mr. Bloomberg. It is staggeringly expensive at $1.14 billion, part of which is to be financed temporarily through the one-time allotment of state funds. The desperate hope in City Hall and the State Legislature is that a better economy will arrive just in the nick of time to plug the gaping holes in next year's budget. 
This page has long supported the idea that mayors should have control as well as responsibility for the success of the school system. Mr. Bloomberg has managed to get that. After 33 years of decentralization in New York City's schools, the Legislature gave Mr. Bloomberg authority to pick both the chancellor and the majority of the school board. Since the chancellor will be able to pick the district superintendents, that means a clear line of command from the top. However, the mayor will still have to get a waiver from the Board of Regents if he chooses a chancellor without the education credentials required by law for the job.
Mr. Bloomberg has said he wants a person with business and management skills at the top of the school system, with a deputy to oversee educational interests. Outsiders might feel he already has such a chancellor in Harold Levy, a former corporate executive who is also a former regent. But Mr. Bloomberg is set on naming his own person, and the Regents should bend over backward to let him have his choice.
It would be easier to cheer wholeheartedly about Mr. Bloomberg's triumphs this week if the city could actually afford the extra pay promised to teachers. Nevertheless, the core of a good school system is good teachers and responsible management, and the city just took a big step toward achieving both.

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF THE TIMES; 
Diplomatic Square Dancing With Russia as a Partner

BYLINE:  by RICHARD EDER 

 BODY:
THE RUSSIA HAND
A Memoir of Presidential Diplomacy
By Strobe Talbott
Illustrated. 478 pages. Random House. $29.95.
 From the time he studied Russian at boarding school, Strobe Talbott arranged himself to be a specialist. He majored in Russian at Yale, wrote an Oxford thesis on the poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, joined the Moscow bureau of Time magazine and then, as that magazine's foreign-policy writer in Washington, took a particular interest in United States-Soviet affairs. 
 Much later he put his expertise to work for a hyperkinetic former Oxford housemate, fellow Rhodes Scholar and companion in all-night talk and junk-food sessions. Named deputy secretary of state, he became President Bill Clinton's top adviser and operative for relations with the former Soviet Union.
Thus, logically and in a sense trickily, the title of his book: "The Russia Hand." This was Mr. Talbott, of course, whose memoir is a dextrous and generally engrossing account of his own handiwork.
But Boris N. Yeltsin's Russia was in perpetual crisis, the threats to its precarious democracy were violent, the post in post-cold war was wobbly, and President Yeltsin, was vehement, impetuous, battered by legislative mutineers and needy. This was a combination, the author suggests, that Mr. Clinton found easy to recognize and hard to resist.
"Events in Moscow and the importuning of the man shakily in charge there thrust upon Clinton the portfolio he'd hoped I'd handle for him," Mr. Talbott writes. Soon after taking office, Mr. Clinton "had become the U.S. government's principal Russia hand, and so he remained for the duration of his presidency." 
"The Russia Hand" recounts the major and minor crises over issues like the expansion of NATO, the removal of missiles from Ukraine, Western military action against the Bosnian Serbs, the much graver confrontation over Kosovo, the question of antimissile defense. Some were resolved, some -- Russian nuclear aid to Iran -- verbally settled yet unsettled in fact to this day. Other crises eased in the post-9/11 detente between Presidents George W. Bush and Vladimir V. Putin.
Mr. Talbott writes of process: negotiations, standoffs, breakdowns and maneuverings. He writes of the fragilities, the dangers and the bad choices among which tactical decisions must be made. He writes so well, and sometimes with such dramatic skill, as to go beyond the wonkery that one or two reviews have attributed to his book.
For anyone not already engaged in the subject, antimissile defense disputes may seem dry. Who would have thought that the advances and retreats over expanding NATO to include the former Soviet satellites could be made so involving?
Mr. Talbott enlivens the subject with choice anecdotes. When the Russian delegation arrived in Washington to argue, Mr. Talbott's counterpart, Yuri Mamedov, bounced off the plane cheerfully citing an Op-Ed page denunciation in The New York Times by George Kennan, a revered expert on the cold war. "Your hero has saved us having to write talking points on your NATO folly," Mr. Mamedov gloated.
The most gripping sequence is Mr. Talbott's account of the Kosovo crisis. The NATO aerial assault on Serbia was a grave affront to the Russians. 
Eventually they gave way to the Western alliance, but Mr. Talbott describes a near mutiny by Russian generals who, disobeying the government, sent their troops to seize the airport in Pristina, Kosovo's capital. Informed of this while negotiating with Mr. Talbott and his aides, the Russian defense minister broke off and furiously marched his subordinates into another room.
"It sounded as though there was a riot under way down the hall," Mr. Talbott writes. "I heard the thump and crash of articles being hurled against the wall." 
As an official Mr. Talbott attempted to hold his verbal gifts in check. ("Loose quips sink dips," cautioned Leon Fuerth, Al Gore's foreign policy adviser, tutoring his egghead colleague in the ways of the hard-boiled.) Fortunately, though, they show up here. At its best, his book is a chain of scenes, portraits and phrases, purposefully linked.
There is Lawrence Summers, the Treasury's man for international affairs, demanding tough economic conditions for helping Russia. "Larry's brain was like a tank powered by a Lotus engine: it purred as it rolled over anything in its way." Partly in the way were the president and Mr. Talbott. They noted that democracy meant sloppiness, and that Mr. Yeltsin, however sloppy and sometimes drunk, was an indispensable midwife to Russian democracy's cataclysmic birthing, and needed leeway.
There is Mr. Mamedov, pleasantly cynical and as devoted as Mr. Talbott to getting things to work and nursing the lurches. A friendship is struck: nowhere, surely, is postmodern diplomacy better portrayed than when Mr. Yeltsin's tanks assault the rebellious Russian legislature. Mr. Talbott and Mr. Mamedov, normally major players, watch it on CNN from Washington and Moscow respectively. Spectators like the rest of us, they exchange running comments by phone.
There is Yevgeny Primakov, a relative hard-liner and longtime Soviet intelligence chief, telling Mr. Talbott and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright of his diligent reading of John le Carre. Does he identify with the Soviet spymaster Karla? "No," is the reply. "I identify with George Smiley." Later, when Ms. Albright complains that a bill giving religious supremacy to the Russian Orthodox Church could alienate American friends of Russian democracy, Mr. Primakov -- no doubt thinking back to when the line between the two countries was stonier but clearer -- responds, "Madeleine, Madeleine, sometimes I'm not sure how much more of your friendship we can stand."
One thinks of the proclaimed intention of the incoming Bush administration to hold Russia at a formal distance. What could be more different from Mr. Clinton's hands-on, brainy intuitiveness, described in a vivid detail that could make this book the best news that our ex-president has had in some time; or Mr. Yeltsin's lurching grand opera scenes with their oddly positive endings, also vividly portrayed.
One thinks as well of the subsequent Bush-Putin meetings, the hugs, the forthright eye-traffic, the talk of soul. As Mr. Talbott writes of his own learning curve: "The map was not the territory."

HEADLINE: Castro Calls March Against Bush's Criticism 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: MIAMI, June 11 

 BODY:
President Fidel Castro of Cuba has called for "massive marches" on Wednesday to protest the Bush administration's hard-line policies against his government and support a move to declare socialist Cuba "untouchable." 
 Mr. 
Castro announced the demonstrations in a speech on Monday in which he rejected President Bush's calls for free elections and respect for human rights in Cuba. 
 "We are not a military power, but a moral and patriotic one," Mr. Castro said, according to an article today in Granma, the Communist Party newspaper, "a nation with a profound sentiment of justice and freedom that can only prosper with this socialist system."
Cuba's economy has been buffeted. Venezuela has suspended much-needed oil shipments, consumer prices have risen and tourism has been slow. To make up for a reduced flow of dollars, the government recently began accepting the euro. 
But rather than ease his stance against the United States, Mr. Castro been increasingly defiant.

HEADLINE: Outsiders' Precautions Taking a Toll onIndia 

BYLINE:  By SARITHA RAI 

DATELINE: BANGALORE, India, June 12 

 BODY:
Bracing for war has become a major headache for Indian businesses.
 But they are not smarting from their own efforts to prepare for the possibility that tensions with Pakistan may erupt into fighting. Rather, it is the precautions taken by foreign governments and businesses that are causing the havoc here. 
 Travel warnings have all but emptied the country of both tourists and businesspeople from developed countries. Evacuations of embassy and consular employees have left no one to process visa applications from Indian businesspeople or to answer questions about customs, trade and other regulations. 
Moving goods in and out of some parts of the country is becoming difficult, too. And Indian companies find themselves fielding floods of inquiries from customers and suppliers about whether it is safe to keep doing business.
"These measures have the effect of pressurizing India in the same way that economic sanctions do," said Ashok Soota, president of the Confederation of Indian Industry, an influential trade organization.
Even if the American defense secretary, Donald H. Rumsfeld, is successful in easing tensions during his visits to India and Pakistan this week, the crimping effects of the crisis on business will be felt for some time, many here say. 
"The whole thing has sent very negative signals, and the sentiment will linger on for quite a while," said Arun Bharat Ram, vice chairman of SRF Ltd., the flagship company of one of India's oldest conglomerates.
His company had been in talks with potential partners in the United States over a possible joint venture in its chemicals business, and it had expected a group of American executives to visit New Delhi this month to pursue a deal, but the meetings have been indefinitely postponed, he said.
Citing other lost deals he has heard about, Mr. Bharat Ram added, "There seems an unwillingness to do business with Indian businessmen."
In an effort to overcome such developing aversions, the Confederation of Indian Industry is organizing what it calls a confidence- building mission. Indian executives including Mr. Soota and Mr. Bharat Ram will visit the United States starting Sunday to meet with administration officials and members of Congress.
Before the Kashmir crisis flared up, Mr. Soota said, "economic relations between the United States and India were on an upswing, and there were unprecedented private- sector initiatives for defense collaboration," and the Indian business community wants to recapture that trend. 
Considerable damage has already been done by the crisis, according to the Center for Monitoring the Indian Economy, a Bombay-based research group. The country's current account deficit will nearly triple, to $4.4 billion, in the current fiscal year, from $1.5 billion the year before, the center has forecast.
"Coercive diplomacy has caused, for the large part, the deterioration of the current account deficit," said the center's chief executive, Mahesh Vyas.
This week, a global insurance industry group, the International Underwriters Association, said that insurers would begin assessing a war-risk surcharge on policies for ships visiting ports in western India, which are nearest to Pakistan. Oil tankers, container ships and dry-bulk vessels carrying grain and other commodities to and from Kandla, the ports near Bombay and those in Cochin would be affected, though decisions would be made case by case, the association said.
Mr. Vyas said tourism and software services, two industries that depend heavily on foreign business, are the areas where the effects of the crisis are most severe so far. Remittances from Indians overseas are also falling, he said. 
Airlines and hotels are reeling, even in cities like Bangalore, the country's technology hub, which is more than 1,000 miles from Pakistan. The Oberoi Group, a leading hotel operator, said its hotel here catering to businesspeople was only 35 percent occupied, down from a typical 75 percent, and the loss of foreign bookings accounted for nearly all the drop. 
"It has been much worse than the weeks following 9/11," said Amitabh Mishra, the Oberoi Group's regional sales manager.
Indian consumers are pulling back their spending, too, in anticipation of difficult times. The RPG Group, a conglomerate that owns the country's largest chain retailer among other businesses, said there was a slump in the kinds of goods people buy on impulse, like music CD's.
Sales at the group's HMV record label are down significantly, according to Sanjiv Goenka, the group's vice chairman. Smaller rivals like Fabmart, an online retailer, said books, jewelry and computers were also down.
"The retail sector is affected because the feel-good factor is low at times like this," Mr. Goenka said by telephone from his office in Calcutta. He echoed the frustration of many businesspeople at the harmful effects of the travel advisories and evacuations, which he said were unnecessary. "It puts a lot of pressure on India," he said. "Where is the need for these unofficial economic sanctions?"
Still, he said, two of the group's other main businesses, tire manufacturing and power generation, were holding up well, and even the record business had one bright spot: sales of patriotic music have risen to record levels. 
An extra production run of 50,000 copies of an album by the singer Lata Mangeshkar containing the song "Ae mere watan ke logo" ("O People of My Homeland") sold out in days; in ordinary times the company sells about 10,000 of the singer's albums a month.

HEADLINE: A Closer Look 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Eventually, almost certainly, a distinguished bipartisan commission will be convened to examine the conditions that led to the catastrophe of Sept. 11.
 The Bush administration doesn't want this. And Republicans in Congress are fighting to prevent it. But it will happen. 
 The American public remains largely in the dark about the terrorist threat that is still out there, and the nation's preparedness to deal with it. The periodic terror-related announcements by top Bush administration officials often seem calculated not to educate or to illuminate, but rather to frighten the public and intimidate the political opposition.
That is not acceptable in a free society. Despite the preferences of the administration, which likes to operate behind closed doors with the windows shut and the shades drawn, the public has a right to more information, not less. A thoroughly independent, non-Congressional inquiry is essential. 
And that sentiment was poignantly expressed this week by a group of women whose husbands were lost in the World Trade Center attack. They traveled to Washington for a round of meetings and demonstrations in an effort to build support for an independent investigation. "It's not about politics," said one of the women, Kristen Breitweiser of Middletown, N.J. "It's about doing the right thing. It's about the safety of the nation."
The calls for such an inquiry are coming with more frequency.
"History will demand an independent inquiry," former Senator Gary Hart told me in an interview last week. "We might as well get on with it and do it properly."
Mr. Hart was co-chairman, along with former Senator Warren Rudman, of a special commission on national security that warned as recently as the spring of 2001 that the United States was becoming increasingly vulnerable to attack by terrorists and other hostile groups. The commission concluded that sometime in the first quarter of the 21st century "Americans will likely die on American soil, possibly in large numbers."
Mr. Hart said that in the wake of the Sept. 11 tragedy, "The amazing thing to me is how little demand there has been by the public for information. The assumption seems to be that everything's being taken care of." 
Part of the problem has been the success the administration has had in managing the news and keeping fears of terror at a heightened pitch. Every time serious criticism of the nation's preparedness begins to emerge, the administration tries to trump it with some terror warning or some big new antiterror initiative.
Gone are the days when a Franklin Roosevelt would try to defuse an economic panic by cautioning a nation against the fear of fear itself. Or when a Winston Churchill would rally a war-stricken nation by proclaiming, "We shall not flag or fail."
Instead we have Dick Cheney on "Meet the Press" saying another attack on the U.S. by Al Qaeda is "almost certain." And we have the director of the F.B.I., Robert Mueller, telling a gathering of district attorneys that suicide bombings like those in Israel are "inevitable" on American soil.
It's a peculiar leadership strategy that depends for its success on routinely scaring the heck out of the population.
The government-induced anxiety was ratcheted way up by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's insistence that terrorists "inevitably will get their hands" on weapons of mass destruction, which include chemical, biological and nuclear arms. 
Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Now what can we do about that?
An independent inquiry would give us a better understanding of the various threats (including some reasonable sense of their likelihood), and would let the nation know how prepared (or ill prepared) we are to meet them. A proper inquiry would not be sensational or political. It would be a learning process. The commission would thoroughly examine what happened and what went wrong in the weeks, months and years leading up to Sept. 11, and it would assess our current readiness to deal with the continuing threat.
It would build confidence, ease fears and provide a blueprint for the prevention of future attacks. It would also, as Mr. Hart pointed out, establish "as clear and factual a contemporary record as we can possibly get." 
This has to happen. So why not sooner rather than later?

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
The Sierra Club criticizes Ford's chief in a campaign for fuel-efficient cars.

BYLINE:  By Danny Hakim 

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
THE Sierra Club introduced an advertising campaign yesterday that ties fuel economy to patriotism and calls for action by William Clay Ford Jr., the chairman and chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, who was once viewed by the group as an ally.
 The campaign, produced by Haddow Communications, is being rolled out in a dozen states. The campaign includes a radio spot and television ads featuring Bob Kerrey, the former Nebraska senator, and Jack Shanahan, a retired vice admiral. Both men urge the auto industry to take action to cut oil use. 
 "It's time for us to tell the auto industry that we want to break the grip of oil-producing countries and reduce our oil use," Mr. Kerrey said in one spot, which also showed pictures of oil fields burning in Kuwait during the Persian Gulf war. 
The advertisements encourage consumers to ask dealers for a so-called freedom option package. Instead of air-conditioned seats or a sunroof, the Sierra Club wants people to buy cars with eco-friendly features like continuously variable transmissions, which obtain better mileage by using an infinite number of gears, and integrated starter-generators, which shut off engines while idling.
The group said only the Toyota Prius, from Toyota Motor, and a new version of the Honda Civic, from Honda Motor, which both use hybrid engines that combine gasoline and electric power, offer the entire freedom package.
But the most surprising part of the campaign is that it singles out one company, and one man, in particular -- Mr. Ford -- in a radio ad. 
"Now more than ever, America needs cars that get better gas mileage," says a narrator in the ad, which began showing in Washington yesterday. 
"That's why we're asking Bill Ford, head of the Ford Motor Company, to do his part and to produce more fuel-efficient cars, S.U.V.'s and pickup trucks."
In October, Mr. Ford became chief executive of the company founded by his great-grandfather. Before that he was perceived as an iconoclast, a Detroit executive with a green image who would talk about issues like global warming. Groups like the Sierra Club were quite hopeful that he would lead the company to break with the industry's lobbying against toughening fuel-economy regulations.
Instead, Mr. Ford kept the company in the trade groups that backed the industry's campaigns against higher federal gas mileage standards during a Senate debate earlier this year, souring relations with several environmental groups. 
Still, the Sierra Club considers General Motors and the Chrysler Group of DaimlerChrysler to be more entrenched opponents on fuel-economy legislation, so why single out Mr. Ford?
"If you want somebody to lead, you go to somebody who wants to be a leader," said Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club. "We think Bill Ford wants to be a leader, but there are people in his company who don't want him to be a leader."
He added that the radio ad was intended "to up the cost of not leading" by calling into question the image the company has fostered as being concerned about environmental issues.
Ford did pledge in 2000 to improve the fuel economy of its sport utility vehicles by 25 percent over five years, leading G.M. and Chrysler to say they would match Ford. And Ford has said it will come out with what would be the first sport utility vehicle to use a hybrid engine next year. But since becoming chief executive, Mr. Ford is faced with a struggling company that lost $5.5 billion last year and has not been vocal on environmental issues.
"There is no dissension within Ford over our commitment to deliver improved fuel economy," Mr. Ford said in a statement.
"The Sierra Club chose to target Ford and me personally because we are seen as leaders," he added. "I think that's ironic because I have often been criticized for being too far out front on this issue. But we will not change the course we are on and will not alter our commitment to improving the fuel efficiency of our products." 
The Sierra Club intended to start running the radio spot in Detroit yesterday as well as Washington but has not yet found a local station willing to play the ad.
"We felt it was inappropriate for the Sierra Club to single out an individual and attack an individual in the ad," said Rich Homberg, general manager of WWJ, a local news station owned by Viacom. 
Ford has been one of the station's advertisers, but Mr. Homberg said the decision was made on the merits of the ad. 
"Singling out the C.E.O. of a major automaker, especially one who was in the forefront of the issue, seems inappropriate," he said. "We're one of the stations that sets the standard for journalism in this community. We didn't make this call lightly."

HEADLINE: Import Prices Are Steady; An Increase Had Been Expected 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 12 

 BODY:
Import prices were unchanged in May, according to a Labor Department index, reflecting cheaper computers and the biggest decline in automobile costs since 1992. Food and fuel prices increased. 
 Economists had expected a 0.4 percent rise in the import price index after a revised 1.6 percent increase in April. Excluding petroleum, the cost of goods purchased from abroad decreased 0.1 percent, the Labor Department said. That was the third decline in five months and followed an increase of 0.6 percent in April. 
 "International and domestic competition remain very intense," said Steve Wood, chief economist at FinancialOxygen in Walnut Creek, Calif., a provider of financial services to banks, "and that's continuing to keep pressure on pricing power."
Overall prices of imported goods are down 3.8 percent from May 2001, the Labor Department said. Excluding petroleum, prices are down 3 percent. 
Last month, petroleum prices rose 0.9 percent after surging 12.7 percent in April and 17 percent in March. From a high of $29.36 a barrel in mid-May, the cost of crude oil has fallen to around $24 a barrel.
The decline comes as the International Energy Agency reduced its estimate for oil demand in the second half of the year, and non-OPEC producers increased output.
The prices of imported automobiles and parts fell 0.3 percent in May, the biggest decline since a 1.1 percent drop in December 1992. The index of imported consumer goods excluding autos was unchanged after falling 0.1 percent in April. The last time that index increased was in March 2001, Labor Department officials said. 
Prices for capital goods and other business equipment fell 0.1 percent in May after rising 0.1 percent in April. Prices of electric generating equipment fell 0.4 percent. 
The costs of imported computer equipment and office machines declined 0.6 percent in May after rising 0.2 percent. Computer prices were 6.6 percent cheaper than they were a year earlier. 
Imported building materials fell 1.3 percent in May and paper prices decreased 0.7 percent. 
The cost of imported iron and steel fell 0.3 percent in May. Food prices increased 1.3 percent. 
Broken out by region, prices for goods from Japan fell 0.1 percent last month. From European Union countries they rose 0.3 percent, and from Canada import prices were unchanged. Prices of goods from Latin America rose 1.5 percent.
The import price statistics are not seasonally adjusted.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
There have been significant changes in the welfare system, yet a rise in child poverty rates is now a real risk in the U.S.

BYLINE:  By Jeff Madrick; Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine and of a new journal of social health, Indicators. Both publications are based in Armonk, N.Y. He is an adjunct professor of humanities at Cooper Union. E-mail: challenge@mesharpe.com.

 BODY:
The sharp cut in welfare caseloads in recent years has forced many skeptics to acknowledge that the controversial reforms of 1996 had some merit. In addition to reducing the welfare rolls, one of the legislation's objectives was to raise the standard of living of poor children. The poverty rate of children has indeed dropped substantially as their parents have found work. 
 But many, if not most, of these surprisingly good results were a consequence of the economic boom of the late 1990's, which created so many jobs. And now a rise in child poverty rates is again a risk. The unemployment rate is up. The House has just passed a tougher welfare reform proposal requiring still more hours of work for aid recipients, even as the job market softens. The Senate also faces renewal of two important family welfare programs and is not likely to expand benefits significantly. In the meantime, states are likely to cut back on social programs now that the recession has seriously strained their finances. 
 In truth, not enough progress was made during the boom years. Over all, the official child poverty rate has fallen to 16 percent, but it is still well above the lows of the late 1960's and 1970's of around 14 percent, and the rate probably moved up in 2001. Child poverty for blacks and Hispanics, also down, is still an unconscionable 30 percent and 28 percent, respectively. 
But the financial state of America's children becomes a stark national embarrassment when we compare it with that in other rich nations. Timothy Smeeding of Syracuse University, based on work done in collaboration with his Harvard colleague Lee Rainwater, has completed probably the most comprehensive study to date on the subject. 
Because poverty rates are measured differently across nations, they are not typically comparable. To adjust for this, Mr. Smeeding draws a poverty line at a specific percentage of a nation's median income (including government cash and near-cash transfers, like America's food stamps). In Europe, official poverty lines are typically about 50 percent of median income, or even higher. In the United States, it is somewhat above 40 percent.
Based on a poverty line of 40 percent, Mr. Smeeding calculates that America still has a child poverty rate of 14.8 percent, the highest among the 19 rich members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development for which he has data. Only Italy comes close, at 14.6 percent. The next closest is Canada at 9.6 percent, then Britain at 8.4 percent. France's child poverty rate is only 2.9 percent, Taiwan's is 2 percent, and Sweden is at the bottom of the list, at 1.3 percent.
The American data is updated through 1997, but the fall in the poverty rate since then does not alter the national relationships because the differences are so large.
Mr. Smeeding also adjusts these income levels for what they can actually buy in each nation, or "purchasing power parity." By doing this, he can estimate the actual standard of living of children in different countries.
It turns out that America's poorest children -- say, those in the bottom 10 percent -- have a lower standard of living than those in the bottom 10 percent in any of the other nations measured except Britain. 
Moreover, the gap from rich to poor is far higher in the United States than anywhere else. In America, he finds, a child in the 90th percentile -- one whose income is higher than 90 percent of all children -- has an adjusted income five times that of one in the 10th percentile. In all other nations, it is an average of three times.
The United States also has the greatest gap between the child in the middle of the pack -- the median -- and the poor child in the 10th percentile.
Guy Stevens, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve until his recent retirement, supplements income data with an analysis of a couple of dozen noneconomic indicators of childhood well-being. He finds that the state of America's poor children is every bit as bad as the low incomes suggest.
Infant mortality rates in America are only slightly better than in Cuba, Mr. Stevens notes, making it 33rd in the world. Eighteen percent of American women have minimal or no prenatal care, higher than in any other rich nation. Fourteen percent of children have no health insurance. Only 60 percent of 3- and 4-year-olds go to child care, well below the European rate, and many of those go to centers that are inadequate.
What should be done? The welfare reform of 1996 is sending more people to work, but they are often earning so little that a high proportion of these households are either still officially poor or living close to the poverty line -- leaving their children poor as well. 
At the least, the 1996 reform package should be supplemented with financing to provide quality child care to working parents. Mr. Stevens would like to see a serious effort to provide universal health insurance for all children.
But nothing is as important to child welfare as better jobs and higher wages for parents. A handful of Democratic senators are urging an expansion of programs that help many poor people overcome obstacles like drug abuse and domestic violence to find work. The earned-income tax credit should also be increased and the minimum wage raised.
Government assistance to the poor does not sit easily with Americans. We assume anyone can make it if only he or she tries. But surely we cannot impose this standard on children as well. "Too bad children can't vote," Mr. Stevens laments. Child poverty remains one of America's most stunning failures.

HEADLINE: Officials Say Heroin Arrests Show New Supply Routes 

BYLINE:  By BENJAMIN WEISER 

 BODY:
Federal authorities said yesterday that they had broken up a major Colombian drug-exporting ring that was smuggling millions of dollars worth of heroin each month into New York and elsewhere.
 Prosecutors said that among the 25 people arrested, both in New York and Colombia, were the group's leader and two top aides. The extradition of the three to the United States is now being sought. 
 The arrests highlight what the authorities say has been the use of increasingly sophisticated smuggling techniques and the emergence of Colombia as a successor to Asia as the major heroin supplier to the United States. 
In describing the new techniques, James B. Comey, the United States attorney in Manhattan, told of chemists working in Colombian laboratories who dissolved heroin into clothing that was folded and packed in suitcases and carried by couriers into the United States. Then, chemists in this country extracted the heroin and had it prepared for sale on the street, he said.
"Heroin is back in New York, and it is back with a vengeance," Mr. Comey said. He added that, while 20 years ago, the heroin sold on the streets of New York came from Southwest and Southeast Asia, "The Colombian drug lords have branched out from cocaine and have come to dominate that traffic." 
Felix J. Jimenez, special agent in charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration's New York field office, said United States investigators worked closely in the yearlong investigation with Colombian law enforcement authorities, including sharing intelligence information developed in both countries.
Mr. Comey, who was joined at a news conference by a general from the Colombian National Police, said the drug ring was "among the most powerful, the most dominant heroin organizations in the world."
Prosecutors said the group smuggled 10 to 20 kilograms of heroin, with a street value of $1.5 to $3 million, into the United States each month. 
Mr. Comey said the Colombians' move into the American marketplace reflected "just economics." In the last decade, he said, Colombian drug lords, long major cocaine exporters, realized they could also grow opium in the Colombian climate. By selling at high purity and a low price, he said, they saw they could make inroads into the market share held by the Asian countries.
"It's what we might call in another market 'predatory pricing,' " Mr. Comey said, "and they essentially captured the market, particularly here on the East Coast, but throughout most of the country."
The indictment, unsealed yesterday in Federal District Court in Manhattan, charges that the organization, led by Jose Jairo Garcia-Giraldo, bought heroin on the open market after it was grown on farms and refined in laboratories. The heroin was then prepared for smuggling in special packaging mills, where it was "secreted in hidden compartments in luggage and soaked into clothing for transit to the United States," the indictment said.
Couriers then carried the heroin into the United States on commercial flights, for distribution in New York City, Philadelphia and Boston. Some was transported in less sophisticated ways as well, Mr. Comey said. For example, he said, Colombian investigators have seized 15 kilograms of heroin, much of it in pellet form, suggesting that it was to be swallowed by people known as mules, who would then carry it into the United States.
Along with Mr. Garcia-Giraldo, the United States government is seeking the extradition of his brother, Fabio, who the indictment said coordinated shipments to the United States through Ecuador and the recruiting of couriers. Also sought was Juan Carlos Giraldo-Perez, who was described as overseeing the packaging of the organization's heroin. The government also indicted several people it called "New York based distributors" for the group.
None of those arrested in New York appeared in court for arraignment yesterday.
The government said that, among other things, it had seized $490,000 in drug proceeds in New York and 55 pounds of heroin-soaked clothing from a courier in Houston.
Mr. Comey said that the heroin "made the clothing fairly rough -- you wouldn't want to wear it."

HEADLINE: Vermont to Require Drug Makers To Disclose Payments to Doctors 

BYLINE:  By MELODY PETERSEN 

 BODY:
Amid rising concern about the cost of prescription drugs, Vermont is expected today to become the first state in the nation to require pharmaceutical companies to disclose their gifts and cash payments to doctors, hospitals and other health care providers.
 "Drug companies are giving doctors free dinners and flying them to Florida for a vacation," said Vermont's governor, Howard Dean, a Democrat. He plans to sign the disclosure bill, which has been passed by both houses of the Legislature, in Montpelier, the state capital, today. 
 Governor Dean, a doctor who has talked of seeking the presidency on a health care platform, said he thought such gifts could influence physicians to prescribe certain drugs -- often the most expensive ones. Vermont officials hope the disclosure requirement will force doctors and drug companies to change their behavior. 
The legislation in Vermont is part of a growing effort by state and federal lawmakers to rein in drug companies' marketing practices. On May 31, Gov. Benjamin J. Cayetano of Hawaii signed a law that requires drug companies to report how much they are spending on marketing, including the cost of television advertisements broadcast in the state.
Legislators in other states, including New York, have proposed bills to prevent drug companies from deducting the cost of advertising on their state tax returns. In all, measures regulating pharmaceutical company marketing have been introduced in at least 15 states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
In Congress, a recently introduced bill would block drug companies from deducting consumer advertising costs that exceed the amount they spend on research. Other federal legislation would allow the Food and Drug Administration to impose penalties as high as $10 million for advertising the agency found to be misleading.
"The patient needs to know whether the doctor is prescribing drugs based on good sound medical practice or whether he has been influenced by gratuities from the manufacturer," said Richard T. Moore, a Massachusetts state senator who has introduced legislation there to force doctors to disclose gifts from drug companies.
The drug industry spent $19 billion last year on advertising and promotion -- more than double the $9.1 billion it spent five years ago, according to IMS Health, a consulting firm. About half that consists of the value of free drug samples given to doctors. The rest includes the cost of sales representatives, gifts to doctors and advertising.
The pharmaceutical companies say the sales visits and discussions with doctors are essential for transmitting the most recent scientific information on how medicines should be prescribed. Their consumer ads, they say, help prompt people who are suffering from undiagnosed medical problems to seek care and remind them to take their medicine.
Earlier this year, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry trade group, revised its ethics guidelines to make it clearer that certain gifts -- particularly those related to entertainment rather than education -- are inappropriate. 
The industry has long had rules aimed at limiting such practices, but many companies appeared to ignore them, perhaps because the rules were too vague. The new guidelines go into effect on July 1. 
"We now consider theater tickets and sporting events to be inappropriate," said Jeff Trewhitt, a spokesman for the trade group.
The issue has caught the attention of state legislators as they seek ways to slow the increasing cost of drugs paid for by Medicaid programs, which provide health care to the poor. At the same time, elected officials are hearing complaints from elderly constituents who lack drug coverage and say they cannot afford the medicines that their doctors have prescribed and that they see advertised on television.
Marjorie Powell, assistant general counsel at the pharmaceutical manufacturers' group, said the industry had not taken a position on the Vermont legislation. "We'll be interested to see how the state implements it," she said.
The Vermont law would require drug companies to disclose any gift or payment of $25 or more to doctors, hospitals, nursing homes, pharmacists or health insurers for the purpose of marketing their products. The companies would not have to disclose the value of free drug samples or medical student scholarships.
State officials said they planned to make the information available to the public, possibly via the Internet, so that patients can see what gifts their doctors have accepted.
The measure had broad support from both Republicans and Democrats and from the Vermont Medical Society. Yesterday, the American Medical Association said it supported the bill's intent. "The ideal circumstance is that no inappropriate gifts are offered or received," said Dr. Richard F. Corlin, the association's president.
The only state with a similar law is Minnesota, which in the mid-90's prohibited companies from giving gifts valued above $50 to doctors or other health care providers. 
A Vermont Senate leader, Peter E. Shumlin, a Democrat who sponsored the bill, said drug companies appeared to have "a two-pronged marketing strategy."
"They get consumers to want the drugs and then make it pleasurable for the doctor to prescribe them," Mr. Shumlin said. "It is just getting more and more out of control."
The industry's guidelines would continue to allow drug companies to pay doctors for services like consulting or to give speeches about drugs before other physicians.
In a recent example, Shire Laboratories invited a group of psychiatrists to dinner at the Omni Berkshire Place Hotel in Manhattan on April 25. The doctors were paid $300 for their participation in an "advisory board meeting," according to the invitation, where they were asked to discuss how the company's drug Carbatrol could be used to treat bipolar disorder. Vermont's legislation would require disclosure of such cash payments. Carbatrol, an epilepsy medication, has not been approved by the F.D.A. to treat patients with bipolar disorder, but physicians are free to prescribe drugs as they see best.
A spokeswoman for Shire, Michele Roy, said the company had paid the doctors for their expert advice about the drug. "This was not a gift," she said. "The honorarium was compensation for the time they gave us."

CORRECTION-DATE: June 22, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on June 13 about a new law in Vermont requiring drug makers to disclose any gifts and cash payments made to health care providers -- and about a growing effort by state and federal lawmakers to rein in drug companies' marketing practices -- referred incorrectly to a law in Hawaii that created a discount drug program. It does not require drug companies to report the amount of their spending on marketing.

HEADLINE: SOCCER; 
O'Brien's Leap of Faith Pays Off for the U.S.

BYLINE:  By JERE LONGMAN 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, June 12 

 BODY:
International soccer does not involve itself in the same hand-wringing as American basketball about high school players jumping directly to the pros. Everywhere but the United States this kind of leapfrogging is the rule, not the exception.
 In Europe, professional teams sign players to apprentice contracts when they are as young as 12 or 14. Even in America, college is seen as a hindrance, not an enabler, in the development of soccer talent. "We can beat any other country in crossword puzzles," Coach Bruce Arena said. "But the rest of the world doesn't care how educated we are." 
 As a 17-year-old, John O'Brien took a rare, bold step. He left before his senior year at Brentwood High School in Los Angeles to join the youth team affiliated with Ajax, the Dutch power in Amsterdam. He moved in with a Dutch family, immersed himself in the language and the culture, got his diploma from an international high school and began working on his advanced soccer education.
"It was just going to be a year in Amsterdam, seeing what professional soccer was like," O'Brien said. "Eight years later, it's been a pretty extended trip."
During the recently completed season, he moved into Ajax's starting lineup as it won the Dutch league and the league cup. And, for the World Cup, O'Brien has moved into the American midfield, producing a goal and an assist in two games. A victory or a draw on Friday against Poland will ensure the United States a spot in the Round of 16 against Italy, Mexico or Croatia.
Some people wait their whole lives to score a goal in the World Cup. O'Brien needed four minutes. A rebound off a Brian McBride header fell at his feet against Portugal, and he blasted the rebound into the net for a 1-0 American lead. He is certain that his eyes grew wide in anticipation. Against South Korea, O'Brien played a superb looping pass to Clint Mathis from 40 yards for the lone American goal. Actually, he played the pass to Mathis's hairdo.
"I saw a bunch of heads, and the Mohawk was open," O'Brien said. "I was trying to hit the Mohawk."
At 24, he is perhaps becoming the player that many expected Claudio Reyna to become -- adept at scoring and passing, composed on the ball, comfortable both at coming forward on attack and holding in defense. In truth, he also has been brittle the way Reyna has been brittle. O'Brien sustained a foot injury during training here, and Arena feared at one point that he would be without both midfielders for the Portugal match. But O'Brien got the Americans going on their way to a 3-2 victory, then helped secure a 1-1 draw against South Korea with willful defense under tremendous pressure from the home team. He could never remember a crowd so deafeningly loud.
"He's not the first," Arena said of American teenagers trying to catch on in European leagues, "but he endured. He had the talent to do it."
Had it not been for expatriate soccer, O'Brien said, he would not be where he is today, playing left back for Ajax and central midfield for the United States. An Ivy League education was a possibility, but international soccer demands practical, on-the-job training. O'Brien has since studied economics for two years at university level.
"I never would have gotten there if I had taken the route through college," O'Brien said. "Those years are critical for development. You need to be playing against experienced players in a real competitive environment. It's just not the case in college. You don't have the same intensity. When you are with a pro club, even at the youth rank, it's competitive, serious. That's what it takes."
In the United States, development of soccer talent is left largely to youth leagues, where the coaching is often well meaning but underqualified. For America to become a true power, Major League Soccer will have to assume a larger role in player development, Arena said. Currently, there is little enticement for M.L.S. clubs to do this, he said, because player contracts are owned by the league, not by individual teams, in a so-called single-entity structure.
"There's no local incentive to find a player and develop a player," Arena said. "In their own system, they have to decide to incentivize teams to do that."
O'Brien was not without some small regrets as he left for Europe, knowing what he was leaving behind, uncertain where he was headed. At fleeting moments, he thought about coming home, feeling socially isolated and emotionally tired. But he stuck with it, and now he is playing in the World Cup, while Ajax supporters and all of the Netherlands are in mourning because the Dutch national team failed to qualify for soccer's global championship.
And, O'Brien predicted, if the Americans can advance to the second round and continue to play insistent defense while scoring goals, "we can make some more upsets happen." As the soccer world shrinks, confidence seems to grow, especially among the younger American players who have learned their trade in European leagues.
"Hey, we're going out to play," O'Brien said. "Who cares who these other teams are. At the end of the game, they might step off with a win, and be the better team, but until then, the ball's in our court."

LATIN AMERICA WORRIESAFFECT MONSANTO'S FORECAST

BYLINE:  AP 

 BODY:
 The Monsanto Company lowered its earnings expectations for the second quarter and all of 2002 because of economic uncertainties in Latin America and an unusually wet spring in parts of the United States. Monsanto, a biotechnology and agricultural company, said it expected earnings per share of $1.10 to $1.15 for the second quarter, which ends this month, compared with earlier expectations of $1.40 to $1.45 a share. For the year, Monsanto expects earnings per share of about $1.50; it earlier projected full-year earnings per share of $2.23 to $2.27. Wet weather has slowed planting of corn and soybeans in parts of the country, delaying applications of the Roundup herbicide made by Monsanto. Monsanto plans to make changes in its Latin American operations, its chief executive, Hendrik A. Verfaillie, said. The steps are intended to reduce the credit risk exposure in Brazil and Argentina.

HEADLINE: Insurance-Squeezed Doctors Fold Their Tents 

BYLINE:  By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, W.Va., June 6 

 BODY:
Dr. R. Todd De Pond misses the howling new infants but not the costly insurance protection required for presiding at their births.
 "I've decided not to do obstetrics at all," Dr. De Pond said of his retreat to the gynecology half of his practice in what West Virginia medical officials warn is a statewide crisis in skyrocketing malpractice insurance rates. 
 Scores of doctors are curtailing services by dropping high-risk obstetrical and neurosurgical procedures rather than pay premium increases of 30 percent and more, the State Medical Association says. At the same time, about 100 doctors, one in 20, have in the last two years retired early or moved from West Virginia, one of the costliest areas in the nation for malpractice coverage. 
The problem has already set off an emergency legislative session and another of the statehouse clashes between doctors and trial lawyers that have played out in other states, few of them as traditionally hard pressed to attract physicians as rural, impoverished West Virginia.
Trial lawyers insist that tort overhauls passed by other states to limit jury awards have only bolstered insurers' profits and not held down premiums or protected patients better from malpractice. 
"The real crisis that we face is the threat to our system of justice," said Bill R. Frame, president of the state Trial Lawyers Association. "They want to take away our fundamental right to seek and obtain compensation for a wrong."
But the doctors here insist that unless jury awards are reined in, the state's medical corps will be sharply reduced and health care will degrade. 
"Practically every day, doctors are leaving," said Dr. Ahmed D. Faheen, president of the medical association, describing a "code blue" emergency that he said threatened trauma center services and other basic parts of the state's health care.
At the Charleston Area Medical Center, the state's busiest, administrators had to work out an unusual plan to provide $2,000 a day in insurance premium subsidies to retain emergency room specialists and keep the trauma center open. In Wheeling, the departure of the last emergency room neurosurgeon means that trauma patients must be helicoptered to other areas, the medical association says.
"And now it looks like the bottom has fallen out," Dr. Faheen said, citing the decision last winter by the state's major commercial underwriter, the St. Paul Companies, to withdraw nationally from malpractice coverage.
West Virginia is one of the worst-hit parts of a national problem in which insurance rates have gone up with malpractice jury awards. They have grown from an award average of $1.95 million nationally in 1993 to $3.49 million in 1999. 
While the problem varies, New Jersey, Florida, Nevada and Pennsylvania are among other areas reporting significant numbers of doctors curtailing high-risk services or moving to places of lower premium prices rather than facing annual premiums of $100,000 or more for $1 million worth of coverage.
The St. Paul Companies, which attributed rising losses to jury awards, has been covering two-thirds of West Virginia's 2,100 private practitioners. The sole remaining carrier out of five that previously wrote coverage in the state, Medical Assurance Inc., put into effect an 18 percent rate rise last year, has a 23 percent increase request pending and is rebuffing new applicants, according to the medical association.
As a result, close to 300 doctors have already joined a new physicians' part of the state's Risk and Insurance Management program, an insurer of last resort. This is no long-range haven, doctors say, because by law they must pay at least 10 percent more than the highest commercial rates. Estimates are that unless workable alternatives are found, close to half the state's 2,100 doctors may have to join the state program within the next year. 
In their consternation, 40 percent of the state's doctors are considering early retirement or moving to another state, according to a recent medical association poll that trial lawyers dismiss as propaganda.
"It has gotten worse every year," said Dr. De Pond, who used to handle 15 maternity cases a month.
His $60,000 malpractice insurance bill last year would have jumped to more than $80,000 this year, Dr. De Pond said, while the same protection costs about $100,000 in the state program. 
Comparable coverage across the border in Virginia would be about $30,000, says the medical association, which contends this is because surrounding states restrain "meritless" malpractice suits that West Virginia more easily allows. Trial lawyers deny this, noting that lawsuits are now reviewed by medical specialists before they can proceed, a practice that doctors point out was only recently enacted by the Legislature because of the insurance crisis. 
As in other states, the medical association is considering a program of mutual insurance by the doctors, an approach now covering an estimated 60 percent of the nation's doctors. Lately, however, mutual plans have also been experiencing rate increases of 10 percent or more. 
The medical association maintains that self-insurance cannot work without state seed money of up to $20 million plus tort reform. Accordingly, the State Trial Lawyers Association is gearing up for a legislative struggle. 
"The jury system does not contribute to the high cost of medical insurance," Mr. Frame, the trial lawyers' president, said, adding that insurers kept premiums "artificially low" for a decade to dominate the market, but with the faltering stock market were now forced to increase rates.
"Some increase in malpractice premiums was necessary and required," he said, insisting that there had been no decline in health care.
But Evan H. Jenkins, executive director of the medical association, says the insurance problem "is now literally a life-and-death issue for patients in West Virginia in the ability to get access to care."
The insurance problem is compounding the state's perennial struggle to attract doctors to rural care, administrators warn. They say, for example, that Bluefield Regional Center, a major hospital in the state's hardscrabble south, lost 12 doctors in the last two years and has been able to replace only 2. Aggravating factors include the state's health care tax of 2 percent on doctors' gross incomes, a tax that is to be phased out over the next decade. 
"We're fearful we may lose a generation of physicians," said Dr. Tom Foster, a surgeon who closed his private practice last year to become a hospital administrator.
Dr. Foster is a Democratic candidate for the Legislature running, he said, on the wider issue of stemming the exodus of the state's young generation, a deepening economic problem that he says by necessity requires protecting health care.
"The thing that's most discouraging is seeing good young physicians leaving," Dr. Foster observed, citing a friend, "a superb urologist," who left his native state here this week to practice in North Carolina.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Albany: Job Benefits Bill Advances 

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton (NYT) (Compiled by Anthony Ramirez) 

 BODY:
 A New York State Assembly bill to give thousands of jobless New Yorkers an extra 13 weeks of unemployment insurance benefits advanced yesterday, said a spokesman for Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker. 
As many as 100,000 New Yorkers will have exhausted their temporary benefits by the end of next week, according to data from the Federal Department of Labor. Two Assembly committees approved the bill, and the full Assembly is likely to consider the bill on Monday. Senator Guy J. Velella of the Bronx has introduced similar legislation in the Senate. Both bills extend payments to those who have used up six months of regular unemployment benefits and three months of federal benefits. Leslie Eaton (NYT)

HEADLINE: W.T.O. Loophole Allows a Surge in Protectionism 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, June 12 

 BODY:
The "safeguard" exception was supposed to be a small, minor loophole in global trade rules, allowing a country to head off a sudden wave of imports without having to wait for the slow, cumbersome trade dispute resolution process to do its work. 
 Then the Bush administration invoked it in March to justify selective tariffs on imported steel, and the European Union in turn invoked it to justify countermeasures. The dispute highlighted what experts say is a developing stampede to stretch and exploit the loophole for protectionist ends, putting at risk decades of progress in liberalizing world trade. 
 In 1995, the first year that the safeguard agreement was in effect, the provision was used in two cases. Last year, there were 53, according to Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw, a Chicago-based law firm specializing in trade matters, and the trend is upward again this year. 
But this surge comes despite the fact that the World Trade Organization, the global arbiter of trade disputes, has yet to bless a single safeguard measure that has been challenged before it. Many experts say the Bush steel measures will not pass muster either.
"There's a view right across the globe now that there is a place for protective trade measures," said Cliff Stevenson, an economist with Mayer, Brown's London office. "And that's a change in attitude."
All 144 members of the trade organization pledged to keep their markets open when they joined the group. But nearly all of them also look for ways to run interference for domestic industries struggling to adjust to liberalized trade.
"The W.T.O. is not a free trade steamroller," explained David Woods, a former W.T.O. employee who runs the Geneva-based consulting firm, World Trade Agenda, defending safeguard provisions. "It gives you an escape door," he said.
More than one, in fact. Besides safeguard measures, there are also antidumping measures, which countries can impose to ward off foreign products sold in their markets below cost, and there are countervailing duties to protect against subsidized goods. Mayer, Brown found that two dozen countries initiated a total of 348 antidumping actions last year involving nearly 140 products.
But widespread use of safeguard measures is a newer and more worrisome phenomenon, free trade advocates say, because the vague wording of the agreement is being stretched to justify protective tariffs in almost any circumstances. 
The United States has been by far the most active of the 21 countries that have invoked the safeguard agreement so far; from 1995 to 2001 it did so 42 times. But Chile and India have also been frequent users, Mayer, Brown found. 
Nations like India, with limited resources and few trade experts, are turning to safeguards as an easier and cheaper alternative to other measures. Pursuing an antidumping case, for example, requires sending officials abroad to investigate the true cost of manufacturing the goods in question; data to support a safeguard action is mainly concerned with injury to domestic industry and can be gathered at home.
"You have to go through burdensome procedural hoops in antidumping cases compared to safeguards," said Scott D. Andersen, a lawyer in Sidley, Austin, Brown & Wood's Geneva trade law practice. 
Safeguard measures usually apply across the board to all exporters of a given product, though the Bush administration has exempted many countries from the steel tariffs, to the European Union's intense irritation. The rules permit nations to claim compensation for their injured industries rather than have to retaliate against imports, which many smaller countries lack the market power to do effectively.
"Their beauty is that you can give a lot more protection to your industry," Mr. Stevenson said of safeguard actions, adding that he expects them to keep proliferating. But he noted that so far, the trade organization panels that hear challenges to safeguard actions have found "all of them to be W.T.O.-inconsistent" -- meaning impermissible under global trade rules.
The safeguard agreement -- part of the package of accords that created the trade organization in 1995 -- set no specific criteria, leaving the precise circumstances under which safeguards could be applied open to interpretation.
Since then, dozens of the measures have been challenged, and 11 cases have been heard and decided, according to the trade group's statistics. Five of those were brought against the United States, challenging restrictions on imports of wheat gluten, lamb, cotton yarn, underwear and steel piping. All were thrown out. 
Other nations have had no better luck. South Korea failed to persuade a W.T.O. panel that its dairy products safeguards were justified; Argentina lost on shoes.
The accumulating case law is doing what the diplomats who drafted the agreement did not, setting specific limits on when safegaurds can be applied -- and narrowing them with nearly every new decision. In the Argentine footwear case, for example, a December 1999 ruling said an import surge "must have been recent enough, sudden enough, sharp enough and significant enough, both quantitatively and qualitatively, to cause or threaten to cause serious injury" before safegaurds were warranted. 
The Bush steel tariffs probably fail that test, trade lawyers said. Steel imports to the United States actually fell by about 30 million tons last year, undercutting the claim of an immediate threat to domestic steel producers.
"To win," Mr. Andersen said, "countries need a real emergency, not just complaints from industry that they're being hurt."

Re "Global Warming Follies" (editorial, June 8):
 The main reason President Bush rejects the Kyoto Protocol is based on faulty reasoning; he believes that it would hurt the American economy. 
In fact, the opposite is true. 
 What is bad for Exxon is not necessarily bad for the United States economy. Ratifying Kyoto would spur new technologies and create millions of new jobs. This is just what our economy needs.

HEADLINE: Infirmity of Its Senior Sheiks Leaves Kuwait Stagnating 

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: KUWAIT 

 BODY:
The failing health of Sheik Saad al-Abdullah al-Sabah, who has been Kuwait's prime minister and crown prince for 24 years, causes him to lose track of what is happening around him for long periods of the day, say Kuwaiti officials, members of Parliament and foreign diplomats who have seen him recently.
 When his lucidity drifts, the 72-year-old prince no longer recognizes his ministers. He drops the thread of conversations to such an extent that the royal interpreters are periodically instructed to tell visiting statesmen anything except the gibberish he speaks. 
 Sheik Saad needs help walking down stairs -- four men assisted him at the opening of Parliament last fall -- and he can become so disoriented that during the daylight fasts of Ramadan last fall he repeatedly demanded that guests be served tea and coffee.
Although the question of succession hangs over many aging leaders in the Arab world, it is perhaps most acute in this moneyed emirate, because the governing trio suffers from such serious ailments. 
The ruling emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, 73, suffered a stroke last year and spent the fall and part of the winter recuperating in England. 
With the emir and the crown prince incapacitated, the job of running the country fell to the Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the 73-year-old prince who has been foreign minister since 1962 and who wears a pacemaker.
Kuwait's significant oil wealth, with one-tenth of the world's reserves, and the presence of thousands of American troops ensure a minimum stability.
Kuwait's relationship with the United States and the agreement by Iraq at this year's Arab summit meeting in Beirut to respect Kuwait's sovereignty mean that the doddering state of Kuwait's leadership is unlikely to tempt President Saddam Hussein of Iraq into a repeat of his 1990 invasion.
But Kuwaitis feel that their country is stagnating, caught up in endless public squabbles over minor issues. Many Kuwaitis say a younger leadership conscious of the Internet and globalization would prevent such bickering and instead focus on competing economically with nearby emirates whose innovative rulers are transforming the region.
"What is delaying progress here is that the leadership is too old," said Muhammad A. al-Jassem, editor in chief of the newspaper Al Watan. "Everybody is ready for a new Kuwait with a younger generation. But you can't really say to the old guys that you are wrong and it's time for you to retire."
Unlike other royal dynasties in the Persian Gulf, Kuwait has no set pattern for succession. The family decides by consensus. There have been reports that the next generation of princes is trying to get the family to discuss the matter, but they appear to have been stymied.
Part of the problem is that Sheik Sabah, the effective ruler, discourages public discussion and has even banned Kuwait's newspapers from writing directly about the issue, now sometimes referred to in print as "the Big Decision."
"It seems that so far no steps have been taken to organize this issue," said Ahmad al-Deyain, a Kuwaiti columnist. To try to make his point, he devoted a column to describing Libya in 1969, when a benevolent, aging monarch with American and British bases on his soil was overthrown by the first temperamental colonel who happened along.
"The Al-Sabah family believes that this is a family affair," he added. "Of course we do not interfere in the affairs of the family, but we are talking about the situation in the country, the competence of the decision makers. Obviously there is a problem here."
The royal family tends to deny any such problem. Sheik Muhammad al-Sabah, 47, minister of state for foreign affairs, said the country still benefited from the older generation's wisdom.
"Mentally they are fit," he said. "Physically they are ailing. We need leaders, not acrobats."
With the dynasty loath to discuss succession, senior members of Kuwait's business community formed a committee several months ago to lobby the family -- not on who would lead, but on at least facing the question.
It galls Kuwaitis that 30 years ago they were sending financial aid to the United Arab Emirates for things like hospitals and schools. Now one of the emirates, Dubai, has eclipsed Kuwait in every aspect of modern commerce, running a very successful port, an international trade zone, an airline and airport and cargo services, to name a few.
Kuwait, in fairness, faced severe setbacks, ranging from the collapse of its financial sector in the early 1980's to Iraq's invasion. But Kuwaiti thinkers point out that the setbacks have not strengthened a resolve to move the country forward.
Since it was restored in 1992, the elected Parliament has been tied up largely with squabbles between the Islamic factions and their allies against more liberal opponents.
Political analysts say many tough issues that have been shot down or shunted aside in Parliament -- like the right of women to vote, or economic privatization -- could have been pushed through by a younger, stronger leadership.
The 2.2 million population, roughly half Kuwaiti, grows rapidly while the economy does not. The government employs 95 percent of the Kuwaitis in the work force, while foreigners do the service jobs.
"The entire Kuwaiti population has become government clerks," said Abdullah Nibari, one of the stalwart liberals in Parliament. "How long can we go on that way?"
The liberals thought they had the Islamic forces in Kuwait on the defensive after the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States. The fact that one of Osama bin Laden's main spokesmen, Suleiman Abu Gheith, turned out to be a Kuwaiti further tarnished them. Kuwait has denied that another bin Laden lieutenant recently singled out by American intelligence is a Kuwaiti.
But Washington's support for Israel swung the pendulum back. Kuwaitis have no great love for the Palestinian leadership, which backed Iraq during the invasion, but the issue of control of Jerusalem grates.
Some prayer leaders began denouncing Jews and Christians as the enemy during weekly Friday sermons. When the religious affairs minister ordered a halt, he was attacked as trying to override the Koranic verses that condone prayers against those who have wronged Muslims.
The two sides compromised in late May, with the prayer leaders now singling out specific American officials.
"They were against cursing all Jews and Christians," said Abdel Razak al-Shayegi, the spokesman for one Islamic organization and a leader of Friday Prayers. "But now I can say, 'God punish Bush, God punish Rumsfeld, God punish Rice.' That is better because they are the ones practicing injustice against us."
Liberal Kuwaitis are appalled by such outbursts. "Delivering a sermon with prayers to Allah to provide Muslims with a victory over the infidel is nonsensical," Mr. Nibari said. "We are not in a battle, we are not fighting a war and we are being protected by non-Muslims from Muslims."
But the liberals say the Islamic groups will continue to hold sway, as they do in much of the Arab world, because they are the most organized and can operate through mosques, while political parties are banned.
Kuwaitis concede that their country keeps rolling no matter how it is run because of the oil bubbling out of the main oil field.
"As long as Burgan oil field pumps enough oil to feed the mouths of 95 percent of the population of Kuwait, they are happy," said Jassim M. Boodai, the editor in chief of the newspaper Al Rai al Am. "It's been that way for the last 35 years."

ImClone Case Drags Martha Stewart Shares Down

BYLINE:  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
The arrest of Samuel D. Waksal, the former chief executive of ImClone Systems, on criminal charges of insider trading was not a good thing for Martha Stewart, or for shareholders of her company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia. 
 Dr. Waksal is accused of tipping off two family members about a decision by the Food and Drug Administration to turn down an application ImClone made for approval of its cancer drug, Erbitux. He was arrested at 6:30 a.m. yesterday, well before the markets opened. When they did, shares of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia plunged. The shares fell $2.10, or about 12 percent, to close at $15. 
 Ms. Stewart, who has publicly praised ImClone stock and whose daughter dated Dr. Waksal for years, sold thousands of shares of ImClone on Dec. 27, the day before ImClone announced that its application for approval of Erbitux had been rejected -- an announcement that prompted a sell-off in the company's stock.
She has told Congressional investigators that she had a standing order with her stockbroker to sell the 3,928 ImClone shares she owned as of October if the price fell below $60 a share and that she did not speak to Dr. Waksal or have any insider information before selling them. On Dec. 27, after a call from her broker, she said, she sold the shares at $58 each, for about $227,824. After that trade, she said in a statement yesterday, she called Dr. Waksal but did not reach him, and he did not call her back. 
"Martha Stewart is not the focus of our investigation," a Congressional spokesman, Ken Johnson, said in an interview. "But certainly the curious timing of her sale has raised some eyebrows, and we're digging a little deeper."
Investors clearly worried that the taint of an investigation could harm the value of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, a $295 million company whose success depends heavily on Ms. Stewart and the name she has made for herself as tutor to the masses when it comes to labor-intensive housekeeping, crafts and cooking. She stars in television broadcasts and closely controls many elements of the company, which emphasizes quality and "good things," like making a blueberry pie with a lattice crust or rediscovering petunias. 
One analyst said the revelation of her stock trade complicated the company at a time when it appeared to have emerged from the recession and was starting to see advertising rise for its magazines and its television programs.
"None of this has looked good for Martha Stewart as a person, in an environment where people are very sensitive to any appearance of impropriety by corporate leaders," said Laura Richardson, an analyst for Adams, Harkness & Hill in Boston, who follows the stock. "It's unfortunate, because it has taken attention away from the fundamentals, which are improving for media companies and for Martha Stewart."
Ms. Stewart, who has not been charged with any crime, issued a detailed summary of her activity with regard to ImClone stock late yesterday. She said she bought 5,000 shares "several years ago in the public market" and sold about 20 percent of them at $70 each as part of a Bristol-Myers Squibb tender offer last October. The remaining 3,928 shares, she said, were to be sold if the share price dropped below $60. She said she made the arrangement with her broker, whom she did not identify.
Her statement is consistent with information she gave to the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which will hold hearings today; Ms. Stewart is not on the list of witnesses scheduled to appear before the committee. What remains unclear is exactly when, and why, Ms. Stewart instructed her broker to sell the stock if it sank below $60 a share. In October, ImClone's share price climbed from $58.48 a share at the start of the month to $61.19 by the end of the month. In November, the stock also rose, sinking below $60 once, on Nov. 9, when it closed at $59.75 a share. By Nov. 30, the stock had hit $72, its high for the year, and remained in the $70-a-share range for most of December. A spokeswoman for Ms. Stewart could not be reached for comment last night.
Ms. Stewart appeared at an investor conference sponsored by U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray in Manhattan yesterday afternoon, where she was pursued down a corridor by a camera crew from CNBC but refused to speak to reporters. Inside the meeting, where cameras were not allowed, she delivered a polished presentation about Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia that included a list of all the longtime employees, other than herself, who make up the creative and administrative talent at the company. "The model is very much to teach so our audience can do," she said.
About $36 million of her company's revenue comes from licensing the Martha Stewart name, and most of that business is from Kmart, the discounter that declared bankruptcy in January. Kmart management has said Martha Stewart is essential to its turnaround, and she was one of the first creditors to be paid under Kmart's reorganization. A Kmart spokesman refused to comment on the investigation. 
One analyst said Ms. Stewart would emerge financially unscathed from the investigation, forced at worst to return any profit she made from selling ImClone.
But there may be additional fallout, said Alan Bromberg, professor of corporate and securities law at Southern Methodist University, because of other scandals. "A lot of people are pretty disgusted at rip-offs by insiders or people in high places," he said, "and some of that is likely to rub off on her even if she isn't guilty in any technical sense. It will hurt her some, but she's not going to go out of business."

Former Chief of ImClone Systems Is Charged With Insider Trading

BYLINE:  By ANDREW POLLACK with DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
Samuel D. Waksal, the former chief executive of the biotechnology company ImClone Systems, was arrested at his Manhattan home early yesterday morning and charged with insider stock trading. 
 A federal criminal complaint accuses Dr. Waksal of tipping off family members to sell their ImClone shares in late December before the public announcement of an unfavorable regulatory ruling on the company's experimental cancer drug -- an announcement that sent the stock price plummeting when it was made. 
 Dr. Waksal, as much a fixture in New York social circles as in the biotechnology industry, was arrested by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents at 6:30 a.m. at his spacious art-filled loft in the SoHo section of Manhattan. In addition to the criminal charges filed by the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil complaint against him. 
"The crux of our case is that when bad news came to ImClone, Sam Waksal scrambled to protect himself and his relatives," said Barry W. Rashkover, the S.E.C. associate director in New York. 
Dr. Waksal was released on $10 million bond, of which half will have to be posted in cash by tomorrow. In a statement, his lawyers called the evidence against him "entirely circumstantial," adding, "The government misread the evidence, and it overreacted in deciding to make today's arrest." 
The lawyers, Mark Pomerantz and Lewis Liman, said Dr. Waksal was "an accomplished scientist and researcher who has spent most of his career in the successful search for drugs that have the potential to cure cancer." 
The criminal complaint was the second filed in Manhattan this month against a prominent business executive. Last week, L. Dennis Kozlowski was indicted on charges of state sales tax evasion one day after he resigned as chief executive of Tyco International. Prosecutors and regulators have been bearing down on signs of corporate and executive misconduct in the wake of Enron's collapse and the bursting of the stock market bubble. 
Yesterday's complaints by the Justice Department and the S.E.C. say that when Dr. Waksal learned on Dec. 26 that the Food and Drug Administration was about to refuse to accept the company's application for approval of its cancer drug, Erbitux, he tipped off two family members in a series of late-night and early-morning phone calls. The relatives, identified by others as one of Dr. Waksal's daughters and his father, sold more than $10 million in ImClone stock during the next two days, before the news was announced after the stock market closed on Friday, Dec. 28. 
The complaints also say that Dr. Waksal tried to sell $4.9 million worth of shares but his brokers would not do it because of regulations restricting the sale of stock by corporate insiders. The criminal complaint also charges Dr. Waksal with perjury, saying he lied under oath to the S.E.C. when questioned in April about the transactions. If convicted, Dr. Waksal, 54, could face years in prison and millions of dollars in fines from the nine criminal counts against him.
The S.E.C., meanwhile, wants him to pay unspecified fines and give back several million dollars in stock losses avoided by the people he tipped off. It would also bar him from serving as an officer or director of any public company. 
The charges open a new chapter in the colorful career of Dr. Waksal, an immunologist by training who until a few months ago was as likely to show up in the society gossip columns as in the business pages. Described by those who know him as extremely charming and well read, he has cultivated friendships with entertainers, politicians and other prominent people, like the style arbiter Martha Stewart. 
Ms. Stewart has acknowledged selling all her ImClone shares the day before the announcement of the unfavorable regulatory ruling on the cancer drug, but has denied having any insider information, saying she had sold because the shares had dropped below her target price. Shares of ImClone closed at $55.25 on Dec. 28, before the company made its announcement. The next trading day, Monday, Dec. 31, as the public responded to the news, the shares fell to $46.46. ImClone's stock, which has been trading below $8 recently, rose 28 cents yesterday, to $7.83. Shares of Ms. Stewart's company, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, fell.
News of Dr. Waksal's arrest reverberated through the biotechnology industry's annual convention , being held in Toronto. Biotechnology stocks are down sharply this year, in no small measure because the ImClone imbroglio has left investors wary of trusting company claims. 
"Sam's become the poster child for everything that's wrong with the industry," G. Steven Burrill of Burrill & Company, a biotechnology investment firm, said in Toronto. 
Although an early-morning arrest is unusual in such cases, it had become clear recently that Dr. Waksal would face some sort of federal charges. He resigned from the company three weeks ago to try to distance ImClone from his problems. The company, the largest biotechnology concern based in New York City, is now run by his younger brother, Harlan W. Waksal, a medical doctor who had been its chief operating officer. 
Harlan Waksal is now coming under scrutiny in Washington by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has been conducting its own investigation of ImClone. 
Ken Johnson, a committee spokesman, said Congressional investigators had determined that another ImClone official, Lily W. Lee, met with the F.D.A. on Dec. 4 and sent an internal memorandum indicating the agency might reject the company's application. Two days later Harlan Waksal sold $50 million of shares.
A person close to the situation, however, said the memorandum was dated the day of the F.D.A. meeting but might not have been written until later. It did not give an indication that a rejection was likely, only that, under the law, it was one possibility, according to this person, who said Harlan Waksal had told ImClone's board weeks before that he would sell the shares to help pay taxes on earlier stock profits. 
The House committee has scheduled a hearing on ImClone today and Samuel Waksal, who has been subpoenaed, will appear. In a response to a request by the Justice Department, a magistrate in New York temporarily lifted a condition of Samuel Waksal's bail that he stay in the New York area. 
Samuel Waksal, who started ImClone in 1984, finally seemed on the verge of huge success late last year. The company's first drug, Erbitux, had seemed to show impressive results in treating colorectal cancer and Bristol-Myers Squibb agreed to pay $2 billion for rights to Erbitux in the largest deal for a biotechnology product. 
Then, on Dec. 28, the F.D.A. formally notified ImClone that it would not even review its application to have the drug approved, saying the company's data was deficient. Bristol-Myers Squibb said that the arrest would not lead to changes in its agreement with ImClone and that the two companies would continue to work to have the drug approved. 
Federal officials say that the ImClone securities investigation is continuing and that it is possible additional people will be charged. Already, some of Samuel Waksal's relatives have received notices from the S.E.C., warning them they might be charged, according to lawyers close to the situation. 
The complaints issued yesterday do not identify the family members who sold stock. But based on the accusations and on other information that previously came to light in the Congressional inquiry, one is Samuel Waksal's father, Jack Waksal, and the other is one of his daughters, Aliza Waksal. 
Stephen E. Kaufman, Ms. Waksal's lawyer, said he had no comment. Charles Stillman, the lawyer representing Dr. Waksal's father, a Holocaust survivor who ran a scrap metal business in Dayton, Ohio, before he retired, would not confirm that his client was the one mentioned in the complaints. But Mr. Stillman said the evidence was circumstantial, based on records that phone calls were made, not that people actually spoke. 
According to the complaints, on Dec. 25, Harlan Waksal learned from a Bristol-Myers executive who had talked to the F.D.A. that rejection was "99 percent likely." Samuel Waksal learned this early the next evening, Dec. 26, the complaints said.
The criminal complaint says that Samuel Waksal tried several times that night to call "Tippee No. 1," the person identified by others as his father. The next morning, Dec. 27, Tippee No. 1 called several brokerage firms and sold a total of 110,000 shares for $6.7 million. He also sold about $83,000 of stock for another individual, whom Congressional investigators have identified as Dr. Waksal's sister, Patti Waksal. The following morning, Dec. 28, Tippee No. 1 sold another 25,000 shares worth $1.4 million. 
The criminal complaint also says that on the morning of Dec. 27, Samuel Waksal called Tippee No. 2, who was on vacation in Idaho. Tippee No. 2 called Merrill Lynch and sold all the holding, about 39,472 shares, worth nearly $2.5 million. A sale of this size on this date by Aliza Waksal had previously been disclosed.
The complaint also says that on the evening of Dec. 26, shortly after learning of the F.D.A.'s pending decision, Samuel Waksal instructed his accountant to transfer all of his ImClone shares in his Merrill account -- 79,797 shares then worth $4.9 million -- to Tippee No. 2. 
Samuel Waksal, according to the complaint, wanted Merrill to hurry because ImClone was going to stop its executives from trading the shares because the F.D.A. news was pending. "I understand that ImClone will have a 'blackout' beginning Friday, therefore, you should make sure that this is completed EARLY tomorrow morning," said a letter sent by the accountant to Merrill. 
The next day, Dec. 27, Samuel Waksal instructed Merrill to sell all the shares that had been transferred, but the firm refused. Merrill Lynch explained that it needed permission from ImClone's general counsel because the shares had been owned by Samuel Waksal and were still subject to trading restrictions. Samuel Waksal then transferred the shares to Banc of America Securities, but it, too, refused to sell without permission from ImClone.
The complaint also says that Dr. Waksal appears to have had offshore accounts and that as of Dec. 26 he had more than $80 million in debt, of which more than $65 million was secured by his ImClone stock.

HEADLINE: State's Delegation to Request More Federal Aid for 2 Utilities 

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
Several members of the New York delegation in Congress say they are planning to ask the Bush administration for an extra $150 million for Verizon Communications and Consolidated Edison to pay the cost of repairs related to the World Trade Center attack.
 Verizon and Con Edison officials have been careful not to ask explicitly for the extra money, which would raise the total amount of federal aid they are expected to receive to $900 million. But company officials told Congressional delegation members of their request in recent weeks. 
 In March, the Office of Management and Budget promised $750 million in Housing and Urban Development block grants to "to reimburse costs for repairing damaged facilities." Members of the delegation said at the time that that money was earmarked for public utilities. 
At the same time, delegation members are concerned that some in the Bush administration might renege on giving the $750 million just to the utilities and may attempt to split the money among Verizon, Con Edison and two universities that have asked for assistance.
Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a Democrat who represents parts of Manhattan and Queens, recently cited a study suggesting that New York's total costs from the attack Sept. 11 would be about $62 billion more than the $21 billion that President Bush has promised New York.
"The president is not going to want New Yorkers to have their electric bills go up because of the terrorist attacks, and I'm sure the administration will amend its budget request to help," Ms. Maloney said. "That we are going to need additional help above the current levels shouldn't surprise anyone, given all the economic studies to date."
James A. Harris, a spokesman for Representative Edolphus Towns, a Democrat from Brooklyn, said, "It appears that these costs will exceed the $750 million level" and that the delegation would work "to secure additional funding necessary to avoid passing these costs along."
Verizon and Con Ed said earlier this year that $750 million in costs not covered by insurance would have to be passed on to ratepayers.
In March President Bush announced a package that included money for them. 
Utility officials said some of the additional costs involve unexpected damage to phone lines and damage near 7 World Trade Center, which housed a Con Ed substation. Verizon's costs not covered by insurance are now estimated at $528 million and Con Ed's are estimated at $408 million.
John J. Bonomo, a Verizon spokesman, said this week that the company's estimated costs had remained steady, but that "we are still in the process of working out insurance" and "there are still many variables that have to be dealt with."
John H. Banks, vice president for government relations at Con Ed, said, "The $750 million that is included in the supplemental appropriation is an excellent start on a process to ensure that the ratepayers don't bear the burden of the terrorist attack."

HEADLINE: A Youthful Land in All Its Glory 

BYLINE:  By ROBERTA SMITH 

 BODY:
IT'S hard to think of an art exhibition more appropriate to the magisterial hybridism of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts than "American Sublime: Epic Landscapes of Our Nation, 1820-1880," which opens tomorrow in Philadelphia. Its 100 paintings and oil studies, some of which were exhibited at the academy when they were first made, are so profoundly contextualized that you may feel as if you're time-traveling.
 Both the paintings and Frank Furness's ornate 1876 building are products of the same fraught historical trajectory: the coming of age of the American nation politically, economically and culturally. 
 The exhibition traces this trajectory in artistic terms. It begins with Thomas Cole's fretful, moralizing five-painting epic, "The Course of the Empire," which he began in the late 1820's, just as the Erie Canal was opening the wilderness to the west to artists and tourists alike. It ends with Thomas Moran's slightly bland panorama of the Grand Canyon, painted in 1892, as Congress's creation of national parks to protect the remaining wilderness gained speed. 
In between are the becalmed seascapes of John Frederick Kensett and Fitz Hugh Lane, which edit the natural world to the point of geometric simplicity, and Frederic Edwin Church's spine-tingling "Niagara," one of the "show pictures" that drew paying crowds at circus sideshows and that enumerate natural detail with nearly the precision of the camera lens.
Furness's muscular, profusely decorated building caps this show's oil-on-canvas timeline like an exclamation point. Emblematic of the extravagant confidence of the post-Civil War boom, its innovative eclecticism -- neo-Classical, Moorish, Egyptian, neo-Gothic -- parallels the way the painters here turned European ideas and styles to their own purposes. Art and architecture even share specific influences, like John Ruskin's exaltation of natural phenomenon, both grand and small.
The show, which originated at the Tate Britain last fall, may be the first large survey of this subject organized by non-American curators: Andrew Wilton, a J. M. W. Turner scholar and a recently retired keeper and senior research fellow at the Tate, and Tim Barringer, an English specialist in Pre-Raphaelite painting who teaches art history at Yale. By coincidence their effort is complemented by "Fire and Ice," a selection of photographs from Church's vast collection, at the Dahesh Museum of Art in New York City, which serves as a long, illuminating footnote to the larger show.
The 10 artists in "American Sublime" are not unknown quantities, at least to American audiences. All except Asher B. Durand and Jasper Cropsey have had large retrospectives in American museums since 1985. All have made multiple appearances in surveys that have categorized them as Hudson River School painters, American Luminists or painters of the American West. Some of them have been viewed as apologists for Manifest Destiny, and most have been claimed as precursors of the Abstract Sublime of the Abstract Expressionists.
The curators sidestep such theories and labels, settling on the sublime as an idea prevalent in the aesthetic thinking of the period and well known to the artists themselves. Their goal is to change the way 19th-century American landscape painting is viewed, both by Americans who prize it as a national achievement and by Europeans who know it hardly at all but consider it parochial when they do.
"American Sublime" sets out to define this achievement as the continuation and endpoint of the European tradition of painting the sublime and also as the transformation of it. This concept of a dwarfing experience of incomparable extremes that makes the vastness and power of nature (if not its divinity) overwhelmingly apparent was articulated by Burke and Kant, taken up by Ruskin and given visual expression by the paintings of Caspar David Friedrich, John Martin, John Constable and, of course, Turner, Ruskin's favorite artist.
The primary instrument of the transformation of the European sublime was the pressing reality of the American one, the country's frightening uncharted wilderness and mysterious awe-inspiring natural wonders, which were unlike anything in Europe and were encountered, it sometimes seemed, at every turn.
The show presents the works with such clarity and neutrality that no viewpoint is excluded. The installation is spare and grouped in a manner that manages to be chronological, thematic and stylistic all at once. Some may find it overly formalist, but its coherence makes the works unusually available as both art objects and historical documents. It helps that the ample skylights of the academy, which was built before electric lighting, bathe the paintings in the light in which they were originally painted.
The paintings' vistas move from the East Coast to the Rocky Mountains, from epic narrative to epic empiricism, with one form of transcendence giving way to another. One room is devoted to the preternaturally serene paintings of Head, Lane, Kensett and Gifford, nearly every one greeting the eye with a smooth, glistening horizontal plane of water. Another is dominated by gorgeously colored sunset landscapes, some depicting peaceful homesteads and the promise of nature's benignancy, while others are less optimistic.
Gifford's "Hunter Mountain, Twilight" centers on a ravaged patch of half-cleared land, spiked with jagged tree trunks. Church's "Twilight in the Wilderness" (1860) depicts a wild river from a carapace that bars human entry, overseen by an almost wrathful blood-red sky. The scene reflects the artist's anxieties about the inevitability of the Civil War and perhaps his realization that the prospective new states carved so brutally from the wilderness were intensifying the debate about slavery.
Church's attention to his surroundings is expanded upon in the show at the Dahesh, which presents 55 landscape photographs of the many he collected, among them several by John Moran, Thomas Moran's brother. They reflect his world travels and frequently mingle Romanticism with plain fact, as in Eadweard Muybridge's record of an abandoned watchtower in Panama.
The show also includes the Yosemite images by Carleton Watkins, which inspired artists and photographers alike to head west when they were first shown in 1860; William Bradford's majestic photographs of Artic icebergs; and images of the Alhambra and Indian architecture that supplied Church with ideas for his designs for Olana, his Moorish-style mansion overlooking the Hudson. A selection of Church's watercolors and oil studies interspersed among the photographs sets up some extremely telling comparisons. The exhibition, organized by Thomas Weston Fels, curator of the Elizabeth de C. Wilson Museum in Manchester, Vt., and Kevin J. Avery, an associate curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, reminds us that the sublime was not the exclusive purview of painting. Photography did it equal justice and sometimes more.
The paintings at Philadelphia have been chosen with attention to the excellent and the representative but also the less familiar. To my eye, more engaging than Moran's bland canyon is his strange proto-Symbolist Hiawatha series, painted in the thrall of Cole. Meanwhile, the morality of Cole's "Course of the Empire" is more immediate in his "Expulsion From the Garden of Eden," split by a flash of heavenly light into a paradisiacal landscape and dark shattered terrain of coiling trees on a rocky precipice, a Charles Burchfield before the fact. And the bombast of Albert Bierstadt's "Mount Rosalie" can't hold a candle to his "Moat Mountain, Intervale, New Hampshire," its crystalline recession of trees on a broad, cloud-dappled plain halted by a compact mountain of bare stone.
This exhibition may be a once-in-a-lifetime experience, at least for those concerned with American art and history, the tradition of Western painting or the challenges of the curator's craft. As proof of the salutary effects of natural light and generous rectilinear rooms on works of art, it should also be required viewing for anyone interested in the blighted field of museum architecture. The academy, one of the very first American art museums, and the multilevel sublimity it brings out in the paintings in this show inspire a parting thought: that museums should always be designed as if electricity did not yet exist.

"American Sublime: Epic Landscapes of Our Nation, 1820-1880" opens tomorrow at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Broad Street at Cherry Street, Philadelphia, (215) 972-7600, and runs through Aug. 25. It travels to the Minneapolis Institute of Arts (Sept. 22 to Nov. 17). "Fire and Ice: Treasures From the Photographic Collection of Frederic Church at Olana" is at the Dahesh Museum, 601 Fifth Avenue, at 48th Street, Manhattan, (212) 759-0606, through Aug. 24.

HEADLINE: FEMA's Pace On 9/11 Aid Is Criticized 

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 13 

 BODY:
Six weeks after the Federal Emergency Management Agency promised to re-evaluate more than 7,000 applications for disaster aid that it conceded might have been improperly rejected in the months after Sept. 11, the agency said today that it had granted 85 additional awards. 
 The officials, who said the 85 approvals resulted from a second review of nearly 600 of the rejected applications, also acknowledged that they had not yet even begun to examine the remaining 6,600 of the cases in question. And they said they were continuing to apply the standards for granting the aid that had in part prompted the call for another review in the first place. 
 The agency's latest performance has infuriated members of New York's Congressional delegation, some of whom accuse FEMA of stalling the review process and simply repeating its mistakes at a time when the aid is most vital. 
"I don't see that much has changed since the original review, and FEMA said that it would," said Senator Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat. "These numbers are deeply troubling."
Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a Democrat from Manhattan, echoed that sentiment. "FEMA had promised to act quickly," she said. "It has acted on only 85 cases out of 7,200 in the six weeks after their promise. This is not anyone's definition of acting quickly. FEMA is slow-walking these people to eviction."
But Larry Zensinger, FEMA's director of response and recovery, defended the agency's effort, saying the re-evaluation was time-consuming. "We're doing intensive staff work with each of these," he said. "We're working as fast as we can."
The renewed concern involves a program intended to help people whose economic losses from a disaster put them in danger of losing homes or apartment leases. In April, FEMA officials said that because of bureaucratic missteps and a new interpretation of qualification standards, only $13 million had been distributed to World Trade Center victims, a fraction of the amounts paid in other disasters.
The agency acknowledged at the time that it was requiring people to prove that their hardship was a "direct result" of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, a standard that broke with the agency's longstanding policy and that was not in line with laws governing disaster aid. In previous disasters, including hurricanes and wildfires, FEMA has merely asked applicants to show that their losses were "a result" of the catastrophe.
Days after the problems with the program became public in April, Joseph M. Allbaugh, the FEMA director, said in a letter to New York's senators and representatives that the agency would look anew at the rejected applications, which then numbered above 7,000.
The question of the aid was particularly important because victims were facing evictions and foreclosures and the big private Sept. 11 charities had decided to stop making direct cash awards to victims. 
The initial problems with FEMA's handling of the applications prompted Mr. Schumer to push legislation that would require FEMA to expand the number of people eligible for housing assistance. The measure has already been approved by the Democrat-led Senate as part of a larger spending bill. Its fate in the Republican-controlled House is unclear.
Mr. Schumer is also trying to expand eligibility to include residents in the 10 counties outside New York City that the federal government declared disaster areas after the attacks. But Mr. Schumer's aides acknowledge that that expansion will be difficult to push through Congress.
Several FEMA officials in New York said they themselves were frustrated with the agency's handling of the review. One senior official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said he believed that the re-evaluation had come to a stop.
"It was my impression that the whole review of the 7,000 cases had halted, pending a decision in re-evaluating the eligibility guidelines," the official said. "There was a period when the number of people deemed eligible just froze."
Time is critical, because the application deadline is in September. Many people thrown out of work as a result of the disaster are also facing the prospect of exhausting their unemployment benefits, making FEMA's help all the more important.
But FEMA seems prepared to adhere to the eligibility standard that prompted the initial protests.
Mr. Zensinger, the FEMA official, said the agency would continue to limit benefits to people who could prove that their income loss was a direct result of the attack, or, as he elaborated, "related to the physical damage caused by the disaster."
But New York lawmakers say -- and some FEMA officials agree -- that such a standard goes beyond the laws that have traditionally governed disaster relief efforts. And other advocacy groups that are working with Sept. 11 victims seeking FEMA aid say it has been inconsistent in applying that tougher standard. 
"It's been almost two months," said Representative Jerrold Nadler, a Manhattan Democrat whose district includes ground zero. "How long are they going to take? These people who are victims of the attack shouldn't have to wait so long for what they are entitled to."
Representative Maurice D. Hinchey, an upstate Democrat who is a member of the House Appropriations Committee, questioned whether FEMA was genuinely trying to get people the assistance they need.
"This has gone on far, far too long," he said. "People are being evicted from their homes."
Mr. Zensinger said 578 applications had been reconsidered out of the original 7,200 that were rejected. In addition to the 85 that were approved, 217 were rejected and the status of 276 have yet to be determined, he said.
Mr. Zensinger could not say when the agency would finish its review. But he expressed confidence that FEMA would approve more applications even though it had not changed its eligibility standard. He also noted that caseworkers were taking a far more active role in helping applicants meet the requirements. 
"This is an infrequently used program," he said in explaining the previous rejections. "And as our caseworkers have been working these cases, they have gotten better at it."

HEADLINE: Whatever Happened to the Recovery Rally? 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
THERE is a recession pattern to the stock market. Prices fall going into a downturn, but turn up before the recession ends and then leap once it is over.
 From 1938 on, an investor who bought the stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 six months before a recession ended, and then held on until six months after the end, always did well. In fact, the return over those years averaged 27 percent, and that figure does not include dividends. Determining when a recession would end was not easy, of course, but an investor who managed to do that was sure to prosper. 
 Until now.
This time, what is usually the sweet part of the cycle for investors has turned sour. If, as appears likely, this recession is eventually determined to have ended in December, it will have been the first one with a market decline in the final six months of the downturn.
There was a rally late last year, but it died young. This recovery will be six months old in two weeks, but you wouldn't know it from the S.& P. 500, which is off 12.1 percent this year. 
The interesting question is what that means. To some bulls, it shows that the market is a little slow to pick up on the improving economy. With an accounting firm on trial and two chief executives of formerly highflying companies being arrested, this has not been a month to renew confidence in the financial markets. Once the uproar settles down, they say, investors will be reassured by the rising profits and will start bidding up stock prices.
A less encouraging reading comes from Greg Jensen of Bridgewater Associates, a money management firm. The way he sees it, "the market is pricing in a rapid recovery in earnings," but even that recovery is not enough to offset the fact that many of yesteryear's market leaders, particularly in technology, are still overvalued. "The fact that the turn in earnings and the economy has come and gone without an equity rally is an indication of how bad the post-bubble hangover is," he said.
Hangovers mostly affect those who were drunk. Smaller companies, of the nontechnology variety, were generally ignored in the boom. So were many solid larger companies, the ones that investors rely on for dividends rather than for the hope of big capital gains. The Dow Jones transportation average, dominated by economic-sensitive stocks in the rail and trucking industries, is up 2.5 percent this year. And, reports Howard Silverblatt of the S.& P., the 351 dividend-paying companies in the S.& P. 500 are, on average, up a little this year. It is the others that have dragged down the average, with an average decline of 17.6 percent since Dec. 31. 
That drop is not an indictment of the recovery, which is weak but not about to end. Instead, it reflects the valuation excesses of the bubble era, which have been reduced but not eliminated. Usually, stock valuations are low by the time a recession nears an end, but that did not happen this time. That fact made it harder for the market to recover when the economy did.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Down 0.9% in May 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 13 

 BODY:
Sales at retailers fell 0.9 percent in May, the biggest drop in six months, the Commerce Department said today, as consumers trimmed spending on cars and clothes. Lower gasoline prices also were a big factor in the decline. 
 Retail sales in May were weaker than many analysts expected and followed a strong 1.2 percent advance in April. 
 Another report today, from the Labor Department, showed that the Producer Price Index fell 0.4 percent in May, the biggest decline in five months, largely reflecting lower costs for energy.
The department also reported that new claims for unemployment insurance rose last week by a smaller-than-expected 6,000 claims, to 390,000 claims. Even with the increase, new claims hovered below the 400,000 mark, a level associated with weakness in the jobs market.
In the retail report, the 0.9 percent drop was the biggest decrease since November. 
Sales at automobile dealerships fell 2.5 percent in May, as some incentives to lure buyers were discontinued. Sales revenue at gasoline stations dropped 3.1 percent.
Excluding sales of automobiles and gasoline, retailers had a 0.1 percent sales decline last month.
The decline in the Producer Price Index, which measures inflation pressures before they reach store shelves, was a surprise to many analysts, who had been forecasting a 0.1 percent rise in the index.
Prices paid to factories, farmers and other producers fell for two months in a row, suggesting that inflation continues to be under control. In April, wholesale prices dipped 0.2 percent.
For the 12 months ended in May, wholesale prices fell 2.7 percent.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Ad spending on cable and syndicated shows is below the peak but still topping expectations.

BYLINE:  By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
AFTER the broadcast television networks performed surprisingly well in lining up advertisers for the coming 2002-03 season, media executives at the cable networks and syndicators worried that there might not be much marketing money left for them. 
 But, according to executives involved in the preseason negotiations, advertisers are spending more than expected on both cable networks like MTV and Comedy Central as well as on syndicated programming, which includes shows like "Entertainment Tonight" and reruns of "Friends." 
 These sectors of the television industry are expected to bring in at least $6.5 billion during what is known as the upfront market, a 14 percent lift from last year's miserable performance. That matches the showing by the broadcast networks, like CBS, NBC and WB, which improved their haul more than 14 percent, from $7 billion to about $8 billion. 
The syndicators appear to be doing better than their cable counterparts. With the negotiations mostly completed, analysts estimate syndication sales will total $2 billion, up 17.6 percent from $1.7 billion in 2001-02. 
Though sales will remain lower than those of two years ago, when a record $2.5 billion worth of ads were committed, "it's going in the right direction," said Gene DeWitt, president of the Syndicated Network Television Association in New York.
"Up 18 percent in this economy? We'll take it," he added. "It could have been $1.4 billion." The association's members, which include AOL Time Warner, the Tribune Company and Viacom, account for about two-thirds of syndicated billings.
Syndication appeared to benefit from the strong demand for commercial time in broadcast. "Some broadcast dollars flowed down to premium syndication as a replacement for those buyers who couldn't get all their money down in broadcast," said Andy Donchin, director for national broadcast at the Carat USA media agency in New York, part of the Carat division of the Aegis Group.
By premium, he meant programs with high or expected high ratings like first-run episodes of "The Oprah Winfrey Show" and reruns of series like "Everybody Loves Raymond," "Friends," "Seinfeld" and "Will and Grace."
The cable picture is more clouded as negotiations in that market are still going on. Most analysts are estimating that cable upfront sales will increase 12.5 percent to 15 percent, or to $4.5 billion or $4.6 billion from $4 billion. But the demand is not being spread evenly. 
Analysts and media buyers said that so far there was more interest from advertisers in commercial time on specialized or niche cable networks with focused or themed programming like Comedy Central, the Food Network, HGTV and MTV. The networks with more broad or general programming, like TBS and TNT, are not faring as well. The few broad-based cable networks that are doing well, like Lifetime and USA, are getting their boost largely because they have cut the prices they charge for each 1,000 viewers. 
"I don't think anybody believes cable will be back to where it was two years ago," when a record $4.8 billion was booked in the upfront market, said Jon Mandel, co-chief executive for United States operations at MediaCom in New York, owned by the Grey Global Group.
"The strong broadcast upfront didn't hurt cable," he added. Uncertainty remains, however, because much of the additional spending there came not from marketers increasing their ad budgets but from purchasing commerical time in advance rather than waiting until the season begins and buying in what is known as the scatter market.
Another challenge for cable is that the supply of commercial time is less scarce than at the broadcast networks.
"There's an abundance of inventory on cable," said Bob Flood, director for national broadcast at Optimedia International U.S. in New York, part of the Zenith Optimedia Group.
As a result, he added, "there's a level of uncertainty how robust the dollar volume will be in cable, especially as to whether dollars from broadcast will trickle down." Zenith Optimedia is owned by the Cordiant Communications Group and the Publicis Groupe. 
Joe Mandese, editor of Media Buyer's Daily in New York, a newsletter published by Primedia, said: "Cable is showing more like normal growth, back where it should be, than closer to two years ago, which was an aberration. 
"At this point, where only a third to a half of all cable upfront time is sold, it's hard to say what the total volume will be," he added. "But the strong broadcast upfront indicates that there is underlying demand in the marketplace."
At the Cabletelevision Advertising Bureau, optimism abounds.
"It's always a question of jockeying for position," said Joseph W. Ostrow, president and chief executive at the bureau in New York, "but all things considered, I think we are going to do very well, a far cry from last year."
"There are some really healthy categories driving spending," he added, "like automotive, pharmaceuticals, entertainment, toys and electronics, all of which are starting to build some strength in the retail market."

HEADLINE: Plutocracy And Politics 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Kevin Phillips's new book, "Wealth and Democracy," is a 422-page doorstop, but much of the book's message is contained in one stunning table. That table, in the middle of a chapter titled "Millennial Plutographics," reports the compensation of America's 10 most highly paid C.E.O.'s in 1981, 1988 and 2000.
 In 1981 those captains of industry were paid an average of $3.5 million, which seemed like a lot at the time. By 1988 the average had soared to $19.3 million, which seemed outrageous. But by 2000 the average annual pay of the top 10 was $154 million. It's true that wages of ordinary workers roughly doubled over the same period, though the bulk of that gain was eaten up by inflation. But earnings of top executives rose 4,300 percent. 
 What are we to make of this astonishing development? Stealing (and modifying) a line from Slate's Mickey Kaus, I'd say that an influential body of opinion has reacted to global warming and the emergence of an American plutocracy the same way: "It's not true, it's not true, it's not true, nothing can be done about it."
For many years there was a concerted effort by think tanks, politicians and intellectuals to deny that inequality was increasing in this country. Glenn Hubbard, now chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, is a highly competent economist; but he demonstrated his fealty during the first Bush administration with a ludicrously rigged study purporting to show that income distribution doesn't matter because there is huge "income mobility" -- that is, that this decade's poor are likely to be next decade's rich and vice versa.
They aren't, of course. Even across generations there is a lot less income mobility than the folk wisdom about "shirt sleeves to shirt sleeves in three generations" would have it. Mr. Phillips shows that tales of downward mobility in once-wealthy families are greatly exaggerated; the descendants of 19th-century robber barons are still quite different from you and me.
But the Gilded Age looked positively egalitarian compared with the concentration of wealth now emerging in America. Pretty soon denial will no longer be possible. What will the apologists say next? 
First we will hear that vast fortunes are justified because they are the reward for vast achievement. Here's where that table comes in handy, because it tells you what achievements actually get rewarded. Only one of the 10, Tyco's Dennis Kozlowski, has actually been indicted. But of the rest, three -- four, if you count John Chambers of Cisco -- were Andy Warhol C.E.O.'s: their companies were famous for 15 minutes, just long enough for the executives to cash in their stock options. The list also includes Gerald Levin, who engineered Time Warner's merger with AOL at the top of the Internet bubble; even at the time it seemed obvious that he was trading half his original shareholders' birthright for a mess of cyber-pottage. 
We'll also hear that in any case nothing can be done to limit the accumulation and inheritance of vast wealth. We'll be told, for example, that reinstating the estate tax would have devastating economic effects -- even though the great boom of the 1990's took place with a 55 percent tax on the largest inheritances. I've even been assured by some correspondents that inheritance taxes on the very rich are impractical, that they will always be evaded -- this in spite of the fact that in 1999 the estate tax raised about $15 billion from estates worth more than $5 million.
But it's not just a matter of collecting taxes. Mr. Phillips, a lifelong Republican, is most concerned not by economics per se but by the political consequences of wealth concentration. He warns that "the imbalance of wealth and democracy is unsustainable, at least by traditional yardsticks."
How will this imbalance be resolved? The economists Claudia Goldin and Robert Margo have dubbed the narrowing of income gaps that took place under F.D.R. the "Great Compression"; if I read Mr. Phillips right, he thinks something like that will happen again. But he also offers a bleak alternative: "Either democracy must be renewed, with politics brought back to life, or wealth is likely to cement a new and less democratic regime -- plutocracy by some other name."
Apocalyptic stuff. But Mr. Phillips has an impressive track record as a political visionary. What if he's right?

HEADLINE: A Development Fuels A Debate on Urbanism 

BYLINE:  By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: CHULA VISTA, Calif. 

 BODY:
Otay Ranch would seem to have everything the back-to-the-future movement in American town-planning could ask for: front porches, back alleys, a network of paths, all built around a park with a barn-style community center and little hub called Heritage Towne Center. It's a village, the developers say, not another sea of stucco rising at the urban edge of San Diego. 
 But look again, say the proponents of new-style suburbs, and you see things they have long criticized. Otay Ranch is protected by guarded entrance gates, which limit the kind of random encounters so cherished in older communities. A six-lane road as wide as a freeway leads into the development, making it a challenge to cross the street on foot. Cul de sacs, little different than those in the far exurbs of Los Angeles, fill the development. 
 As the largest single subdivision in California history, Otay Ranch is at the center of a fight among people who plan and build new communities in the fastest-growing states. 
To hear some developers talk, a person would think they would not be caught dead building a traditional suburb, or what is known in shorthand sneer as a csd, for conventional suburban development. They build places where people live in "sustainable communities" around "towne squares," where the three-car garage has been banished.
But just as these developers have seemingly embraced this design style known as New Urbanism, many planners and architects say that the movement has been co-opted and that many of the neo-villages appearing in Southern California, as well as in the exurbs of New Jersey and on the shoreline of the Florida Panhandle, are impostors.
"More and more, we're seeing places where people just take the label of New Urbanism and slap it on a development as a way to get around political or environmental concerns," said Steven Bodzin, spokesman for the Congress for the New Urbanism, a loose-knit group of planners and architects. "It's designed to fool consumers and to fool the political process."
Otay Ranch is a kind of Levittown West, though for a slightly higher income bracket. The houses are affordable, by California standards, ranging from $250,000 to $500,000; the racial mix is diverse, by suburban standards; half the land has been set aside for nature; and homes are selling faster than any other big development in San Diego County. Developers of the 6,000-acre ranch have gone out of their way to distance themselves from the suburbia of old.
"The most visible difference is our village concept, which encourages people to once again meet neighbors, walk to nearby parks, and sit on front porches," the developers proclaim in brochures and on their Web site.
The small, nontraditional parks in the development "are the kind of places where kids go after school to count clouds or play Frisbee until their mom calls them in for dinner," said Kim Kelkenny, executive vice president of Otay Ranch.
One afternoon here in the center of the village, very little front-porch sitting or cloud-counting was evident. But children actually walked home from school, and enough people were out strolling or bike-riding to give the sense that the S.U.V.'s were on a leash.
Still, Otay Ranch is a gated community, one that has many elements heretical to the New Urbanism. 
"The gates resemble New Jersey toll booths and the cul de sacs are wide enough to park a trailer," said Rob Steuteville, editor of New Urban News, who toured the development earlier this year and was highly critical. "It is so over-engineered for traffic that it's just off the charts."
Another critic, a transportation planner from Palo Alto, Calif., Patrick Siegman, said Otay Ranch was an example of an old-style suburb with a few changes that were largely cosmetic. Mr. Siegman called for a process in which developments would have to be certified "to keep the marketers from appropriating New Urbanist language."
Of course, hyperbole is not new to the business of selling real estate. The joke about new developments being named after whatever it is they displace -- Elk View Heights -- is often true. But only recently have marketers started to use the language of New Urbanism, language that was traditionally used against their developments.
It used to be fairly easy to define a New Urbanist development because there just were not that many of them. Nearly 20 years ago, when the town of Seaside was planted as a village-style development on the Florida Panhandle, it was thought to be an anomaly. 
But then the Disney Corporation built a town of its own in Celebration, Fla., and others soon followed.
Now developments that claim to be New Urbanist are finding themselves the object of criticism. For example, Laguna West, a development near Sacramento, was initially hailed as a pioneering example of how to build a community that was not overly dependent on the automobile. But it has since gone through changes that have led critics to label it as classic urban sprawl, though with porches and alleys.
"Laguna West is one of the most pitiful examples of a so-called New Urbanist community that in reality is little different than a 1970's-era development in Los Angeles," said Wendell Cox, a design consultant who has written critically of recent subdivisions.
Mr. Cox pointed to houses with three- and four-car garages, "liberal use of cul de sacs" and the fact that the development pushed the edge of the city into the countryside.
The designer of Laguna West, Peter Calthorpe of Berkeley, Calif., who has been a leading opponent of old-style suburbs, said the project was changed after it was sold in the California recession of the mid-1990's.
"There are compromises," Mr. Calthorpe said, "but all in all I think it's a great success. The reality of America is that some people want three cars."
For some people, though, the compromises go too far.
"I give these developments like Otay Ranch credit for trying something different," Mr. Siegman said. "The problem is when a project takes one or two elements, and leaves out all the others."
Here at Otay Ranch, the main designer, Kent Aden, said he tried to build with narrow streets, fewer cul de sacs and more intentional congestion, but met resistance from buyers and code enforcers. The master plan calls for several villages, each about one square mile, with a school and several small parks, surrounded by arterial highways. Two villages have been built.
"We want congestion inside the villages," Mr. Aden said. "We're trying to break the mold. People aren't necessarily ready for it, and the engineers don't get it yet."
He called the architecture "California heritage," yet lamented that some intersections were too big and busy to walk across and that people seemed to ignore one of his favorite pocket parks.
"But if you compare us to California subdivisions of the 1980's," Mr. Aden said, "we're leaps and bounds ahead of what they did."

HEADLINE: The Big City; 
Moving South, To the Domain Of the Princes

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
WHEN you have spent eight years celebrating the incomparable vitality of New York in a column called The Big City, it is awkward to announce that the column is ending because you are moving out of town. It is especially awkward when the place you are moving to is Washington. 
 In this column, Washington has generally played the role of the Great Satan. It is both the antithesis and the nemesis of New York. My favorite explanation of the New York-Washington relationship, not to mention the history of urban civilization, is the economist Brad DeLong's theory of merchants versus princes. 
 Cities have always been created by merchants, the peaceful deal-makers who flourish under the protection of a relatively hands-off prince. The city becomes cosmopolitan as the merchants import money and talent: entrepreneurs and artisans to create industries; artists and entertainers to serve the new class of patrons.
But the city's growing wealth and glamour eventually attract the age's most ambitious princes. Once these conquerors add the city to their empire, their taxes and decrees drive away the merchants and artists.
Dr. DeLong's theory explains, for instance, why the Renaissance occurred in Florence, an independent city-state run by merchants like Lorenzo de Medici, whose income came chiefly from his family's bank, not taxes. Then, after warrior princes from Spain and France conquered the Italian city-states, merchants created new commercial and cultural hubs in the independent cities of the Low Countries.
Dr. DeLong, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, compared nine regions of Western Europe over the past 1,000 years, and he found that urban populations shrank during periods when cities were consolidated into larger empires. "City growth," he concluded, "has a strong allergy to the presence of strong, centralizing princes."
Dr. DeLong's study did not include New York, but it is easy for a non-economist to spot a similar trend here in the last century. The city's population grew rapidly for the first three decades, doubling to nearly 7 million by 1930. But as Fiorello LaGuardia and Robert Moses consolidated their power and allied themselves with the rising New Deal princes in Washington, the growth slowed, and the population stagnated at 7.8 million from 1950 through 1970. It fell by 800,000 during the 1970's, when Washington's princes were working especially hard to rescue urban America.
Congress's "urban agenda" was scrapped by its Republican princes during the 1980's and 1990's, and Washington's benign neglect coincided with a rebound in New York's population. The merchants gained power, and today one of them is prince. If Michael R. Bloomberg is anything like Lorenzo the Magnificent, the city will prosper.
SO why am I leaving the merchants? Why join the courtiers in Washington? Because the princes make great copy, even if you do not like what they're doing. After ranting at them for so long, it's time to cover the enemy.
It's also time to give the merchants and artists a rest. For eight years I have been haranguing them to stop sending their money to Washington, to stop electing centralizing princes to Capitol Hill and the White House, but New Yorkers have kept voting for national politicians who support higher taxes. My sermons about our tax deficit -- the money New Yorkers lose each year to farmers in the heartland and bureaucrats in Washington -- had exactly zero impact.
This state of affairs used to infuriate me, particularly when I visited Washington in the summer. I would take the Washington Metro, marveling at the quiet ride and the immaculate, air-conditioned stations. Then I would return to Pennsylvania Station and marvel at the sweltering masses on our subway platform.
Actually, I did more than marvel. In my mind, I was screaming at them. What are you people thinking? Can't you see what the princes are doing with your paychecks? They're air-conditioning their subway! I might have looked a bit crazed to my neighbors, but I did at least manage to keep the thoughts to myself. One of the advantages of a column is that you have other opportunities to vent.
This summer I will be calmer, and certainly cooler, when I take the Metro to The Times's bureau in Washington. There may be an occasional moment of treason -- Go ahead, New York, keep sending your money -- but I can't imagine siding with the princes. My heart will stay with the merchants and artists. I'll miss you.

HEADLINE: GOLF; 
Corporate Tents Grow in Popularity at the People's Open

BYLINE:  By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
As the first publicly owned golf course to play host to the United States Open, Bethpage State Park takes pride in running what some people are calling the "people's open." The reality, of course, is more complicated.
 Golf is the ultimate corporate sport, with its affluent, well-educated fan base, and the United States Golf Association certainly does not mind cashing in at its premier event. 
 A prime example: 78 large corporate tents divided into three minicommunities along Bethpage's Black Course. Corporate giants like Goldman Sachs, AT&T and Citigroup rent the canvas tents for substantial fees and provide food and beverages to ticketed clients, staff and friends.
At the 1995 United States Open, 26 snazzy corporate tents sprawled out over the grounds of Shinnecock Hills Golf Club in Southampton, N.Y.
The number of tents at Bethpage is not only triple that of seven years ago, but it is 24 more than last year, when the Open was played at Southern Hills Country Club in Tulsa, Okla. 
"The space that Bethpage affords us is incredible," said Mimi Griffin, president of MSG Promotions, which oversees the tournament's marketing and corporate hospitality.
The tent cities come complete with names and diverse designs. The tents in Empire Village are arrayed along a straight line along an elevated, carpeted boardwalk. Tillinghast and Liberty Villages are arranged elliptically, with oval boardwalks within. But there is no design feature like the topiary golfers that stood outside the three villages at Shinnecock in 1995. "They looked like Cro-Magnon man," Griffin said.
The blossoming tent business at the tournament brings in substantial revenues to the U.S.G.A., which is charging a top price of $175,000 for the ritziest 40-by-40 foot tent in the Empire Village along the 18th fairway; the least expensive tents cost $85,000 for a 30-by-30 foot tent in the Liberty Village, which, like Tillinghast, is along the first hole. Last year, the four-day rental cost corporations from $75,000 to $150,000. 
Companies pay extra for food, beverages and interior design, which the U.S.G.A. supplies.
While the American economy is not booming, as it was in 1995, there has been no shortage of demand from companies willing to pay as much as it costs to rent a luxury suite in a stadium or an arena in some markets around the country.
Companies like Citigroup and Goldman Sachs are ensconced in Empire; NBC, ESPN and FleetBoston Financial are in Tillinghast; and AT&T, Bear Stearns and Canon U.S.A. will try to rough it in Liberty.
Griffin said the U.S.G.A. has been selling the tents at Bethpage (which have red, white and blue facades) for four years. "We presold them when the economy was still strong," she said. "Had we begun selling them a year ago, we wouldn't have been successful." The sales push is already on for the Open's return to Shinnecock in 2004.
Bethpage had sold out all the tents by March 2001, but about 15 companies later pulled out because of the economy. As recently as March, a company left the fold. 
"But because we're in New York, we were able to replace them," said Griffin, who added that none of the dropouts were caused by the business impact from the Sept. 11 attacks.

HEADLINE: Pataki Says McCall Should Prove Accusation or Apologize 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, June 13 

 BODY:
Gov. George E. Pataki today accused H. Carl McCall of stepping beyond the pale of fair political comment when he said that the governor's aides had threatened businesses with the loss of state contracts if they gave to Mr. McCall's campaign. 
 Mr. Pataki, a Republican seeking a third term, said Mr. McCall, the state comptroller and a Democrat running for governor, should either produce proof of the allegations he made on Wednesday or apologize. 
 "I thought those comments were outrageous, and I really think they crossed the line of fair political comment," the governor said at a news conference here. "If that has happened, and I don't believe it has happened, he should come forward and name names, and if he can't come forward and name names and do it now, he should apologize."
The McCall campaign has declined to name names. But Mr. McCall's campaign manager, Allen P. Cappelli, said today that it was the governor who should apologize -- to voters -- for appointing his top fund-raiser, Charles A. Gargano, to oversee the state's economic development agency. Mr. Cappelli also poked fun at Mr. Pataki's outrage.
"To hear the governor's protestations today reminds me of that famous scene from 'Casablanca,' when the police chief, played by Claude Rains, declares that he's 'shocked to learn that gambling has been going on here,' even as he stuffs his pockets with roulette winnings," Mr. Cappelli said.
Mr. McCall made the allegation when a reporter asked him if it had become hard for him to raise money because of the governor's large lead in polls. The comptroller said the polls were irrelevant. Then he said some people had told him that Pataki officials made it clear that they would not get state business if they gave to the McCall campaign.
The comptroller was campaigning on Long Island and in Westchester today. The other Democratic candidate, Andrew M. Cuomo, a former federal housing secretary, took advantage of the dispute to challenge Mr. Pataki and Mr. McCall to agree not to accept donations from people to whom they have awarded contracts. As comptroller, Mr. McCall hires firms to handle the state pension fund's assets, including firms that have given him campaign donations.
Mr. Cuomo told reporters today that, to his knowledge, none of his donors had been intimidated. He also said he believed that Mr. McCall's accusation was accurate. 
"Yesterday, Carl McCall accused Governor Pataki of intimidating donors at the same time Governor Pataki accused Carl McCall of selling access to the pension fund," Mr. Cuomo said in a statement today. "The truth is, they are both right."

HEADLINE: Big Companies Are Looking To Spread Out From Midtown 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
A movement among major companies to scatter workers across several locations instead of concentrating them in one place, a trend that began last fall after the attack on the World Trade Center, has spread to some Midtown businesses. 
 The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, which is building an office tower on Madison Avenue near Grand Central Terminal, has decided to reduce its presence there and move some employees to a still-unspecified location downtown, according to several executives of other companies and city officials familiar with the plan. The bank is also looking at Jersey City. 
 Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, the giant law firm that moved its offices to Times Square a few years ago, is seeking to rent satellite office space downtown or in Westchester, according to real estate brokers. C.D.C. Capital, a financial services company now at 9 West 57th Street, is also looking downtown and elsewhere. 
"In the post-9/11 world, we're seeing more tenants looking to diversify their operations for security reasons," said Mitchell Konsker, executive vice president of Cushman & Wakefield, a real estate company. "At the same time, they're looking at how they can reduce their operating costs."
The spread of the trend to Midtown may prove to be a boon to Lower Manhattan, where dispersion has been the order of the day for eight months. The resulting exodus of thousands of high-paying jobs and even entire companies has sent a shudder through the winding streets of Lower Manhattan, where landlords and city and state officials fear the disintegration of the city's historic financial district.
Morgan Stanley, for instance, has moved hundreds of downtown employees to Jersey City and Times Square, while selling its nearly completed Midtown skyscraper near Rockefeller Center to Lehman Brothers, which abandoned Lower Manhattan altogether. Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield is moving a majority of its downtown employees to a building under construction in Brooklyn, while Marsh & McClennan is building a new tower in Hoboken, N.J. Aon, another insurance company, is heading for Midtown.
Major Midtown companies are now considering multiple locations in order to avoid having their entire operations knocked out by a single catastrophic event. Of course, nearly every company's search list also includes downtown Brooklyn, Long Island City, Westchester and Jersey City, as well as Lower Manhattan.
Midtown law firms like Clifford Chance Rogers & Wells and Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel are considering moving their entire offices from Midtown to downtown -- lured, brokers say, by lower rents and by government grants and tax breaks. Bank of New York, however, plans to move some employees from downtown to Brooklyn, or Jersey City. American International Group, the insurance giant, is also considering moving employees to New Jersey. KPMG, one of the world's largest accounting firms, is close to a deal to move downtown from Midtown.
"These centralization-decentralization patterns run in cycles," said Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York. "New York will benefit from this because it has two or three central business districts, which can meet virtually any need of a large corporation."
Only two years ago, urban corporate campuses were all the rage. Companies saw a benefit to housing all their employees in the same neighborhood. 
Several years ago, the Canadian International Bank of Commerce, which had offices downtown at the World Financial Center, decided to build a 35-story tower at Madison Avenue and 42nd Street. Executives who have been briefed on the bank's plans say it now wants to cut its presence in the new building to 600,000 square feet and look for at least 300,000 square feet downtown or in Jersey City. The move could save it as much as $12 million a year in rent, one downtown executive said.
Mr. Konsker, the broker for the bank, declined to comment on its plans.
Bear Stearns, which has offices at the Metrotech complex in Brooklyn, is even considering moving about 2,000 employees from Brooklyn to Lower Manhattan or Jersey City. But that poses a policy problem for the city, which has long used tax breaks and incentives to encourage companies to move data processing and other departments to Brooklyn or Queens, rather than New Jersey.
After threatening a move to Whippany, N.J., in 1991, Bear Stearns got more than $30 million in incentives from the city to move 1,500 employees to the Metrotech complex. Six years later, the Giuliani administration more than doubled the subsidy, to $75 million, when the bank announced that it would build a 45-story headquarters on Madison Avenue, between 46th and 47th Streets.
Several executives say Bear Stearns recently asked the city for even more subsidies to hop back across the East River to Lower Manhattan, a move that some officials say would hurt Brooklyn's economy. The bank, which did not return calls seeking comment, has also looked at alternatives in Jersey City.
But the executives say it is unclear whether Bear Stearns has met its obligations to maintain a certain number of employees in New York to qualify for the tax breaks. Some brokers said the company might be playing another round of corporate poker, in which it threatens to relocate in order to obtain tax breaks, cash incentives from New York and a better deal from its landlord.

HEADLINE: G.M. Beat Ford in Efficiency, A Study of Auto Plants Finds 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, June 13 

 BODY:
Last year, for the first time since a closely watched study began tracking productivity, General Motors was more efficient than the Ford Motor Company in building cars.
 But both companies, along with DaimlerChrysler, parent of the Chrysler Group, continue to trail Asian competitors in productivity and profitability. The gap remains wide, even though the three major Asian automakers -- Toyota, Honda Motor and Nissan -- slipped a bit last year. 
 According to the study, the Harbour Report, which tracks productivity in North American auto plants, it took G.M. 39.3 hours last year, on average, to form a car body from sheet metal, build the engine and transmission and assemble the vehicle. That number has fallen from 47.1 hours in 1997 and was ahead of the 40.9 hours at Ford. It was the first time since the study began in 1989 that G.M. topped Ford. Such variances are a crucial measure of the drive among automakers for higher efficiency, which leads to greater profitability. 
The report continued G.M.'s streak of encouraging news, coming on the heels of a strong showing last month in an initial-quality survey by J. D. Power & Associates. 
"This shouldn't have happened," said Ron Harbour, president of Harbour & Associates, a consulting and research firm in Troy, Mich., that compiles the annual report from data collected from automakers. Ford's productivity has moved in the opposite direction of G.M.'s, from 36.8 hours a vehicle in 1997 to 40.9 last year, according to the report.
"G.M. passed them by," Mr. Harbour said, adding that he thought Ford grew complacent in the late 1990's.
Since ousting its chief executive, Jacques A. Nasser, last October, Ford's new chief, William Clay Ford Jr., has put in place a turnaround plan and conceded a need to refocus on getting manufacturing systems and quality in order.
"We've said repeatedly that we did lose our focus in some of the basic disciplines," a Ford spokeswoman, Della DiPietro, said.
G.M. was in a more celebratory mood. The company's plant in Oshawa, Ontario, which makes the Chevrolet Impala and Monte Carlo, ranked as the most efficient plant in the report, beating Asian automakers' plants in North America. It was the first time G.M. had won the category. The Oshawa plant turns out a car with 16.8 hours of labor, on average.
"As we continue to improve our quality, more waste pops out of the system," said Gary L. Cowger, the president of G.M.'s North American operations. "We're proud of the gains we've made particularly in the last two years. But we also know we can't rest on our laurels. As we speak, the competition is improving."
The study also pointed out how far the Big Three automakers still have to go to match the productivity levels of Asian competitors. Honda averaged 31.2 hours a vehicle last year while Toyota averaged 31.6 hours. Nissan, which ranks sixth in sales in the United States, led the productivity study for the eight consecutive year, with 29 hours a vehicle. 
"Despite this improved efficiency, G.M. only made $300 per vehicle and the average Japanese automaker made over $1,000 per vehicle last year," said Rod Lache, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. He added that G.M.'s progress on manufacturing efficiency was encouraging but that it would still take years to change perceptions about G.M.'s quality.
"As this business becomes more and more competitive, and it will, you see more intense pricing competition," Mr. Lache said. "The guys making less money than the Japanese today will be making less money in the future." 
Last year, DaimlerChrysler and Ford both lost more than $1,600 a vehicle, while G.M. made $337 a vehicle, according to the Harbour Report. Honda led with profits of $1,661 per vehicle.

HEADLINE: Outlook for Japan Improves, But Households Are Stressed 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: TOKYO, June 13 

 BODY:
The Bank of Japan slightly upgraded its outlook for the country's economy for a fourth consecutive month today, citing a rebound in exports. But it also warned that the average household was still being pinched.
 The central bank's report for June came after a similar assessment for May. The reports were relatively good news for Japan, the second-largest economy in the world. It has been struggling to emerge from a decade-long slump. 
 "Over all, Japan's economy is projected to stop declining as a whole since an increase in exports and production will lead to an improvement in corporate profits and, in turn, domestic private demand," the Bank of Japan said.
Still, it cautioned that domestic private demand remained weak, and warned that "employment and income conditions of households over all remain severe."
Last week, Japan had its strongest growth in two years, with gross domestic product rising 1.4 percent in the first quarter from the previous quarter. The increase supports the government's view that the downturn is ending.
But the government also said it expected that G.D.P. would be flat for the fiscal year that began in April, compared with a year earlier.
And in a sign that any healing in the economy has so far failed to trickle down to the labor market, Japan's unemployment rate remained unchanged in April, at 5.2 percent, its eighth consecutive month above 5 percent.
The Bank of Japan acknowledged today that recovery was still hampered by high unemployment and the bad loans that are burdening commercial banks.
And while the central bank expects the economy to stop deteriorating, it did not say when the economy might improve.
Many economists say that manufacturing is already showing signs of recovery but that the services sector could lag for months.
"The Bank of Japan is unlikely to declare full recovery until then," said Ryo Hino, an analyst with J. P. Morgan in Tokyo. "But 'when' is the magic question."
A sudden spurt in exports has helped the Japanese economy, and the central bank predicted that domestic industrial production would increase to meet growing demand in the United States and Asia. Still, it said, the "pace of recovery is likely to become somewhat slower in the future than at present."
Critics say that too much reliance on exports will not support stable, long-term growth, in part because manufacturers are increasingly relocating factories to cheaper production sites elsewhere.
Dependence on exports also exposes Japan to the ravages of the global economy.
The Bank of Japan hinted at concern over that today, saying that the outlook for recovery in the United States, in particular, was accompanied "by various uncertain factors," including swinging exchange rates. In recent months, the United States dollar has tumbled against the yen and euro.

HEADLINE: Brazil Tries to Fight 'Wave of Anxiety' on Economy 

BYLINE:  By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, June 13 

 BODY:
The Brazilian government tried today to calm roiling financial markets and bolster its sinking currency by announcing a package of measures meant to restore confidence.
 To reinforce its financial reserves, the government will tap a $10 billion line of credit with the International Monetary Fund, the finance minister, Pedro Malan, said this afternoon at a news conference in Brasilia. At the same time, he said, the government will increase its budget surplus and buy back some of its foreign debt. 
 These steps, he said, are intended to "counter the wave of anxiety" that has assailed Brazil's economy, the largest in Latin America, in recent days, and to show investors that Brazil is "stronger than the turbulence of the present moment." 
That turbulence has been more severe than expected. The value of the Brazilian currency, the real, has fallen 17 percent against the American dollar this year, with most of the loss in the last two weeks. The main stock market index has fallen more than 15 percent since January, and bond yields have shot up nearly 20 percent just this month. The main credit rating agencies have revised downward their outlook on Brazil. 
Much of the market nervousness can be attributed to growing worries about the presidential election to be held in October, a race now led by Luiz Inacio da Silva of the left-wing Workers' Party. Recent polls show Mr. da Silva with the support of more than 40 percent of voters, a lead of more than 2 to 1 over Jose Serra, the handpicked candidate of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso. 
Analysts here and on Wall Street fear that if Mr. da Silva is elected, he will renegotiate or even default on Brazil's foreign debt, a stance that his party has endorsed for most of its 20-year history. The analysts also worry that he may abandon other free-market policies, like the privatization of state companies, and fail to fight inflation aggressively.
The jitters of recent days have developed despite statistics showing the economy performing well. Inflation fell to just 0.1 percent last month, for instance. And on Wednesday, Congress secured $1.75 billion in new government revenue by extending a financial transactions tax.
"This is purely political," Edmar Bacha, a leading economist here and a former president of Brazil's national development bank, said of the sagging markets. "If you look at the most recent economic indicators, they are all very good. The economy is growing, and the trade balance is favorable, so the fundamentals are all strong."
Today, investors' initial reaction to the government's announcement was mixed. The real bounced back and regained some lost ground in moderate trading, but the main Sao Paulo stock market index closed down 1.4 percent. 
The $10 billion credit line that Brazil intends to draw on is not a new loan; it was part of a $15 billion package negotiated with the International Monetary Fund last August. Government officials said earlier that they hoped not to have to use the credit line, but the market's sudden skittishness left them little choice.
In addition, the fund has agreed to lower, to $15 billion from $20 billion, the minimum level of foreign reserves that Brazil must keep on hand. If the pressure on the currency continues or intensifies, that change will give Brazil "an important additional space to intervene in the foreign exchange market when we deem it appropriate," Arminio Fraga, the president of the Central Bank, said today.
Both the nature of Brazil's economic problems and the way the fund is responding to them stand in sharp contrast to the situation in neighboring Argentina. Officials there have quarreled with the fund and have been unable to obtain new credit since Argentina's currency and economic collapse six months ago. But Brazil has consistently followed the fund's guidelines, meaning that the fund's own credibility would be damaged if the situation here worsened.
On Wednesday, a senior fund official in Washington, Gerd Hausler, acknowledged that "there are some political uncertainties" in Brazil and that only Brazilians can resolve them. But, he said, "markets agree that the present economic policy of Brazil is largely appropriate."
Arguing that he is not to blame for the current turbulence, Mr. da Silva has accused the government of "fomenting speculation to create panic in Brazilian society." He has criticized market analysts for engaging in "economic terrorism," and he has rejected suggestions that he help assuage investors' doubts by clarifying his positions and policies.
"The only words that console the speculator are those which permit him to continue speculating," he said.
Earlier this month, Mr. da Silva sent one of his closest economic advisers, Aloizio Mercadante, to the United States to meet with market analysts and others. But that move failed to have the desired calming effect, perhaps because until recently Mr. Mercadante advocated a "rupture" with the fund and called on the Brazilian government to withdraw from free trade negotiations with the United States.
Addressing a business group this week, Mr. da Silva argued that the slump was the fault not of his policies but of Brazilian interest rates. Those rates are among the highest in the world, with a benchmark short-term rate of nearly 20 percent; the comparable rate in the United States is 1.75 percent. The high rates, meant to combat inflation, are clearly inhibiting growth. "Either we reduce interest rates or the country atrophies," Mr. da Silva said.
Rates are a concern to borrowers and creditors alike because Brazil's net public debt has now risen to almost 55 percent of its gross domestic product. Mr. Fraga has been criticized in recent days for his decision to exchange long-term debt for much shorter maturities, a step that was intended to appease markets but has added to Brazil's debt burden.
"The root problem is that people are beginning to understand that the high real interest rates and debt have been prolonged for too long," said Christian Stracke, an analyst with Creditsights, a Wall Street research firm. "At some point, something has to give," he said, no matter who wins the election.
Only about 20 percent of Brazil's total public debt of nearly $300 billion is owed to foreigners, but four-fifths of the domestic debt is tied either to foreign exchange rates, mainly the dollar, or to interest rates, making it unusually vulnerable to market swings.
In a conference call last week, Mr. Fraga assured investors that Brazil's debt load would be manageable however the election came out. Today, though, he sought to reduce that burden by announcing that Brazil would buy back at least $3 billion of the $9 billion or so in debts coming due in 2003 and 2004.
"This is a point on the curve that deserves our attention," he said, acknowledging that interest rates have been very high recently. "It lowers our profile and relieves a bit of what is due in the next government, which is always a good thing."

HEADLINE: Senate Debating a U.S. Role In Terror Insurance Coverage 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
The Senate began debate yesterday on insurance legislation that would require the government to pay the vast majority of losses in a terrorist attack, with Democrats and Republicans sharply divided over restrictions on terrorism-related lawsuits.
 In the early evening, Senator Tom Daschle, the majority leader, said the debate would most likely continue into next week. He said he would call for a vote on two amendments this morning. 
 As introduced by Democrats last week, the legislation provides for the government to pay 90 percent of the financial losses in a terrorist attack if they exceed $10 billion. With losses of less than $10 billion, insurance companies would pay a portion based on their market share and would then be reimbursed for 80 percent of additional losses by the government.
Disagreement over limits on terrorism-related lawsuits stalled the insurance measure in the Senate last December, and insurers, bankers and real estate groups that have been lobbying for the insurance bill say they fear that the debate could scuttle the bill. But Senators Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, said they were optimistic that a compromise would be reached. 
The Senate Republicans and the Bush administration want to bar victims of terrorism from bringing negligence lawsuits against businesses or the government. 
The Democrats oppose seeking punitive damages from the government but want victims to be able to recover damages from the government for economic losses and pain and suffering; they want no restrictions on suits against businesses.
In the afternoon, the Democrats defeated an amendment that would have prevented lawsuits against American corporations. The vote was 50 to 46.
Angela de Rocha, an aide to Senator Gramm, said that in its current form Republicans thought the legislation left government and businesses open to "predatory lawsuits." 
Even if Congress passed such a bill, she said, "the president will veto it." While urging passage of an insurance bill, President Bush has insisted on limiting lawsuits.
Immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks, the insurers withdrew coverage for terrorism but later resumed writing policies. Those lobbying for government assistance, along with the Bush administration, contend that inadequate amounts of terrorism insurance have been an added strain on an already sluggish economy. At the same time, many insurance brokers and some consumer advocates contend that terrorism insurance is becoming increasingly available and that prices for the coverage are dropping. 
The Consumer Federation of America reiterated yesterday morning its belief that some big buildings, stadiums and other properties in New York and other big cities have not been able to obtain the necessary terrorism coverage. It urged that the legislation be focused specifically on areas where the shortage was most acute to limit the potential cost to taxpayers.
If the Senate passes an insurance bill, it will have to be reconciled with a far different insurance measure adopted by the House last fall. Instead of paying for most of the costs in an attack, the House bill would make loans available to the insurers. But in an interview, Mr. Schumer said he thought the differences could be resolved. "Once we get a Senate bill," he said, "we'll get a bill we can send to the president."

HEADLINE: Traditional Council Elects Karzai as Afghan President 

BYLINE:  By CARLOTTA GALL 

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, June 13 

 BODY:
In a resounding endorsement of national unity that marked an end to conflict after 23 years, a large majority of delegates at a traditional council elected Hamid Karzai, who has been interim leader for the last six months, to serve the next two years as this country's president.
 It was the first broadly representative election in over 20 years, with delegates from every ethnic group and region, and as such it represents a remarkable watershed in Afghanistan's recent history. 
 Mr. Karzai won 1,295 of 1,575 ballots distributed to delegates, easily defeating his two challengers, one of whom also made Afghan history as the first woman to run for president, just six months after the repressive Taliban fell from power. But it was Mr. Karzai's victory and he was quickly engulfed by enthusiastic supporters and regional leaders surging forward with congratulations. 
His election by a loya jirga, or grand council, a much-honored tribal institution that drew representatives from all regions of Afghanistan, gives him the mandate to lead a transitional administration until general elections in 2004.
"I am proud of you, that you could trust me and that I could win the leadership of the transitional government," he told delegates. "You have laid a very high trust in me." 
The United States, which helped put him in power as part of its war against the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, openly backed his candidacy. The American envoy to Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, was on stage offering his congratulations this evening as the results were read inside the vast tent where the loya jirga has been meeting for several days. 
"He became a consensus candidate," said Mr. Khalilzad in an interview after the election. "It looked like he was going to win, and it happens often in Afghan loya jirgas when a victory looks inevitable, then they move towards a consensus."
Mr. Karzai had won over the strongest challengers to his side earlier in the week, securing important endorsements from the former king, Mohammad Zahir Shah, who ruled out any post for himself, as well as a former president, Burhanuddin Rabbani, and the strong Tajik faction in his own cabinet, including Defense Minister Muhammad Qasim Fahim. Mr. Karzai is an ethnic Pashtun.
A final challenge came when royalists put forward their own candidate for chairman of the loya jirga on Wednesday. But when the chairmanship was won this morning by Ismail Qasimyar, a supporter of Mr. Karzai, it became clear that there was broad support for him.
One of his two opponents in the race was Dr. Massouda Jalal, 35, a medical professor who works for the World Food Program in Kabul. She made an impressive speech advocating a strong central government, police force and national army. She promised to improve education and build up the judiciary, as well as promote adult literacy. About 85 percent of Afghan adults, many of them women, are illiterate. 
"As women we have the right to vote and no one can put pressure on us," she said.
The third candidate, Mir Muhammad Mafouz Nedai, a Kabul company director, spoke urgently of the need to build up the shattered economy. "If a country is holding out its hands for medicines and clothes and these things come from other countries," he said, "then we cannot say we are free."
Dr. Jalal won 171 votes, Mr. Nedai 89, and the remaining ballots were invalid.
Before tackling the enormous challenges of economic and social reconstruction, Mr. Karzai must first try to form a cabinet that will satisfy the powerful regional and factional leaders who gave him support. Additionally, in the coming days he will have to persuade loya jirga delegates to endorse his plan for a new government structure and the people he chooses to run that structure, among them several deputies or vice presidents.
"He's going to be much more confident now," Mr. Khalilzad said of Mr. Karzai. "He has won a landslide and he has the vote of the people. He can choose his own cabinet and put forward his own program."
Yet, Mr. Khalilzad acknowledged, some things will have not changed: there is as yet no national army loyal to the president, and powerful regional leaders remain a strong force.
The 4,500-member international security force deployed in Kabul and its environs will probably stay until June 2004, the deadline for a new constitution and general elections, Western diplomats said. Special Forces helping to train the new Afghan National Army and police force are also to remain in place until then.
Mr. Karzai, who was chosen as interim leader more than six months ago by Afghans gathered for talks in Bonn, Germany, has an inclusive, respectful speaking style that has helped draw regional leaders and some warlords to his side.
His speech to delegates here before the vote, delivered partly in Pashto and partly in Dari, embraced all ethnic groups and factions in Afghanistan. He paid honor, too, to the Islamic guerrillas who fought against the Soviet occupation and then later against the Taliban and Al Qaeda, and remembered the slain leaders of some of these groups, such as the Tajik leader Ahmed Shah Massoud, the Hazara leader Mazari, and the Pashtun leader Abdul Haq, and "all the other Afghan martyrs whose graves lie in the desert marked with only one flag."
He even found something good to say about the first, good intentions of the Taliban, before the movement was subverted by foreign influence and turned against its own people. 
And in comments that will be welcome in this unstable corner of Asia, he promised to forge good relations with Afghanistan's neighbors, despite the interference that experienced from those countries in the last two decades. He was careful to praise Iran and Pakistan for the help they had given to Afghanistan's millions of refugees over the last 23 years of war.
"We give a guarantee to our neighbors that we are not going to take any action against them, because we know what was done to us," he said.
Speeches will continue in the loya jirga over the next two days, which will give Mr. Karzai time to draft his plan of government and choose several deputies or vice presidents, as well as heads of the judiciary and the legislature. 
He is expected to propose that the loya jirga elect over 111 delegates to form a national parliament, made up of representatives from each province and from special groups.

HEADLINE: MIDEAST TURMOIL: SUCCESSION; 
6 Men Who Could Be Contenders to Lead the Palestinians if Arafat Goes

BYLINE:  By JAMES BENNET and JOHN KIFNER 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, June 13 

 BODY:
Yasir Arafat has remained the Palestinian leader for more than 30 years in part by not cultivating a long-term lieutenant, avoiding a threat to his pre-eminence by dividing up power beneath himself and encouraging rivalries among his top political and security aides. 
 That strategy has also left him without a clear successor. 
 Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has called Mr. Arafat a terrorist and wished him exiled. President Bush has harshly criticized Mr. Arafat, but the United States has so far blocked any Israeli move to harm him. 
Some senior Israeli security officials and Palestinian politicians argue that there is no alternative to Mr. Arafat, who they say would dominate Palestinian affairs in the West Bank and Gaza even from exile. His death, they say, could bring on bloody civil conflict. It could also lead other Palestinian factions outside Mr. Arafat's organization, like the militant movements Islamic Jihad and Hamas, to vie for prominence. 
Despite Mr. Arafat's maneuverings, a varied, experienced group of potential leaders waits in the wings. They include older men who lived decades in exile with Mr. Arafat and younger ones who grew up fighting the Israelis in the West Bank and Gaza and studying Israeli society at close hand. 
If the objection to Mr. Arafat has been his involvement in terrorist activities, few among these leaders -- most of whom have spent years in Israeli jails -- would be exempt from similar charges. But none have Mr. Arafat's combination of international standing, broad constituency, financial resources and the raw power of guns.

Mahmoud Abbas
Lawyer and historian, late 60's
Mahmoud Abbas, who is known as Abu Mazen, has long been known as Mr. Arafat's No. 2. Along with Mr. Arafat, he is one of the few remaining founders of Fatah, first organized in the late 1950's by a group of young Palestinian professionals working in the Persian Gulf. 
In 1980 he was elected to the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization. He is now secretary general, which in the overlapping and somewhat makeshift governing structure makes him the second-ranking Palestinian leader, even though he has no post in the cabinet. 
Regarded as a moderate and pragmatic voice, he played a leading role in encouraging contacts between Palestinians and left-wing Israelis as far back as the 1970's. 
Mr. Abbas was born in 1935 in Safad, a town in Galilee, and became a refugee in Syria in 1948 with the birth of Israel. In addition to a law degree earned in Damascus, he holds a doctorate in history from the Moscow Oriental College; his topic was Zionism. He was an important figure in the negotiations leading up to the Oslo accords and is regarded as having good contacts with both Israelis and Americans.

Marwan Barghouti
Politician, 42
Marwan Barghouti is now the second-most-popular Palestinian leader after Mr. Arafat, according to a recent poll that placed his support at 19 percent, compared to Mr. Arafat's 35 percent. It has not hurt Mr. Barghouti's standing that he is once again in an Israeli prison, having been arrested in April on accusations of masterminding terrorist operations by Mr. Arafat's Fatah movement. 
Until the current conflict, Mr. Barghouti, who is fluent in Hebrew and English, had close ties to Israelis and a growing reputation as an advocate of reconciliation. A wry and subtle man given to blue jeans and leather jackets, he has positioned himself as the common man's alternative to corrupt, aging ministers around Mr. Arafat whose roots in the West Bank are not as deep.
Mr. Barghouti, who is 42, was raised in a West Bank village outside Ramallah and is a member of a large, well-known clan. He logged six years in Israeli prisons, even before his recent arrest, having first been arrested by Israel at 16. 
He was deported in 1978. He returned five years later, became chairman of the student council at Bir Zeit University -- where much later he earned a masters in international relations -- and was then deported again. He returned to the West Bank in 1994 under the Oslo peace accords, winning a seat in the Palestinian Parliament and the office of general secretary of Fatah in the West Bank. 
Mr. Barghouti has always called himself a political leader, not a military one. He has advocated violence only against Israeli settlers and soldiers in the West Bank and Gaza, insisting that once Israel evacuated those territories, the warring peoples could live in peace.

Muhammad Dahlan
Security official, 40
At 40, Muhammad Dahlan is among the youngest of the senior Palestinian leaders. In anticipation of Mr. Arafat's reorganization of his government, he resigned recently as chief of the preventive security forces in Gaza, and is seeking a job as a senior political adviser to Mr. Arafat, which would broaden his portfolio while insulating him from criticism if his old force begins to crack down on Palestinian militants. 
The move is in keeping with Mr. Dahlan's reputation as a sophisticated politician. Mr. Dahlan says he was jailed 10 times by Israel, for a total of six years, but Israeli officials say his jail time was considerably less. 
He was deported in 1987. "The Israelis deported me to Jordan," Mr. Dahlan said in sketching his resume during an interview in November. "The Jordanians deported me to Egypt. The Egyptians deported me to Iraq." 
It may seem paradoxical, but one of Mr. Dahlan's assets is that he has excellent relations with Arab states, and solid ties as well to American and even some Israeli officials. 
Mr. Dahlan speaks English and began studying Hebrew when he returned to Gaza in 1994. Since then, he has struggled to extend his influence beyond Gaza.

Ahmed Qurei
Economic adviser, mid-60's
Ahmed Qurei, better known as Abu Ala, is the speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council and regarded as one of the main authors of the Oslo agreement. 
He was born to a wealthy family in 1937 in Abu Dis, on the Mount of Olives, then an Arab village on the outskirts of Jerusalem. He is regarded by some Palestinians as an aristocrat rather than a revolutionary. Much of his activity has been in the economic sphere, and he has been the mainstay of the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction, the main development agency. 
He joined Fatah, Mr. Arafat's mainstream faction, in 1968 and was director of foreign investment for the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
Mr. Qurei led the Palestinian delegations to the secret negotiations that led to the Oslo agreement in September 1993, and to talks afterward on its implementation. 
He has been critical of corruption in the Palestinian Authority and the cabinet. Under the Basic Law -- passed five years ago but only just signed by Mr. Arafat -- he is officially designated as the person to take over as president of the Palestinian National Authority.

Jibril Rajoub
Security official, 49
Jibril Rajoub, the gravel-voiced, pragmatic chief of preventive security in the West Bank, has for years had the advantage and burden of being one of Israel's favorite Palestinians. Lately this distinction has become a millstone, though Mr. Rajoub retains a strong geographic power base around Hebron, where he grew up. 
First arrested at 15, Mr. Rajoub, who just turned 49, was sentenced to life in prison in 1970 for throwing a grenade at a convoy of soldiers, then released in a prisoner exchange with the P.L.O. He served a total of 17 years in Israeli prisons before being deported to Lebanon in 1988, during the first intifada. 
He became a close lieutenant of Mr. Arafat and spent seven years in exile with him before returning to the West Bank. Mr. Rajoub, who speaks Hebrew and English, has strong ties to American and Israeli security officials, having taken part in trilateral meetings for years. 
But Mr. Rajoub's security compound, paid for at least partly by the United States, was shelled during Israel's incursion into Ramallah in March. Without accusing Mr. Rajoub directly, Israeli officials later claimed to have found disguises linking the office to suicide attacks. 
Mr. Rajoub's popularity has declined in the West Bank, and it is not yet clear what role he might play as Mr. Arafat reorganizes his government in response to American pressure.

Sheik Ahmad Yassin
Hamas's spiritual leader, mid-60's
Sheik Ahmad Yassin, the spiritual leader of Hamas, the main Islamic fundamendalist organization, is the most charismatic rival to Mr. Arafat functioning outside the framework of the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
Crippled from a childhood injury, he is frail, uses a wheelchair and speaks in a high squeaky voice. 
But his uncompromising denunciations of Israel from his spartan headquarters in Gaza thrill many and inspire suicide bombers. 
Sheik Yassin calls for the recovery of historic Palestine, that is, the abolisment of the State of Israel, and the establishing of an Islamic state. 
His early origins are unclear, but he was born around 1937 and became a refugee in the cramped, squalid Gaza Strip with the birth of Israel in 1948. Although lacking in formal religious education, he was strongly influenced in his youth by Ikhwan -- the radical Muslim Brotherhood founded in Egypt -- and became a compelling preacher. 
He founded the Islamic Center in Gaza in 1973, which soon controlled all religious institutions there. 
In 1991 he was sentenced to life plus 15 years on charges of abetting terrorism, but was released in a prisoner exchange in 1997 for Mossad agents caught in Jordan trying to assassinate a Hamas official by pouring poison in his ear. Sheik Yassin was greeted as a hero on his return to Gaza.

CORRECTION-DATE: September 17, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article on June 14 about potential successors to Yasir Arafat and one on Aug. 15 about the indictment of Marwan Barghouti, a Palestinian leader who is being tried by Israel on murder charges, misstated the history of his arrests and deportation. He was first arrested in 1978 at the age of 19, not 16. He was deported once, in 1987, not twice, and returned to the West Bank in 1994, not 1993. (A reader reported the errors by e-mail on Sept. 2; this correction was delayed for fact checking.)

HEADLINE: Battle on Estate Tax: How Two Well-Organized Lobbies Sprang Into Action 

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 13 

 BODY:
As the Senate moved toward a risky vote on repealing the estate tax; William H. Gates Jr. sat a continent away on Wednesday, trying to work his will on the proceedings.
 One of a group of wealthy Americans who have campaigned to keep the inheritance tax, Mr. Gates, father of the Microsoft mogul, called pivotal senators. From Seattle, he laid out his case for withstanding the Republican-led election year effort to eliminate the tax or put Democrats on record as opposing repeal. 
 "It is a very legitimate claim of society on an accumulation of wealth which would not have occurred without an orderly market, free education and incredible dollars spent on research," said Mr. Gates, 76.
 He said he talked with Senators Jean Carnahan of Missouri and Tim Johnson of South Dakota, two Democrats who will no doubt face tough questions about the tax in their re-election campaigns. Mr. Gates said he doubted that he had much effect. But Mr. Johnson and Mrs. Carnahan were among 44 senators who voted to retain the tax, blocking a business-backed campaign to end it.
 When it became clear on Tuesday that the senate was going to vote on repeal, lobbying turned frantic. Groups on both sides blanketed members with e-mail messages, prompting thousands of telephone calls to senators who were viewed as being in the middle of the debate.
 Although no senator would acknowledge being swayed by such a campaign, repeal opponents said they believed that they helped cement the votes of at least three law-makers who supported the tax cut package last year that started the fight, Mr. Johnson, Mrs. Carnahan and Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California.
 Repeal advocates say they had successes, as well, in retaining two other Democrats, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Bill Nelson of Florida.
 "Oregon and Florida were our biggest targets," said Marty G. Reiser, a spokesman for Citizens for a Sound Economy, an antitax group. "We generated visits to their offices and a lot of phone calls. Their staffs were certainly aware of our pressure."
 The fight grew out of a wrinkle in the tax cuts last year. Under current law, the value of assets exempt from the estate tax gradually rises until 2010, when it is eliminated for one year. With no change, the tax then reverts to last year's level. Republicans have said permanently eliminating the tax is a defining issue for their party.
 Advocates for repeal included groups like Mr. Reiser's and coalitions that represented some of the biggest business lobbies in town, including the National Federation of Independent Business, the National Association of Manufacturers, automobile dealers, grocery chains, farm groups and even family-held telephone and media companies.
 On the other side were aggressive nonprofit groups allied with some of the most successful makers of profit in America, millionaires and billionaires with a deep-seated philosophical resistance to lifting the tax who formed a group called Responsible Wealth. Besides Mr. Gates, the group included Warren Buffett, George Soros and Ted Turner, among other figures as familiar on Wall Street as on Pennsylvania Avenue.
 Business lobbyists, who knew from the start that they had a uphill fight, said the maneuver by the Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle, Democrat of South dakota, to bring the issue to the floor unexpectedly on Tuesday cost them.
 "Our effort was grass-roots oriented," said Dirk Van dongen, president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors and a leader of the Tax Relief Coalition, which says it has 1,000 members.
 The fight was supposed to have been joined on Wednesday, when another group, Americans for a Fair Estate Tax, an alliance of nonprofit groups and others that oppose the repeal, had planned to release the results of a poll that showed that public opinion favored changing tax but not total repeal.
 At the same time, the federation of independent business was to begin its annual legislative conference, giving hundreds of small business owners a chance to buttonhole their senators in the Capitol corridors. They expected the vote some time before the end of the month.
 Mr. Daschle, running the schedule, had other plans. On Tuesday afternoon, he said that the Senate would start debate a few hours after it had approved a $450 billion increase in the debt limit. He wanted the contrast between the increase in borrowing power and the estimated $740 billion 10-year cost of the repeal to be the backdrop for the floor fight. Stunned, the competing lobbies sprung into action.
 On Wednesday, the lobbying rivals went ahead with their planned events. The repeal opponents had a news conference for the release of their poll and a telephone conference with Mr. Gates. Republican had their event, featuring the manager of a Missouri lumber company worried about holding on to the family business, a clear message to Mr.s Carnahan.
 A critical development was the ability of Senate Democrats to offer competing proposals to the all-out repeal. Mrs. Carnahan joined Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, in offering a plan that would have lifted the value of assets exempt from the tax to $4 million as of next year and granted an unlimited exemption to qualifying heirs.
 Mr. Gates said he did not intend to leave antirepeal lawmakers on their own. "We are certainly going to be helpful to people who this particularly exposes," he said. "The repeal of this tax gives me nightmares."

HEADLINE: End Homelessness? We Need the Will 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "A Plan to End City Homelessness in 10 Years" (news article, June 13):
 You report that more than 33,800 homeless people are living in New York City homeless shelters today, a population that skyrocketed by 26 percent in the last year alone, and that the city spends close to $1 billion a year on homelessness. 
 Clearly, the short-term, Band-Aid approach to homelessness has failed. 
Solutions must be multifaceted: affordable housing, supportive services tailored to the needs of individuals, living-wage jobs, effective job training and antipoverty efforts. 
Ending homelessness in 10 years is humane, makes economic sense and is achievable. The only missing ingredient is political will.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
FallingConsumer Confidence Helps Send the Dow Lower

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Stocks plunged early yesterday on reports that consumer confidence fell this month and a car bomb exploded outside the United States consulate in Karachi, Pakistan, killing at least 11 people. But investors overcame their initial nervousness and shares rebounded, eliminating almost all of the day's losses.
 But even with the rebound, the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed at new lows for the year, capping off their fourth consecutive weekly declines. For the week, the Dow lost 1.2 percent and the S.& P. 2 percent. Both are at their lowest point since the Sept. 21 bottom in the wake of Sept. 11. The Nasdaq composite index ended the day barely in the black but fell 2 percent for the week, its fourth consecutive weekly decline. 
 Among the stocks leading the market down were General Motors, Home Depot, Sprint PCS, Qualcomm, Cisco Systems and Dell Computer.
"I don't know if we can say more about the rebound than some investors came in to cover their shorts," said William E. Rhodes, chief investment strategist at Rhodes Analytics in Boston. He was referring to short sellers, who borrow stock and sell it in hopes that the price will decline. Buying the stock back, in this case, allowed them to lock in their profits. He also said that some investors appeared to be snapping up "what they considered to be bargains."
Some of the market sectors that were doing poorly recently, including multiline insurance companies and diversified financial companies, were leading the rebound yesterday, he said.
"What this means depends on what kind of follow-through there is over the next couple of days," he said.
Combined with a report that industrial production rose just 0.2 percent in May, the data suggested that the economic recovery that is under way may be slower than expected, delaying the hoped-for rebound in corporate earnings. The bombing, along with recent warnings of potential terrorist attacks here, could continue to sap consumer confidence. That could mean consumers would slow their spending, making the recovery even weaker.
Also hanging over the market is investor concern about the manipulation of corporate earnings, the reliability of accounting firms and recent reports of insider trading and tax evasion by leading corporate executives.
The Dow finished down 28.59 points, or 0.3 percent, at 9,474.21, after falling more than 240 points soon after trading began. The S.& P. 500 index was off 2.29 points, or 0.2 percent, at 1,007.27, after dropping almost 30 points. The Nasdaq managed to claw its way back into the black, finishing up 7.88 points, or 0.5 percent, at 1,504.74, after falling 51 points earlier.
At their lows in early trading, the S.& P. 500 index was 16 points away from the low it hit on Sept. 21. The Nasdaq was just 22 points away.
The University of Michigan's index of consumer confidence fell to 90.8 in June from 96.9 in May, the biggest drop since the decline of 9.7 points in September. Industrial production for May rose 0.2 percent, after an increase of 0.3 percent in May. Forecasters had been expecting a 0.3 percent increase.
One sign of investor concern about the slowing of economic growth can be seen in the expectations of when the Federal Reserve will begin raising its short-term interest rate target again. The federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks is now at a 40-year low of 1.75 percent.
The recent betting has been as early as the August meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers. But in the last two weeks the yields on these federal funds futures have fallen and it now appears that some investors think the Fed will not act until its meeting on Nov. 6.
Shares of wireless phone companies were among the hardest hit yesterday, after Sprint PCS warned that sales and growth in the number of its wireless customers would fall below analysts' forecasts. Analysts at several brokerage firms including J. P. Morgan and Merrill Lynch lowered their ratings on the sector. Sprint PCS fell more than 26 percent, Triton PCS Holdings, 27 percent, and AT&T Wireless, 9.4 percent.
In the bond market, prices were higher and yields, which move in the opposite direction, lower, as many investors concluded that slower-than-expected growth would put less pressure on interest rates. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note dropped to 4.80 percent from 4.90 percent Thursday, as the price rose 24/32 , to 100 18/32 .

HEADLINE: Baseball? I Got My Ph.D. In It, Thanks; 
To Many Academics, America's Pastime Is More Than a Game

BYLINE:  By BRUCE WEBER 

DATELINE: COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. 

 BODY:
A sport, a pastime, a diversion, a game. A hobby, a passion, an obsession, a dream. A metaphor, a country of its own, a profession, a statistical mother lode. Baseball is many things to many people, but it is a subject for academic scrutiny to only a few.
 There is an annual conference for this tiny minority, and its 14th incarnation was June 5 to 7 at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum here. Some 70 people attended, including teachers and amateur researchers. But mostly they were scholars from places like New York University, Emory University, the University of Rochester, Union College, Long Island University, Hofstra University and the University of Arkansas. 
 Yes, there is a good-natured sense of "we know people think we're nuts" about them. Many will even acknowledge a shyness (shame is probably too strong a word) over confessing to other academics their adult pursuit of their once boyish or girlish pursuit. 
When Skip McAfee, a nonscholar who has traveled to Cooperstown for each conference from his home in Maryland, quoted President Grover Cleveland in an informal address to the group, he received an appreciative round of laughter and applause.
"What do you think the American people would think about me," Mr. McAfee, the former executive director of the American Society of Horticultural Science, quoted the former president as saying, "if I wasted my time going to a ballgame?"
But all the men and women at the Cooperstown Symposium on Baseball and American Culture were serious enough about baseball's place in American life and history to be drawn by papers on subjects ranging from the advertising industry's use of ballplayers as celebrity product endorsers, to baseball's significance in the works of Ernest Hemingway, to its role in contemporary labor, to its Hollywood filmography and to its history of discrimination. And secretly, or maybe not so secretly, each harbors a belief that this scholarly interest is on the verge of legitimacy, if it isn't already there.
"You still get a condescending attitude from someone whose specialty is supposed to be more serious," said Charles C. Alexander, distinguished professor of history at Ohio University, "but I think we're getting beyond that. I don't think anybody here has to apologize."
Professor Alexander, who has written studies of the Eisenhower presidency and the Ku Klux Klan in addition to biographies of Ty Cobb, Rogers Hornsby and John McGraw and a history of baseball called "Our Game," delivered the keynote address at the conference, which he drew from a chapter in his recently published book, "Breaking the Slump: Baseball in the Depression Era" (Columbia University Press). 
At Ohio, he has been teaching courses on sports and American history since 1980.
"Thirty years ago, I never dreamed I could bite into American history so many ways by writing and teaching baseball history," he said. "What I argue is that baseball history is a lot of other things: immigration, race relations, corporate business, the celebrity phenomenon, the rise of cities, labor history, transportation development, technology development. It was the first big-time sport, the first sport to have an impact on American life, including ballparks as a species of American architecture."
The conference is not, the participants are at pains to point out, about baseball arcana. It does not encourage papers restricted to baseball's insular world. In other words, there are no treatises on the effects of baseball's lowering the pitcher's mound after the 1968 season or statistical analyses of the performances of Duke Snider, Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle to determine once and for all who was New York City's best centerfielder in the 1950's. Nope. That stuff constitutes a whole other discipline called sabermetrics, named after S.A.B.R., the Society for American Baseball Research, an organization founded in 1971 that now claims more than 7,000 members.
Not that the attendees (many are repeaters) aren't interested in such things; the majority of them, of course, were baseball nuts before they were scholars, a circumstance that colored a presentation or two. William M. Simons, for example, a history professor at the State University of New York at Oneonta, used the life of a journeyman major league pitcher who is now, in his 60's, a minor league coach, as a mythical symbol. His bittersweet lecture, "Pitcher at Twilight: Bill Monbouquette and the American Dream," was tinged with personal asides and the ache of Red Sox fandom. 
But much of the conference business was serious-minded in traditional academic style. One paper analyzed the case histories of two ballplayers, Glenn Burke and Billy Bean, who were driven out of the game when it became known that they were homosexual, pointing out that not a single openly gay man has ever played major league baseball.
And not surprisingly, given Jackie Robinson's importance, several presentations focused on race. "He was the biggest issue in integration in the country until court-ordered busing came along," said James Gates, the baseball museum's librarian. 
Doris R. Corbett, a sports sociologist at Howard University, delivered with her colleague Wayne Patterson a paper titled "The Social Significance of Sport and Its Implications for Race and Baseball," which, among other things, raised the issue of racial profiling in the major leagues. They pointed out some statistics that are startling but not easily explainable: that 63.3 percent of major league centerfielders and 36.7 percent of all outfielders are African-American, but that only 3.3 percent of starting catchers and 2 percent of starting pitchers are.
Gregory Bond, a Ph.D. candidate in history at the University of Wisconsin, delivered the first paper of his career: "The Segregation of Professional Baseball in Kansas, 1895-1899," a surprisingly lively account of the travails of the state's black ballplayers, many of them local stars with substantial followings. The paper was drawn from his dissertation, which uses sport as a vehicle to examine American racial attitudes at the turn of the 20th century.
"Most people think baseball was segregated until Jackie Robinson came along in 1947," Mr. Bond said, though, in fact, black athletes played alongside whites on many teams before 1900. "Segregation had to be imposed, and I'll be trying to get at why that was."
It has been nearly half a century since the first Ph.D. dissertation on the game was written at Cornell by Harold Seymour in 1956. The title was "The Rise of Major League Baseball to 1891," and it prefigured his 1960 book, "Baseball: The Early Years" (Oxford University Press), the first baseball volume to be published by an academic press.
By now, 30 to 40 books have been published from papers first presented at the conference, said Alvin L. Hall, who has organized all 14 Cooperstown symposiums. And the way he describes it, it is almost as if there had been a secret baseball academy living within the academy. Before the first conference, he said, he placed a single ad requesting submissions in The Chronicle of Higher Education and was astounded to receive 125 abstracts, 90 percent of them legitimate, many from major universities.
"I went from 'I hope I get enough to hold a conference' to 'I'm going to have to appoint a jury,' " Mr. Hall said.
Most of the academics attending offer courses at their respective schools on subjects like baseball in American history, baseball fiction and the economics of sport.
And as proof of the growing legitimacy of their work, the scholars here cited periodicals like the decade-old Nine: a Journal of Baseball History and Culture, published by the University of Nebraska Press, and The Journal of Sports Economics, which is in its third year. A contributor to that journal, Paul D. Staudohar, a professor of business at California State University at Hayward, is president of the International Association of Sports Economics, which is holding a conference of its own next month at Columbia University.
Here in Cooperstown, Mr. Staudohar, who is also the editor of a volume of baseball short stories, delivered a paper titled "Assessing Outcomes of Baseball Labor Negotiations." (He thinks, by the way, that there may very well be a baseball strike by the end of this season.)
At the very least, the conference makes a pretty good argument that baseball can hold up to the egghead treatment, even if it isn't quite up to being the standard-bearer of human achievement that another of Mr. McAfee's quotables, Tallulah Bankhead, claimed it to be.
"There have been only two geniuses in the world," Mr. McAfee quoted Bankhead as saying. "Willie Mays and Willie Shakespeare."

HEADLINE: Winter's Frustrations Linger On StubbornlyFor U.S. Airline Industry 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
Gordon M. Bethune usually struts with enough Texan swagger to stave off the clouds of gloom and doom. He drives a Porsche, rides a Harley and takes spins in the Boeing jets flown by Continental Airlines Inc., which he happens to run.
 But lately, Mr. Bethune has been reduced to throwing up his hands. "We're a stupid industry led by stupid people," he said, his face twisted somewhere between a grimace and a smirk. 
 Mr. Bethune turned Continental from a near-bankrupt airline into the country's most successful full-service carrier. But that is an empty superlative in a profitless industry, and like some other top airline executives, he admits that he is running out of ideas on how to breathe life into the business. 
Still staggered by the Sept. 11 attacks, the airlines are as close to recovery as a comatose patient on an intravenous drip. They lost $2.4 billion in the first quarter of this year and a record $11 billion last year. The biggest carriers need to make deep cuts in labor costs while narrowing the gap between leisure and business fares, experts say. But few people can agree on exactly how to do that.
Everything is up for grabs as executives re-evaluate their operations, from legroom to labor contracts. Some are even calling for retooling the hub-and-spoke route model, which the biggest carriers have developed over the last two decades to feed passengers through transfer points. The giants are looking jealously at the lower-cost operations of Southwest and JetBlue, which do not build their business around fast, easy connections.
So far, though, many of the industry's stabs at resuscitation appear short-sighted.
Airlines that slashed their schedules to save money after Sept. 11 have been furiously adding back flights to gain market share, regardless of whether competitors fly the same routes on the same schedules and at roughly the same prices. Carriers have done nickel-and-dime cost-cutting, removing hot towels and food service, but have yet to address much more serious costs, like labor inefficiencies. Three times in the last two months, carriers have tried -- and failed -- to raise round-trip leisure tickets by $20, and they have yet to overhaul their fare structures to woo back business travelers.
So low have the airlines fallen that they are looking to the government to point the way to salvation, a quarter-century after Washington deregulated the industry.
Executives are carefully watching United Airlines, the second-largest carrier, and US Airways, the sixth largest, as they struggle to win the big labor concessions that the government is demanding if they are to be granted loan guarantees. That backing would come from a $10 billion program set up by Congress after the Sept. 11 attacks.
If those airlines succeed in their negotiations, their competitors almost certainly will set out to roll back their labor costs, too.
"What's broken is that the pricing model reflects a cost model that's not sustainable," said Michael E. Levine, a former airline executive who teaches at Harvard Law School. "The cost model that's not sustainable is not a technological problem, but a problem of fixed commitments like labor contracts and infrastructure contracts. There's nothing wrong that reorganization won't fix. That could take place through renegotiation of contracts, workouts or Chapter 11 bankruptcy."
Of course, the airlines would prefer to avoid bankruptcy court, having had ample experience in it. And they hope that their usually combative unions -- knowing that the industry has hit rock bottom -- will deal with them.
That approach seems to be working at US Airways. The Air Line Pilots Association said Monday that its 4,800 active workers would be willing to give up $400 million a year in wages, benefits and work rule changes, more than two-thirds of the $595 million that executives want. Other labor groups have also offered concessions.
At United, the pilots' union and management reached a tentative agreement yesterday on concessions. Both parties declined to give details. The agreement is still subject to ratification by the union's members and approval by United's board and labor committee. 
"If approved, it will result in significant cost reductions for United while providing our pilots with additional opportunities for participation in United's future growth," said John W. Creighton Jr., the carrier's chief executive.
But other unions have yet to start serious discussions with United executives over the airline's recovery plan.
"When things are bad, the first place they come to is labor," said Robert Roach Jr., the general vice president for transportation at the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents 110,000 active airline workers across the country. "But whenever you're in trouble, 9 times out of 10, it's because of mismanagement. We're back in that situation now."
Beyond labor costs, airline managers are re-examining other fundamental aspects of the industry that they now say might be hobbling operations. For example, American Airlines, which popularized the hub-and-spoke system in the 1980's, is looking at whether it should alter its connecting schedules. One idea is to not have so many flights converge and depart at the same time from hub airports like O'Hare International in Chicago and Dallas-Fort Worth International.
"Does it need to be loosened a little bit so that we can achieve reasonable connections and get our costs down so that we provide a product that the customer is willing to pay for?" asked Donald J. Carty, American's chief executive.
At Continental, the fifth-largest carrier, Mr. Bethune said he did not know what more he could do to cut costs without losing the carrier's high levels of worker morale and customer satisfaction.
He has shrunk the fleet from 9 different kinds of aircraft seven years ago to 5. He has invested heavily in regional jets, which are cheaper to buy and operate and make it affordable to feed traffic into Continental's system from smaller airports. The airline has installed self-service check-in kiosks in airports and replaced first-run movies on some flights with older films like "Citizen Kane."
"We did about all we could without compromising the quality of the product and taking the cheese off our pizza," Mr. Bethune said.
But that makes the industry picture even more worrisome, because Continental's recovery remains sluggish. Its revenue per available seat-mile, a standard industry measure, was down 6 to 8 percent last month from a year earlier. It also expects to report a loss this quarter.
A core problem for the industry is that airlines refuse to downsize, with too many carriers flying overlapping routes from the same hubs, experts say. The airlines cut capacity by a fifth after the Sept. 11 attacks and boasted that they would revive along leaner and meaner lines. Instead, they have added back flights until capacity in April was down only 11 percent from the period a year ago, often fighting it out in what Mr. Bethune calls "testosterone wars."
Today, for instance, American Airlines is starting two daily flights between New York and Long Beach, Calif. JetBlue began three flights on the same route last November, added a fourth last week and plans a fifth in October. American said it was strengthening its route structure rather than reacting to JetBlue, but JetBlue executives disagree.
At O'Hare, a knock-down battle between American and United has been unfolding, with the two airlines quickly adding back flights this summer to reach pre-Sept. 11 capacity levels.
"My feeling is there is still too much capacity out there," acknowledged Rono J. Dutta, the president of United. "But when we're adding back, we can't give up market share to others."
Costs are only part of the picture. To regain their health, the airlines need to lure back business travelers, who usually account for about 40 percent of passengers but two-thirds of revenue. During the recent recession, though, businesspeople turned to video-conferencing, trains, cars and discounted plane tickets. Security delays and other post-Sept.11 inconveniences have also kept many away from airports.
Some experts say that the major airlines should look at simpler fare structures like the ones used by Southwest and other no-frills carriers. These airlines usually have only four or five tiers of pricing, as opposed to dozens at the larger carriers, and the walk-up tickets popular with business travelers cost no more than twice advance-purchase fares.
"I think the way things are priced is going to change forever," said James Corridore, the airline analyst at Standard & Poor's. "I think it's more than just a cyclical issue. The cyclical highs are not high enough to offset the cyclical lows. It's not just Sept. 11."
Some carriers are experimenting with advance-purchase fares intended for business travelers, while many have offered deeper discounts to corporate travel departments and small businesses, said Terry Trippler, an airline consultant and fare expert. But the carriers have yet to come up with a fare structure that truly works.
Like virtually all the other problems faced by the airlines, that remains a Gordian knot.
"We need something going for us as an industry," Mr. Bethune said. "We're constantly looking, but it's getting tougher. The tide is pretty heavy."

HEADLINE: Two Reports Show a Faltering Recovery 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14 

 BODY:
Two reports released today showed that consumer confidence had its biggest drop in early June since the terrorist attacks and that industrial production slowed in May as the economic recovery faltered.
 "People had been saying it's just a matter of time before things get better," said James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, which has $75 billion in assets under management. "Well, the lag is too long now." 
 The University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index fell to 90.8 in June from 96.9 in May. That is the largest decline since a 9.7-point decrease in September. Production at factories, utilities and mines rose 0.2 percent last month after a 0.3 percent gain in April, the Federal Reserve said.
Flagging confidence and production came after a larger-than-expected drop in retail sales last month and add to a picture of slowing growth.
Economists had expected the Michigan index, which is based on a telephone survey of about 500 households, to fall to 96.5, according to the median estimate of 47 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.
Concerns about the threat of more terrorist attacks and a lack of faith in corporate accountability that has sent stock prices tumbling may prompt consumers to rein in spending and slow the economy's rebound, economists said. That may help explain declines in sales at retailers.
A slowdown in automaking and in utility output contributed to the smaller gain in industrial production last month. Economists had expected a 0.3 percent increase for May.
Still, the increase was the fifth consecutive rise in industrial production, which has not happened in almost two years. Manufacturing is rising because inventories have fallen below levels needed to keep meeting demand. Production of semiconductors and office equipment rose.
A separate report today from the Commerce Department showed that business inventories fell 0.2 percent in April, the 15th consecutive decline. The drop brought inventories to the lowest level in two and a half years.
"Inventory-to-sales ratios are now extremely low," said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. "Companies do need to rebuild stocks."
The amount of capacity in use rose last month to 75.5 percent, the highest since September. The plant-use rate fell to an almost 19-year low of 74.4 percent in December and is still well below the average 81.8 percent rate during the record expansion from March 1991 to March 2001.

HEADLINE: By Aiding Needy Filipinos, G.I.'s Could Help Rout the Rebels 

BYLINE:  By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: TABIAWAN, the Philippines 

 BODY:
On the small jungle island of Basilan, success in the fight against terrorism may hinge more on digging wells and building roads than on training Philippine soldiers to shoot straighter and track elusive Muslim militants across rugged terrain.
 For the past four months, the stated mission of 160 American Special Forces soldiers here has been to train Philippine soldiers to fight a dwindling band of Abu Sayyaf rebels who have operated on Basilan. 
 But those American Green Berets, as well as 350 Navy and Marine Corps engineers who arrived here in April, have played an equally important role in mending roads, drilling wells and clearing a 1940's airstrip for cargo planes. This will not only improve life for the 300,000 residents of the island, one of the poorest parts of the Philippines, but may also help dry up popular support for Abu Sayyaf, American and Philippine officials hope. 
"When we leave, the improvements stay," said Brig. Gen. Donald C. Wurster of the Air Force, the commander of American forces here in the southern Philippines. "Our strategy is to enhance the Philippine government's legitimacy. We want to eliminate the seed ground for the next generation of terrorists."
Many projects here stem from a six-week survey conducted after the Special Forces set up headquarters in this village north of Isabela, the island's chief city, in late January. The survey found that government services were provided mostly in the island's few Roman Catholic areas, in the north. The majority Muslim population had been mostly neglected. Few residents had drinking water nearby and, on average, two children a day were dying from contaminated water.
Most schools here were staffed with Christian missionaries. When Abu Sayyaf fighters moved in, the Americans found, one of their first acts was to kill or kidnap the schoolteachers and to behead the landowner who donated property for the school.
American and Philippine officials here say the mere presence of 600 armed American troops and 4,000 Philippine soldiers on this 20-mile-by-30-mile island has forced most of the hard-core Abu Sayyaf fighters to flee to nearby islands.
 Indeed, on June 7, Abu Sayyaf fighters and Philippine troops clashed on Mindanao Island, just north of here. Two hostages held by the terrorists, including an American missionary, Martin Burnham, were killed; his wife, Gracia, was wounded but rescued. 
Until now, the risk of being kidnapped or killed by Abu Sayyaf had dissuaded international aid agencies from operating on Basilan.
"Obviously, investment doesn't go in those conditions, which gets you into a vicious circle, where people remain poor, and they're more easily exploited by these terrorist groups," said Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz, who met here with military commanders this month.
The American military, as it has elsewhere, is reviving the island's moribund economy, buying lumber, gravel, food and other supplies from local businesses, and contracting with widows to wash laundry. Entire families have been involved in delivering the Americans' order for 6,000 truckloads of gravel, in particular.
The assessment by the Special Forces presented a plan that essentially dovetailed social and aid programs with military goals. With the rainy season looming, engineers have been given 60 days to build about 40 miles of roads, bridges and other projects.
General Wurster has asked for $7 million from the Defense and State Departments for medical and other community projects on the island. But even without the new authority or requested financing, Special Forces teams have helped in ways large and small.
In one instance, Green Berets came across a little girl with a fishhook snagged in her leg. Medics cleaned and dressed the injury and took her home to her village. The first aid resulted in a new ally on the island, as the girl's grandfather turned out to be a village leader.

HEADLINE: Two Former Governors Come Off the Bench to Help the YankeeNets' Arena Project 

BYLINE:  By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, June 14 

 BODY:
The YankeeNets could apparently use someone with the skill of the Nets' assist leader, Jason Kidd, to maintain the momentum of its drive to build an 18,000-seat arena here.
 So the owner of the New Jersey Nets and the New Jersey Devils (as well as the New York Yankees) is getting help from two substitutes, former Govs. Thomas H. Kean and Donald T. DiFrancesco. 
 Just a month ago, Gov. James E. McGreevey gave his blessing to a timetable that would delay the introduction of legislation needed to help finance the arena until substantial progress was made on the redevelopment of the teams' current home, the Continental Airlines Arena in the Meadowlands. 
The governor had anticipated that the legislation would pass in October, which seemed to satisfy the YankeeNets in May. But now negotiators for the teams' owner have become anxious, worried that the Newark arena concept has lost support, that the complex will not be ready to open in 2005 and that its costs will climb with the delay.
To meet their schedule, the YankeeNets negotiators calculate, legislation must be enacted by the time lawmakers go home at the end of this month. Otherwise they run the risk of the estimated $355 million cost of the arena increasing by $80 million, they say.
McGreevey administration officials insist they are keeping to their original schedule, using the summer to build support for the plan in Bergen County, which will suffer economically if the teams leave the Meadowlands and the property becomes unused. But they have told YankeeNets officials that the governor will support passage of the legislation this month if the YankeeNets can, on its own, drum up enough votes among Republicans in the Senate.
That is where Mr. DiFrancesco and Mr. Kean, both Republicans, come in. 
"Waiting until September," Mr. Kean said, "would be a real problem for the YankeeNets as I understand it, and they can't advance additional money without an understanding from the Legislature that they can proceed."
George Zoffinger, one of the governor's top advisers on the arena issue and Meadowlands redevelopment, said, "If they could get five Republican legislators to sign on to move the process now, then all right." Mr. Zoffinger, who is executive director of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, which owns the Meadowlands, added, "They have DiFrancesco and Kean working on it, but we are going to be consistent and it has not changed our approach."
But Mr. Kean said, "I think we are within two votes."
He said that he was acting not as an agent for YankeeNets, but in his role as a founder of the Newark Alliance, a group of business and civic leaders who came together three years ago to support development and education projects in the state's largest city. He had enlisted Mr. DiFrancesco in the effort, he said, because of his support of the Newark arena project during his term as governor.
Len Coleman, the chief negotiator for the YankeeNets and former president of Major League Baseball's National League, said the company was jolted into action after realizing in recent weeks how time-consuming the project would be. But equally important, he said, was the need -- after three years of trying to build an arena -- for additional assurances of the state's commitment to the arena, which would be partly financed with state-issued bonds that are secured by sales and income tax revenues generated by the arena and surrounding development. Of the 15 YankeeNets board members, he noted, only three are from New Jersey and likely to show any patience with a long approval process seemingly dictated by the state's politics.
The sense of urgency being pressed by Mr. Coleman, Mr. Kean and others comes at a time when many supporters of the arena feel that pressure for progress has eased with the announcement in May of Mr. McGreevey's timetable. At that time one of the things driving the proposal was the governor's desire to make some announcement helpful to Mayor Sharpe James of Newark, a political ally who was facing a spirited challenge in his bid for re-election.
With Mayor James's re-election and the shift of the McGreevey administration's efforts to meetings with Bergen County interests on the Meadowlands redevelopment, the YankeeNets and its supporters began feeling neglected. They were also troubled by the re-emergence of opposition voices calling for a statewide referendum on any state role in a new sports arena.
Much of what they are doing now is reselling the idea of the arena, repeating projections of its economic benefits, the downsides of not replacing Continental Arena and stressing what Mr. Coleman called the "social importance" of sports teams to the state.
"This is the right thing to do," Mr. Kean said, as he called for elected officials to show leadership on the issue. "If we had made such projects as the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, or the Camden Aquarium or even the Continental Airlines Arena subject to what polling said, they never would have been built. My worry is that if this doesn't happen it will be a blow for the city and state, not only economically but psychologically."

HEADLINE: Raising Farm Subsidies, U.S. Widens International Rift 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14 

 BODY:
Less than one month after President Bush signed the new farm bill, agriculture has leaped from the backwaters of diplomacy to near the top of the list of international complaints against the United States.
 Portrayed by its supporters as a necessary safety net for farmers and by its detractors as an election-year welfare program to win Midwestern votes, the huge increase in subsidies has become an overnight magnet for America-bashing. 
 Javier Solana, Europe's foreign policy chief, declared in Madrid this week that the new American agriculture policy has created the "most profound" division between Europe and the United States, worse than disputes over steel tariffs, the Kyoto environmental treaty or the international criminal court.
In Washington, in an address to Congress, Prime Minister John Howard of Australia said on Wednesday that the only problem between these closest of friends was his country's "intense disappointment" over the $180 billion farm bill. 
In Rome, at a United Nations conference on hunger, developing countries pointed this week to the huge new subsidies to American farmers as one of the biggest obstacles to creating vital opportunities for their own farmers and enabling them to climb out of poverty. 
With Mr. Bush pressing other countries to knock down their trade barriers and expand open markets, his approval of an 80 percent increase in farm subsidies -- with all the advantages that confers on American grain exports -- is viewed as a move in the opposite direction.
Poor countries say the subsidies also work at cross purposes to the administration's avowed desire to reduce poverty and to diminish foreign anger against the United States.
In a private letter to Congressional leaders, a group of countries known as the Cairns Group, which includes Australia, Thailand, Canada, Brazil and Argentina, wrote this month that "the sheer size of the subsidy package will inevitably hurt farmers around the world, particularly in developing countries." 
"The United States should be sending a very different message," wrote Mark Vaile, the group's chairman. 
The heart of the dispute is that by underwriting its largest farmers, the United States is flooding the world market with inexpensive corn, wheat, rice and soybeans, which are sold at half what it costs to produce the grain. That leads to artificially low world prices, which in turn undercut grain produced by farmers in countries that do not give subsidies. The grain market becomes distorted, domestic markets are ruined for producers overseas and their chances of making inroads into foreign markets are reduced.
"Subsidies and other measures applied by the world's richest countries continue to increase exponentially," said Navin Chandarpal, Guyana's minister of agriculture, at the Rome conference. "We continue to be pressured into further opening up our markets, without any regard being paid to the welfare of our farming and rural communities as a whole." 
Development experts agree and say the effects ripple throughout developing economies. "American farm exports drive down prices paid to local farmers, reduce rural family income around the world and push farmers off the land and into overcrowded cities," said Mark Ritchie, president of the Institute for Agriculture Trade Policy, a nonprofit organization in Minneapolis.
However, some developing countries with sufficient foreign reserves prefer to import cheap American food as they build up other sectors of their economy.
Despite the complaints, the new American farm policy also conforms to the current rules of the World Trade Organization. Indeed, the United States is not alone as a wealthy country that gives generous welfare programs to farmers. The 15-nation European Union is notorious for giving lavish subsidies to its seven million farmers. 
In an address in Germany this month, Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, defended the farm bill and suggested "respectfully that America-bashing will not promote the E.U.'s enlightened self-interest. 
"When Europeans criticize the recent U.S. farm bill, I wonder how many are even aware that U.S. agricultural tariffs are less than half of the E.U.'s," he said.
Disputes between the world's major economies -- United States, Europe and Japan -- over farm subsidies are nothing new. But the latest American increase, European Union officials say, comes as they are trying to reduce their own payments.
With plans to admit 10 new countries -- including Poland, where nearly one-third of 40 million inhabitants identify themselves as full- or part-time farmers -- the European Union says it must slash expensive programs to support agricultural production and give more money for conservation and rural development.
Critics of the new American policy say that, by giving in to the domestic farm vote, the United States will have a difficult time persuading other countries to open their markets to American agricultural products.
"The American farmers have shot themselves in the foot," said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics. "The long term growth of U.S. agriculture is clearly in foreign markets, particularly the rapidly growing emerging markets. That requires liberalization and access to those markets. The farm bill undercuts our ability to reach those markets."
During the debate on the farm bill, lawmakers in Congress painted a different picture, arguing that American farmers needed subsidies to remain competitive in the world.
America's main competitors on the global grain markets are not the European Union countries but countries that pay few or no subsidies to farmers and indeed may even tax food exports to earn more government revenue.
During the trade negotiations at Qatar six months ago, members of the World Trade Organization agreed to remove barriers to farm trade.
Mr. Zoellick insists that the United States remains committed to the goals worked out in Qatar. But both the Bush administration and the European Union -- whose dispute over farming is essentially one of their many trade battles over state subsidies -- will be hard pressed to remove the barriers to foreign agricultural products without upsetting their powerful farmers.
"We're all free traders and we're all hypocrites," said Peter L. Scher, specialist on trade negotiations for agriculture in the Clinton administration. "I blame the Europeans as well as the Americans. If we're going to develop these poor countries, we've got to give these nations a chance to develop their own agricultures."

HEADLINE: Tensions on Lebanese Border Cast a Pall Over Peace Effort 

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14 

 BODY:
Even as President Bush prepares to issue his new plan for reviving Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, a senior Western diplomat warned here today that the increased threat of military action along Israel's border with Lebanon could jeopardize any chance of an international peace conference.
 The diplomat said there were indications of new weapons shipments from Iran to Hezbollah, the militia in southern Lebanon that has ties to both Iran and Syria. He said these included longer-range rockets that could be launched deep into Israeli territory, perhaps within the next several days. The diplomat said such an attack could prompt a severe Israeli reprisal that could include an invasion of Lebanon. 
 But a range of senior Bush administration officials, from the White House to the Pentagon and the State Department, said they were not aware of any such new or immediate threat, while acknowledging that the situation remained volatile and a matter of intense concern.
An Israeli diplomat here confirmed that Israel was concerned about the northern border and that Prime Minister Ariel Sharon had spent considerable time discussing it with Mr. Bush this week. 
"I know that our people have seen indications that there is an intention on the Hezbollah side to act in the short term, and possibly to escalate in comparison with activities that we've seen in recent months," the diplomat said. "If they fired against a population center some sort of missile, Israel I think would have to respond, though I can't be specific about what we would do."
For months, there has been intermittent shelling by Hezbollah and return fire from Israel. On a visit to the region in April, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell took time out to visit Lebanon and Syria to pressure leaders there to crack down on activity by Hezbollah for fear it could prompt a regional war.
American officials said that in the last 36 hours, diplomats in the region had renewed contacts with Lebanese and Syrian officials, urging restraint, especially given the administration's efforts to establish peace.
"Starting with the secretary's visit, we've been underscoring to all the parties the need for maximum restraint along the border area," one senior administration official said this evening. "We don't see much of a difference in patterns of activity. It remains a volatile situation, and the message is, 'Everybody keep cool.' Israelis have expressed their concerns, but the broader reason is that this is the worst possible time of having something ignite up there."
Indeed, Secretary Powell and senior State Department officials held another round of meetings today in preparation for Mr. Bush's expected announcement next week of his plans for reviving political talks and for an international peace conference to address the Middle East crisis.
After meeting with Secretary Powell, the Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, told reporters as he left the State Department: "I am afraid again I don't have much to tell you. I think your interest and the talk that you want to hear is not me talking, but what the message and the statement of the president is going to be. And I, like you, am waiting for that."
At the same time, the State Department's top Middle East expert, Assistant Secretary William J. Burns, met with his counterparts from the United Nations, the European Union and Russia to discuss the administration's next steps.
Both American and European officials said the meeting produced strong consensus on the need to move forward simultaneously in efforts to re-establish security, address economic and human needs in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and to provide a path for settling the conflict.
One diplomat said that the idea of declaring a provisional Palestinian state whose borders and capital could be determined later was under serious consideration by Mr. Bush, but that he believed no decision had yet been made on that or a host of other points, and that there was some ambivalence about the idea from other nations.
"When you start twisting it, both legally and psychologically, it's very fluffy," the diplomat said.

HEADLINE: Mrs. Clinton Reports That Her Husband Made $9.2 Million From Speeches Last Year 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 14 

 BODY:
Former President Bill Clinton received $9.2 million in his first year out of office for giving 59 speeches to investment banks, Jewish and Israeli groups, public relations companies, advertising agencies and other organizations, according to a financial disclosure form filed today by his wife, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York.
 In addition, Mrs. Clinton earned $2.8 million last year as part of an $8 million advance for her memoirs. 
 Mr. Clinton has parlayed his public service into an extraordinarily lucrative private life, flying from continent to continent and earning fees as high as $450,000 for a three-day engagement in Tokyo sponsored by the Miki Corporation, a food and cosmetics importer and wholesaler. 
Other presidents have cashed in after leaving office. In 1998, Global Crossing, a telecommunications company that has since gone bankrupt, paid former President George Bush with company stock that grew to be worth $14 million in lieu of an $80,000 fee for a speech. Mr. Bush has also earned large fees for many other speeches, earning millions of dollars. In October 1989, former President Ronald Reagan received a $2 million honorarium for a nine-day trip and speeches in Tokyo.
But Mrs. Clinton's filing, which includes required financial information about her family income, is the first time a former president has specifically enumerated his speaking fees. 
The Clintons were required to disclose only Mr. Clinton's income from honorariums, according to his spokeswoman, and thus other income, from sources like his book deal, is not disclosed. Mr. Clinton's book contract includes an advance of more than $10 million.
The Clintons reported that they paid more than $1.3 million last year in legal fees for themselves and "former staff members," although a spokeswoman declined to say which staff members received help with their legal bills. Over all, the Clintons still owe between $1.75 million and $6.5 million in legal bills, mostly to Williams & Connolly, the Washington law firm that represented Mr. Clinton during his impeachment. 
By far the biggest asset reported in Mrs. Clinton's filing today was accounts at Citibank that contained $5 million to $25 million and generated $100,000 to $1 million in interest income. The family's second-largest asset was a blind trust that contained $1 million to $5 million but lost an undisclosed amount last year.
Ethics watchdogs suggested that the payments to Mr. Clinton could raise concerns.
Scott Harshbarger, the president of Common Cause, remarked: "The former president has a right to earn a living, and he does have legal bills. That said, it is troubling for the spouse of a senator to take in $9 million for nominal work."
Julia Payne, Mr. Clinton's spokeswoman, said that the former president had turned down some speeches because they "may have appeared to be a conflict," and that he and his agent were "very cautious" about the speeches he accepts.
Ms. Payne added: "The paid speaking engagements by the former president are not instances where he goes in and out and makes this kind of money. He delivers a very thoughtful and compelling speech on globalization, and he will also take questions from the audiences."
New York's other senator, Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat, listed income of $136,700. His major assets include a thrift savings plan worth $100,000 to $250,000 and deferred compensation of $100,000 to $250,000. He also held mutual funds, an individual retirement account and a United States bond, each worth between $50,000 and $100,000.
According to a summary of other financial disclosure reports compiled by The Associated Press, the Senate majority leader, Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, listed income of $161,200 and major assets that included mutual funds worth $233,000 to $790,000 and bank accounts worth $100,000 to $250,000. He listed no major liabilities. 
The House speaker, J. Dennis Hastert, Republican of Illinois, listed income of $186,300 and major assets including a town house, an Illinois opera house and a money market fund, each valued at $100,000 to $250,000. The opera house and town house carry mortgages of $50,000 to $100,000.
The White House this afternoon released copies of financial disclosure forms filed by senior aides to President Bush. 
Karl Rove, the president's senior adviser, reported assets worth $2 million to $4.8 million, and liabilities of $350,000 to $700,000.
Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff, reported assets worth $1.1 million to $2.8 million, and no liabilities.

 In the annals of American rebels without a clue, it is hard to find a more pathetic group of soldiers of misfortune than the half-dozen or so men in the far northwest corner of the nation who called themselves the Washington State Militia. The Marx Brothers, bumbling through Freedonia, come to mind, but at least they were in on the joke. 
This militia and other units of the so-called patriot movement generated an awful lot of news stories during the middle years of the Clinton administration. They paraded around in surplus cammies, made threats to sheriffs and federal wildlife agents trying to enforce environmental laws and waited for the day that the unseen army of the New World Order would cross the 49th Parallel and take away our right to Mega Gulps and sport utility vehicles.
Up close, they were more Pee-wee Herman than Paul Revere. Had they not been heavily armed, most militia members most likely would have been ignored, left to babble among themselves on bar stools in small Western towns. But a handful of them managed to set off enough bombs, or plot to do the same, that it led some people to believe that a broad national movement was under way. Timothy McVeigh, the Oklahoma City bomber, dabbled in militia culture but never actually joined one. 
A few books in the mid-1990's looked at the more militant and active hate groups that preceded the militia movement. Those people were scary. They were overt Nazis, living in Idaho, Montana, parts of the South and Midwest. They hated Jews, blacks and most elected officials. They held Klan-style cross-burnings, robbed banks and killed people. Most of them have disappeared or are in jail.
By contrast, the militia movement seems like a costume affair for the mildly delusional. Or at least that is the impression that the New Yorker writer Jane Kramer leaves in "Lone Patriot," her well-drawn, superbly reported narrative of the Washington Militia. 
Kramer, who has written The New Yorker's "Letter From Europe" for more than 20 years, may seem like an odd choice to chronicle a far-right beer-belly gang in Whatcom County, Wash., on the Canadian border, about a 90-minute drive north of Seattle. As Kramer says up front in her book, 20 years of living between New York and Paris had put her out of touch with the fringe of her own country. She approaches this subject with fresh eyes, and in a close-up telling of the short, unhappy life of the Washington State Militia she avoids the mistakes of writers who never actually spent much time with these people.
Her subject is John Pitner, a middle-aged unemployed ship painter who called himself the founder, promoter, banker, quartermaster and commander in chief of his own unit of patriots. While his wife brings home the bacon, Pitner frets inside his manufactured home about the usual militia suspects -- Rockefellers, black helicopters and the United Nations -- all while waiting for Armageddon. "He had two lives, the one he had lived and the one he invented, and his real biography seemed to me to be hidden somewhere in the commute he made between them," Kramer writes in a typically lucid dissection of her cast of characters. 
Pitner's comrades came from the folds of western Washington, an assortment of tax protesters, convicted felons and people with too much time on their hands who spent it listening to talk radio. A grandfatherly contractor, an auto mechanic with a propensity for passing bad checks, a tax-dodging veterinarian and a few others were the foot soldiers in Pitner's army. Two of them turned out to be on the government's side -- one a square-jawed agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation who posed as a gun dealer, the other a militia regular who turned informant for $25,000.
At meetings they talked about what they would do when the call to battle came, about a government that had lost touch with the Constitution and about bombs and money to pay for dress-up army stuff. Pitner is presented here as a man with profound delusions, but also as a hapless fellow, not entirely unsympathetic. His family history was bleak, and he failed at everything he tried, including a stint in the Army, which led to a court-martial. 
After reading David Brock's book "Blinded by the Right," I was struck that the more bizarre allegations against Bill Clinton that were hatched in chardonnay-sipping salons in the other Washington filtered down to a disgruntled few in a different tax bracket in this Washington: Vince Foster's "murder"; Janet Reno's fealty to the United Nations; the New World Order's plan for global conquest. No matter how twisted the truth, it all added up to these backwoods militiamen. As John Pitner said, "What I was learning fit my paranoia." Pitner also said his brain was zapped, by mysterious forces no doubt connected to the big conspiracy. 
Kramer does a fine job of portraying a group of everyday lost souls looking for something larger to blame for all their troubles. Pitner's rants held them together, for a time, until they turned on one another. "The strangest thing about John's performance was how American he made it, sitting there with his mug of instant coffee and his plate of cookies in the plasterboard parlor of his double-wide manufactured home, sharing a faded flowered couch with a couple of drowsy cats who clearly had no plans for the invasion," she writes.
She has trouble with geography; Chelan County is a long way from the Idaho Panhandle, though she makes it sound closer. And claiming that the anti-environmentalist theorist Ron Arnold "had helped to found the Sierra Club" is even farther from the truth than Chelan is from Idaho. But these are quibbles. 
In the end, Washington Militia members did very little except talk about what they might do. Several members were convicted of conspiracy to make and possess destructive devices, or of possessing and transferring machine guns. Pitner did three years in jail and was released early last year. The militia has officially disbanded. 
Kramer says she never understood what Pitner wanted. But she quotes his sister, Susan, as saying that the saddest part of his militia history was that "the only person who believed him was the F.B.I."

 THE FLY SWATTER
How My Grandfather
Made His Way in the World.
By Nicholas Dawidoff.
Illustrated. 353 pp. New York:
Pantheon Books. $26.
 BABY boomers still tend to think of the 1950's as orderly, insular and repressed -- as devoid of color as those vintage black-and-white television sitcoms. But it was actually an age of positively unruly, riotous invention.+Everyday life was forever changed by, among other things, the bomb, computers and TV,+and so was the less visible world of ideas. The 50's spurt in American intellectual development was in no small measure the product of+the extraordinary prewar influx of brilliant minds. Scholars fleeing Hitler brought new sophistication to America's premier universities and helped transform the United States virtually overnight into the world leader in disciplines like physics, mathematics and economics.
One particularly exciting mind belonged to Alexander Gerschenkron, the legendary Harvard economist and historian. His colleagues called him "the last man with all known knowledge." But in his captivating memoir, "The Fly Swatter," Nicholas Dawidoff shows that one source of the brilliant insights of "the Great Gerschenkron" into how nations triumph over backwardness was his own personal triumphs over adversity. By retracing his grandfather's tortuous path to Cambridge, Mass., Dawidoff, the author of "The Catcher Was a Spy" and "In the Country of Country," also conveys something of the larger story:+the biggest transfer of intellectual capital in history and its indelible -- and continuing -- impact on American thought.
Before arriving in the United States in 1938, Gerschenkron, who would be called America's "doyen of economic history," was twice exiled. The son of a Jewish tobacco factory manager, he was born in 1904 in Odessa. After the Bolshevik Revolution, Gerschenkron followed his father across the icy steppes to Austria just ahead of Lenin's secret police. In the nearly two decades he spent in Vienna, he fell under the spell of Austrian economics, Social Democracy and the woman who would become his wife, Erica Matschnigg, while making an on-again-off-again living as a factory manager and political organizer. After the Anschluss, Gerschenkron and his family were forced to flee again. This time he skied across the Alps and made his way first to England, where he met up with his wife and daughter, then to California. 
He brought with him a remarkable command of languages and literature, an encyclopedic knowledge of Russian and European history and, last but not least, a deep conviction that freedom was worth fighting for. Too old to be accepted by the Army, he spent the war doing research, moonlighting as a steelworker in a Navy shipyard and, later on, mapping out details of the Marshall Plan at the Federal Reserve. A year after D-Day, he landed at Harvard, where he taught for the next three decades. He died in 1978.
Having reinvented himself twice, he wondered how countries could do the same. Like physicists after Einstein, he was a relativist, writing that "the past changes perpetually with the historian's emphasis, interest and point of view." And in contrast to 19th-century thinkers like Marx who "looked for a determination of the course of human events as ubiquitous and invariant as that of the course of planets," he wrote that his "modest" wish was to find "a historical approach to current problems."
During the cold war, economic development was a very hot topic.+In pursuing his unified theory of industrialization from Edinburgh to the Urals, Gerschenkron upset Marx's notion that "the industrially developed country presents to the less developed country a picture of the latter's future" -- partly by showing that first Germany and later Russia followed the lead of Britain, but not by the same routes or, for that matter, at the same speed.
Gerschenkron had twice fled backward countries, twice made superhuman efforts to catch up. "He had caught up, and the fact that he could do so gave him a sense of optimism about other people's chances," Dawidoff writes. "Yet, as he knew well, things could go the other way." Small wonder, then, that Gerschenkron compared development to a bus that "sometimes comes at odd hours and can be missed."
Development takes place in discontinuous spurts, he concluded, and the more backward a country when a spurt comes, the faster it is likely to grow. Output might consist mostly of heavy machinery rather than consumer products. Consumption might fall rather than rise. Most important, no institutions, whether private capital markets or banks, were absolute prerequisites. In 19th-century Russia, the state had played the role of British stock markets or German banks. Gerschenkron's sweeping history of European industrialization, though criticized in various particulars, has never been superseded. His approach has since proved useful in explaining how Japan and the Pacific Rim economies caught up with the West. And what's more, researchers have found that poor countries and poor regions have generally grown faster than rich ones since World War II.
Gerschenkron's conclusion that the state could promote growth was fashionable in the 50's and 60's among proponents of big government; he was also one of the first scholars in the West to puncture the myth of superior Soviet economic performance. In a virtuoso display of reporting and number crunching (he traveled around the country for months to collect data from companies on various production processes), he demonstrated that standard Soviet production indexes were designed to grossly inflate the rate of growth. What's more, he was among the first Western scholars to argue that the bloated Soviet state was itself a product of backwardness. What characterized the Soviet regime was not Socialism, he wrote in his most celebrated essay, "The Economic Advantages of Backwardness," but rather a "totalitarian dictatorship that has come to dominate the economic processes" and that "actually prevented, or at least delayed, the mental adjustment of the population to the normalcy of a fully industrialized society."
A brilliant+essayist who deployed polemic, humor, ancient Greek, philosophy, novels and poetry with the same ease as statistics, Gerschenkron once published a study of Austrian fiscal policy that an ecstatic reviewer described as a story of "intrigue and backbiting" containing "the necessary ingredient of extramarital affection." However, he never turned his prodigious scholarship into a multivolume opus, possibly, as Dawidoff suggests, because of what he called "his severity to himself, his supreme sense of duty."
Gerschenkron's principal legacy turned out to be his remarkable students -- among them, Paul David, Albert Fishlow, Peter Temin and Deirdre McCloskey -- who carried forward, if not precisely his conceptions, then his exacting yet expansive style of work. For almost a quarter-century, Harvard required its Ph.D. students to take Gerschenkron's yearlong economic history seminar. Short, stocky and notoriously untidy, he nonetheless managed to intimidate his students. "He motivated people," a former student said recently. "He got people to work. No one said, 'Alex gave me this idea.' But they do say, 'I was petrified of him.' "
A showman and ferocious debater, Gerschenkron gave his finest performance during the Vietnam War, after Students for a Democratic Society occupied Harvard's administration building. The refugee who escaped from two totalitarian regimes spoke from the heart when he called on the faculty to defend intellectual freedom: "The university, like all great works of art, is a frail and fragile creation, and unless you do something about it, this wonderful work of art will be destroyed, and the guilt will be yours."
In private, the remote and often+rapierlike Great Gerschenkron let his inner child loose and therefore delighted the children in his life. To his grandson, whose own father was mentally ill -- sick and strange and disappointing" -- he not only conveyed his enthusiasms for baseball, books, boulders and epic battles with flies but also made him feel like "a regular boy." Naturally, Gerschenkron frequently challenged the young Dawidoff, just as he did his students. Gerschenkron often complained about his own "slowness" in reading. Once he timed Nicky Boy, as he called Dawidoff, with a stopwatch while the 12-year-old read Trevelyan's "History of England" a minute at a stretch and quizzed him on what he had just read. Without telling him whether the answers were right or wrong, he repeated the exercise over and over until he suddenly shouted excitedly, "The boy can do it!" And, in "The Fly Swatter," he has.

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER; 
National Parks Still Have Space

BYLINE:  By BARRY ESTABROOK; BARRY ESTABROOK is a writer and editor who lives near Boston.

 BODY:
A GROUP of five Tennessee couples had been planning a trip to Ireland in May, but after the Sept. 11 attacks, they decided to tour the American Southwest instead. At the end of a long day of driving, the group entered Thunderbird Lodge in the remote Canyon de Chelly National Monument in Arizona and requested rooms.
 Normally, the response would have been no. As the only hotel within the borders of the national monument, Thunderbird is frequently booked solid. Mary Jones, owner of the lodge, has been known to roll cots into conference rooms to accommodate travelers who would otherwise have to backtrack across 60 miles of mountains and desert to find the nearest Vacancy sign. 
 But this year she was able to take the walk-ins from Tennessee. "Normally people call and make reservations three or four months ahead and we're full," Ms. Jones said. "Now they're just showing up and saying, 'Hey, you got a room?' " 
The Tennessee group was lucky, and arriving before peak vacation season probably helped, too. Though travelers should not expect to walk in and snare prime national-park lodgings this summer, reservations may be available even for those who procrastinate.
According to park officials and operators of visitors' lodgings who were contacted late last month, the overall number of visitors is expected to run even with or slightly higher than last year. Americans are expected to visit the parks rather than travel abroad. But foreign visitors, who typically book far ahead, are also staying closer to home, freeing up rooms in some places.
"There's a sense that there are going to be more visitors this summer than normal," said Gerry Gaumer, a spokesman for the National Park Service in Washington. Last year 280 million visitors went to the parks, a slight decline over the previous three years. But Mr. Gaumer said that even with the increased traffic, there most likely will still be space at the parks' campgrounds. Campsites can be reserved at the park service's Web site, reservations.nps.gov, or by calling (800) 365-2267 for all parks other than Yosemite National Park, where sites can be reserved by calling (800) 436-7275.
Hotels within the parks are managed by independent operators. The largest, Xanterra Parks and Resorts, formerly Amfac, has hotels and other concessions in nine national parks and monuments, including Grand Canyon National Park, Yellowstone National Park, Zion National Park, Mount Rushmore National Memorial and Everglades National Park.

Fewer Tourists From Abroad
"Our European bookings are down 30 or 40 percent, and our Pacific Rim business has nearly gone away," said Judi Lages, vice president of sales and marketing for Xanterra. (The company's Web site, which includes information about reservations, is at www.xanterra.com.)
"But Americans seem to be taking national parks to heart," Ms. Lages said. "Because of that, we are only about 8 or 9 percent behind last year over all and expect to be normal by summer." 
Although space is generally available, demand remains strong for certain popular destinations. There has been no decline in bookings at Bryce National Park, Zion National Park and on the north rim of the Grand Canyon (where extreme fire danger caused officials to ban campfires beginning in mid-May). "These are areas where we don't have a lot of rooms," said Ms. Lages. She advised would-be visitors who find themselves unable to book to keep trying, particularly this summer, because blocks of rooms can become available when wholesalers who deal with European customers cancel bookings, typically one month in advance.
Glacier Park Inc., which operates seven hotels and lodges in and around Glacier National Park, is experiencing a similar trend. "The properties that fill up first are Lake McDonald Lodge and Many Glacier Hotel," said Jan Ek, the company's president and general manager. "If you haven't made your reservations there by now, you probably will have to adjust your dates if you want a room. But our other properties have openings throughout the summer." Information: (406) 756-2444 or www.glacierparkinc.com.
There is also space available at all of the three lodging concessions operated by the Grand Teton Lodge Company, (800) 628-9988; www.gtlc.com. "Normally during the months of July and August we sell out," said Lisa Bishop, director of sales and marketing, who added that bookings were running 6 percent behind last year. "After Sept. 11, we have found that people are booking accommodations a lot closer to the date of travel, 30 to 45 days out, where it used to be 60 or 90." 
Demand is usually strongest for high-end rooms at Jackson Lake Lodge ($220 a night double occupancy) and Jenny Lake Lodge ($429 a night double occupancy, which includes riding, breakfast and a five-course dinner). But this year, Ms. Bishop said, the more economical cabins, tent-cabins and recreational-vehicle sites at the company's Colter Bay Village are selling out first.

More Regional Visitors
Park lodging operators in the East also expect visitors from that region to predominate this summer.
"It's the visitor who only needs one tank of gas to get here," said Clare Wood, executive director of the Bar Harbor Chamber of Commerce, which represents 140 lodging establishments near Acadia National Park in Maine, on the Web at www.barharbor.org. "There's plenty of space available."
Within a day's drive of nearly one-third of the American population, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, with nine million visitors a year, is used by more people than any other national park. "Summer is always crowded here," said Nancy Gray, a park spokeswoman at Great Smoky. "But we still have some vacancies at our campgrounds. If you wait until just before a busy weekend, it might be difficult to secure camping. Otherwise space should be available." Ms. Gray points out that the three main park entrances are at Gatlinburg and Townsend, Tenn., and Cherokee, N.C. To avoid the hurly-burly of the summer crowds, she says, visitors might head for more remote areas like Look Rock in Tennessee, or Fontana, N.C. 
Mr. Gaumer of the National Park Service expects that the busiest parks and monuments this summer will be those that have patriotic connotations. "Places like Yorktown, Valley Forge, Gettysburg," he said.
At Mount Rushmore National Memorial, visits are already up this year by more than 30 percent. "If it continues, it will be a blockbuster summer for tourism in the area," said Mike Pflaum, chief ranger at Mount Rushmore. "But our facilities will be able to handle the influx." 
Although there seem to be plenty of vacant rooms and campsites in the national parks this summer, visitors who want a specific room or site might be well advised to do as the park operators do. "We are going to be heading out on a little trip to the coast to see the redwoods," said Ms. Jones of Thunderbird Lodge. "Everyone had space. But we reserved anyway."

HEADLINE: Where Do Babies Come From? 

BYLINE:  By Sara Corbett; Sara Corbett is a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine.

 BODY:
Outside Phnom Penh, along a road running west to Cambodia's more rural provinces, sits an orphanage. It was built on a defunct rice paddy and caters exclusively to Americans wishing to adopt children. To get there, would-be parents travel from the city in air-conditioned cars with hired Cambodian drivers, passing windowless garment factories and the shanty settlements that have grown up to house thousands of workers. They pass legless land-mine victims begging money and old women wheeling carts of coconuts in the stultifying sun.
 Finally, they turn down a narrow washboard lane, which runs through a village and past a small Buddhist wat, or temple. Occasionally, the rice farmers look up from their work to watch the cars as they rise like apparitions from the dust -- white faces peering expectantly from the back seats -- and then disappear again, headed toward the orphanage. The moment is one of mutual disorientation. 
 Until recently, the cars seemed always to come -- sometimes once a week but increasingly more like once a day, as greater numbers of Americans arrived from half a world away, their bags stuffed with Baby Gap clothing and Whoozit toys, their hearts piloted by no more than a passport photo of a Cambodian child sent months earlier. If the United States is seen as the world's great exporter -- of culture, of goods, of ideology -- then this must count as an unlikely pilgrim's route. 
At the end of the road, there are roughly 150 children housed at a place called the Asian Orphan Association, a collection of aluminum-roofed buildings sparsely shaded by coconut palms. They eat mainly rice porridge and sleep on straw mats spread across the floor, tended by nannies fanning themselves languidly in the humid air. Mosquitoes float in clouds. The infants fill two rooms the size of a convention hall, sprawled in bamboo baby baskets that hang from the ceiling, floating like human pendants above a gleaming tile floor. Nearby, a group of 5- and 6-year-olds dressed in Green Bay Packers jerseys and cotton jumpers sit raptly before a Khmer soap opera playing on a small television set.
But whereas the children were once leaving, whereas adoptive parents used to show up for the sweet awkwardness of having a baby placed in their arms for the first time, the adoptions have now stopped. This orphanage, along with 15 others that work with American adoption agencies, has become the focus of a U.S. investigation of adoption practices in Cambodia, one that questions whether adoption has morphed from an altruistic pursuit into a highly lucrative industry. If the U.S. government worries that these children have become commodities in a twisted free market, adoptive parents tend to view them as needy orphans robbed of the opportunity for a better life.
Harder, perhaps, to know are the hearts of the Cambodian people. Decades of political upheaval -- including the dictator Pol Pot's genocide of three million Cambodians in the mid-70's -- have left the country crippled by epidemic levels of AIDS and tuberculosis and mired in poverty that is virtually unimaginable to an American mind. Meanwhile, fertility rates are among the highest in Southeast Asia. There are Cambodians who will crowd a baby stroller pushed by American parents and stroke the cheek of the adopted child inside, lending tacit approval. "Lucky baby," they will say in Khmer. "Lucky baby." There are others who pointedly avert their gaze.
In the village near the orphanage, the faces of the rice farmers betray nothing, glancing up as they do when another car heads back down the dusty road toward Phnom Penh. For a Cambodian living on less than a dollar a day, there is no conjuring an orphan's journey from straw mat and daily porridge to a lovingly painted nursery and organic squash dished up in suburban Boston. And for the Americans sitting in the back seat, holding a child who has arrived in their laps with virtually no history, no hint of parentage nor of what fate or ill circumstance may have brought him or her to this unlikely moment, for these new parents the child is its own mystery.
Visiting Cambodia earlier this spring, I met a newly adopted baby named Rachel Chronister. She was an ethereal-looking 8-month-old with charcoal eyes and wisps of dark hair and was, at the time, living in a high-rise apartment in Phnom Penh with her adoptive American parents, Christina and Ben Chronister, and their two biological children, ages 5 and 6. The Chronisters started the adoption process last summer, were matched with Rachel in October and were told by their adoption agency that she would be living with them in their Seattle-area home by Christmastime.
But in the fall, consular officers at the U.S. Embassy began flagging what they considered to be fraudulent documents coming from several orphanages, including the Asian Orphan Association, where Rachel was living. Consequently, the issuing of visas to U.S.-bound orphans ground nearly to a halt. On Dec. 21, James Ziglar, commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, formally suspended new visa processing for adopted children in Cambodia, citing suspicions that they were being bought or stolen from their parents and put into orphanages with false paperwork in order to feed the growing American demand for babies. "Documents didn't match up; signatures were forged," says Bill Strassberger, an I.N.S. spokesman. "The paperwork would say babies had been abandoned in a certain village, and then an investigation would show that no baby had been abandoned in that place for years."
This marks the first time the U.S. government has stopped processing orphan visas in a foreign country, apparently because it seemed unlikely the Cambodian government would take action. While Cambodia, which began allowing foreign adoption in 1989, is now cooperating with the investigation, the country previously had done little to combat child trafficking.
When the United States announced its moratorium, Christina and Ben Chronister were one of an estimated 400 families caught with adoptions in midprocess. And as the U.S. government pledged to conduct a "special humanitarian initiative," sending a task force consisting of American and Cambodian officials to each orphanage in order to review pending cases individually, the Chronisters and a handful of other eager parents had flown to Phnom Penh to wait. The Cambodian government had already sent them an official "adoption decree," which allowed them legally to pick up their children, but without I.N.S. approval they could not bring them home. When I first encountered the Chronisters in March, they had been in Cambodia for several weeks and were growing increasingly impatient for news that Rachel's case had been cleared. "All we want," Christina said dolefully, sitting by the apartment building's small pool one afternoon, "is to bring our family home."
For Christina, who had grown up with two adopted Asian-American sisters, Rachel's adoption felt like a natural way to complete the family. She and Ben originally sought to adopt a child from China, but learning that it would take more than a year, they turned instead to Cambodia. Over the last several years, Cambodia's popularity with Americans looking to adopt has skyrocketed. According to the U.S. State Department, applications leapt from 249 in 1998 to about 100 a month in the summer of 2001. The growth mirrors a larger boom in international adoptions, and the increase in Cambodia most likely has to do with the fact that parents adopting there normally have a child in their arms within three to six months of completing their agency paperwork -- a boon compared with the 12 or more months parents spend waiting for most foreign and stateside adoptions to be completed. 
Kent M. Wiedemann, who until last month was the U.S. ambassador to Cambodia, says that the growing interest in Cambodian adoptions has resulted in new orphanages built expressly to keep the parade of Americans happy and that, more worryingly, these orphanages are filled with children who seem custom-ordered to suit American tastes. In the words of one aid worker, it is the "cute and cuddlies" who drive the adoption business, meaning the children who are healthy, young and preferably female. While there are no statistics on the age and sex of children sent to the United States, agency workers say that parents request girls over boys by a margin of four to one and that the demand for infants is great. 
Our adoptive preferences have not been lost on aspiring capitalists. Two years ago, when an American nonprofit group, the Sharing Foundation, opened a state-of-the-art orphanage called Roteang not far from Phnom Penh, the entrepreneurs emerged from the woodwork. "Cambodians would come to the gate and say, 'Baby girl . . . $200,"' says Nancy Hendrie, a pediatrician from Boston and the foundation's director. She is quick to add that once orphanage employees turned down these initial offers, the baby sellers stopped coming. "But someone, obviously, had given them the impression that Americans pay for babies," she says.
Americans do indeed pay to adopt babies, but the money train is expected to stop short of rewarding birth parents or anyone who might profit from delivering a baby to an orphanage. Instead, adoptive parents pay agencies anywhere from $13,000 to $20,000. The agencies then contract with people known as "adoption facilitators," who work on the ground in Cambodia handling everything from finding children to pushing adoption paperwork through the requisite government ministries, passing out a commonly acknowledged bundle of bribes along the way. According to agency directors, a facilitator's fee can account for up to $9,000 of an adoption's total expense -- money that is wired directly into a facilitator's private bank account or delivered in cash by adopting parents upon their arrival in Cambodia. How this money is used is indeterminate: some portion covers orphanage overhead, some offsets the facilitator's expenses and much of it, I.N.S. investigators say, is raw profit.
According to one of Cambodia's largest human rights organizations, the League for the Defense and Promotion of Human Rights (Licadho), the moneymaking potential in foreign adoptions is so great that it has inspired a network of unofficial "recruiters" who scour neighborhoods in search of young children, often plying birth mothers with lies or false promises in addition to cash in order to get them to turn over their children. Licadho alleges that the recruiters are paid off by facilitators or orphanage directors, who then bribe low-level government officials to create phony paperwork that can be submitted for adoption processing. Along the way, a child is, in effect, laundered -- moved into an orphanage with no true record of his or her birthplace or parents, rendering the child untraceable. "If a birth mother goes looking for her child," says Naly Pilorge, the deputy director of Licadho, "he or she is practically impossible to find."
Christina Chronister has heard Licadho's claims and says she believes they are exaggerated. She is quick to defend the Asian Orphan Association and its director, an affable Cambodian man named Serey Puth, who facilitated Rachel's adoption and whose orphanage work, says Chronister, is motivated by love for children. One muggy morning this spring, she and I went to visit Puth, 43, who speaks fluent English and in addition to overseeing the orphanage operates a successful import operation in Phnom Penh. Puth is one of seven adoption facilitators working in Cambodia -- three of them are American women; the rest are Cambodian men -- and by most accounts, they are a highly competitive lot. While some, like Puth, maintain their own orphanages, others contract with state-run or private facilities to place children with adoptive parents. 
As facilitators go, Puth was in the enviable position of having a host of especially adoptable children at his disposal. According to a chart in the office, girls outnumbered boys 95 to 62, and the majority of the orphanage's children were under a year old. Twenty-eight of the 157 children already had adoptive parents waiting for them in the States. Christina Chronister had come primarily to take photos of these children, which she planned to e-mail back to a group of waiting parents she met through online groups concerned with Cambodian adoption. It was hard not to be moved by the sight of her, a hazel-eyed, ponytailed woman of 30, making her way through the orphanage's cavernous rooms, snapping photographs. "Your mommy loves you," she would say, bending to touch a baby's shoulder. Sometimes, she would wrap her arms around a child and squeeze tightly, as if to administer a transcontinental dose of love.
A few of the orphanage's children had obvious disabilities -- there was a 1-year-old girl with a head tumor; a boy with a cleft palate -- but their overall health bore stark contrast to the images I would take away from my visit a few days later to the Nutrition Center, a large orphanage in central Phnom Penh. There, I would see babies with bodies whittled so thin by AIDS that they hardly resembled babies, as well as entire rooms filled with 7- and 8-year-old children whose palsied limbs and vacant expressions bespoke a bleak future. Touring Puth's orphanage was a decidedly less provocative experience, one more tailored to the feel-good part of adoption in which we might congratulate ourselves for giving a child a better life without the burden of feeling guilty about more needy children being left behind. 
Licadho claims that in order to maintain the appearance of propriety, some orphanages will keep a respectable number of older and disabled children while maintaining what Nancy Hendrie calls a "side stash" of infants elsewhere -- including in houses that also operate as storefronts for purchasing children. Last September, under pressure from Licadho, the police in Phnom Penh raided two such houses after being tipped off by a Cambodian woman who claimed she had sold her two children. Police officers discovered 10 babies and two older children there and took four adults into custody under suspicion of child trafficking. Two of the children were promptly hospitalized.
The following day, Serey Puth produced documents stating that the 12 children were registered at his orphanage and that he had been paying for their care. While human rights workers say they believe the houses were merely way stations for children who had been bought from birth parents and would soon be placed for adoption through orphanages, Puth insists the opposite. He had brought the children from the orphanage to one of the houses, he says, believing it to be a medical clinic. (He did admit to me, however, that he wasn't sure whether the woman running the clinic was in fact a doctor.) Early this year, charges against the four people connected to the houses were dropped after several key witnesses suddenly -- and suspiciously, say embassy officials -- recanted their testimony. Puth himself was not charged. He denies any wrongdoing. "I have never paid for a child," he says.
When I went looking for the house Puth had called a clinic, I found it padlocked and shuttered. It was located on a garbage-strewn dirt avenue in one of the city's poorer corners, a section of the Tuol Kok district known as Construction Area 12. Inside the house next door, a round-faced woman sat on a hammock, nursing her year-old son. Speaking through a translator, she said that the supposed clinic had operated for about a year leading up to the raid, run by a Cambodian woman and a nanny, and had been filled with small children. She seemed genuinely concerned. And her characterization was consistent with police reports regarding the raid. "Mothers brought them here to sell," she said. "They were very poor. A boy was $150; a girl was $180." (In Cambodia, the dollar is the currency of choice in any big-ticket transaction.) Periodically, a man came and took the children away, to a place she called a "child center." She declined to give her name, saying she feared for her safety. "This is a very bad business," the woman said finally. "They lie to people, and tell them if they give their children away, they will get money from abroad."
The act of adoption is, at its best, one motivated by equal parts compassion and need. Historically, Americans have adopted children left parentless by war: 8,000 Japanese and European orphans were adopted in the late 1940's; thousands more came from Korea a decade later. Since then, adoption agencies have launched programs everywhere from Azerbaijan to Sierra Leone. According to State Department figures, the number of international adoptions in the last decade has doubled, with a record 19,237 children granted orphan visas last year.
Domestic adoptions still outnumber international ones, but that margin appears to be quickly closing. Like Cambodia, the United States has no shortage of adoptable children: it is just that most of them are over the age of 5 and living in foster care. There is also the little-discussed issue of race: white infants make up the minority of available children but also are the most requested. In addition, the growing movement toward "open adoption" in this country allows for varying degrees of information and contact between birth parents and adoptive parents. This, coupled with the specter of several high-profile court cases in which biological parents have successfully reclaimed their children after years of separation, can intimidate potential adopters. "I was terrified of hooking up with a birth mother who would change her mind, even if there was only a small chance of it happening," says an Oregon mother, describing her decision to adopt from Cambodia instead of domestically.
In this respect, international adoption appears to be more straightforward and decidedly more anonymous, though the situation in Cambodia and other countries suggests that adoption, in any setting, is irrefutably complicated. "People go overseas to adopt because there's no legal risk regarding birth parents," says Samuel C. Totaro, a Pennsylvania attorney specializing in adoption. "Those parents' legal rights have been all but terminated."
Every year, thousands of international adoptions are conducted legitimately, though the possibilities for exploitation always exist. As prospective parents spell out their wishes and adoption agencies work to meet them, the quest to find the youngest children and the quickest turnaround often leads to less-developed countries, where regulations surrounding adoption tend to be loose and the amount of money involved can be dazzlingly influential. A team of U.S. government researchers reported last year that "almost every discussion we had of adoption in Romania involved the use of commercial terms, terms such as 'auction' and 'market' and 'price."' (The Romanian government has since suspended adoptions.) Similar problems exist in Guatemala, and in the last few years, child-smuggling rings geared toward adoption have been broken up everywhere from Vietnam to Cyprus to Mexico.
Mary Lib Mooney, director of the National Association of Ethical Adoption Professionals, blames the large number of U.S. agencies using freelance facilitators, who operate on commission, rather than salaried staff members to locate adoptable children in foreign countries for the cycle of corruption. "They go to these countries, and they hire any Tom, Dick or Harry," she says. "Whether it's the trash man or a schoolteacher, they hire whoever can get the most babies for them. It's money, money, money."
The agencies I spoke with claimed to do their best to check out the facilitators' backgrounds, but they admitted that hard information can be difficult to come by. Wide Horizons for Children, an agency that makes 500 adoption placements a year, has used Serey Puth as its facilitator for about a year, paying him $6,900 for each child placed. And while the agency divorced itself from another facilitator working in the Republic of Georgia because of questionable ethics, it remains supportive of Puth. "I'm not a detective," says Vicki Peterson, executive director of Wide Horizons. "Until I see some real evidence that he's involved in a way that's inappropriate, I'm not in a position to feel that we shouldn't be working with him." Anne Polasko, who runs the Asia program for a Maryland agency called Adoptions Together, traveled to Cambodia in December to establish a program there, but she "didn't have a good feeling" about the facilitator she had planned to hire. "It really is hard to know who you're dealing with over there," Polasko says.
In Cambodia, there is no centralized registry for births and deaths. Record-keeping is done at the village level, if at all, and children do not generally receive birth certificates unless they are being considered for adoption. Because of a complex set of statutes in U.S. immigration law, children who are abandoned -- as opposed to delivered to an orphanage by their parents -- tend to have an easier time meeting requirements for an orphan visa. By the time an application reaches the U.S. Embassy for processing, a child's birth history more often than not has been entirely erased.
According to her documents, the Chronisters' little girl, Rachel, had spent the first part of her life named Suorsdey Rath. (Suorsdey loosely translates to "hello." Rath, the Khmer word for "ward of the state," appears in many adopted children's names.) She arrived at the orphanage when she was about 5 days old. On the morning Christina and I visited, Serey Puth pulled Rachel's dossier from the drawer of a shiny file cabinet where he keeps the orphans' records. It was, as most orphanage files are, only a few pages long, containing a brief medical history and a single sheet written in Khmer, saying that she was born on June 26, 2001, and had been abandoned on July 1 in a village called Cheng Meng. There was a request for the orphanage "to kindly accept" the baby, signed by the village chief and notarized. Upon her arrival at the orphanage, Rath had been issued a birth certificate. With no information to work with, Puth says that he guessed at the infant's birth date. In the spaces provided for the names of her birth mother and father, he had written in "Unknown." After a mandatory 90-day waiting period, he alerted an adoption agency that she had become available. Twelve days after that, Suorsdey Rath was offered to the Chronisters.
For Christina, our meeting with Puth was a chance to fill in some of the informational holes in her daughter's documents. "Who named her?" she asked.
"The village chief," Puth said.
"Where is this village?"
"Oh, maybe two kilometers from here." 
When I asked for directions to the village, Puth insisted on coming along. Soon, we were sitting in the two-room concrete home belonging to the chief of the rice-farming village. He was a heavy-lidded, Buddha-bellied man named Phon Phorn, who greeted us stoically after we woke him from a midday nap. Any time a pedestrian or motorbike passed down the single-lane dirt track that served as the village's thoroughfare, Phorn leaned forward in his chair like a watchful troll. As chief of Cheng Meng, a community of 182 families, he served primarily as arbiter in local land disputes. Speaking through a translator and with Serey Puth listening carefully from a nearby seat, Phorn told us that he had been finding two or three abandoned babies a month, sometimes more. He shook his head sadly. "There are a lot of country people working in the garment factories," he said. "Unmarried women get pregnant, and they are afraid to go home to their villages. Maybe they know this is a safe place to leave the children."
If birth parents knew Phorn's village as a friendly place to abandon infants, then word curiously seemed to have spread, following the U.S. adoption suspension, that the Asian Orphan Association was no longer accepting children. Cheng Meng's last orphan, Phorn said, was abandoned early last July. All things being accurate, that orphan would have been Suorsdey Rath, the Chronisters' daughter. The news caused Christina to sit up in her seat, realizing that Phorn remembered the girl, that this unexpressive village chief offered a gossamer line into the clouds of her daughter's past.
"Why did you name her Suorsdey?" she asked.
The chief allowed himself a smile. "It's a happy name," he said.
"Where did you find her?"
He would show us.
And so it was that we ended up on a dusty corner of red earth where Cheng Meng's two roads bisect and where the village office, a pitch-roofed building with a community water pump, sits behind barbed wire. Phorn gestured to a patch of ground littered with palm husks next to a wooden fence post, a few feet from the intersection. "Here," he said. "This is where they leave the babies." He added that the infants are usually left early in the morning and that he hears their cries from his office, about 30 yards away. When I asked if he has caught a glimpse of a person or a car, or if a parent ever simply brings the child to his door, his answer was unequivocal: "Never."
It seemed possible that Phorn had been coached on this answer. Serey Puth also claims that in three years of running one of the area's largest orphanages, he has never met an infant's birth parent. Given that the U.S. investigation is centered on possible monetary transactions between birth parents and adoption facilitators or their associates, the safest answer may be to deny any interaction with birth parents whatsoever. Licadho suspects that a good number of the orphanage's children never passed through Cheng Meng at all, but rather came from other sources. A village chief, the group suggests, might be paid to provide paperwork stating that he discovered an infant abandoned in his village. (I.N.S. investigators claim, for example, that Phon Phorn's wife told them there hadn't been an infant found there for years.)
Nancy Hendrie, the American doctor who oversees the Roteang orphanage, says that desperate birth parents are seldom anonymous, that fathers or relatives routinely deliver children directly to her orphanage or give them to its staff nannies when they are visiting their home villages. The Roteang orphanage, she claims, has records on the birth parents of all but one of its 77 children, though it submits the requisite "abandonment" documents to the U.S. and Cambodian governments in order to get adoptions approved. While she regrets the duplicity, Hendrie scoffs at Puth's assertion that the majority of his orphanage's children are found in Cheng Meng and another neighboring village. "Cambodian people are not heartless," she says. "They don't leave newborn children lying by the side of the road."
At the fence post, Christina Chronister spent a long moment staring at the desolate corner as the sun beat down on the dry rice fields around her. She took a few pictures of the spot for Rachel's scrapbook, then put the camera away and squinted again at the ground. Had her daughter been left here last July, the height of the rainy season, approximately 5 days old and, as Phorn recalled, wrapped in a piece of cloth? It seemed impossibly possible. Who knew what the circumstances were? What American could even begin to imagine?
I asked Christina what she would tell Rachel someday about the invisible birth parents and the village fence post. She said: "I'll tell her everything I know. I'll tell her it was a quiet corner close to a good orphanage. Somebody cared enough to bring her here." She looked around one last time before beginning to walk away. "I see it as an act of love." 
Not long after my visit to the fence post, I spent some time with a 3-year-old girl named Narak Den, a moon-faced child with silky cropped hair and attentive brown eyes. She was born in 1999 and lived with her mother and younger brother in a densely populated settlement west of Phnom Penh until she was 2 -- at which point her mother, who was hungry, pregnant again and having trouble affording rent, decided to sell her. Den's mother had heard about a place, a medical clinic of sorts in the Toul Kok district of Phnom Penh, where you could take a child, and so that's what she did. She was given $50 and promised another $100 in a week.
I was told this story by the child's 51-year-old aunt, Narin Keo, one humid evening this spring as we sat cross-legged in her two-room, tin-roofed shack on the outskirts of Phnom Penh. The day's last light was fading, and so we talked in the gathering darkness, surrounded by Keo's own three children and her elderly mother. On the floor, several emaciated kittens pranced playfully in and out of a small basket. The 3-year-old, Den, sat quietly by her aunt's feet, dressed in purple shorts and a shirt with puppy dogs.
"When she told me she sold her baby," Keo said through a translator, "I could not do anything but cry." She added that she persuaded her younger sister to reveal the child's whereabouts by threatening her with a stick. And when she implored her sister to return the money in exchange for Den, who had been gone two days at that point, her sister confessed that she had already spent half of it. Keo, who is divorced and unemployed, then borrowed 100,000 Cambodian riel (about $50) from a neighbor, agreeing to pay 25 percent interest monthly.
It was Keo's 22-year-old daughter, a garment worker named Marida Kong, who followed the mother's directions to an unmarked clinic in Construction Area 12 -- a place she would later recognize in the newspapers as the site of the September police raid -- and asked for the child back. She brought a police officer with her for good measure and was nonetheless met with reluctance by the man and woman who appeared to be running the clinic. "They told me that this baby was bought for adoption for foreigners," Kong said that night. "They showed me a file written in English." When Kong persisted, the couple finally relented. Kong says that she paid $50, and Den was returned to her, wearing a yellow paper bracelet that indicated she was scheduled to be moved from the clinic the next day.
Den now lives with her aunt, grandmother and cousins, the six of them supported by Kong's garment-factory wages of between $40 and $70 a month, depending on how much work is available. The family struggles with the never-diminishing high-interest loan it took to remove Den from the Toul Kok clinic. Last year, Den's mother moved to the countryside, but not before she sold Den's brother, a year-old boy, to the same clinic. Keo explained this apologetically, saying they had no money to go looking for him. "I tried to stop her," she said. "We don't know where that baby boy has gone."
According to Keo, her sister was told that when her son was adopted, his new parents would send money from abroad. Since then, the mother has heard no news.
I had a number of conversations with families like Keo's who said they had sold, or been approached to sell, their children. One woman, Bopha Meas, claimed that several years ago an American facilitator named Lauryn Galindo offered to place her three children in an orphanage. She suggested that Meas could not possibly care for them on her own and showed her a picture of a well-fed American couple holding a Cambodian baby -- proof, it would seem, of some better alternative. According to Meas, Galindo said she would give her $700, an offer Meas declined. Galindo, who has facilitated more than 400 Cambodian adoptions, acknowledged meeting with Meas but denied offering to buy the children. "There's absolutely no truth to that allegation," she said. 
Another woman wept on the phone from her home in a rural province, begging me -- through a translator -- to find her 5-year-old son, Rasme Hang, who she had relinquished in exchange for $100 when he was 8 months old, having been told that he would go to the United States and that the adoptive parents would send photos. "I want to know he's O.K.," she said. 
Finally, there was Chanthea Chea, a 31-year-old sturdily built woman whose hair hung in a ponytail down her back. Her husband divorced her last year when she was six months pregnant. Three days after her baby son was born in June, she was approached by a neighbor. "He said, 'Ah sister, if you have problems feeding your child because he has no father, I think you should send him to an orphanage where they raise children,"' she recalled. Chea, who was exhausted and hungry after birth and could not continue her job farming mushrooms, said that she would think about it. The following day, the man resurfaced with two women who claimed to represent an aid organization helping women and children. 
Chea allowed her neighbor and the two women to take her infant son for a medical exam with the promise that they would return with him in an hour or two. But the boy never came back. Instead, Chea said that her neighbor took her to a house in Construction Area 12, near the clinic that was later raided. The two supposed aid workers pushed her to sign papers, relinquishing her son. "I asked them where my child was, and they said they already sent him to the orphanage," Chea said. After sitting at a table for two hours, feeling hopeless, Chea agreed to turn over her son to an unnamed orphanage with the understanding that she could visit him there once a week. There was no talk, she said, of adoption. The women gave her an $80 "donation" and told her she would receive an additional $30 a month as she recovered from the birth.
That night, Chea had a change of heart. "I went back to my house," she told me. "I could not sleep. I was weeping. In the morning, I brought the money back, but they said in order to get my child back I must pay $160. That night I lit a joss stick and candle and prayed for my child to come back to me." Chea said that she returned to the clinic several times over the next month, asking to see her son, but each time was turned away. At one point, Chea said she was given a passport-size photo of her son to assure her of his well-being. 
When news of the police raid broke in early September, Chea sought the help of Licadho, the human rights group. The boy turned up in the custody of an organization run by an adoption facilitator named Sea Visoth, who, like Puth, works with American agencies. (Visoth could not be reached for comment.) Chea took the case to court, and after she accurately described her son's birthmarks to a judge in November, the boy was returned to her. "I was separated from my child for almost four months," she told me. "When I met him again, I almost couldn't breathe." Meanwhile, three people -- Chea's neighbor and the two women who paid her for the child, one of whom, according to court officials, is Sea Visoth's wife -- have been charged with human trafficking but have yet to be prosecuted. Sea Visoth was not charged.
Not long after Chea's court date, the U.S. Embassy produced an identical copy of the boy's passport photo, which had been included in an adoption application. The paperwork -- signed by the director of a state-run orphanage in a rural province far from where Chea had relinquished her son -- claimed the boy's name was Borin Rath and that he had been "abandoned and picked up by a kind person" before being dropped off at the orphanage on June 15. According to the embassy, Borin Rath had been matched with a couple in Maryland and his adoption was in the "final stages" of processing. Chea said she has since given the boy a name of her own -- Sak Kada -- meaning "strong spirit and good luck." Embassy officials say the family in Maryland has been matched with another child. 
Adoptive American parents like to call attention to the paradoxes of their situation, especially in the increasingly complex skein of reproductive politics. "The government's holding up my adoption because maybe somebody gave the birth mother $25?" asked Janice Corkery, an Atlanta woman who was in Phnom Penh adopting Cambodian twins. "I did in-vitro and paid someone for her eggs! Isn't that baby-buying?" Others make the point that privately arranged adoptions in the United States often require adoptive parents to pay a birth mother's medical and living expenses -- up to tens of thousands of dollars -- during and after pregnancy. In a country like Cambodia, where thousands of children die of malnutrition or disease each year and even more children fuel a booming sex trade, there are those who question the harm in giving a birth parent some money so that she can properly look after the rest of her family.
Yet the experience of someone like Chanthea Chea, whose poverty and relative powerlessness appear to have been aptly exploited, seems to offer a cautionary tale about what happens when first-world money flows into third-world adoption. Narin Keo, the aunt who went into debt to buy back her sister's child, says her sister was unduly influenced by the offer of money. "If no money was involved," she said, "she wouldn't have given up her babies." As far as she was concerned, the promise of a better life in the United States should not eclipse love, even when staying in Cambodia means inevitable hardship. "I understand they have food over there, but I would not feel calm if I could not see my niece," Keo said. Finally, she reiterated her disgust for what her sister had done -- and possibly for the impression it created about Cambodian women and their children. "Being a mother is important," she said that night as I took leave of the small, unlighted shack she shared with her family. She gestured to the half-starved kittens, now curled in the shadows next to their mother. "Even an animal," Keo said, "takes care of its children."
When is an orphan no longer an orphan? Christina Chronister says she feels that Suorsdey Rath became her daughter in October, when an adoption agency employee e-mailed the child's name and photo in what is commonly called a "referral." From that day on, Chronister says, it became painful to imagine the girl sitting parentless in an orphanage. 
While the Chronisters went to Phnom Penh, other waiting adoptive families have had little choice but to maintain their vigils at home, photos of Cambodian children stuck uselessly to the refrigerator. In the eyes of the U.S. government, however, an agency referral has virtually no meaning: a child is not formally adopted until both the Cambodian and U.S. governments have signed off on the process. This kind of appraisal infuriates prospective parents, who accuse the I.N.S. and the U.S. Embassy of viewing their situation heartlessly. In recent months, families waiting to adopt from Cambodia have engaged in a passionate letter-writing campaign to Congress. They have picketed the I.N.S. building in Washington, toting posters that bear the plaintive faces of orphanage children, emblazoned with slogans like "The Only Family That Wants Me Is in the U.S."
Few seem willing to consider the government's assertion that some of these children may have been bought or that birth parents could have been intentionally misled. At the very least, many insist that shady practices are sporadic rather than systemic and that a shutdown of adoption is unwarranted. Most remain convinced that their particular agencies, facilitators and orphanages are not suspect. Adoption agencies appear even less capable of self-examination. I talked to a number of agency representatives who extolled their own virtues while happily smearing their competitors with off-the-record tales of underhanded behavior, particularly on the part of rival agencies' facilitators. "For my money, there's not an entirely reliable facilitator out there," Ambassador Kent Wiedemann says. "We don't trust any of them."
All this leaves adoptive parents in a particularly tough spot, often consumed by their wish for a child and left with spotty information not just about the people and process involved but also about the child they have chosen to adopt. Last spring, a woman named Dale Edmonds traveled to Phnom Penh to pick up two siblings -- an 18-month-old boy and a 6-year-old girl -- she was adopting using the services of an American facilitator named Harriet Brener-Sam. Once home, Edmonds, a native of New Zealand living in Singapore, learned enough Khmer to converse with her adopted daughter. Her daughter claimed to be 11 years old and not 6. She also said that she and her brother had been born with names different from those given to Edmonds and had been instructed not to discuss their history. More alarmingly, Edmonds says Brener-Sam told her that her children's birth mother had died in a rural province, when in fact her daughter insisted her birth mother was living in Phnom Penh. Edmonds returned with her children to Cambodia late in the fall and was able to locate their mother and another sister. 
Edmonds will not discuss the birth mother's circumstances, saying it would violate her children's privacy, but she says the birth family was repeatedly denied access to the children during their eight-month stay in an orphanage. The birth mother did not object to the sibblings' move to Singapore, and Edmonds and her husband have now, at the mother's request, adopted her other daughter. What matters most, Edmonds says, is that her Cambodian-born children were stripped of their names and histories and essentially hidden from their birth family. "I wanted to think our adoption was ethical," she says. "It hurt bitterly to have those beliefs challenged." (Harriet Brener-Sam declined to comment on Edmonds's account.)
Other parents say they will wait for the I.N.S. to produce credible proof before accepting the U.S. government's allegations. "The only way I would ever return Isaac is if his birth mother came forward and could prove he was hers," said Dawn Smith, an Indiana mother who spent three months in Phnom Penh before being cleared to take her son home in May. She pointed out that since the United States suspended adoptions, Cambodian birth parents have not exactly lined up to reclaim their children. "Even if the government proves these children were trafficked," Smith said, "they're still going to sit in orphanages."
And life in a third-world orphanage can be demonstrably cruel. A Missouri couple who received an agency referral in September stood by from a distance of 12,000 miles as their 10-month-old adoptive daughter struggled with pneumonia. A boy destined for Ohio came down with malaria, and just before Christmas, an infant named Tia, who had been matched with a family in Florida since October, died at her Phnom Penh orphanage.
In the meantime, since the December shutdown, the I.N.S. has cleared 141 children for adoption. But it is proceeding with a criminal investigation that could involve charges against citizens of both Cambodia and the United States, though the agency will not discuss its progress. Strassberger, the I.N.S. spokesman, concedes that it is difficult to conclusively establish that a child has been trafficked, given the poor record-keeping and endemic corruption in Cambodia. "We know that something is not right, but because we can't prove it in U.S. courts under the U.S. systems of justice, we have no choice but to approve an application and allow the child to come in as an orphan," he says.
As a result, the United States plans to continue its moratorium on new adoptions until the Cambodian government passes legislation intended to eliminate child trafficking. Until it does, hundreds of legitimately parentless children will collect in orphanages around Cambodia, growing older without a family.
This thought keeps Christina Chronister up at night, despite the fact that Rachel's adoption was cleared by I.N.S. in late April. The family flew home immediately and was greeted by a group of friends at the airport in Seattle. But Christina still spends hours corresponding with fellow adoptive parents, many of whom continue to hope for I.N.S. approval. The children at the orphanage at the end of the dusty road, she says, live quietly at the back of her mind. There is Piseth, a chubby 3-year-old who tumbled around the toddler area. There is Chan Thol, a little girl not much older than Rachel, whose adoptive family waits in Missouri, and Saran, a sad-eyed 7-year-old boy who once he turns 8 will no longer be eligible for adoption under Cambodian law. Rachel herself will celebrate her first birthday with a big party at the end of this month, a happy baby surrounded by her American family in a comfortable suburb, the mysteries of her past remaining just that.

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 6-16-02: ON LANGUAGE; 
Goodnesss Gracious!

BYLINE:  By William Safire 

 BODY:
Donald Rumsfeld is what used to be called a "man's man." He is tough-minded, direct, virile, authoritative and sure of himself. As head of the Cost of Living Council in the early 70's, the designated inflation-fighter kept a tight lid on wages and prices and taught his deputy, a kid named Dick Cheney, how to crack the whip. He ran a tight White House as President Ford's chief of staff and later, in the business world, was named one of the 10 toughest executives by Fortune magazine. He is again secretary of defense, and woe betide the brass hat who tries an end run to lobby for a favored weapon.
 If he's so macho, then how come the phrase that comes most frequently to his lips -- the words heard most often at his high-powered news conferences -- is the sort of exclamation heard on "The Golden Girls"? In the height of dudgeon, professing shock just short of horror, Rumsfeld can be heard with his grandmotherly trademark: "My goodness gracious!" 
 To NBC's Tom Brokaw, who asked about the pace of the attack on Afghanistan, the square-jawed SecDef retorted, "To hear your question and the urgency and 'Don't you need quick success?' -- my goodness gracious! go back to World War II." (Brokaw has done very well going back to World War II.) This was using the phrase as a straight interjection. Rumsfeld also uses it in an adverbial form modifying an affirmative. Asked if he wanted Osama bin Laden dead, he answered, "Oh, my goodness gracious, yes, after what he's done?" adding for emphasis, "You bet your life."
According to the spouse of a senior administration official, speaking at poolside on condition of anonymity, Rummy began using my goodness gracious at New Treir High School in Winnetka, Ill., where he first met his wife, Joyce, and continues to use it in expostulations at home.
What does it mean? What did Charles Dickens have in mind when he had a character in his 1841 "Barnaby Rudge" exclaim, "Goodness gracious me!"?
Goodness is a frequent euphemism for God, a name that many believe should not be taken in vain. Shakespeare used it that way in "Henry VIII," and the capitalization is the clue to the substitution: "For Goodnesse sake, consider what you do,/ How you may hurt your selfe." The phrase, with gracious added, I conjecture, is based on "by the grace of God." It also appears as gracious sakes alive and goodness gracious, Agnes, the latter partly drawn from the Latin words in the Mass, Agnus Dei . . . miserere nobis, "lamb of God . . . have mercy on us," referring in that case to Jesus as sacrificial lamb.
By the mid-19th century, the vehement exclamation had acquired a connotation of archness associated with elitist gentlewomen. Under "Gossip," The New York Times reported in 1855 in trochaic measure: "Goodness gracious! Mrs. Davis,/Have you heard how Mrs. Thompson/Spoilt her new broche this morning?"
Another substitute word for God is gee, though gee whiz and gee whillikers! are ways of not quite saying "Jesus." Gosh led to land o' Goshen! This was a favorite usage of the cartoon character Loweezy, wife of Snuffy Smith, in Billy DeBeck's comic strip "Barney Google." DeBeck was also responsible for popularizing the expression "tetched in the haid." Many hear the phrase land o'Goshen as "Atlantic Ocean." That confusion is known as a "mondegreen," from the misheard line of poetry that goes "laid him on the green." Another example of this phenomenon, expressed by many young children parroting the Pledge of Allegiance, is "I led the pigeons to the flag." Currently, ohmygosh and omigod are often expressed in writing as a single word, thereby avoiding the appearance of blasphemy.
The alliteration of goodness gracious has been matched in recent years by good grief, popularized by the "Peanuts" cartoonist, Charles M. Schulz. According to Joan Hall, editor of the Dictionary of American Regional English at the University of Wisconsin, the frequency of use of good grief and goodness gracious is running neck and neck, with good Lord and good gracious off the pace by half.
Exclamations beginning with great are holding their own. You can still hear great Caesar's ghost! rendered half as often as great God! and great Scott! while great day in the mornin' has gained a rural connotation, and a jocular quality has overtaken great balls of fire!
With unbowed head, we approach the secular use of holy. In DARE's survey, holy cow! is the most commonly used, followed by mackerel, smoke, Moses and cats. (Don't e-mail me another; we are dealing here with exclamations neither profane nor obscene, not popular expletives.)
Have you noticed, from many of the ejaculations cited above, how religious allusions dominate the world of exclamation? 
Examples: from ye gods and little fishes and heavenly days to hell's bells and mercy me, the lexicon of astonishment is rooted in the wonderment at the eternal. Well, I swan is a way of ostentatiously not swearing, and the Pete in for the love of Pete and for Pete's sake is Simon Peter the apostle. My stars! (originally my stars alive!) is thought by the lexicographer Sol Steinmetz to be an alteration of myst (all) crity, a transposition of Christ almighty! Heavens to Betsy is a mystery, however; Steinmetz speculates that it might be an alteration of the obsolete bedad! a euphemism for by Dad! itself a euphemism for by Gad! and alteration of by God! but that's a long stretch. The archaic zounds! is known to come from "God's wounds."
Not all interjections of mock horror or other jowl-shaking expostulation have biblical roots. Don't forget fiddlesticks! and get off my back. And, for crying out loud, you can still stamp your foot and explode with botheration! Come to think of it, that last is probably a euphemism for damnation!
After these explanations, will Secretary Rumsfeld -- when seemingly taken aback or ostensibly outraged by a question, and with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs sternly at his side -- continue to let off steam with the use of his quaint, old-fashioned, grandmotherly goodness gracious!?
Son of a gun! I hope so. Jumpin' Jehoshaphat! I'd hate to see him change.

 CORRECTION:
The On Language column on June 16, about the origin of the phrase "goodness gracious," misspelled the name of the Illinois high school attended by Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, who often uses the phrase. It is New Trier, not New Treir.

HEADLINE: New Haven Coliseum's Days May Be Limited 

BYLINE:  By KENNETH BEST 

 BODY:
SOME eyebrows were raised when Gov. John G. Rowland talked so openly recently about closing the New Haven Veterans Memorial Coliseum. The governor mentioned the coliseum while discussing a $13.1 million state grant for the Ninth Square redevelopment project, which is located nearby. 
 City officials had explored with the governor the likelihood of state aid to help demolish the 30-year-old arena on the day of the grant announcement, but were still awaiting the results of a coliseum financial audit, due in about two weeks, before a final decision is made, Mayor John DeStefano Jr. said. 
 The coliseum has been losing money for several years and with a debt service of $1 million on the building and projections of continued future losses, "a decision in many respects will make itself," said Mr. DeStefano, noting that many concerts have shifted to the Meadows Music Theater in Hartford and events like the circus and ice shows have moved to the new Arena at Harbor Yard in Bridgeport. The minor league hockey teams that have called the arena home have also struggled to draw fans.
Calls to SMG, which manages the coliseum for the city, were not returned. The only future events listed on the coliseum's Web site are July dates for the New Haven Ninjas Arena Football team and a July 25 Barry Manilow concert.
While the possible demise of the coliseum will disappoint concert-goers and hockey fans, the arena's South Orange Street location makes it a likely extension site for the flourishing Ninth Square project and other redevelopment plans in the adjacent downtown region. 
"A lot of strategic directions are converging. These forces are demanding more housing and street-level retail," the mayor said. "There's also a big demand to have more meeting space and potential hotel space."
Mr. DeStefano said the emerging biotechnology businesses in New Haven and the success of the Omni New Haven Hotel as a meeting center have driven increasing demands for more downtown hotel and meeting space. The city has also been in discussions with the Long Wharf Theatre and the New Haven branch of Gateway Community College about relocating to the downtown area. 
One new site for the college could be in available space on Church Street between Frontage Road and Crown Street, near the former Chapel Square Mall, the mayor said. 
"We've been working on the idea of a new Long Wharf Theater for the past three years," said Michael Ross, managing director of the theater now located adjacent to Interstate 95. "We've been talking to the city about a number of sites, including the Ninth Square area."
The Ninth Square redevelopment project is a $90 million effort aimed at revitalizing the downtown region east of the New Haven Green bordered by George, Chapel, State and Church Streets. The first phase of the project resulted in new combined housing and retail space, including apartments, restaurants and offices. 
"A key element here is that this is both market rate housing and affordable housing. What we've done that's unique is we have continually supported affordable housing and diversity in the downtown," said Henry Fernandez, the city's head of economic development. "It is a diverse place and we cherish that diversity. We believe that downtown is a place we all share and by making a place everybody feels comfortable, accepted and decided. It makes a much more cosmopolitan place, a place well worth living in."
That view is shared among those who have moved their businesses to the area.
"We love it. It's surprisingly village-like," said Sarah Buchanan of Buchanan Associates Architects, which moved its offices last September from upper Crown Street to the Ninth Square section of the same street. "There's a feeling of knowing people. It's a very nice mixture of residential and business. It would be great to have more commercial businesses, more restaurants."
Mr. Fernandez said a key factor in the success of the redevelopment projects is the private investment in the downtown area, rather than large public projects, such as a baseball stadium. "They are things that sustain themselves and pay taxes and provide jobs where people live. That's key to the success of any city," he said. 
The former Chapel Square Mall property was recently purchased by a group of investors after a steady decline in its retail business. Plans for redevelopment of the mall include 140,000 square feet of office tower space and residential space, Mr. Fernandez said. 
Other downtown projects under way include a series of properties being renovated by architectural firms, a steakhouse restaurant, luxury apartments on Olive Street, retail and residential projects in the former Woolworth's and W. T. Grant buildings and the renovation of an historic firehouse into a recording studio in the Ninth Square district by a former Yale student. 
Nick Lloyd, a musician who has operated recording studios in New York, said he spotted the 1905 firehouse while looking at apartments to rent. He decided to buy the building and turn it into a studio. The engineer who is designing the studio is the same one who developed the famed Electric Ladyland building in New York, where Jimi Hendrix and many others recorded, he said.
Mr. Fernandez said that the retailers and cultural resources are viable because there are people on the street well into the night.
"Those people are there because they live there. That means stores can stay open late," Mr. Fernandez said. "People who come into downtown feel safe."

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut; 
Housing Plan for Airport in Madison Sparks a Battle

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
IN the late 1970's, when the town of Madison became known as "the Greenwich of Eastern Connecticut," it became a target for developers, and its population rose from 9,800 to 18,200 today, not counting some 6,000 city folks who decamp annually to its beachfront cottages and stately summer homes. Its older, financially secure residents want to retire here in smaller carefree quarters among friends and familiar surroundings.
 Aiming at that market, Leyland Development L.L.C. of Tuxedo, N.Y., has proposed a 192-unit housing development for people 55 and older with no children under 18. To be called Madison Landing, it would be situated at what is now Griswold Airport, a 42-acre parcel separated from the 1,100-acre Hammonasset State Park by a creek and tidal marshlands. 
 Hammonasset is a large and beautiful public waterfront park, with a two-mile-long beach and pristine environment for wildlife, hikers and nature lovers. Now its protection is part of a tug of war in Madison between development and the status quo. 
Two grass-roots organizations are attempting to influence the sale of the airport from opposing positions. Last August nine members of the Committee to Stop Griswold Overdevelopment filed an appeal in Superior Court against the Madison Planning and Zoning Commission's approval of a change in zoning from commercial to residential on the grounds that the commission had exceeded its authority in changing the zoning. Dr. William McCullough, president of the committee, said: "We would have approved 30 houses on one-acre lots, as the original 1955 zoning for the town indicated. The number of units is more than twice the density elsewhere in town."
In January, Leyland filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' suit for lack of aggrievement. Three of the nine appellants withdrew when their attorney advised them that they lacked standing because they live too far from the site. The case is pending. 
"If Leyland prevails on the motion to dismiss, the lawsuit is over," said Thomas Cody of Robinson & Cole, a Hartford law firm representing Leyland. "If not, we go back and argue the case on the merits, which the court has not heard." Leyland has taken the next step toward final approval by applying for a special exception for its site plan. Two informational public hearings were held last week, and three hearings in which members of the public will present their views are scheduled for Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.
Many townspeople and intervenors in the lawsuit, including the Connecticut Fund for the Environment, Save the Sound, Audubon Council of Connecticut and Menunkatuck Audubon Society, argue that the development is far too dense. They also say that because the site is in a flood plain, the project will cause long-term degradation of the area, including the state park, and could endanger residents in a flood.
Residents who favor the development regard it as filling a need for empty-nesters and providing tax revenues that will help to defray increasing educational costs, including the construction of a new $44 million high school.
Peter Falk, a 20-year resident and business owner, is chairman of Citizens for Madison Landing. "I'm a great proponent of open space," he said, "but nobody wanted this property, not even the Madison Land Trust. From the daily e-mails and phone calls I get offering support, I'm convinced that the town is in favor of it, but it's the naysayers who are the most vocal." 
Since the deaths of the airport's founders -- John S. Griswold and his son, Sherman -- its operation has declined sharply, and Sherman's wife, MaryAnn Griswold, has been trying to sell it for 15 years. Among numerous offers were a golf course, big box stores and a shopping center. An office park was approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission, but its developer ultimately decided to build in another town. 
"My sister-in-law, who is the other major stockholder, and I decided on Leyland," Mrs. Griswold said, "although they were not the highest bidder. We felt a traditional neighborhood for active adults would be beneficial for the town. If there is no Madison Landing, people downsizing from their 10-room homes are going to go elsewhere. Madison Landing will keep them in town and generate a positive tax flow." 
The Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection reviewed the site for a possible purchase for open space and turned it down, said Elizabeth Varhue, assistant director of land acquisition, because it does not connect with the park. Visitors would have to exit the park and enter the property from Route 1. The town, which had the right of first refusal, rejected the site for financial reasons. The price was $3 million. 
"We blew it," said Andrew J. Errato, a 30-year resident, voicing regret for the failure to acquire the site for public use. But he also likes the project that has been proposed. "I'm 55," he said, "and I'm going to sell my four-bedroom colonial on an acre and a half, and a young couple will move in with their kids. I'd like to stay in Madison, and I think it would be nice if my wife and I could relocate to Madison Landing. I'd rather see that kind of development than a Wal-Mart."
THE new first selectman, Thomas S. Scarpati, a 25-year resident who took office in November, is another proponent. "The group that's against Madison Landing is very vocal and well funded," he said. "It's the same group that has been against any development for the past 10 years. They say that Madison Landing will cost the town $600,000 in extra expenses. We had the South Central Regional Planning Agency do an economic analysis and they came up with a benefit of $1.5 million a year, or about $1 million if you deduct that $600,000. With no children the development gives us higher revenues per acre than any other sites, with little impact on services. I notice of late that some of the ambivalent groups are beginning to understand that, and to realize that we're bringing on a new high school and playing fields."
Henry Ferris, a director of the Menunkatuck Audubon Society and former member of Madison's Planning and Zoning Commission, is regarded as the most active member of the opposition to Madison Landing. Together with the Committee to Stop Griswold Overdevelopment, he says, he has collected more than 1,000 signatures of people opposed to the project and has collected 300 financial contributions to the lawsuit. 
"There's a huge potential for environmental damage," he said. Within Hammonasset Park, "400 acres of marsh surrounding the development on two sides would be degraded by chemical and biological pollutants and could no longer support the thousands of organisms -- microflora and fauna to ospreys and fish."
Patrick Comins, director of bird conservation for Connecticut Audubon, said, "This is one of the most critical areas for birds in Connecticut." A list of endangered and threatened species includes the sharp-tailed sparrow, sedge wren, piping plover, roseate and least terns, six species of frogs, four species of salamanders, three kinds of turtles and numerous evergreens and plants.
Leah Lopez, staff lawyer for Save the Sound, warns of "poorly filtered soil, oil and gas from cars and other pollutants entering the Sound in runoff." She added, "That is the leading cause of shellfish bed closures in Connecticut and New York."
Plans for Madison Landing include 83 apartments in four two-story buildings, 39 town houses and 70 single-family homes, priced from $300,000 for a one-bedroom apartment, a small cottage or a small town house to $700,000 or more for the largest units. About 40 percent of the acreage would be used for dwellings, interior roads, walking trails and separate buildings housing a meeting hall, health club, indoor swimming pool, business center, general store and post office. Traditional New England architectural styles and building materials were blended by the architects John Regan and Robert Orr to create an impression of having been built over several time periods. 
Even though the plans look attractive, however, there are some who are worried about the project's infrastructure. Penny Anthopolos, staff attorney for the Connecticut Fund for the Environment, said, "There is insufficient evidence in the developer's application for special exception to determine whether sewage and storm water management will be sufficient."
In accordance with state environmental regulations, nothing will be built within 100 feet of the marshlands. The BL Companies of Meriden has been retained to install an innovative on-site sewage treatment system identical to the one ordered by the town for the new high school. "Our homeowners' association will have strict management guidelines for minimal use of herbicides and pesticides," said Howard Kaufman, executive vice president and general counsel at Leyland. "Thirty McMansions with individual septic systems and lawns would have a far greater negative impact."

HEADLINE: During the Trial, a Few Places Where the Regulars Were New 

BYLINE:  By GARY SANTANIELLO 

 BODY:
AS the local merchants warily eyed the upcoming Skakel trial, many envisioned Norwalk under siege. They had visions of television trucks clogging narrow streets, overflow parking harming area businesses and a news media horde disrupting daily routines.
 What resulted from the seven-and-a-half week trial (including jury selection), however, was a convivial, well-behaved extended family of news media, lawyers and family members that found succor from area businesses and left behind goodwill, not ill feeling. 
 "According to what I heard, it was going to be a zoo," said Peter Alatsas, owner of Ambrosia Bar and Grill, a restaurant that specializes in Greek and Mediterranean dishes not far from the courthouse. 
Instead, it was a much more congenial atmosphere. One of his most frequent customers was Dorthy Moxley, the mother of Martha Moxley, who Michael Skakel was convicted of murdering in 1975. Dorthy Moxley reserved a table for lunch at 1 p.m. two days before jury selection began and was there with family and friends all but one day of the trial.
"She fell in love with the place," Mr. Alatsas said. Mrs. Moxley celebrated her 70th birthday, twice, at Ambrosia, "and after the verdict, we all celebrated with Champagne," Mr. Alatsas said. "She was playing with my nine-month-old baby. She told me she couldn't go home without going to Ambrosia."
Mr. Alatsas said he was host to the jury once or twice, Mark Fuhrman was a regular and that he ended up serving roughly 30 extra lunches per day. "And some of the reporters came back for dinner," he said. "The trial was a positive thing, as far as business went."
Michael Skakel, his lawyer, Michael Sherman, and their large entourage were accommodated at Ash Creek Saloon on Wilton Road. Jon Bagdon, the manager, said he served 10 to 20 extra lunches a day when court was in session.
"It wasn't the landslide we thought it might be, but it was a nice piece of business," he said.
At Foodworks, a deli on Wall Street, Carol Kasmarski, the co-owner, and her son, Michael, regularly set aside a large table for the jurors, who could have the daily specials such as Jury's Decision (hot honey-glazed ham) and Judge's Chamber (lobster salad).
Although people were two-deep at the counter and all 35 seats were taken during the court's 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. lunch break, "We got the food out real quick," Mrs. Kasmarski said. "After their first time here, people knew our system. A lot of reporters were here, too, but everyone felt comfortable. We just told people we had to serve the jury first, and they understood."
Bob Prastine, the owner of Atlantic Meat Market across the street, counted Jonathan Benedict, the lead prosecutor, among his many regular customers from the trial.
"He said he liked my chicken salad," Mr. Prastine said. He added that he noticed many long-time customers avoiding his shop during the lunch rush. 
"After a while, though, they started calling in their orders at 11 a.m.," Mr. Prastine said.
Other businesses found different ways to serve trial-related customers. 
Stew Leonard's, the grocery store, brought free cookies to the reporters and technicians, and left menus for catered needs. The Fraternal Order of Eagles, whose lodge abuts the courthouse parking lot, fired up a charcoal grill and served sodas, hamburgers, hot dogs and sausage and pepper sandwiches to members of the news media the first few days of the trial. "It was as much a social event as anything," said Herb Sanford, the club secretary.
The only complaint of Richard Dileo, the owner of Dileo Jewelers, was many of his customers avoided Norwalk center during the week.
"The media had them afraid to come down here," he said. "People thought the area might be closed off, but as it turned out, you could find more parking spots than ever. My Saturday business increased, though.
"Whatever the media had to do, they stayed out of people's way," Mr. Dileo added. "Whoever orchestrated this, they did a good job."
Much of the logistical coordination for the news media's needs was provided by Guy Ortoleva of the Connecticut Film Office, a division of the State Department of Economic and Community Development.
"Once everyone knew we were all going to work together, and that the court employees were going to be displaced from the parking lot with no harm to local businesses, it was easy," Mr. Ortoleva said. "Mayor Alex Knopp, and all the Norwalk city agencies, bless them for their cooperation."
Not only did the trial not cause the feared disruption in Norwalk center, some said it may have provided the impetus for more business in the future. "This city has a lot of potential," Mr. Ortoleva said. "With the current leadership, and some extra cooperation, and considering the facilities for film and video available nearby, I can see Norwalk becoming a hotbed of production."

Stony Brook's Rainmaker Brings In the Business

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH 

 BODY:
Governor Pataki's budget, which the State Legislature passed last month, sets aside money for five Centers of Excellence scattered throughout the state, one of them at the State University at Stony Brook, pleasing executives who have pressed the governor to promote the growth of regional high-tech business corridors.
 The Stony Brook center is intended to foster cooperation between academic researchers and technology companies, tapping the unversity's intellectual resources for the benefit of the private sector. 
 The state is contributing $50 million for the Stony Brook center, with another $50 expected from the federal government and another $115 million to come from the private sector over the next five years.
It will emphasize telecommunications, and programs there will start well in advance of the building's formal opening, said Yacov Shamash, the dean of the university's engineering and business programs. Hundreds of Long Island companies, including four of its 10 largest publicly traded corporations, are involved in wireless telecommunications. 
In announcing the program, Governor Pataki said that the centers would focus on finding commercial applications for technologies that accounted for fully a third of the national economic growth of the last five years.
News of the centers' approval by the Legislature was a leading topic earlier this month at a gala, sponsored by Stony Brook's Hillel organization, honoring Dean Shamash (pronounced sha-MASH). Charles Gargano, the state's economic development director, assured the audience of 500 business leaders and academics that Dean Shamash was the individual whose efforts had brought the project to fruition.
In landing the project, a process that involved multiple trips to Albany accompanied by business leaders, Dean Shamash trumped a rival proposal championed by the Long Island Association, the region's largest business group. The fancy footwork advanced the dean's already considerable reputation as a savvy administrator able to build bridges between the worlds of business, academia and government.
In the process, the dean has strengthened Stony Brook's emergence as a business-friendly university, following a town-and-gown model set by Stanford University and Silicon Valley, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Route 128.
"I would describe Yacov as our ambassador to the business community," said Shirley Strum Kenney, the president of Stony Brook. "Yacov is able to embody our mission to be the engine of economic growth for Long Island."
Lewis Knopf, a vice president of Reuters, the information-services company with a large presence in Hauppauge, said: "Yacov has an amazing sense of what business needs and what academia needs, and is able to bring the two together. Yacov listens to people, learns what's needed and sets out to get it accomplished. He doesn't take no for an answer."
"If you look at how closely the university works with industry, that's been growing steadily since Yacov's arrival," Mr. Knopf continued. "A strong connection between industry and academic institutions means the research that takes place at the university level gets spun off into tech companies. That's something Long Island hasn't had before this."
The benefits are mutual. "Close connections between Stony Brook and local businesses benefit both sides," Dean Shamash said. "We have great teaching and research resources here. We can help local technology companies in many ways, and that's what we do."
But some academics raise concerns that closer academic-business ties threaten the traditional university commitment to pure research. "I don't think there is any aspect of the U.S. industrial scene that is more respected around the world than the linkage between academia and technology," said Jeffrey Garten, the dean of the Yale School of Management, who has a house in East Hampton. "But the linkage, which largely developed after World War II, has a lot of inherent tension. On one hand, there is basic research, conducted to satisfy the curiosity of scientists. On the other hand, there is applied research, which addresses specific commercial needs."
Companies "might benefit short-term from the applied research," he added, "but if they don't support continued theoretical research, we are going to see the technological base of the country decline rapidly." 
Despite Dean Shamash's high profile, his background is not widely known. He was born to Jewish parents in Basra, Iraq, in 1950. Concerned about his safety in Iraq, he left for England as a young man and received undergraduate and graduate degrees from the Imperial College of Science and Technology in London.
He came to the United States and taught at three universities before joining Stony Brook: the University of Pennsylvania, Florida Atlantic and Washington State University. There, he helped establish a center financed by the National Science Foundation that promoted research into integrated circuit design and helped develop a consortium of three universities and 15 technology companies, including Boeing and Hewlett-Packard.
His role establishing that consortium made Dean Shamash stand out from the crowd and led to his being hired by Stony Brook in 1992. There, his biggest success has perhaps been a program called the Strategic Partnership for Industrial Resurgence, or SPIR.
During the last five years, the program has helped some 200 companies with 600 projects, Dean Shamash said, and has attracted more than $60 million in federal grants. In addition to his two deanships, he is the university's vice president for economic development, and the university says that through his leadership, research financing from external sources has nearly tripled. 
Managers at Computer Associates and Symbol Technologies, Long Island's fourth- and eighth-largest publicly traded companies last year based on revenue, have worked extensively with Stony Brook professors and graduate students in the last decade. Hundreds of students trained at Stony Brook have been hired by local technology companies in the last decade, further cementing town-gown ties.
"Our internal research tends to be focused directly on today's problem and what customers would like to see fixed in the next 10 minutes to 10 months," said Mark Combs, a vice president at Computer Associates. "University researchers are a good complement, because they tend to be focused on more abstract issues. They ask great questions that begin 'Would it be possible to . . .' and go on from there."
"We aren't set up to do blue-sky research," he added. "University researchers are, and they get funding to do so. They push us to do things we wouldn't do otherwise. Partnering with them is a natural and valuable thing for a company like ours."
The dean's supporters say his personality is a key reason he has been successful. "Yacov is one of the few people who bridge the gap between academia and the business community," said Peter Goldsmith, the president of the Long Island Technology Network and a friend of Dean Shamash for nearly 10 years. "People respect his intellect, his drive, his honesty and his unending energy. He routinely does what I think no one else can do."

HEADLINE: Black and White On Long Island: Like Oil and Water 

BYLINE:  By ALLAN RICHTER 

 BODY:
A TALL hedge and a street sign are all that separate the homes of Bernard and Della Tomlin in Hempstead and Barton and Laura Midwood in Garden City. The street sign marks the border. But there are plenty of clues that more than just a political boundary separates the two families.
 On the Hempstead side, where the street is called Lafayette Avenue, the road where the Tomlins park their Volvo is cracked and potholed. Mrs. Tomlin said the plows rarely show up after a snowstorm. The Tomlins send two daughters, Dana, 15, and Dawn, 12, to private school for the education Mrs. Tomlin says will increase their odds of getting into college. And if the Tomlins were to sell their Colonial-style house, Mrs. Tomlin said she doubted it would fetch more than $250,000. 
 On the Garden City side, where the street is called Lafayette Street, a heavy tree limb fell the other day, and village workers had it chopped up and carted away in a few hours. A Mercedes is parked in front of the Midwoods' house. The pavement is smooth. Residents flock to the village for its quality schools. Mr. Midwood said he is in contract to sell his home; he declined to reveal the price, but Pat Dickson, a real estate agent with Coach Realtors Fennessy Associates in Garden City, said comparable homes were selling for around $450,000. 
People who have launched a campaign to highlight the racial divisions they say are institutionalized on Long Island say all the distinctions between the Tomlins and the Midwoods are tied to an even more obvious one: The Tomlins are black and the Midwoods are white.
Mrs. Tomlin figures the racial distinction is costly. As an assistant dean of student affairs at Adelphi University in Garden City, she works in the village she and her family would have to struggle to move to, even though it is just paces from her front door. 
"If that sign were moved to the corner," Mrs. Tomlin said of the green-and-white Garden City marker, "my house would increase, what, $150,000, $200,000? My children would then be able to attend a school that I think will prepare them educationally, so that's another $10,000 saved because I send my kids to private school."
The Tomlins and the Midwoods live along one of the more pronounced of the political, social and economic dividing lines that separate the races more thoroughly on the Island than in any other suburb in America, a new report says. The report, issued this month by Erase Racism, a year-old nonprofit group sponsored by the Long Island Community Foundation in Jericho, says 74 percent of the Island's blacks would have to move to be evenly dispersed through the population.
That index of segregation, culled from an analysis of the 2000 federal census by the Lewis Mumford Center for Comparative Urban and Regional Research at SUNY-Albany, was topped in seven cities, including New York, but no other suburban areas.
"Segregation is shorthand for talking about whether people are given access to opportunities," said John Powell, a University of Minnesota law professor and executive director of the Institute on Race and Poverty in that state. He spoke on June 5 at an Islandia conference organized by Erase Racism to call attention to the issue.
The Island's black residents are especially subject to institutional racism, particularly when it comes to housing, Mr. Powell's group said. It pointed to statistics showing that well-to-do blacks were more likely than other minorities to live in low- or moderate-income areas, and Erase Racism said the likely cause was unfair housing practices directed at blacks.
Segregation on Long Island is the result of decades-old discrimination, activists and black residents say, that was flaunted in developments like Levittown, America's pioneering post-World War II suburb, and exacerbated by white flight from once-mixed neighborhoods.
"It's embedded and not overt," said V. Elaine Gross, director of Erase Racism. "It's more subtle, and it doesn't require that people really be intentional about it. All of the stuff that sort of creates the disadvantages for black school children, it's not that someone gets up in the morning and says, 'I'm going to see to it that all the black kids get an inferior education.' That's what makes it so hard to grasp. You don't need an army of bigots for it to be perpetuated."
The segregation trend study that Erase Racism commissioned was released on the heels of another report this month, commissioned by Senator Charles Schumer, showing that blacks on Long Island are at least three times more likely to pay higher interest rates on loans.
Mrs. Tomlin, the Hempstead border homeowner, said segregation on the Island has also been perpetuated by the inability of black homeowners like her family to command top dollar for their houses and trade up to better neighborhoods. "I have Uniondale, Hempstead and Roosevelt to choose from," she said. "Outside of those, I need an extra $250,000."
She noted that Hempstead was much more prosperous decades ago, before the departure of most of its white population. "Money doesn't come back to the neighborhood," she said. "It never returns."
So when the snowplows miss the street in front of her house, Mrs. Tomlin finds herself on the telephone, trying to be a squeaky wheel with Hempstead Village Hall. She seldom gets the grease. "What do you do when you're told time and time again that the money is not there?" she said. "You can be a pest, but when it's not done you stop yelling after awhile."
Speakers at the June 5 conference said they want zoning decisions and other powers more centralized to rupture the jurisdiction lines around the Island's 13 townships, 95 incorporated villages and 126 school districts that they say have penned blacks and other minorities into enclaves.
"On Long Island, there has to be some way of breaking up this fragmentation and creating regional resources," Mr. Powell said, adding that many black communities he has studied around the country have either financial resources or strong governmental representation. But "spatial racism," a term describing institutional racism in land-use policies, has left the Island's minorities without "resources or voice," he asserted.
David Rusk, a consultant on urban and suburban policy who analyzed the Island's segregation issues for the Erase Racism group, held up two Washington suburbs as model communities that have felled the walls around their segregated "little box" communities.
A far lower percentage of blacks -- 41 percent and 38 percent, respectively -- would have to move in Montgomery County, Maryland, and Fairfax County, Virginia, to be evenly dispersed. The counties have centralized school districts and zoning policies requiring developers to reserve 15 percent of new housing for low- and moderate-income families.
Mr. Rusk linked inclusive zoning policies to a strong regional economic identity like those in the Washington suburbs -- now more efficient "big boxes" -- because affordable housing is a magnet for skilled workers. He exhorted Long Island to "do something because you are falling behind. The big boxes are beating you out. Montgomery County is the world capital of biomedical research. Fairfax County is the world capital of the Internet. What is Long Island the world capital of?"
Mr. Rusk's recommendation for Long Island: "I would empower the county governments, through state law, with overall responsibility, working with all the little boxes, to develop an Islandwide land-use and transportation plan, enact Islandwide inclusionary zoning, coordinate economic development initiatives and set up some program of regional tax-based sharing so that some of the wealthier communities put more money into a pot that gets shared out to some of the poorer communities."
Ms. Gross said activists would lobby state and local legislators, making use of the court system if need be, for changes. Ms. Gross said the coalition would question how school district lines are drawn and how they are funded. "The districting lines basically do not allow African-American children in particular to gain access to the kinds of good schools that might be available just next door, because we have so many small little school districts," she said.
Another aim, she said, is to secure funding so Long Island Fair Housing Services, a Bohemia-based watchdog group, can dispatch "more visible and prominent testers" to determine whether real estate agents are steering blacks away from white neighborhoods.
One prong in the strategy that Ms. Gross said would not go overlooked would be arranging public meetings to allay white fears.
"We want to have a better understanding of the there-goes-the-neighborhood mentality," Ms. Gross said. "We know that a lot of what happens in communities is fueled by misconceptions, myths and fears that ordinary citizens have. There needs to be some way of having a dialogue."
Ms. Gross said her group had received positive feedback from Suffolk and Nassau legislators. Thomas R. Suozzi, the Nassau County executive, appeared briefly at the Islandia racism conference and applauded the group for crystallizing an issue that never graduated past casual conversation. Mr. Suozzi took issue with labeling Long Island racist but said he supported stronger regional government in the counties.
But efforts to shift powers from the local municipalities are likely to be met with stiff resistance.
"Many of these villages are almost 100 years old and they were created to get away from the bigger governments that were not giving the services they needed," said Warren Tackenberg, executive director of the Nassau County Village Officials Association. "Village government is still the most responsive and effective government there is. The counties or townships, the bigger governments, haven't proven to us that they're successful in their planning methods."
Some of Long Island's black residents say their isolation from white communities contributes to a sense of doubt about how whites view them when they do mingle. Mrs. Tomlin, the Hempstead resident, said she is "constantly trying to discern what I'm seeing and what I'm feeling. You may say, 'Oh, you're so nice,' but you may just be tolerating me. I think about that all the time."
Veronica Dale, 32, who lives in the predominantly black North Park section of Long Beach, said she wonders why her community does not receive flyers announcing festivals and other Long Beach events. Another recent example was the campaigning of school board candidates at the L.I.R.R. station.
"They did not approach me, and I want to believe that it's because I look young," Ms. Dale said, "but then I watched several black people walk there and they were not approached, either."
Ms. Dale said another instance involved her daughter, Aikea Hassell, 7, when she recently attended a white friend's birthday party. Another white girl pulled the birthday girl away from Aikea. "I didn't know if this was her upbringing, racial comments that her parents make," Ms. Dale said, "or if it just was a kid that didn't want to share her friend with somebody else."
Such uncertainty makes it difficult to speak out, Mrs. Tomlin said. "That says something in itself," she said. "You don't want to rock the boat. As people of color, there's a concern about being too outspoken because you don't know what the repercussions will be."
Richard and Tracy Gaines, a black couple, live on Wellington Street in Hempstead, and their backyard abuts that of a white family on Meadow Street in Garden City. Mr. Gaines said he has nothing to do with the Garden City side, adding that he is irritated by the looks he gets from the Garden City police who pass by when his white coworkers at a clothing distributor in Lake Success come over for barbecue.
His daughter, Shenasiah, 10, said she occasionally talks to children on the other side of the fence. "I think one boy's name is Billy," Shenasiah said. "We talk about how the day was and stuff like that."
Nobody answered the door at that Garden City home, but residents elsewhere along the border with Hempstead said their relations with their black neighbors are cordial.
"We like the fact that we have neighbors in the back who are African-American because we don't want our kids to think it's a white world," said Dane Petersen, 43, a photographer on Meadow Street in Garden City. Mr. Petersen said he sees some of his Garden City neighbors less often than Desmond Gebon, his black neighbor beyond the fence in Hempstead.
Mr. Midwood, who lives next door to the Tomlins, said: "The truth of the matter is the only problems I ever had were with my Garden City neighbors. I never had problems from the Hempstead side because they were all friendly, great people. A few weeks ago some guy from the sanitation department knocks on my door very apologetically to tell me that one of my Garden City neighbors complained because I left my green recycling bucket out six hours longer than I should have."
Mrs. Tomlin said a move to a wealthier and, by inference, white neighborhood would raise a number of uncomfortable questions: "Do you really want to break the barrier? Who are your children going to date? Who are their friends going to be? Will your children be accepted?"
In the end, Mrs. Tomlin decided her goal falls somewhat short of the full integration that activists on the Island want. "It does not matter if it's separate as long as it's equal," she said. "Why can't Garden City and Hempstead have the same success rate in sending their kids to college?"

HEADLINE: IN THE SCHOOLS; 
When the Substitute In Class Is a Parent

BYLINE:  By MERRI ROSENBERG; This column, about education in Westchester, appears biweekly. E-mail: wested@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
DEPENDING on your feelings about parents turned loose in a classroom, the Rye city school district's recent plan to recruit and train parents as substitute teachers in the elementary schools could be considered a brilliant solution to the chronic shortage of substitute teachers -- or a potential nightmare that could create more problems than it solves. 
 Dr. Edward J. Shine, superintendent of the Rye city school district, said that on any given day, the district with 2,566 students needs about 10 to 12 substitutes districtwide , a number comparable to similar districts in the county. That number can double when Rye faculty members are needed to grade standardized tests or participate in professional development programs. 
 "When the economy was booming, we couldn't find anyone available to do subbing," said Dr. Shine. 
Even increasing the daily pay rate to $90 wasn't enticing enough prospects. Rye had tried to tempt parents to consider working as substitutes through a mass mailing during the last school year, but found few takers. Anyone over the age of 18 who passes a criminal background check can be hired as a substitute teacher by a school district. Uncertified substitutes are limited to 40 days in the classroom. Certified teachers, who are working as substitutes, can work without any such limits. The minimum state requirements for being a substitute teacher can be superseded by a school board's and district's own hiring requirements.
This year, the district decided to offer training to substitute teacher candidates, and 55 parents responded to a district solicitation this spring. A dozen mothers were ultimately selected on a first-come-first-served basis for the program.
Before the training was offered, Alison Dye, a mother of three who had been a teacher in the United Kingdom before coming to the United States, wasn't certain how her British training would prepare her for an American classroom. 
"For me, this is the perfect step in," said Mrs. Dye, who had taught home economics to 11- to 18-year-olds in England, and now coaches field hockey here as a volunteer. 
The dozen candidates were given a two-hour training session by two Rye school teachers, focusing on classroom management techniques, district policies regarding student confidentiality issues and how to follow a teacher's lesson plan. The sessions also covered basics like how to collect lunch money and take attendance, and walk children through the hallways to the library or gym. Prospective substitute teachers spent a half-day in a school, essentially shadowing a classroom teacher. Parents were also interviewed by an elementary school principal, and then go through another two-hour training and debriefing session. 
"These are stake holders in our community, who have the safety and best interests of the children at heart," said Jeanette Lees, a third-grade teacher who does some of the training. "This represents an even more formal way for parents to help. We don't expect subs to teach new things, but learning continues and we want our children to be safe and secure. It's a big disruption for kids when their teacher is out. The children rely on structure and routines." 
What about worries that parents who work in the schools will forget that they are district employees and divulge information about one student's attention deficit disorder problem or another's need for extra help in reading while chatting with other mothers at next weekend's soccer game? Or that parents who work as substitutes may try to parlay that role into favored treatment for their own children? 
"We've emphasized strongly to the parents that they are expected to comply with school confidentiality policies," said Dr. Dan McCann, Rye's deputy superintendent. "And we won't place the parents in their child's classroom or even on their grade level." 
While districts often hire parents as uncertified substitutes, this is one of the only district-sponsored programs that seeks and trains parents to fill the slots. For the district, seeking substitutes among parents made sense. "There are many qualified people in our community who are interested in teaching and interested in working in the community," said Dr. McCann. "These are well motivated people who want to contribute. We'll get people who are reliable, and who are close."

HEADLINE: ENVIRONMENT; 
Auditors Recalculate Delaware Dredging

BYLINE:  By JOHN SULLIVAN 

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
WHEN the Army Corps of Engineers agreed to undertake a controversial plan to deepen the Delaware River's shipping channel, it said the project would save about $40 million a year in transportation costs for the region.
 But after studying the proposal for about a year -- with critics contending that the savings may be less than anticipated and the potential damage to the environment considerable -- Congressional investigators for the General Accounting Office now say the corps vastly overstated the economic benefits. 
 According to the calculations by the investigators, which were made public last week, the project would provide only about half the benefits predicted by the Army Corps of Engineers.
"This is a boondoggle, and it should be dead," said Representative Rob Andrews, a Democrat from Haddon Heights who has long opposed the project, whose cost was estimated at more than $300 million with a completion time of five years. 
The numbers are crucial because the corps is only supposed to undertake projects that provide at least as much economic benefit as they cost in construction. 
The corps is not disputing the criticism. Indeed, it has agreed to suspend work on the dredging plan until a new analysis is complete. It has also agreed to have independent consultants provide the analysis, and to shelve the project if the numbers do not justify it.
The General Accounting Office began its review of the project last year after receiving requests from Representative Andrews as well as New Jersey's two senators. Mr. Andrews has opposed the project in part because engineers planned to dump a large amount of dredged river muck in sites in his South Jersey district. He also said dredging would damage the river's environmental health and provide little economic benefit.
But supporters of the project, led by Senator Arlen Specter, a Republican from Pennsylvania, have vowed to continue to fight for its survival because of what they say is its importance to the economic health of the river ports in and around Philadelphia.
Manuel Stamatakis, chairman of the Delaware River Port Authority, said thousands of port-related jobs depended on the deepening project. He said the Congressional investigators were unfairly subjecting the Delaware project to close scrutiny.
"I don't understand why they would single out this project and not look at a much bigger project, such as the one in New York," he said. 
The Delaware project calls for engineers to increase the depth of the 103-mile-long shipping channel from 40 to 45 feet, which supporters say is necessary to accommodate large container ships and oil tankers.
But Congressional investigators questioned whether the increased depth would add substantial business to the Delaware River ports, and opponents point out that the ports have drastically increased revenue in the last several years without deepening the channel.
Environmentalists have said the project would threaten the environmental recovery of the Delaware River. The resurrection of the Delaware, which has seen the return of many threatened animals and plants, is considered one of the success stories of the environmental movement. In their report, the Congressional investigators said most environmental concerns had been properly addressed by the corps.
Some of the errors cited in the report were simple math mistakes. For example, the corps double-counted the economic benefit it expected from reduced costs to oil companies, which would be able to use larger ships on the Delaware. That error led the corps to overstate the annual benefits by $2.6 million, the investigators said. A computer error overstated the project's benefits by another $4.7 million, they also said.
By the time the Congressional investigators finished adjusting for math errors and erroneous assumptions, the project's benefits were reduced from $40 million a year to about $13.3 million.
As a result of the report, the corps has agreed to review its calculations on another 150 projects nationwide. 
Representative Andrews said there was still a possibility that the Delaware River project could survive, although he said "there is an immense burden of proof for the proponents."
He said he would try to ensure that financing for the project is not restored in Congress.
"It is a bad idea, and I can't justify spending $300 million on it," he said.

Hijacking The Spotlight

BYLINE:  By LUC SANTE; Luc Sante's books include "Low Life" and "The Factory of Facts."

 BODY:
JOHN J. GOTTI was conceivably cited more often in hip-hop lyrics than any other human being, and not just because his name helpfully rhymes with body, karate, Bacardi, Maserati and illuminati. He was New York's bandit king. His sole concession to the sharing of wealth may have been the annual fireworks displays he put on outside the Bergin Hunt and Fish Club in Ozone Park, Queens, until they were halted by Mayor Giuliani, but that was hardly the point. 
 In today's free-market culture, a thug does not gain respect by doling out groceries or endowing hospitals. To command death while wearing $2,000 Brioni suits is the dream of the powerless, and Gotti happily embodied that possibility. Just as ingenue boxers of the 1900's assumed the names of their idols, so gangsta rap, the urban soundtrack of the powerless, has spawned a long list of epigones of the Don: Gotti, Young Gotti, D-Gotti, Cell Gotti, Yo Gotti, Lil' Gotti Gambino. . . . 
 John Gotti, who died last week, was, after all, a pure product of the slums: the fifth of 13 children, whose father was unskilled and often unemployed, whose family managed only a lateral move from the South Bronx to East New York, then as now arguably the two bleakest neighborhoods in the city. He became a gang leader, slid out of school, was arrested nine times in eight years for the usual variety of juvenile offenses. 
Every element in this list is familiar from a million dossiers compiled by social workers in the slums of this and other cities. But Mr. Gotti did not wind up eating lead, did not spend his entire youth in prison and did not succumb to dope -- or, for that matter, find religion -- because he caught the eye of an employer for whom his excesses and misdeeds and sociopathic tendencies made excellent resume material.
Unfortunately for those who would follow his example, few milieus in American society possess criminal organizations bound together by the principles of medieval vassalage. Even the one he worked for seems to have slipped; its ownership of judges, juries and prosecutors is at an all-time low.
Mr. Gotti was a star. He may have come up through the ranks, humbly hijacking trucks and working as an enforcer, but after Paul Castellano met the asphalt of East 46th Street in late 1985, Mr. Gotti stepped into the spotlight like an understudy in a musical. In doing so, he was filling a conspicuous vacancy. No mobster had displayed so much panache since Lucky Luciano, who was deported to Italy in 1946. With the possible brief exception of the psychotic Joey Gallo, the intervening years had been dominated by expressionless men in fedoras. Their style had tended to focus on deeds rather than appearances, even if half of them had taken lessons in body language from George Raft.
Mr. Gotti, suddenly if belatedly, invented a kingpin style for the television era. His hair alone was a minor masterpiece; his wardrobe suggested Prohibition splendor with a 1950's Miami Beach palette; his demeanor flickered constantly from amusement to bonhomie to menace. 
Had he mastered the art of the sound bite as well he would have been overpowering, but among the Mob, pithiness apparently went out with Carmine Persico (who, acting as his own lawyer in the 1986 RICO case that sent him and many other prominent capos away, described the proceedings as "a bus tour of Tinseltown"). 
Mr. Gotti wielded language like a two-by-four -- excision of common obscenities would trim his collected utterances by half -- and his most quotable quotes were picked up by concealed microphones.
"La-di da-di, free John Gotti, the king of New York," warbled the Fun-Loving Criminals, a second-string white hip-hop crew, a few years ago. You could buy "Free John" hats and shirts in select locations, and several Web sites were given over to the cause, the guest books of which were dense with condolence messages within a few hours of his death. 
He was a king to many who could not imagine themselves ever achieving a place in society as it is conventionally constituted, and his downfall and improbably long term in solitary only reinforced the notion, oddly enough. His previous ability to buy acquittals had made him an object of admiration, but his inability to do so in 1992 inspired love. 
He was revealed as human, one of us, who had enjoyed a wild ride at the expense of the power elite -- compared to which his own exercise of power could be seen as insurgent, even brave -- and then had been undone by the treachery of Sammy the Bull, an archetypal Judas. He had risen from the dirt of poverty to the plateau of celebrity, a place of fine dining, superb haberdashery, constant presence in the tabloids and power over life and death. Of course he was going to go down. 
Mr. Gotti somehow managed to tap into a tradition, that of the criminal as popular hero, that dates back to peasant societies in the mists of time. By popular reckoning, Dutch Schultz was a killer, Al Capone was a warlord, Carlo Gambino was a remote figure who directed fate with a mere nod of his head; but John Gotti was a bandit.
His life and actions were not much different in substance from theirs, but he possessed charisma and swagger, and he conveyed the very American humbug that because he lived large, you could, too.

Trying to Save Energy May Come at a Price

BYLINE:  By JOHN SULLIVAN 

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
With state regulators poised to collect nearly $1 billion from utility customers for energy conservation measures over the next seven years, a recent audit concluded that the plan was flawed and warned that New Jersey might be in danger of wasting much of the money.
 "You should have a long-term plan to measure these things, and they don't," said David Llewellyn Davies, chief executive of Davies Associates, the Maryland-based auditor that conducted the study for the state Board of Public Utilities. "They are sort of winging it at the moment, and they are trying to back into a long-range plan." 
 Moreover, when regulators and the state's power utilities unveiled the program last year, auditors said, they began spending money without clearly identifying the desired results. 
By year's end, the state expects to have spent more than $200 million on programs ranging from rebates for energy-efficient equipment to training for building contractors. Yet in the report, completed in April, auditors recommended that the state more clearly define the goals for each of its energy efficiency programs and scale back or eliminate those not expected to produce long-term results. 
Jeanne M. Fox, president of the Board of Public Utilities, said her staff had already begun to work on long-term plans. "It is a priority for all of us to get a handle on this," said Ms. Fox, who was recently appointed to the board. "I would like to have something in place by early fall."
State legislators created the energy conservation fund when they passed a 1999 measure deregulating the state's electricity market. The clause establishing the conservation fund was one of the most hard-fought sections of the law, with various groups from utilities to environmentalists clashing over how the money should be spent. The arguments tied up the money until last year, when the state reached a compromise solution.
Under the new plan, every ratepayer pays a small fee, called a societal benefits charge, in addition to the bill for the power itself -- some of which goes to the energy conservation fund. Under the deal struck last year, 75 percent of the energy conservation fund will be used to promote more efficient use of power, and 25 percent will support renewable energy sources like solar or wind power.
To get the fund up and running quickly, the state regulators turned to the utilities, which had been administering their own, smaller funds for decades. The utilities, in the past limited to handing out high-efficiency light bulbs or pamphlets on home insulation, were asked to operate more ambitious programs.
But from the beginning, opponents criticized the decision to rely on the utilities to manage the funds.
"It is the fox managing the henhouse," said Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club. "The people who have the most to gain by not having energy efficiency programs are in charge of it."
The auditors found that the utilities did a good job establishing the programs and ensuring efficiency, but that many of them were modified versions of the utilities' original conservation efforts. Consequently, auditors questioned whether they would achieve the results the board wanted.
Rather, the auditors said that the programs should be aimed at the eventual transformation of the state's energy market so that customers would use less energy because it made economic sense rather than because of state subsidies. "A lot of the programs are not meeting the objectives," Mr. Davies said. "The utilities did a good job, but now you have to get in there and direct them."
The utilities disagreed. One disputed program, for example, trains heating contractors to install energy-efficient equipment to minimize the amount of power used for central air-conditioning. But the auditors criticized the state plan because there were no benchmarks to measure electricity savings or to determine whether the training affected the market for air-conditioning equipment.
Still, Chris Neme, a consultant working on the program, said the training had already shown results.
"The market share for energy-efficient equipment in New Jersey is 30 percent; nationally the average is 4 percent," Mr. Neme said. "New Jersey is way ahead of the national average, largely because of this program."
Frederick A. Lynk, a marketing manager for PSE&G, argued that Mr. Davies's report underestimated the amount of planning that went into the programs. "We had a very short time to get to market with these programs," Mr. Lynk said. "We did a lot of baseline market research about where the markets were, and that market research was an underpinning for the design of these programs."
While Mr. Davies said the auditors did not disagree that many of the individual programs worked well, he noted that the state needed to develop an overall plan to determine which ones should be emphasized.
"If you are going to transform a market, you need a long-term strategy," he said. "And they don't have it, and that is the critical problem."
While the auditors felt the utilities could manage the energy efficiency programs -- with greater involvement by the state Board of Public Utilities -- they said the supervision of renewable energy funds should go to an independent group.
"This is the exploitation of new technologies, and utilities are not known for doing that," he said.
While supporters of the current plan say it has been successful in promoting alternative energies like fuel cells, critics contend that it has not done enough to encourage the use of renewable energy sources.
"The fund has left solar businesses dead in the water," said Lyle K. Rawlings of Advanced Solar Products.
The auditors concluded that the money spent under the current program was unlikely to foster a viable renewable energy industry, and that the current system had spent too much on one technology -- natural-gas-fired fuel cells -- and not enough encourage homeowners to install renewable energy devices.
Ms. Fox said the Board of Public Utilities would examine the plan for renewable energy sources as well as the energy efficiency programs, but that it was too early to call for any changes.
"We are going to look at what structures will work," she said.

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEW; 
Lost Souls In Search Of Brighter Days

BYLINE:  By ALVIN KLEIN 

DATELINE: MADISON 

 BODY:
"CARNIVAL!" is a musical whose time has come. See it at the New Jersey Shakespeare Festival and you may wonder why. 
 You may also wonder what a middling musical like "Carnival!" is doing at the Shakespeare Festival, but that is another matter. Neither a classic musical nor a conventional star vehicle, the place of "Carnival!" in theater lore can be summed up in a name: Gower Champion. Indeed, the musical signaled a new breed of star, one who did not appear onstage but whose presence showed through everything that did. 
 It was 1961 and a new era was dawning on Broadway. The director-choreographer as musical star emerged. Mr. Champion was an early innovator of a new fusion that defined musical theater at its most complete. Production -- not in terms of scenic effects, but vision and concept -- dictated by a masterly touch, overpowered composition. Crashing chandeliers imported from England had yet to arrive. This was Broadway pizazz, genuine, homegrown, first class. 
No other "Carnival!" can be as revelatory. Why the musical is resurfacing, from major showplaces to summer stock, is anybody's guess. It was the season's high point in the terrific Encores! series at New York City Center in February; there is talk of a Broadway revival next year, and the Surflight Theater in Beach Haven opened a "Carnival!" with three Equity cast members last Tuesday. (It runs through June 23.) 
Given the current economic reality, "Carnival" does not need a spectacular production, but it needs something spectacular. New vision, shining talents and grand ingenuity can transform the ordinary into the extraordinary. 
"Carnival!" is about a shoddy circus of lost souls, has-beens and never-was's.At its center, Lili, an innocent 16-year-old orphan, and Paul, a literally, spiritually and psychologically wounded dancer, take two and a half hours of stage time to admit they're in love.
A story about a third-rate troupe of desperate exhibitionists does not call for a third-rate production with desperate performances. Lamentably, in the festival's staging, Lili, on in years, seems moronic or spaced out, but hardly waiflike. When she arrives lugging her suitcase, the keeper of the souvenirs, a bully, calls her "child" and attempts to abuse her. Clearly, myopia is among his impairments. 
Given all the types and degrees of disorders detected here, this woebegone troupe could be transported from their small town "somewhere in France" to the nearest asylum. Given Lili's mindless disruption of the hazardous "leap for life" acrobatic act, eternal wandering seems her rightful destiny. 
The musical depends on Lili's irresistible enchantment. Straightaway, this production is in trouble. 
It doesn't help the vital cause of pathos that Paul's hostility is excessive beyond motivation, his brooding and depression too actorly. To these roles, Kate Dawson and Robert Cuccioli bring considerable vocal resources. Ms. Dawson's silvery soprano enhances Lili's songs, especially the lovely solo, "Mira." 
Mr. Cuccioli's resounding, popular baritone was either restrained for the futile cause of inner turmoil, or the singer had an off night. Either way, Paul's dramatic arias came off as effortfully understated.
Bob Merrill's fitful score shifts from dopiness to lyricism without blend. It is naive to credit it with beauty or cohesiveness. "Humming" is dumb filler; "Her Face," a heart-tugger. 
But even if "I've Got to Find a Reason" may sound treacly, interpretive power could make it heroic, as Brian Stokes Mitchell proved in New York last February. 
Michael Medeiros as Jacquot, assistant puppeteer to Paul, appears to have exclusive rights to charm and musical comedy finesse. Rosalie ("the incomparable") and Marco ("the magnificent") are traditionally annoying, here far more than tradition tolerates.
Because Lili actually believes that puppets are people, it is hard to figure director Bonnie J. Monte's choice of casting actors inside the dummies. Carrot Top is the only hand puppet in the show. 
Ms. Monte's staging and Kelly Garfield's skimpy dances are not seamless.
The festival has produced three musicals under Ms. Monte's leadership. One, "Two Gentlemen of Verona" (1996), was sensational. Now that the theater is New Jersey's first to be awarded $1 million under a new Dodge Foundation Strategic Partnership Grant, perhaps its musical mission can be reevaluated. 
After all, Shakespeare may be the festival's best source for everything.

Here A re Your Pills. Do You Want the Seminar?

BYLINE:  By MICHELLE ANDREWS; Michelle Andrews is a freelance writer in Manhattan specializing in health care. Her column on its economics appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: moneymeds @nytimes.com.

 BODY:
"THE pharmacist will see you now."
 At the Kerr Drug Store in Chapel Hill, N.C., customers can meet with a specially trained pharmacist who will check their cholesterol and suggest how to maintain acceptable levels. Or they can attend a stop-smoking clinic, take a bone-density test, receive information on diabetes or sign up for a course on women's health issues. (And, yes, they can have their prescriptions filled, too.) 
 Kerr is among a small but growing number of drugstores across the country trying to expand the definition of "pharmacy" to include a range of health management services. In this new guise, the pharmacist is no longer just a figure in a white lab coat behind the counter.
Many pharmacists believe that the new role is a natural for them, and consumer groups like the idea, too, because it expands patients' access to health care.
More and more, pharmacists are relinquishing traditional pill-dispensing duties to automation or to off-site centers. With the growth in the number of pharmacy technicians -- 111,000 have been certified since an exam became available in 1995 -- pharmacists can be relieved from routine chores like checking insurance coverage or ordering supplies.
Appointments at doctor's offices can be hard to arrange. But "pharmacies are accessible to people," said Eleni Anagnostiadis, executive director of the National Institute for Standards in Pharmacist Credentialing, which in 1998 began certifying pharmacists who receive extra training in disease management. "Patients see their pharmacist more often than their doctor," she said.
The number of pharmacies offering expanded patient care is still relatively small. The National Association of Chain Drug Stores puts it at about 500 of the 35,000 chain stores. Of the approximately 200,000 licensed pharmacists nationwide, 1,300 are certified to counsel patients on topics like diabetes, asthma, cholesterol management or blood clotting conditions. Thirty-two states allow pharmacists to give flu shots (they generally charge around $15), and pneumonia shots (about $25). 
But as drug therapy becomes more complex, many medical experts agree that it's time for more pharmacists to step out from behind the counter. Many hospitals already include pharmacists in patient management teams. "Doctors don't know enough about medications," said Charles Inlander, president of the People's Medical Society, a consumer advocacy group based in Allentown, Pa. 
Medication is either prescribed or administered in two-thirds of doctors' visits. Last year, 3.3 billion prescriptions were dispensed.
As long as pharmacists don't try to usurp the doctors' primary role in diagnosis and treatment, physicians are guardedly supportive of their entry into patient care. "Pharmacists provide a valuable service," said Dr. Richard Corlin, president of the American Medical Association. "But it's not that of being a junior physician."
Florida is the only state that lets pharmacists prescribe drugs independently, though only a limited number of medications, like certain allergy drugs. An additional 32 states let pharmacists modify medications with the approval of a doctor.
Pharmacists who want to expand their services face other obstacles. For one thing, there aren't enough of them. Chain drugstores reported more than 6,500 pharmacist vacancies in February, and some stores are reducing pharmacy hours because of staff shortages, said Crystal Wright, a spokeswoman for the National Association of Chain Drug Stores.
Insurance reimbursement is an even bigger stumbling block. Health insurers pay pharmacists a dispensing fee for each prescription. They don't generally pay for pharmacists' counseling about drugs or helping patients manage diseases, a function typically handled by doctors. "When you start paying for something, you stimulate a huge amount of business, and much of it is not medically necessary," said Dr. Donald Young, president of the Health Insurance Association of America, a trade group representing nearly 300 insurance companies.
Without dependable insurance reimbursement, pharmacies that offer more services piece together revenue through arrangements with employers or individual customers who pay out of pocket, say $15 for a cholesterol test to $75 to $100 for a 45-minute consultation on diabetes.
Right now, just 5 of the 115 Kerr Drug Stores in North Carolina and South Carolina are what the chain calls Enhanced Pharmaceutical Care Centers, with specially trained staff, private counseling rooms and meeting space for groups. The company said it believes that the changes will differentiate it from larger chains and help build customer loyalty, eventually increasing business.
For now, though, "it's a struggle financially" for these care centers, said Mark Gregory, Kerr's director of pharmacy. "Our goal is to break even."

Balancing Act

BYLINE:  By JOHN E. McCORMAC; John E. McCormac is the treasurer of New Jersey.

 BODY:
ON March 26, Governor James E. McGreevey presented a fiscal year 2003 budget that is rooted in two fundamental principles -- fiscal responsibility and fairness.
 The budget proposal achieves fiscal responsibility by controlling spending with an appropriations level at roughly that of fiscal 2002, the first time in many years that such a budgetary accomplishment has been achieved. The budget will reduce the number of state employees, cut overhead costs, and make state government more responsive and less wasteful. 
 The governor's budget achieves fairness by protecting the hard-working families of New Jersey with stable state aid to schools and municipalities and stable property-tax-relief programs for middle-class families, such as the Saver rebates. The budget also increases the Homestead Rebate checks to a maximum of $775 for the elderly and doubles the income eligibility for the Senior Property Tax Freeze Program. Finally, the proposal does not increase personal income tax rates or sales tax rates and maintains critical programs that directly affect our most vulnerable children, families and older citizens. 
Before proposing his own budget for fiscal year 2003, however, Governor McGreevey first had to restore order to a 2002 budget that was badly out of balance. Revenues were over $3 billion down from the original target, and new spending added nearly $500 million more to the shortfall. New Jersey had the worst problem in our history and one of the worst problems in the nation.
With the cooperation between the administration and the State Legislature, the 2002 budget was brought back into balance with $400 million in additional revenues, a $1.9 billion reduction in the remaining budgetary appropriations and the use of $1.2 billion in available surplus balances.
Without any action, the 2003 budget presented a $5.3 billion shortfall because of the continuation of the revenue reduction at $2.4 billion plus another $2.9 billion in statutory growth in appropriations. A determined effort to scrutinize all state spending line by line, division by division and department by department yielded nearly $3 billion in budget cuts for the coming year. Quite simply, we met the challenge of living within our means and held the line on spending.
As we work hard over the next several budgets to restore balance between recurring revenues and recurring appropriations, we are seeking to securitize the state's fiscal benefit from the tobacco industry settlement agreement, which means choosing guaranteed cash now instead of uncertain annual payments.
New Jersey proposes to join with 30 other governmental entities and remove the risks associated with this agreement that could jeopardize the future of this revenue stream. These uncertainties can be manifested in the continued litigation surrounding the tobacco industry in general and the agreement in particular. There is continuing decline in consumption of cigarettes, and the companies that are part of the settlement hold an increasingly smaller part of the market, which will decrease under the agreement.
The decision to securitize these proceeds is sound, and one likely to be considered even in good economic times. Private and institutional investors are more than willing to rely on the tobacco proceeds, so we are transferring those risks from Main Street to Wall Street.
While securitization provides New Jersey with a multiyear fix to its budget woes, it is only a temporary solution. We are seeking such permanent, structural soundness by making changes to the Corporate Business Tax and ensure that we reach in 2003 the original target of $1.823 billion contained in the 2002 budget.
Corporate tax collections have performed the worst of all major revenue sources in 2002 with actual revenues at barely half the original estimate. Left unchecked, corporate taxes would generate fewer real dollars in 2003 than in 1982, without any adjustment for inflation. Out of approximately 200,000 active corporations, roughly 77 percent pay only the statutory minimum of $200 in taxes to New Jersey. A single parent earning $25,000 pays more. The corporate tax as structured entices alternate business types, encourages transfer of ownership to out-of-state and offshore organizations and permits accounting maneuvers that export income and import deductions.
Our Corporate Business Tax reform proposal will eliminate these loopholes and ensure that all companies pay their fair share of taxes to New Jersey, including out-of-state entities that lack a physical presence but profit from their economic presence here. In fact, it will lessen the tax burden for small businesses in our state and level the playing field among and within all industries. Fairness and equity will be restored to our tax code.
New Jersey government remains committed to making investments that build on New Jersey's already strong and diversified economy. We continually build public and private partnerships that encourage new investment, create new jobs and enhance our standing as the most innovative and progressive state in the country for technology, health care, pharmaceutical and financial service industries.
The Wall Street rating agencies are watching, our investors are watching, and most importantly, our eight million citizens are watching. We shall put the state on the road to structural balance between recurring revenues and recurring appropriations. By keeping spending under control, by maintaining our long-term vision for capital expansion and by reforming our corporate tax structure, we have set out on a journey to restore fiscal responsibility and fairness to state finances. The 2003 budget is a giant step toward our achievable destination.

Rhyme but No Reason

BYLINE:  By JOHN J. FARMER Jr.; John J. Farmer Jr., of Stanton Station, was the attorney general of New Jersey Attorney from 1998 through 2001. He previously served as chief counsel to Gov. Christie Whitman.

 BODY:
It's springtime here in Trenton, Gov.
And though you're gone, your name
Is on the new folks' lips each day
 With some new form of blame. 
They've blamed you for each crisis, 
They're awfully glad you're out.
They'd blame you for the Bible's flood
If they hadn't for our drought.
They've blamed you for the deficit
Though New York's is the same.
They've blamed you for recession
But recession barely came.
They've blamed you for the borrowing
On roads and schools and spaces.
They've blamed you for the air we breathe.
They've blamed you with straight faces.
They've railed against indebtedness:
"Beware the interest mounting."
Now they say "securitize"
And hope nobody's counting.
And they're not raising taxes
In the budget, merely "fees,"
And they're not cutting aid,
It's just a "necessary freeze."
They're taxing corporations
But they hope they don't uproot them.
And as for bears they shrug and say,
"Can't live with them, can't shoot them."
They're squeezing aid to colleges
Which'll only raise tuition.
They lack the guts for layoffs
So we're paying for attrition.
The property tax blame you took
Was vicious and unending.
But that's not Trenton's problem,
Now that they're in Trenton spending.
They've frozen aid to urban schools
Without street demonstrations;
No motions filed, no further talk
Of wasted generations.
They've frozen aid to cities,
They've frozen aid to towns.
Our local taxes will go up
Our rebates will come down.
There'll be no cameras in cop cars
But guess what, Gov.? That's fine.
Reform can wait, the reverends say,
"She's gone now; take your time."
The Court is dumb now, so they say
It's filled with her attorneys.
But Handler, Pollock and O'Hern
Were Byrne's, not Bert and Ernie's.
And what of Long and Coleman,
Two career appellate jurists?
Are they dumb too or just not right
For race and gender purists?
They say they'll find a genius
They'll search the high and low
For nominees with "gravitas"
Like non-Colonel Santiago.
And government, they say, will change
Its conduct of affairs.
But things look all too similar
And so the press just stares
As jobs are added or are filled
With friends of union bosses,
While each new problem is addressed
With commissions or task forces.
Is it that you're female?
Is it that you're rich?
Or is it that Republicans
Are bait for every switch?
Yes, it's springtime here in Trenton, Gov.
But some things stay the same --
New grasses bring hay fever
While the asses lay the blame.

Mold Can Be an Insurance Mess for Homeowners

BYLINE:  By DAN MICHALSKI 

 BODY:
FOR the last two months, Bob and Kathy McCord have been suburban refugees. They were forced out of their four-bedroom house in Dallas because of toxic mold, which they say has been festering under the floors and walls since a water pipe burst this spring.
 "The mold got so bad," said Mr. McCord, 52, president of a Web site development company, "that as soon as you walked in that place it burned your eyes and nose." 
 After leaving their house, the McCords spent the first few weeks at a local Summerfield Suites hotel, where they said they met seven other families in similar ordeals. But with the mold removal not yet complete, and negotiations continuing with their insurer over what work still needs to be done, they recently decided to sign a 90-day apartment lease. 
Stories about toxic mold creeping through homes, schools and other buildings, sickening and displacing their occupants, have become more common in recent years, particularly in regions with warm, wet climates, like Florida and parts of Texas and California. 
Of course, mold has always been around. Most of it, though unattractive, is harmless, like the kind you might find growing in the shower stall. But more serious strains of slimy greenish-black fungus have been appearing lately, including Stachybotrys atra, Aspergillus and Penicillium, which produce toxic substances that can cause respiratory problems in some people.
Many scientists believe that today's more tightly sealed, energy-efficient homes are more susceptible to mold growth. They are also looking into the role that powerful air-conditioning systems may play in spreading mold spores throughout a house or building, as well as changes in the formula for some drywall, which some believe may also be a contributing factor in mold growth.
Whatever the reasons, some insurance experts say the problem threatens to become as serious financially as asbestos has been: a potential health hazard that could cost the industry billions of dollars. While the number of claims has risen, so have mold-related lawsuits, driven in part by a few large jury awards of late. (More than 5,000 mold-related lawsuits are pending in state courts against insurers by disgruntled policy holders, according to the Insurance Information Institute in New York.)
No hard data is available, but insurance companies estimate that more than 10,000 families nationwide have been forced out of their homes because of toxic mold the last two years. In Texas alone, insurers paid $1.2 billion in mold claims last year, while a family from the Austin suburb of Dripping Springs won a $32 million judgment against their homeowner insurance company, Farmers Insurance, for mold-related damages to their 22-room house. The judgment included punitive and legal fees as well as about $6 million for repairs, though the state court would not consider the family's medical claims.
Insurers say average bills for most mold claims run from $30,000 to $50,000.
Though taxing for the insurers, the consumer may ultimately have to pay a good part of the price for combatting mold -- through diminished coverage and higher premiums.
Across the country, annual homeowner policy premiums have already risen 7 to 8 percent this year from last year, to around $500, on average, according to Robert P. Hartwig, chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute. He blamed mold claims for a large portion of the increase and said premiums were expected to rise a few more percentage points next year as more claims are expected.
In Texas, which has the nation's highest average homeowners premium -- just under $1,000 a year -- residents can expect premiums to increase, on average, by 40 to 60 percent this year, according to the Texas Department of Insurance. People with previous water damage claims, and mold problems, may face even higher rates.
Some insurers, though, have been trying to get out of mold coverage altogether. Over the last six months, major companies -- from Allstate to Nationwide to State Farm -- have been petitioning state insurance regulatory agencies to let them exclude mold from homeowners policies. So far, 35 states have approved some sort of mold exclusions, like eliminating coverage for water problems caused by a lack of maintenance on the part of homeowners. Louisiana, for example, has eliminated all mold coverage, while North Carolina has put a $5,000 cap on mold-related payouts.
Legislators in some states are trying to add protection for consumers. California recently passed the Toxic Mold Protection Act, which forces insurers to offer mold coverage and mandates that homeowners disclose previous water or mold problems when selling a house. New York is considering similar legislation, while Maryland and New Jersey passed bills this year to study health risks associated with mold.
Last fall, the Texas Department of Insurance allowed carriers to phase out coverage for mold for all new homeowner policies. But in January, it allowed carriers to offer "enhanced water coverage," which essentially sells back the excluded protection, at an average annual cost of $2,000. Under the new policies, Texas homeowners can expect insurers to pay for the actual removal of mold and the replacement of rotted walls, floors, and furniture, but not for testing or the expense of living in a hotel while work is done.
Consumer advocates advise all homeowners to check their policies regularly, understanding fully what is and isn't covered, and to keep abreast of the insurance regulations in their states.
Consumers are learning that it takes vigilance to ensure that mold claims are paid and cleanup work is thorough. In most cases, only "sudden or accidental" discharges of water are covered in claims. 
MARGARET CRUZ, 67, of Bedford, Tex., says she has spent more than two months in negotiations with her insurance company over the cleanup of her home, which was contaminated with mold after a plumbing backup. Now living in a local hotel, she is still unsure about what repairs are covered.
Mr. McCord, whose current homeowner policy still covers certain water damage, said: "It's been a battle every step of the way. You have to follow this thing step by step, inch by inch, if you want it to be handled right."
He said he has had to prove that a burst pipe, not lack of maintenance, was responsible for the water problems in his home and subsequent mold growth. Paul Berry, a spokesman for USAA, the McCords' insurer, said he could not comment directly on their case. He said, however, that his company responds promptly to all mold and water claims and thoroughly investigates them.
Insurers say they have been trying to educate consumers about mold. "What we do is help our customers with a rapid-response team" as soon as water damage is reported to the company, said Ray Baray, another USAA spokesman. "This is a challenge for the entire industry."
But, he added, "there is a lack of standards with mold, and the science just isn't there." 
Obviously, the best way to deal with mold is to stop it early. That means promptly addressing any water problems, by keeping dry all furniture and the areas under carpets, along baseboards and behind appliances. And if you're buying a home, have it inspected for mold.
Most medical experts agree that brief exposure to toxic molds can make eyes itchy but usually does not seriously affect health. Long-term exposure, they say, could lead to respiratory problems.
Consumer groups say that affected homeowners should try to choose their own contractors for the mold cleanup after they file their insurance claims, and they recommend regular testing. If your insurer will not pay for tests, they suggest hiring a testing company on your own. It can be expensive: on-site testing can run $600 to $3,000.
But there are cheaper alternatives. For example, Mold Testing Lab of St. Petersburg, Fla., (www.moldtestinglab.com) says that for $40 it can help you assemble your own test kit out of household materials. Samples are sent to the company's laboratories and results are promised within 24 hours.
Last week, Mr. McCord had his home tested for a third time and, again, it showed unsatisfactory levels of Aspergillus and Penicillium. He and his wife had hoped to reclaim their house this summer, but they are growing more doubtful. 
These days, each time he visits his house to check the cleanup, he dons a $25 biohazard respirator. "We're hoping for the best," he said, "preparing for the worst."

Looking to Suburbs to Map 9/11's Reach

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton; This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
ONE of the many mysteries left in the wake of Sept. 11 is just how hard the attack on the World Trade Center hit New York City's economy. Really hard, obviously.
 But how hard, exactly? And how much of the past year's economic carnage came from the national recession, rather than from the disaster in Lower Manhattan? 
 One place to look for an answer is the suburbs. And particularly the "suburb" that is New York State's second-largest economy: Long Island. 
The New York region is so tightly linked that many economists consider the whole schmear, from Fairfield County in Connecticut down to Staten Island, east to the Hamptons and west well into New Jersey, to be a single economy.
In the past the region has often behaved that way. From 1989 through 1992, New York City lost 9 percent of its jobs; Long Island lost 8 percent; Westchester lost 7 percent; no one was thrilled.
But this time around, things are different. Because while New York City has been suffering, Westchester, Rockland and especially Long Island have been doing pretty darn well, thank you very much.
Want to see some numbers? (If not, feel free to skip the next few paragraphs.) In the 12 months ending in April, New York City lost 107,3000 jobs, a 2.9 percent drop; nationally, the job count was down about 1.1 percent in the same period.
Almost all of the surrounding areas had job gains, particularly Long Island, where the number of jobs actually edged up by more than 8,000, or 0.7 percent. Rockland and Westchester Counties rose 0.2 percent. Unemployment rates show the same pattern. The jobless rate reflects where people live, not where they work, and is almost always higher in the city than anywhere within commuting distance. But it has climbed faster in the city over the last year than in the adjacent areas.
In April, the most recent month for which there is data, the jobless rate in the city was 7.5 percent, up 2.2 points in 12 months. In Westchester, Rockland and on Long Island, unemployment is below 4 percent, and in each place has increased by roughly one percentage point in a year. 
All of this tends to suggest that the crater in New York City's economy was, indeed, caused by terrorists.
To be sure, New York City's economy had started softening well before Sept. 11, and the jobs that disappeared earlier in 2001 cannot be blamed on the calamity.
But, adjusting for seasonal factors, 67,000 jobs vanished during the last quarter of the year, said Jason Bram, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the disruptions of the trade center attack can probably be blamed for most of those losses. During that period, he noted, employment on Long Island was basically stable. 
But he and other economic gurus agree that there are other factors that help account for the differences between the city and the outlying areas.
One, obviously, is size; the city's economy dwarfs those of the northern suburbs, and by some measures is twice as large as the economy of Connecticut. Even Long Island doesn't have half the jobs of the city.
The workers outside the city tend to be wealthier and better educated than those in the five boroughs as a whole, and the places where they work are different, too. For one thing, those places tend to be smaller, said Marc Goloven, an economist at J. P. Morgan. Smaller firms are less likely to have the wholesale layoffs that have afflicted big companies in the city. 
After Long Island's defense industry went into a tailspin in the 1980's, the economy there was transformed to contain a wide diversity of smaller businesses, many of them involved in technology, said Gary E. Huth, the Long Island analyst for the New York State Department of Labor. Other areas of the state now look at Nassau and Suffolk Counties as a model.
Certain businesses that have been slammed by the recession or the economic aftermath of Sept. 11 -- stock brokerages, advertising agencies, garment factories -- are just a lot less important outside the city. "We don't have Broadway," Mr. Huth said. "Some of the reverberations just didn't reach out as far" as Long Island.
Long Island's economy has not been untouched, he added, and unemployed people there are having a tough time. But compared to the city, he said, "In general, things have been better here."

Fares Don't Rise, So Airlines Struggle

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
LAST week, US Airways became the largest airline to apply to the government for loan guarantees, which would help it raise $1 billion for a revamping. 
 Airline stocks fell, continuing a long-term decline. Susan M. Donofrio, the airline analyst at Deutsche Bank, talked last week about the struggling industry. Following are excerpts from the conversation.

Q. What is wrong with the airline industry right now?

A. What is working against the industry right now is a lack of fare increases, growing low-fare competition and uncertainties surrounding airport security.

Q. Why have airlines been unable to impose lasting fare increases since Sept. 11?

A. Demand is still very tenuous and highly price-sensitive. As a result, there have been some airlines that have not been willing to go along with fare increases. We also think that from a supply standpoint, although the airlines are doing a very good job of matching supply to demand, that there is still too much capacity out there. Those are the two biggest reasons. And we think the third reason that fare increases haven't been sticking is that consumers are much more price-conscious, which is typical when an economy is in the early stages of a recovery.

Q. Who is helping to keep fares low?

A. These airlines would be AirTran, Alaska and Southwest, just to name a few. They are actually continuing to grow positively year over year because their revenue strategies do tend to thrive in this kind of environment. We also note that new competitor JetBlue is also expected to put pressure on overall air fares.

Q. How big of a problem for airlines is fear of terrorism?

A. Certainly, the fears of terrorism are not helping bring passengers back to the airports. But I also think another reason is the inconsistency with respect to how long it takes to get through an airport. That hassle factor is also keeping people away.

Q. In terms of traffic, where is the industry compared with before Sept. 11?

A. We are still not back where we were pre-9/11. I would say traffic fell off about 30 percent year-over-year right after 9/11. And now traffic is down roughly 15 percent year-over-year.

Q. How serious are airline labor problems?

A. Many of the airlines are purposefully dragging their feet as we await whether United or US Airways are able to get the wage concessions they are currently trying to extract from labor. So we think, as a result, it is going to be a quiet year on the labor front even though we have contracts that are amendable at American, Alaska, Continental and Southwest.

Q. Which airlines are strong and which are weak?

A. America West, United and US Airways have indicated that they are thinking about or have applied for a loan guarantee. We would consider them the weaker players. We think at the other extreme are strong airlines that we think have a healthy liquidity balance and are not likely to need any government assistance. Those major airlines would be American, Continental, Delta, Northwest and Southwest.

Q. Which are the strong smaller airlines?

A. AirTran Airways, Alaska. I also think JetBlue has certainly shown financial strength as well. So those would be the stronger smaller-cap airlines. The weaker ones would be ATA, America West and Vanguard.

Q. Are airline stocks near bottom?

A. We think we are going to continue to see sluggish performance with a downward bias to stock prices because earnings estimates are still falling for the airlines. We also have found that, seasonally, the summertime has not been the best time for airline stocks. So we would anticipate a 10 percent to 15 percent pullback over the summertime in airline stocks.
We think that toward the summer's end is when we will start to see a capacity scaleback. And we think as we head into the fall we are likely to see fare increases, and we believe that will be the catalyst to get this group moving again.

Q. What airline stocks should investors consider buying?

A. They should buy the airlines that are positioned best to outperform once industry revenues begin to recover. On the large-cap side, those airlines would Delta and Continental. On the smaller-cap side, those airlines would be Skywest, Atlantic Coast and Alaska.

Q. What is your longer-term view for airlines?

A. We believe the industry certainly has been dealt a blow with 9/11. But we think that financially it is hurt but not broken.

You Earned Your Wings, So Return to the Nest

BYLINE:  By ABBY ELLIN; Abby Ellin is a Manhattan writer. Her column on starting out in the world of money appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: preludes@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
NO matter how you slice it, the trend of returning to the nest after college is not much fun. For four years, you had autonomy, all-night escapades and the chance to run around the world as if you owned it. Then, one June day, your universe collapses like a warped mortarboard. Health insurance disappears. Loans kick in. With no money and no job, you often have no choice but to go home to your parents.
 I know about this first hand. After receiving a bachelor's degree in communications more than a decade ago, I moved into my parents' home in the Boston suburb where I grew up. Never mind that two years earlier I was hitchhiking my way across Egypt, Israel and Europe and following the Grateful Dead in the United States. Never mind that I'd been living in my own apartment and preparing my own meals. The truth was bitter: I was penniless and jobless, and the country was in a recession. 
 I always saw myself as more of a "balloon" than a "boomerang," a term used to describe offspring who come home after being away. But apparently my balloon was made of lead: I was stuck in that house for almost three years. It was not pretty. 
My mother saw it this way: "It was awful."
That was in 1990, but the world today is much like that one. A poll in March by MonsterTrak, an online job site, found that 60 percent of 1,942 students questioned planned to live at home after graduation. They may have little choice. The 1.2 million college graduates this year will leave school with more debt than ever -- around $20,000, on average, for students with loans, the General Accounting Office says. And they can expect to earn only in the high $20,000's to low $30,000's, on average, compared with the high $30,000's and low $40,000's just two years ago, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the job placement firm. Some experts estimate that new graduates may need up to six months to find jobs in their chosen fields.
New graduates are often afflicted with what I call Benjamin Braddock Syndrome, for the character in "The Graduate": the sense that life will be rather bleak for the foreseeable future. A 1995 study by Barbara Mitchell and Ellen Gee, two sociologists at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia, found that "boomerang" children feel like failures because they have been delayed in reaching their goals. 
Jack Harari, 21, graduated last month from the University of Wisconsin with a degree in television and film. Now he's living in Pleasantville, N.Y., with his parents, but the situation seems far from pleasant. He shares the car with them; if he wants to use it, he wakes up at 8 a.m. and drives his mother to work. He's looking for a job -- ideally in his major -- but knows he probably won't find anything paying close to the $30,000 he thinks he needs to move into Manhattan. (I didn't have the heart to tell him that's not nearly enough.) 
"The issue is, do I live here and save my money and jeopardize my sanity, or do I move out, live off peanuts and maintain my mental health?" he said. While he appreciates everything his parents are doing, and acknowledges that they are all trying to accommodate one another, he resents having to come home. "I feel like I'm younger than I was two weeks ago. A few years ago I was living on my own, traveling around Australia."
Of course, he knows he has it fairly easy, as I did when I lived at home. Not all parents are so generous. 
Cynthia S. Graves, co-author of "Grown-Up Children Who Won't Grow Up" (Prima, 1994) recommends that parents set ground rules, like asking their new roommate to pay rent and charging interest if it's late. Mothers shouldn't fall into maid mode. "Make sure they do their own laundry and buy their own toiletries," she said. "It teaches them good budgeting skills." 
She also advises setting a time limit for their stay, say a year, and kicking them out once it is up. Above all, she said, don't provide cash. "Go buy them groceries if they need it, but don't give them money," she said. "Don't say, 'I can't afford it,' either, because that immediately engages them in a discussion. Just say, 'I'm not comfortable giving you money.' "
Ms. Graves is lucky that she doesn't live in Italy, where her tough-love approach might not fly. In April, a court ruled in favor of Marco Andreoli, 28, who was suing his father for child support. The younger Mr. Andreoli was living with his mother and being supported by his father, who argued that his son had solid work qualifications and access to a $200,000 trust fund. But the courts said the son wasn't responsible for keeping himself if "labor conditions do not satisfy his specific qualifications, his attitudes and his real interests so long as there is a reasonable possibility of satisfying his aspirations within a limited time."
I SUPPOSE it's a good thing that we don't have laws like that here -- most of us might never leave home. The other side of all this, of course, is that many European countries have filial laws, which mean that it's the child's duty to support his parents in their old age. "In the U.S. you don't have to support an elderly parent unless they're destitute," said Laura W. Morgan, a family lawyer at Family Law Consulting in Charlottesville, Va. "In Europe, where families tend to be much closer, the duty is greater." 
Sometimes duty imposes itself on you. As my mother often tells me, she will sell the house in Boston in another few decades, pack up the belongings and move to Manhattan, landing in my home like a Frisbee. It will be up to me to take care of her.
Fair is fair, I guess. Or so she says.

Hotels Are Adjusting to a Travel Slump. Are Their Stocks?

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH KELLEHER 

 BODY:
BUSINESSES are still cutting back on employee travel, and hotel profits remain weak. Yet some investors say those are signs to buy hotel chains' shares.
 Michael Rietbrock, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in New York, said he expects a "powerful" rally in the sector in the first half of next year, precisely because the last year has been so awful. In some ways, he said, the recent slump has helped the industry, by limiting construction of new hotels and by pushing the chains into some serious cost-cutting. 
 That view is not universal among industry experts. Bjorn Hanson, who manages the hospitality consulting unit at PricewaterhouseCoopers, says the companies' share prices, which have generally recovered from their September lows, already reflect that good news. Stock prices of larger hoteliers could go up a little more, he said, but "the risk is, if business travel doesn't recover by year-end, people will become impatient" and prices could plummet. 
Hotel occupancy in the first quarter was 55.6 percent, on average, down from 58.9 percent in the corresponding period last year, according to Smith Travel Research in Hendersonville, Tenn. Room rates have been down each month since September, compared with the year-earlier periods. 
With business travel down, hotels have been offering discounts to vacationers and conventioneers, said Laura Paugh, a vice president of Marriott International in Bethesda, Md. "We watch profit reports from companies like I.B.M. to predict when business travel will come back," she said.
Analysts who expect that business will rebound soon are recommending shares of some of the big chains, like Marriott, Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide and Hilton Hotels. 
"The debate is: Do you feel the economic recovery is strong?" said Bernard Winograd, president of Prudential Investment Management in Newark, who is bullish on the lodging stocks. Mr. Winograd added that increases in hotel occupancy levels tend to be tightly correlated with growth in the gross domestic product. "We are fairly optimistic about the economy and so are positive" toward these companies, he said. 
BANKS have not financed much new hotel construction recently, and PricewaterhouseCoopers projects growth of 1 to 2 percent in the number of hotel rooms nationwide each year for the next three years. That compares with 4 percent in 1999, 3 percent in 2000 and 2 percent last year.
Big hotels, meanwhile, have eliminated jobs and consolidated services ranging from reservation centers to laundries. Some hotels have begun changing linens less often for guests staying multiple nights. "Customers are not complaining," said Keith Mills, an analyst at UBS Warburg in New York.
J. Cogan, an analyst at Banc of America Securities in San Francisco, prefers hotel companies that own properties over those, like Marriott, that manage hotels or franchise their brands. Owners, Mr. Cogan contends, will benefit faster when travel resumes. 
He particularly favors Starwood, which generates almost three-fourths of its income through ownership of Sheraton, Westin, W and St. Regis hotels.
Joyce Minor, an analyst at Lehman Brothers in New York, said Starwood's stock is trading at 9.3 times her 2002 estimate for Ebitda -- earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- a measure of cash flow. Her 12-month price target on the stock is $45, which assumes that it can trade at 10 times her 2003 estimate of Ebitda for a year from now. It now trades at $33.27.
Although Hilton owns only 65 of the 2,015 hotels it controls, those properties are marquee names in big cities and account for 70 percent of its cash flow. In the last four quarters, Hilton's earnings exceeded analysts' expectations, Mr. Cogan said. "Yet it's valued lower than its peers," he added, at less than eight times projected cash flow for 2003.
He has a $20 price target on the stock for the next 12 months. The shares closed on Friday at $13.28.
Ms. Minor favors Marriott. While not a hotel owner, Marriott gains "incentive fees" if hotel profits rise, and it says it expects a 6 percent increase in Marriott-brand hotels both this year and next. She expects its price-to-earnings ratio of 22, based on her 2002 earnings estimate, to reach 26.5 in a year, based on her 2003 earnings estimate. Her 12-month target price is $54; the shares now trade at $38.11.
Mr. Mills at UBS Warburg is not bullish on the industry for the near term, but he has one recommendation: Extended Stay America, based in Spartanburg, S.C. He calls the chain, a low-cost leader, "the Southwest Airlines in the hotel industry." 
The company owns 446 hotels and plans to build 24 more this year, relying mostly on its own cash. Mr. Mills has a 12-month price target of $19 on the stock; it closed on Friday at $15.76.
Ms. Minor acknowledged that hotel occupancy rates had not picked up as quickly as she had hoped and said the stocks are richly priced for now. "We would buy on weakness," she said. 
Mr. Rietbrock said he thinks waiting could be a mistake.
"You may not see it coming," he said, referring to a resurgence of business trips, booked only a few days in advance. "You want to own these stocks."

As the Tech Economy Goes, So Go Special Visas

BYLINE:  By RICK GREEN 

 BODY:
ONE of the last remaining bubbles of the high-technology boom has burst.
 Applications by foreign workers for long-term H-1B work visas plunged by nearly half in the first six months of the government's fiscal year, according to new data from the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Perhaps more significant, approvals of the visas fell by more than one-third. The H-1B, granted to highly skilled foreigners to help fill jobs when no qualified Americans can be found, has been an important recruiting tool for technology companies. 
 The decline has not, however, quieted critics of the H-1B program, who say it was used during more prosperous times to displace American citizens with foreigners willing to work for less money. Now that companies are laying off workers, the critics contend, there is no reason to import labor. Congress, they say, should lower the ceiling on the number of H-1B visas granted. 
Supporters of the program say the quota should remain the same, because more imported workers will be needed when the economy heats up again.
The H-1B visas, which are work permits good for up to six years, are given to professionals with four-year degrees and specialized skills. They are coveted both by employers and would-be immigrants because the visas are ideally suited for long-term work projects and often serve as a first step toward permanent residence status.
H-1B's were in such short supply a few years ago that employers pressed Congress to raise the ceiling to 115,000 in 1999, from 65,000 the year before. It was raised again, to 195,000, in 2001. But the new cap is unlikely to be reached this year.
Halfway through this fiscal year, only 105,800 applications had been filed for visas covered by the cap, said the I.N.S., down 48 percent from the first six months of fiscal 2001. Approval was given to 44,900, down 38 percent.
"The H-1B numbers have finally caught up with the economy," said Mark D. Shevitz, director of marketing at VisaNow.com, an immigration processing service based in Chicago that tracks I.N.S. data.
In 2000 and 2001, the supply of H-1B visas was exhausted in a matter of months.
The government figures are not complete, focusing only on applicants who count against the annual cap. Not included are certain exempt workers with unique knowledge, such as scientists working at national research institutes. The comparisons were also skewed by a large number of extra applications in 2001 as employers hurried to beat an I.N.S. fee increase.
Nevertheless, it is clear to immigration experts that economic weakness has put a damper on demand for foreign workers. Business is down at many technology companies, which accounted for more than half of all H-1B employees in previous years.
Instead, companies are more likely to hire laid-off United States citizens. For foreigners, that means it is no longer good enough to be merely well-educated. 
"It definitely lessens the demand for the cookie-cutter H-1B," said Daryl R. Buffenstein, general counsel for the American Immigration Lawyers Association in Washington.
Economic weakness or not, said Theresa Cardinal Brown, director of immigration policy at the Chamber of Commerce in Washington, American universities are still not producing enough advanced mathematics and science graduates, so employers must look overseas.
Critics of the H-1B program are not so sure. "You can't convince me there's not a U.S. citizen available," said Representative Tom Tancredo, Republican of Colorado, who introduced a bill in November to roll back the H-1B ceiling to the 1998 level of 65,000. 
Mr. Tancredo and some labor advocates say employers are merely using the visas to import cheaper workers. He pointed to Qwest Communications, based in Denver, which he said had been hiring foreign workers in the last two years even as it was eliminating more than 10,000 jobs.
Chris Hardman, a Qwest spokesman, declined to say how many H-1B workers the company employed, or whether it was hiring new ones. "We hire the most qualified person for the position," he said, adding that Qwest is training American workers to reduce reliance on foreign specialists.
Mr. Tancredo conceded that his bill would probably never come to a vote, but said he hoped to create pressure that would prevent the program from expanding. The ceiling is scheduled to revert to 65,000 in 2004 unless Congress acts sooner.

The Impossible Demands On America's Airlines

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
FEW American industries have to meet the demands that the public makes of the airlines. People want carriers to operate with the reliability of utilities, providing frequent flights on-time, at low cost and with cozy amenities. But the airlines are also supposed to thrive as businesses in a competitive marketplace, earning enough profits to expand their operations and enrich shareholders. This tightrope act has never been easy to pull off, with big carriers taking financial nosedives and customers growing increasingly disgruntled since deregulation in 1978.
 Yet the public continues to treat the industry as an almost ungainly hybrid of state and private interests, an approach that is highlighted by the government's bailout of the airlines. 
 On Monday, US Airways filed for a $900 million federal loan guarantee as part of a $15 billion aid package put together by Congress last fall. Immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks, the government agreed to give $5 billion, or $18 per resident of the United States, to the faltering industry. Such handouts have raised few eyebrows, though self-sufficiency is one of the paramount mantras of American business. People want assurances that the airlines will keep flying, just as they want water companies to keep providing their resources.
"Transportation is supposed to serve all people," said Alfred E. Kahn, a professor of political economy at Cornell University who oversaw deregulation as president of the Civil Aeronautics Board. "It is crucial to the rest of the economy, like electric power."
Because of that, the government tends to treat the industry like a prodigal child, though critics say such parenting distorts market forces. Even before last fall, when the terrorist attacks led to unprecedented government intervention in both security and financial support, federal officials kept more oversight over the airlines than most other industries. For example, President Bush invoked an arcane labor act twice last year to avert airline strikes; the Justice Department blocked United Airlines' proposed buyout of US Airways in July; and the Transportation Department publishes monthly consumer reports that rate the various carriers.
Deregulation never entirely removed the government's hand from the industry, and in some ways it actually strengthened the perception of the airlines as utilities. Pre-1978 air travel, with its fixed prices, was the accepted domain of the wealthy. After deregulation, prices plummeted because of open competition, and air travel emerged as this country's national mass transit system, as crucial to daily life as highways and subways.
Nothing has done more in recent memory to brand the industry as a public interest than the bailout program. Legislators agreed to enact it just 11 days after the attacks. By contrast, the city of New York, a true public entity, has had to plead and cajole for its billions of dollars in aid.
"We have this feeling in this country, a residual feeling from regulated days, that the airlines have a responsibility to us," said Joe Brancatelli, an advocate of cheaper fares for business travelers. "We should realize these are the kind of people who want to take our money. We never bailed out Enron and we never bailed out Kmart."
Many industry experts say the initial $5 billion cash infusion was a necessary life preserver. But the $10 billion loan guarantee program is another matter, and critics argue that it is propping up businesses that would fail in a completely Darwinian arena. That debate is heating up over the case of US Airways, the country's sixth-largest airline, which lost $269 million last quarter and $2 billion last year.
The carrier is far bigger than any previous applicant. Of the eight airlines that have applied, two have been rejected and one -- America West -- has been approved, getting $380 million last December. The government demanded the option to buy a third of the airline's stock, further blurring the line between public and private domains.
Airlines in this country and abroad have long been regarded as national symbols, and that helps explain why the public did not raise much protest over the taxpayer-financed bailout. Even before the attacks, the American government protected its airlines by limiting terminal slots allotted to foreign carriers and preventing those carriers from flying domestic routes, restrictions common around the world.
"Protectionist attitudes can be very tempting when times are tough, but in fact liberalization would make it easier to cope with tough times," Rod Eddington, chief executive of British Airways, said at a recent luncheon in New York. "Why should we be special?"
IN some ways, the government has supported the airlines more than its own transportation babies, like Amtrak. It has played a more active role in subsidizing airport construction than overhauling crumbling rails. It denied Amtrak $3.2 billion that it requested for security upgrades after Sept. 11, only to take on the costly task of federalizing airport security.
Even in regard to labor issues, the airlines are treated as if they were a vital public interest, often to the chagrin of both management and unions. The Railway Labor Act, a law adopted in 1926 that applies only to the railroad and airline industries, forces workers and management into a collective bargaining process so as not to disrupt service. If talks fail, the National Mediation Board can order both parties into a 30-day "cooling off" period.
After that, workers can still be prevented from striking through an executive order. No other private industry has such an involved labor law intended for the public's interest.
When things go wrong with air travel, customers often complain not only to the airlines, but to the government. "When I complain to my congressmen about the hotel industry, I get a polite letter saying they feel my pain," said Michael E. Levine, a former airline executive who teaches government regulation at Harvard Law School. "Nobody introduces a bill to regulate the hotel industry. But on airlines, they threaten to hold hearings."
Still, in many respects, the airlines do not fit neatly into the role of a utility. The flights of major carriers arrive on-schedule roughly 80 percent of the time, for example, and federal officials do little to enforce better performance. If water appeared only 8 out of 10 times a faucet was turned on, the government would surely take action.

HEADLINE: Bush Doctrine: Lock 'Em Up 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
PICKING through conflicting evidence last week, the 12 cloistered jurors in Houston trying to decide whether Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm, is guilty of obstruction of justice became the first laboratory in the Bush administration's risky response to the wave of corruption that seems to be engulfing much of corporate America.
 As the jury deliberated, Washington officials held out the case as the model of how to respond -- with quickness and aggressiveness -- to the growing crisis of confidence in business among investors in particular and the public in general. Since the Enron-Andersen scandal broke late last year, the business news pages have been dominated by tales of questionable practices at companies like Global Crossing, Tyco International, Adelphia Communications and ImClone Systems. The market has continued to plunge, and fearful policy makers have decided to stress swift justice -- what some are calling "real time" enforcement -- over the promulgation of new rules. 
 A series of high-profile investigations and cases will yield the desired results, the administration and its appointees believe. A few modest legislative and regulatory proposals, like one last week requiring chief executives to personally certify financial statements, will complete the trick, they say, without the far-reaching legislation and regulation proposed largely by the Democrats. To Republicans, there's no need for stringent proposals to limit the consulting activities of accounting firms, sharper restrictions on stock options issued to executives, broad conflict-of-interest rules for stock analysts or greater access to the courts for stockholders.
At bottom, what separates the Democratic and Republican approaches is a philosophical difference about the role of government and its relationship to the marketplace, as well as a different diagnosis of the root of the problems. The Democrats see the steady stream of corporate failures as a symptom of broad systemic problems. Republicans say it is more a case of a few bad apples, not a fundamentally deformed tree.
"I think people who abuse our trust, we ought to hang them from the very highest branch," Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said in a speech on Thursday. 
Citing "unethical behavior of a few notorious company executives," he added: "These cases are infrequent, but even a few bad cases can poison confidence in our system, which depends on entrusting public company managers with investors' capital. We will never be able to write rules that anticipate every possible subterfuge. Nonetheless, we must take action to restore investor confidence in the accuracy of public company information."
Administration officials like Lawrence B. Lindsey, the president's top economic adviser, as well as Harvey L. Pitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, have warned that some of the more far-reaching proposals by the Democrats would be ineffective, if not downright counterproductive.
The sheer image of executives pleading the Fifth before the klieg lights of Congress, as Kenneth L. Lay, the former chairman of Enron, and Samuel D. Waksal, the former chief executive of ImClone, have done, has begun to motivate directors across America to rethink the way they oversee companies, compensate executives and scrutinize accounting practices. 
"The Justice Department realizes that businesses and the financial world don't want any trouble at all with investigators," said E. Lawrence Barcella Jr., a former federal prosecutor who now specializes in white-collar cases. "Even acquittals will not lessen the reaction of corporate America."
BUT some critics in industry and academia question the effectiveness and consistency of this approach. They say that the Justice Department, for instance, has taken a harder line on white-collar cases of late, but that it has also shown considerable leniency in other areas. Most notably, they point to the antitrust case against Microsoft, which was settled by the Bush administration on terms that rival companies and nine states have said were far too lenient.
Equally important, some experts say, tougher enforcement requires more money and more staffing than most agencies now have. To date, the Bush administration has rejected requests from its own officials for additional financing in this area.
In some eyes, the administration's strategy is partially an attempt to distance itself from Enron executives who enjoyed personal ties to senior officials from President Bush on down (as well as to some prominent Democrats).
"When you think back to when this prosecution happened, it may have saved the administration," said Ronald J. Gilson, a specialist in corporate governance at Stanford Law School. "Suddenly, it was the administration's favorite energy guys at Enron and their accountants who were getting rolled. You look tough. You bring in a prosecutor. You set that engine in motion and get a big bang."
Legal experts also wonder whether prosecutions like the one against Andersen, which was Enron's auditor, are going overboard, and whether they are simply blunting more effective reforms. Many experts, for instance, have questioned the societal value of prosecuting Andersen as a firm, instead of individuals, thus hastening the demise of a major accounting firm in a profession that already suffers from being an oligopoly. That strategy also effectively killed the proposed reform measures that Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman brought in to advise Andersen, had hoped would rekindle the firm's onetime image as a model of rectitude and professionalism.
"What have we won by this expensive circus?" asked James D. Cox, an expert on corporate law and accounting at the Duke University School of Law. "What's the just remedy in this case? No one can believe we are better off with a Big Four instead of a Big Five. I certainly feel strongly about going after individuals.
"I'm rather surprised we haven't seen more on the criminal front against Enron," he said. "And we ought to look at the law firms, not to mention some of the investment banking firms. But it's hard to understand the endgame by going after Andersen."
Even before this year's surge in corporate investigations, officials at an array of agencies from the Federal Trade Commission and Federal Communications Commission to the Environmental Protection Agency had vowed to reduce regulations and laws that they have said are too burdensome for companies and the economy. More vigorous enforcement of existing laws would fill any voids, they said.
At the F.C.C., for instance, Michael K. Powell, the chairman, has told Congress of an urgent need to unshackle several industries from rules that have been on the books for decades; he also sought authority to impose stiffer penalties for regulatory violations from companies like the regional telephone companies.
The chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, Timothy J. Muris, has tried to blunt the move by Democrats for new consumer privacy legislation by expanding the enforcement program under existing consumer laws.
At the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Pitt has said there is little need for most proposed legislation, like restrictions on stock options and new conflict-of-interest laws for analysts and for consultants at accounting firms. The top of his wish list to Congress includes broader authority to bar executives and directors who violate securities laws.
In recent months, though, the landscape has shifted. Deluged with tips of corporate malfeasance -- many uncovered by the collapse of the stock markets over the last two years -- regulators and prosecutors have tried hastily to adjust.
Still, while the rhetoric of deregulation has been recast to avoid sounding too tolerant in a time of investor fear, the basic first principle remains the same. Problems plaguing the markets, officials say, largely reflect the flaws of executives.
"Some of the inadequacies we are seeing are people who are bad and some of what we are seeing is a system that has lost its way," Mr. Pitt said in an interview last week. While he has committed to keeping an open mind about revisions to securities and accounting laws, he has also testified that many Democratic proposals are not necessary and could have unintended and unfortunate consequences.
That stance is no surprise.
"The Republicans have believed that within the framework that has been on the books essentially since 1934, you've got all you need to regulate the markets," said Donald C. Langevoort of Georgetown University, a former S.E.C. official who is an authority on securities and corporate law. "If someone cheats, that's enough," he said. "Nail them. You don't need fancy rules about conflicts of interest, stock options and those kinds of things. That's a way of saying, let's not keep rewriting the rules, layering new responsibilities on companies."
"The broader view," he added, "is that the investor needs not only a sense of protection from bad apples who need to be punished, but that companies must conduct themselves with an eye to more openness. That's the traditional Democratic way of looking at securities law."
Joseph A. Grundfest, a former S.E.C. commissioner now at Stanford Law School, says he and other Republicans think that it is ultimately often less effective to address problems like those now arising by simply rewriting rules.
"If you look at the policy issues, there is a sense that doing things like trying to fix generally accepted accounting principles at the end of the day is a fool's errand," he said. "You will never be able to fix GAAP, just as you can't fix the tax code. There is always some next move."
"If people would just abide by the laws we already have on the books, we would have much more honest markets," he added. "By the same token, if the laws were enforced somewhat differently, we would have more honest markets."
FOR Mr. Grundfest, the model of the new aggressive enforcement beyond Andersen was the action taken by the S.E.C. last month against Edison Schools, the nation's largest commercial operator of public schools.
The case's outcome was foreshadowed earlier this year, as the number of corporate scandals began to explode. Then, Mr. Pitt began to regularly cite a well-known legal decision involving fraudulent financial statements of the Continental Vending Machines Corporation. In a decision by Judge Henry J. Friendly, a prominent appellate judge, a federal appeals court 32 years ago upheld the conviction of three accountants of fraud, even though there was testimony at their trial that they had complied with generally accepted accounting principles.
"Judge Friendly held that if literal compliance with GAAP creates a fraudulent or materially misleading impression in the minds of shareholders, the accountants could, and would, be held criminally liable," Mr. Pitt said approvingly in a speech.
Last month the agency formally revived that principle in its settlement with Edison of accusations that the company had provided inaccurate information about its past revenue and maintained inadequate financial controls. S.E.C. officials said Edison had not violated generally accepted accounting principles and was "in technical compliance" with them. But the commission nonetheless forced Edison to revise the way it reported revenue and hire an internal audit manager because it had failed to disclose that about half its reported revenue never actually reached the company.
"The case shows the qualitative evolution in the types of cases the agency is willing to bring," Mr. Grundfest said. "If you look carefully at the Edison action, had the S.E.C. taken that kind of approach years ago -- the approach that formal compliance with GAAP is insufficient -- and had that message gotten out loud and clear, arguably you could have stopped Enron. Enron is built on the foundation of hypertechnical compliance with GAAP."
A week after the Edison case, the S.E.C. sued Ernst & Young, accusing the firm of violating ethics rules by having a seven-year business partnership with a client, PeopleSoft. Ernst & Young vowed to defend itself, saying its actions "were permissible under the profession's rules and were commonplace" at the time. Ernst & Young disputed the government's accusation that the violations compromised the independence of the auditors, noting in particular that the S.E.C. was unable to find any evidence that the ties between client and accountants had created errors in PeopleSoft's financial statements.
Experts say the Edison, Ernst & Young and Andersen cases reflect the particular zeal of the new era of enforcement. And to the extent that those cases blunt efforts to adopt the toughest rules and regulations, companies and some major accounting firms not in the cross hairs of prosecutors -- and not particularly interested in being shackled by new restrictions -- could not be happier.
"It's the old argument that guns don't kill people, people do," said Mr. Gilson, the law professor. "If I were heading the lobbying coalition against these reforms, I'd be happy about the human sacrifices as the best way to placate these gods. That's the way it works."

HEADLINE: Why Security Must Be Globalized 

BYLINE:  By Shimon Peres; Shimon Peres is deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs of Israel.

DATELINE: JERUSALEM 

 BODY:
Security strategy is now becoming globalized, in much the way the world's economy has become globalized. Ever since economies changed from being dependent upon land to being predicated on knowledge and information, the world's political borders have been blurred. 
 Similarly, issues of security are shifting from a world in which nations face certain enemies to one in which threats are of a global nature. From the moment that ballistic missile systems were introduced, ballistic range became a strategic factor no less important than territorial depth. 
 This is particularly true for terrorism that is capable of striking targets at great distances with no prior warning. Because terrorism is global, so must the strategies arrayed against it be global. 
Against the Qaeda network, which is not subordinate to any state or law, the nations of the world have come to understand that in order to protect themselves, collective responsibility is required, on a national, regional and global level. 
This is particularly true in the Middle East, which now faces threats from modern weapons of mass destruction, even as it lags behind in all the benefits from the globalized economy. This part of the world is replete with ballistic missiles, and nations in this region have begun to arm themselves with nonconventional weapons -- chemical, biological and in the future, even nuclear warheads. The presence here of terrorist cells with transnational reach means that their activities in the Middle East are a global danger, rather than just a regional problem.
That is why an international alliance has come together to deal with the Middle East. A "quartet" -- the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations -- has met informally several times in recent months, and may yet establish a formal body. Indeed, President Bush has indicated that he will soon offer a specific plan for reinvigorating the political process to resolve the Mideast crisis. 
The four partners have accepted America's leadership, while the United States has accepted the need for the other three to play key roles. The cold war, which stoked the Middle East conflict, has ended, and the four partners clearly want to avoid having tensions among them rekindled by the current Middle East conflict. Their interest in the region comes not from Arab or Israeli prompting, but rather from their own strategic needs -- a fact neither Israel nor the Arab world can or should ignore. 
The quartet possesses undeniable capabilities, but I am not referring specifically to military power or willingness to dispatch forces to the Middle East. Armies are necessary to win wars or guarantee peace treaties, but an army cannot replace a treaty and cannot be a monitor where no treaty exists. The international partnership can exert influence by extending or denying political and economic aid, and by determining the degree of legitimacy granted to each state or entity -- for example, by adding it to or removing it from the list of those sponsoring terrorism.
Today, Israel has an economy that is half global (the part that continues to operate uninterrupted by national crises) and half national (the part captive to the country's security situation). We will have to get used to the idea that in the realm of strategic defense Israel will also have to operate in a way that is part global and part local. The state must participate in alliances against global threats while using its military to protect itself against its particular enemies.
Globalization of security strategy means that the conflict scenario in the Middle East will no longer involve only two parties, but three: the Israelis, the Palestinians and the quartet of international partners. It also means that Israel needs to reach an understanding with the quartet about our interests. Terrorism now stands in the way of a true peace with the Palestinians and with the Arab states. Every time a Palestinian faction rejects the peace process or carries out a bombing or a shooting, the credibility of the Palestinian side is ruined. Egypt and Jordan entered into peace treaties with Israel, receiving territory and water, without the use of terrorism. The Palestinians had a chance to reach a settlement, but their rejection of the settlement offer at Camp David destroyed trust and good faith.
But perhaps in the context of the quartet of partners, and with President Bush's leadership, we will be able to renew the pursuit of peace as well as defend against new threats. Both sides in the Middle East conflict need assistance to overcome the present political shortcomings from which they're suffering, and for which both peoples are paying a heavy price. If we can return to negotiations, we will be able to establish two states coexisting in peace and capable of moving into the global economy and generating prosperity.

'Click, Click' Can Be Music to Real Estate Brokers' Ears

BYLINE:  By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN 

 BODY:
 If real estate agents were ever worried about being replaced by the Internet, they can relax. If anything, the Internet is bringing them more business, according to a survey of home buyers and sellers released last week by the National Association of Realtors. 
 The survey found that 41 percent of all home buyers went online to search for homes in 2001, up from 18 percent in 1997. At the same time, the percentage of home buyers who used a real estate agent barely budged, declining to 79 percent in 2001 from 82 percent in 1997. People who used the Internet were more likely to use an agent to close the deal (77 percent) than people who relied on other sources of information (64 percent). DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

A Last-Minute Sizzle Can't Rescue Markets

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The stock market had a furious rally late Friday that erased almost all of the morning's sharp losses. The three major stock indexes still finished down for the week and hit new lows for the year. 
 Investors' concerns from previous weeks continued to hang over the market. 
 A car bomb attack outside the United States Consulate in Karachi, Pakistan, on Friday intensified fears of terrorism. Data showing a sharp drop in consumer confidence in June suggested that the recovery may be weakening. And charges of insider trading against the former chief of ImClone Systems reminded investors of how little trust many have in company executives and auditors these days.
 The negative performers for the week included AT&T, American Express, I2 Technologies, Ciena, the Sprint PCS Group and the CMS Energy Group. 
 For the week, the Dow Jones industrials finished at 9,474.21, down 1.2 percent, while the Nasdaq composite index closed at 1,504.74, off 2 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed at 1,007.27, down 2 percent. 
 Bonds rallied, with the yield on the Treasury's 10-year note falling to 4.80 percent from 5.07 percent a week earlier. JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

HEADLINE: INVESTING: DIARY; 
More Black Stock Investors

BYLINE:  Compiled by Jeff Sommer 

 BODY:
The number of higher-income American blacks who are investing in the stock market has jumped sharply in the last five years, according to a new survey.
 Among people with annual incomes of $50,000 or more, 74 percent of blacks own stocks or stock funds, an increase of 29.8 percentage points over the last five years. 
That compares with 84 percent of whites in the income category, up 3.7 percentage points over the period. 
 Only 46 percent of blacks, compared with 68 percent of whites, expected the economy to improve within a year. Of non-investors, 42 percent of blacks, twice the percentage of whites, said they are likely to begin investing in that period.
Charles Schwab and Ariel Mutual Funds sponsored the survey. The random telephone poll of 500 blacks and whites with incomes of more than $50,000 was conducted in late January and early February by Neuwirth Research Inc.

HEADLINE: Confidence in the Economy, But Not the Market 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "What If Investors Won't Join the Party?" (June 2), which discussed why people aren't coming back to the stock market, despite some positive economic signs: 
 After the dot-com implosion, Sept. 11 and Enron, more people are simply asking themselves: "What's the purpose? What's the point?" The bottom line has always been important in American business, but in the last few decades the bottom line has become everything. 
Whatever happened to a great business idea?
In the new economy, it isn't enough to show a profit for shareholders. If businesses want to lure and hold investors, they need to show why they exist beyond a quarterly financial statement, and prove that their business makes a difference in the quality of people's lives. 
Investors, consumers and even employees don't really hear that message any more from the largest companies in corporate America. This might be why mid-sized and smaller businesses are doing better with investors -- they communicate clearly what they are all about.

BYLINE:  These sketches were written by Anthony DePalma, Aaron Donovan, Jan Hoffman, Tarannum Kamlani, Tina Kelley, N. R. Kleinfield, Melena Z. Ryzik and Barbara Stewart. 

 BODY:
PHILIP S. PETTI
Sports Enthusiast
 A basement room in Lt. Philip S. Petti's home in Staten Island was filled with so much sports equipment that it looked like a locker room, complete with a treasured photo of him posing as a pro hockey player. An 18-year veteran of the Fire Department, Lieutenant Petti did play on a department hockey team -- his mother, Catherine, said he joined the team "before he actually knew how to ice skate."
 Though he did eventually learn how to skate -- his daughter, Lauren, now 16, taught him -- he never really learned how to play well. "I saw him play, and you know, he needed work," said his nephew Tim Schlittner. "As much as he loved it, he definitely needed some work." 
 But if Lieutenant Petti, 43, was anything less than content with his hockey skills, it did not stop him. "He had a wonderful disposition," his mother said. "He accepted whatever life handed him. His favorite expression was, 'That's what it is; deal with it.' "
Besides, he was too busy to look for accolades. He continued to coach his church's soccer and baseball teams long after his daughter and his son, Philip, 18, outgrew their cleats. He had to plan for his sister Jacqueline Butt's annual Halloween party -- one year he and his wife, Eileen, went as the Blues Brothers -- and practice the Ed Norton-Ralph Kramden routine he had going with his brother Thomas, also a firefighter.
Their sister Adrian Foran said: "Hugs and humor. When you think of Phil, that's what you think of."

DONALD A. DELAPENHA
Big D, the Daily Biker
 Every weekday at 6:05 p.m., the Delapenha children would stand outside their home in Allendale, N.J., and wait for their father, Donald A. Delapenha, to come back from work. "As soon as they heard the train whistle, they would know, five more minutes," said Mr. Delapenha's wife, Lorraine.
They'd line up with their bikes, waiting for him to take them on their daily ride around the neighborhood. Samantha, 8, and even Robert, 6, rode two-wheelers, and Madison, 2, would sit in a child seat on the back of her father's bike, and off they'd go.
For Mr. Delapenha, getting home from his job as a senior vice president at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in the World Trade Center was often the best part of the day. At work, he was known as Crusher, either because he was an offensive lineman in college or for his 300-yard golf drive; no one knows for sure.
Mr. Delapenha, 37, was a large, stocky guy, who wore shorts "11 months out of the year," his wife said. "He didn't care if it was December, he'd be outside shoveling snow in shorts and a sweatshirt."
His bulk earned him another nickname: Big D. For Christmas, his lifelong friend Gary George gave Mr. Delapenha's children the gift of a star named after their father. "That's what we called it: the Big D," Mr. George said.

SYED ABDUL FATHA
Man of Deep Faith
 Some men cram all the spaces of their hearts with people, places and activities, creating from complexity a fulfilling existence.
Others, like Syed Abdul Fatha, live lives so narrowly focused that other people, places and activities are crowded out. For Mr. Fatha, 54, there were only family and faith.
He was a Muslim who often prayed five times a day according to Muslim practice. He worked at the Pitney Bowes copy center at Aon Insurance in the World Trade Center, and when the work slowed he studied the Koran.
"He was going to buy me a Koran in Spanish because he wanted me to know about his religion," said Beatriz Soto, a co-worker. When Joanna Lewis, new on the job, botched a large copy order, Mr. Fatha stayed calm. "He'd say 'No problem; we just have to do it over again,' " Miss Lewis said.
When Mr. Fatha came to the United States in 1995 he left six children and an ex-wife at home in Bangalore, India. He married an American citizen, but that union also failed.
In Newark, where he lived and worshiped, he met Nauza Umurally, a Muslim woman from Guyana. They were married in a Muslim ceremony in 1998.
Ms. Umurally said Mr. Fatha had planned to become a naturalized citizen. Then he was going to bring his children to America. Mr. Fatha had few friends outside the mosque and few interests outside of prayer. But he had his family, and an intimate relationship with his God. And that, he told others, was enough.

VLADIMIR TOMASEVIC
Payer of Compliments
 Vladimir Tomasevic would find a way to offer a compliment even when a compliment might seem a bit of a stretch. For instance, he always enjoyed the cooking of his wife, Tanja, and for good reason. She cooked well. But like anyone, she had her bad moments.
"One time I oversalted some potatoes that I was baking," she said. "He ate them all, even though I couldn't. He even complimented me on the potatoes. My father was there at the time, and he said, 'You are so lucky.' Another time, it was a new recipe and I put in too much hot pepper. It was really hot. He said, 'It's a bit hot, but it's good.' "
Mr. Tomasevic, 36, lived with his wife in Toronto, and was a vice president for software development at Optus e-Business Solutions. On Sept. 11, he was attending a Risk Waters Group conference on information technology at Windows on the World.
Fond of sports, he played tennis and had recently taken up golf. He did both with his wife. Although he was much better than she was at tennis, he was always patient with her. "He would let me score here and there," she said.
In golf, their abilities matched more closely. "He had a bit of a slice, but my shots were really straight," she said. "He was a bit better, but I was close."

SANAE MORI
Seeker of Adventure
 Ania Kemalow Booth was learning English at Oxford University when she met Sanae (pronounced sa-NYE-uh) Mori, who was a full-time student there. Ms. Mori, who was born in Japan but grew up in the Netherlands, helped Mrs. Booth, who is from Poland, advising her on which college to apply to, which books to read, which courses to take.
Mrs. Booth remembers that when she flew to Poland one December, Ms. Mori met her at the bus station around 5 a.m. to send her off.
"She just wanted to wish me a happy Christmas," Mrs. Booth said. "I was really touched. She gave me a little book, and I thought, 'Wow, I have a friend.' That's something I haven't done for somebody. If I don't have to, I'm not getting up at 5."
They corresponded across the time zones, about renting a car and driving around America, or about Ms. Mori's adventures scuba diving in a Japanese cave. Ms. Mori, who lived in Tokyo, suggested that they visit the Caribbean to go snorkeling.
"It shall be fun!" she wrote. "Someday, someday, perhaps. Keep on dreaming!"
Ms. Mori, 27, worked for Nomura Securities and was attending a conference at the World Trade Center on Sept. 11.

ROBERT J. BAIERWALTER
A Man Who Took His Time
 Robert J. Baierwalter thought outside of the box. In high school, he and some friends hoisted a drum set, piece by piece, up to his bedroom so his mother would not know (at least not for a few hours). Decades later, as an account underwriter for FM Global, he liked creating insurance deals his co-workers thought impossible. And when other fathers sped to work early, he stayed home until 8:45 a.m., when Veronica, 14; Richard, 11; and Raymond, 6, left for school.
"He watched their grades like a hawk," said his wife, Laura. "It's a very difficult job, I'm finding out now. He used to ask Veronica every three days, 'What's your math average?' and he was always on the phone with the teachers."
She and his friends remember how Mr. Baierwalter, 44, was always late. "Now that I look back, I see he never rushed for anything," said Debbie Falls, a neighbor. "He enjoyed life. He took his time. He didn't have much time here."
Mr. Baierwalter, who lived in Albertson, N.Y., worked in Norwalk, Conn., but was at the World Trade Center on Sept. 11 for a meeting at 8:30 a.m. "It was probably the first time in his life he was on time," Ms. Falls said.

KENNETH BASNICKI
Still an Inspiration
 "It's pretty normal to not listen to what your father has to say," said Erica Basnicki, speaking for herself and other 22-year-olds. "Now it's funny how many times I say, 'Dad always said this.' I actually listen to him more now."
Her father, Kenneth Basnicki, financial marketing director for BEA Systems, was meeting co-workers at the World Trade Center on Sept. 11.
She remembers how he helped her when her college application was rejected, encouraging her to do some research and write letters. "Nothing else mattered at that moment other than me getting into university, and I did," she said.
Mr. Basnicki, who lived in Toronto, brought that same determination to recreation -- mountain biking, golfing, skiing and snowboarding with his wife, Maureen, and son, Brennan, in addition to his daughter. At 48, he had a group of friends who enjoyed snowboarding together. "We called them the grays on trays," Erica Basnicki said.
Now she hopes to study journalism in New York City. "The best way to honor my dad for me is to not be scared, and to live and go to school in New York," she said. "I know my dad's fighting for me somehow. He'll work his magic, and I'll work my magic over here."

BARBARA KEATING
Contented Grandmother
 Barbara Keating spent 25 years in public service, 10 as executive director of the Big Brothers Big Sisters of South Middlesex, outside Boston. She was widowed almost 20 years ago and survived two occurrences of breast cancer. At 72, she split her time between Cape Cod, Mass., and Palm Springs, Calif., where she drove a red Sebring convertible and went to church every day.
She was someone you would not talk back to, said Paul Keating, one of her five children; she was smart, tough, professional and funny. "The joke was she could always find a restaurant with a good martini," he said. She took hers dry, with two olives.
She planned her year around visits with her 12 grandchildren, in Texas, Massachusetts and California.
A longtime friend, Eunice Maloney, remembers her quiet kindnesses. "She drove people for cancer treatments," she said. "She was always doing something for somebody, but she never said much about it."
Ms. Maloney remembers talking to her about five days before she was killed on American Airlines Flight 11 as she was returning to California from a visit with her East Coast grandchildren.
"She told me she was very happy with her life," Ms. Maloney said. "Later she left me a note that said she was very glad for my friendship. I thought maybe she wouldn't be coming back to the Cape. Little did I know."

ANNE MARIE MARTINO CRAMER
A Modest Leader
 "There was a seven-years difference, yet I looked up to her," Patricia Nilsen said of her younger sister, Anne Marie Martino Cramer. "She was somebody we all looked up to, even my brother. She had a good job, and was a dedicated person. And I wish I could've been more like her.
"My sister was the type of person who never brought attention to herself, she never liked a fuss," she said. "Even as a kid, if she got hurt, if something went wrong, it was no big deal: she'd get up and walk away.
"She just picked up and would just keep going. That's just the way she was."
Jack Leahy, who worked with Ms. Cramer at Fiduciary Trust in the World Trade Center, where she was a tax specialist, said she was difficult to replace. "She was somebody you could confide in when things weren't going well," he said. "She'd support you in any and all decisions you had to make."
Ms. Cramer, 47, who lived with her mother in West Brighton, Staten Island, had a special love for Snoopy. Ms. Nilsen remembers giving her many Snoopy-related items. "She had them in her office," Ms. Nilsen said. "It all went with her."

JEFFREY A. HERSCH
Giver of Maxims
 Nathan Hersch does not remember the first time he heard one of his father's memorable maxims. Maybe they had just returned from Police Athletic League baseball practice. Maybe they were walking the family dog in the neighborhood park across the street. Maybe he was home from school and his father, Jeffrey A. Hersch, an assistant vice president at J. P. Morgan, had come home from work in Manhattan.
Whenever it was, Nathan, who grew up in the family's two-bedroom apartment in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, was probably avoiding his studies. "You have so much potential, why are you wasting it?" his father sometimes asked. "We're not rich enough for you to be stupid."
Nathan Hersch, now 35 and a senior vice president in the human resources department at Citigroup, remembered that his father always said he should work hard in school. The elder Mr. Hersch, who was 53, attended City College for a semester before dropping out to join the Army during the Vietnam War. When he returned, he earned a bachelor's degree from Brooklyn College and later a master's degree in economics.
After 30 years with J. P. Morgan, in 2000 Jeffrey Hersch went to work as an accountant at Cantor Fitzgerald, on the 101st floor of 1 World Trade Center. His wife, Leslie Sue Hersch, said Sept. 11 was his first day back at work after a two-week vacation in Ireland and Scotland. The couple loved to travel, and had been to 28 countries together. "We both figured we'd retire at 59," she said, "and do more traveling."

CELESTE VICTORIA
A Hard Year and a New Job
 The first year of the new millennium was tough for Celeste Victoria, said Dawn Torres, a sister. Shortly after returning home to New York City from Brazil, where she had filmed a documentary on its extremes of poverty and wealth, she was laid off. She was out of work for a year before finally finding a job.
From the time she graduated from New York University, Ms. Victoria, 41, had been earning a good living and supporting Jasmine, her teenage daughter. As a young woman -- tall, very slender, with stately posture and a graceful stride -- she modeled. Later, she worked in journalism and marketing, reporting for radio and NY1 News and producing talk shows for Manhattan cable television.
But she hid her worries, even from her family, Mrs. Torres said. "You could not tell she was going through anything," she said. "We didn't know she couldn't pay the rent and couldn't take care of her daughter the way she wanted to."
Mrs. Torres said her sister continued to dress with flair, hold her head high and behave vivaciously. "She didn't like people to be down," she said. "When she went to a party, she livened people up, livened the atmosphere up."
But last summer, her life took a turn for the better. She found a full-time job with Risk Waters Group, the financial information organization, which was holding a conference on Sept. 11 at Windows on the World. That day, Mrs. Torres said, Ms. Victoria was up early, to be there well before the 9 a.m. starting time.

NEIL J. CUDMORE
Forming Roots
 As a boy, Neil J. Cudmore discovered a hobby that became his lifelong passion. At 8 or 9, he regularly disappeared for hours to the river by his childhood home near Essex, England, to fish. As he grew into an outgoing man, his fishing became an oddly solitary activity for someone who thrived in the company of others.
But it gave Mr. Cudmore, 39, a sales director with the Risk Waters Group, a way to balance an active social life with a gentle sensitivity that helped his friends through their sorrows and joys -- whether making daily calls to a friend going through a painful breakup or giving a first-time father emotional support.
"It was not just that he made a lot of friends, but that he retained them," said Mr. Cudmore's father, James Cudmore. He recalled that at a gathering of his son's friends at a pub near a home he had in Dorset, England, friends from almost every phase of his life and from three continents gathered to share memories of him.
On one of those continents -- in Hong Kong, to be exact -- Neil Cudmore met Dinah Webster, an advertising manager at Risk Waters, who became his fiancee. They bought a house in Port Washington, N.Y., in July 2001 and planned to adopt a child. According to their friend William Rhode, they were putting down roots and finally settling down. "Neil was applying what he wanted for his life to his life," Mr. Rhode said. "He and Dinah really knew how to live passionately, especially in their love for each other."
Ms. Webster and Mr. Cudmore were at a Risk Waters meeting at Windows on the World on Sept. 11.

JAMES M. ROUX
Believer in Simplifying
 The law firm -- Roux & Ghimire of Portland, Me., and Katmandu, Nepal -- was never destined for financial greatness. Although James M. Roux, 42, stoutly described his partner as "the Johnnie Cochran of Katmandu," Mr. Roux himself, a spirited litigator, outdoorsman and windmill-tilter, made impracticality an art form. The firm's rollicking inauguration was held at a club in Manhattan, not Maine, and guests included punk rockers, Mr. Roux's fishing buddies, former girlfriends, a blues-rock band and some Sherpas from Nepal, for whom Mr. Roux designated the evening a benefit.
It was a few years ago when Mr. Roux quit defending corporate clients in asbestos and lead-paint cases to return home to Portland as a small-time general-interest lawyer. He became a magnet for clients like artists, the homeless and the Sherpas.
Dinner chez Roux? He would hand his brother Dave a restaurant menu. Then Mr. Roux, a divorced father of two sons, would attach a fishing reel to a clothesline that stretched from his apartment kitchen window across an alley to the restaurant's back door. Its owner would return the basket full of food -- down payment on legal bills.
On Sept. 11, Mr. Roux was on United Airlines Flight 175, on the first leg of a journey to Roux & Ghimire's Himalayan office.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 23, 2002

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a biographical sketch last Sunday about James M. Roux, a lawyer from Portland, Me., who died on a plane that struck the World Trade Center, misidentified the piece of fishing equipment he used to transport food on a clothesline to his apartment from a restaurant next door. It was a creel -- a basket for holding fish -- not a reel.

HEADLINE: Amid Prosperity, Toronto Shows Signs of Fraying 

BYLINE:  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

DATELINE: TORONTO, June 14 

 BODY:
A shantytown is swelling on the shores of Lake Ontario, practically in the shadow of Canada's richest banks. The 80 residents have squatted on five acres of undeveloped land that is soaking in mercury and lead.
 Dogs rummage through garbage. Outhouses donated by charities have a stench. There is no running water, save for a single hose shared by everyone, and no electricity. In the winter, people warm themselves over wood stoves. 
 The first baby was born in the shantytown last month, but was taken away by government authorities because the parents used drugs and lived in a shack.
"I don't have a clue how people could live like this in Canada," said a 21-year-old resident named Michael, who gave only his first name. But he himself recently moved into Tent City after losing his welding job. "Rents are just too high in Toronto," he said.
Toronto, Canada's premier city for business and finance, is still considered a model. Like other cities across Canada, it generally managed to escape the urban blight that afflicted industrial cities in the United States in recent decades.
But signs of fraying are becoming evident here, even though Canada's economy is strong, property values are rising and housing construction is booming for the rich and upper middle class.
The poor have been left behind in an otherwise bustling housing market. City officials estimate that 6,000 people are now homeless in Toronto, double the number of a decade ago. Panhandlers have also become more plentiful outside Toronto's fashionable stores and hotels.
Less than 1 percent of Toronto's low-income housing units stand vacant, and apartment rents have risen 35 percent in five years. The number of units that can be rented for $455 a month or less has decreased by nearly two-thirds since 1998, city housing officials say.
At the same time, welfare payments fell -- by 21 percent since 1996 -- because the Ontario provincial government was running deficits and cut spending on things like housing, welfare and transport for austerity.
An influx of immigrants, a relaxing of rent controls and a slashing of federal and provincial public housing budgets all account for the shortage of low-cost housing. While Toronto's chief administrative officer, Shirley Hoy, says, "We've got to fix this because the number of people spilling into the streets is growing," the solution will not come easily.
This city built almost 24,500 units of public housing from 1984 to 1996, but fewer than 100 units in the next five years. The waiting list is long and growing; in shelters, the number of beds is up sixfold in three years, to 4,100, and occupancy is 95 percent.
With 106,000 households in Toronto now spending more than 50 percent of their incomes on rent, families are doubling up in single-family homes or are forced to choose between buying food and medicine or paying the rent.
There is a joke that Toronto is like New York, except it is run by the Swiss. The subways are squeaky clean. Public parks are safe late into the night. But the emergence of Tent City and growing homelessness suggest that the quality of life in Toronto, as in many other Canadian cities, is beginning to fray under financial and demographic strain.
Cuts in federal and provincial funding over the last 10 years have left Toronto and other cities increasingly reliant on property and business taxes to finance crucial services at a time when large companies and the wealthy have been migrating to the suburbs.
Toronto, with a population of 2.5 million, suffers in particular because it must have a balanced budget according to provincial law, and it does not have the right to issue its own bonds. The federal government is encouraging immigration to spur population growth, and that means Toronto and other cities must take on new responsibilities for education, child care, health and housing services -- sometimes in multiple languages.
The signs of stress are growing. With the city 10 years behind in its plans to repair roads and bridges, potholes are more common. The grass is growing higher before it is cut in the parks. There is more litter on the streets. And air quality is declining, as the city sprawls and bus and streetcar service has been cut back, lengthening the lines of people waiting to commute.
"Toronto is at the early stages of erosion as a model city," said Jack Layton, a City Council member and the past president of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities. "The question is, are we going to notice it and do something about it in time?"
The trend in governmental policies may be starting to swing back. The federal government agreed last month to give Toronto and other cities more than $400 million in new housing funds over five years, but Toronto officials say it is a pittance considering the city's needs.
"We have no housing growth strategy to deal with population growth," said Sean Goetz-Gadon, a senior housing official in the Toronto government.
For Jackie Kendell, an ebullient 32-year-old, time has already run out. She is homeless, and she spends her days panhandling, rolling cigarettes and playing with her Rottweiler around her ramshackle shack in Tent City.
A year ago, Ms. Kendell and her boyfriend, Doug, were on welfare, paying $240 a month to rent a tiny apartment in a boarding house. Then came the knock on the door. The house had been sold, and most residents were evicted. Ms. Kendell said that she and her boyfriend could not find an apartment they could afford, and that no homeless shelter would allow them in with their dog.
So they turned to Tent City.
"Our dog is our pride and joy, my life, so there was nowhere else to go," said Ms. Kendell, who admitted to deadening her pains with daily marijuana smoking. "But there is no future here."

HEADLINE: 9/11 Bridged the Racial Divide, New Yorkers Say, Gingerly 

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY and DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

 BODY:
Daniel Hook knows what it is like to be judged by the color of his skin. It would take no more than a ride on the subway to get the disapproving looks -- the kind that screamed out: stay away.
 Mr. Hook is 25, black and a lifelong resident of Brooklyn. He wears baggy pants and a baseball cap and has a fondness for silver earrings. "Some people wouldn't even look at you," he said. "They didn't have to; you could feel it." 
 But these days, Mr. Hook does not worry about the subways or the people riding them. 
In fact, he seeks them out. Once a week, on a day off from work, he volunteers at New York City Transit, sweeping stations and giving directions.
"People are polite to me," Mr. Hook said while on duty in Jackson Heights, Queens. "My skin color doesn't seem to matter."
According to a recent poll by The New York Times and CBS News, Mr. Hook is among a growing number of New Yorkers who say they have seen a remarkable change in race relations since the Sept. 11 terror attacks at the World Trade Center. People are more tolerant of different ethnic and racial groups, they say, and less likely to overreact to perceived injustices or prejudices. 
"We want to believe the person on the subway next to us is somebody who would've helped us out of a burning tower or would've been willing to give their life for us," said Chris Owens, a former board president of Community School District 13 in Brooklyn. "That's a beautiful thing. That's a powerful thing. That's where people's heads are."
The shift in racial attitudes was noticeable in the first days and weeks following Sept. 11, but then it was seen mostly as the uncertain byproduct of a wounded city. More than nine months later, the change appears to be deeper and less fleeting. Though the widely publicized civility of New Yorkers may have lost some of its sheen, many people say the color lines remain blurred and less intimidating.
Julissa Tineo, who works as a hostess at a Sizzler restaurant in Queens, was struck recently when a middle-aged white woman began complaining about some Spanish-speaking people in the line in front of her. It was as if the woman was living in a different era, Ms. Tineo said.
"The white woman was saying that she didn't understand why these people are in this country," said Ms. Tineo, who moved to New York from the Dominican Republic five years ago. "I just said, 'I am sorry, this is a free country,' and didn't let it bother me. There is so much diversity everywhere, that she really stood out."
For the first time in 14 years, a majority of respondents of all races to the poll said racial relations were generally good in the city. Specifically, the poll found that 53 percent of blacks, 56 percent of Hispanics and 69 percent of whites believed that race relations are generally good. By contrast, just two years ago only 16 percent of black respondents characterized racial relations that way.
The optimism noted in the poll and in dozens of interviews across the city in recent days included some underlying tentativeness. In the interviews, many people said they expected the racial good will to eventually erode, though perhaps not to the same depths of distrust of a decade ago. If there were a high-profile racial incident, along the lines of the police shooting of Amadou Diallo in 1999, some people predicted a racially charged explosion. 
Others worried aloud about other potential threats to the city's nascent racial comity: the campaign for governor, in which H. Carl McCall, who is black, is seeking the Democratic nomination; the city's economic future, in the event of a slow recovery that results in steep cuts in services; and the quality of public education now that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has been given control of the city schools.
"In terms of race relations, it is great now, but these things don't last," said Officer Juan Hawkins, a Health Department police officer in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. "It will last until the next idiot comes along and does something stupid."
Down the street, Nathaniel Pinkston, a former city transit worker, said he saw no evidence of improved race relations. He lives in a redbrick house on Cumberland Street bought by his grandparents more than 100 years ago. Mr. Pinkston, who is black, said his new white neighbors don't even talk to him.
"When people move in across from you and they see you here and they don't speak, what does that tell you?" he asked from the stairs leading to his front porch.
That apprehensive undercurrent may be most acute among South Asians and Middle Easterners, many of whom described feeling a new sense of alienation in recent months. Karamat Shah, who moved to New York from Pakistan 20 years ago, said he considers himself a proud American and New Yorker, but has seen a darker side of his adopted home since Sept. 11.
Mr. Shah, who is Muslim, said he has been bothered while buying a hamburger in McDonald's and questioned while riding the subway with one of his two daughters, who wear traditional head scarves. He described the incidents as minor but unsettling. "When you travel in a bus or a subway, there are certain feelings," said Mr. Shah, who lives in Corona, Queens. 
Yet even with one eye fixed on what might be coming around the corner, many New Yorkers described a sense of racial calm seldom experienced in the city. The most obvious and commonly cited cause was Sept. 11, but there were others.
Some people noted the absence of the confrontational style of former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who was known to push some racially divisive buttons. Officer Hawkins said leaders of all races seemed to be keeping the inflammatory language to a minimum. Others pointed to a better impression of the Police Department and its dealings with minorities. And Mayor Bloomberg, in his first weeks in office, made a concerted effort to reach out to the city's blacks and Hispanics, gestures appreciated in those communities.
"The leader of any organization sets the tone, and if the tone is the right tone, the public will follow," said the Rev. Edward Davis, pastor of the Presbyterian Church of St. Albans in Queens.
Nina Piper, a Jewish mother of three whose eldest son attends Public School 261, a racially mixed school in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, said some people seemed to be making a concerted effort to get along.
"I've tried to be more friendly, more interested in them," she said of the other races and religions at her son's school. "It sounds so patronizing, but I guess I'm warmer."
Although their numbers were smaller, some people insisted there was no going back -- that the city's racial landscape had been permanently altered. Robert Bryan and Coleen Perine were smoking cigarettes during a break from a computer training class on Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn. Mr. Bryan, who is black, and Ms. Perine, who is white, said younger New Yorkers were at peace with the city's racial and ethnic patchwork.
"It is a generation thing," said Mr. Bryan, 32, who lives in Flatbush. "For my parents' generation, races were more separate. Today you still have a white person and you still have a black person, but we take things more individually. It is not all race."
Ms. Perine, who is 37 and lives in Staten Island, said, "It is the way I grew up; it is what New York has become."
Considering that racial tensions have so often flared up over incidents of police brutality, the poll produced some telling findings about attitudes of New Yorkers toward law enforcement officers. Sixty-six percent of blacks, and 59 percent of Hispanics, said that the police gave white New Yorkers preferential treatment compared to people of other races.
But over all, public approval for the job done by New York's police officers has soared, the poll found. Most strikingly, 50 percent of blacks and 52 percent of Hispanics credited the police with doing a good or excellent job.
In April 2000, by contrast, a mere 12 percent of blacks and 26 percent of Hispanics gave the police such high marks. That poll was taken about a month after four police officers were acquitted in the shooting death of Mr. Diallo.
"I think people don't look at the police as an enemy any more, but as a protector," said Garfield Ricketts, 29, a Jamaican immigrant, as he chewed a piece of sugar cane at a street vendor's stand after a day's work at a nursing home in Harlem. 
"There's a higher regard for law enforcement among young African-Americans," said Willie Green, a manager at the Walt Whitman Houses in Fort Greene. "They're not only crime-busters out to break my back and give me a hard time. And the effort to recruit minorities has had an impact on the way police officers are viewed."
Mr. Owens, the former school board president who sits on the 77th Precinct Community Council in Brooklyn, sounded a more wary note of approval. "I don't think we're any more exempt from potential mistreatment," he said. "We have a new respect for the definition of public service. We don't necessarily believe the cops see us differently, even if we see the cops differently."
But Kevin Pough, 41, an office manager at a midtown Manhattan law firm, said that even if the police still saw him a certain way, they were beginning to treat him differently.
"When I used to go home, it was nothing for me to be stopped, put against a wall, patted down," he said. "Since Diallo, they still stop me -- they stopped me last month, before I moved from Brownsville to Fort Greene -- but it's no more of that attitude like I'm automatically a bad guy, like I'm a criminal. It's not, 'Hey you, get against the damned fence.' "
Mr. Pough seemed torn between savoring his new feelings of comfort and confidence in his city, and apologizing for them.
"Maybe it's just an illusion I'm having, but when I talk to people, they're not looking at me as a black person anymore -- just as this guy who has something to say," he said. "But now we're still singling out Arabs. They're coming under scrutiny, like we were. We're on the other side now, looking out and saying, 'That's the way we were treated,' and we're on the same side as the ones who treated us that way."
Mr. Pough added: "Sometimes I think it's like, how many faces do we wear? When this goes all the way, when we put the terrorists away, are we going to go back to the way we were before?"

HEADLINE: The Odd Circle Of School Control; 
'Power to the People' in 1960's Is Now Seen as 'Amateur Hour'

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH BERGER 

 BODY:
It was a strange journey. A conservative idea championed by liberals, it was embraced by its enemies and abandoned by its supposed beneficiaries. When it died in disgrace, its last defenders were the philosophical descendants of its original adversaries.
 It was school decentralization, for 33 years the guiding organizational principle of New York City's public schools. Born in the social upheaval of the late 1960's, it was finally ushered toward history's scrap heap last week when the State Legislature gave the mayor control of the school bureaucracy and began a one-year process of abolishing the local school boards in 32 New York City communities. 
 Still, the philosophical story is actually far less tidy than it appears. Decentralization may be a victim less of a disenchantment with its fundamental principles than of the same disillusionment that revolutionized the city's approaches to crime and welfare. In all three areas, the gauzy ethos of the 1960's that included a sometimes naive tolerance and a trust in grass-roots wisdom came up against some intractable human complexities. With a new faith in standards and data-driven results, the public judged decentralization an overall failure. 
"I think the success in fighting crime has made people recognize that government can improve public service when it has the commitment and the resources," said Mitchell L. Moss, Rice professor of urban policy and planning at New York University. "We're now putting authority for the schools in the hands of experts, not in the hands of all kinds of amateurs. Amateur hour is over."
Yet effectiveness has always been the motivation for tinkering with the way schools are governed, however misguided. When the public school system was begun in 1842, it was divided into 17 wards, each run by a powerful board. These were soon dominated by often unlettered immigrant politicians who gave out teacher and principal jobs based less on instructional skills than on connections.
It was the city's conservative business elite that insisted on centralizing power in the hands of bureaucrats and educators. And it was the teachers then too who fought the change, having grown comfortable with the decentralized system, just as 70 years later they would defend centralization, having grown comfortable with that, said Diane Ravitch, a historian of education.
By the 1950's and early 1960's, New York schools seemed to reach what is remembered as a golden age, with a high-quality, merit-selected force of principals and teachers who were turning out hundreds of thousands of well-prepared graduates.
There was one fly in the ointment. The system was not working for poor black and Hispanic children, and activists like Milton A. Galamison and Rhody McCoy insisted that the cause was prejudice, that white principals and teachers had neither the requisite passion nor, in the skewed staff deployment of the day, the experience to teach their children.
The first remedy proposed was not decentralization, but busing. Black children would be shifted to the better white schools. When the heirs of the white immigrants rebelled against that plan, activists in black neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Manhattan demanded community control, known in the lingo of the 1960's as "power to the people." They were supported by patrician liberals like Mayor John V. Lindsay and McGeorge Bundy, president of the Ford Foundation, who were offended by the injustice of failing schools in black and Hispanic neighborhoods. 
"The original vision of community control was not an idea that liberalism normally embraced; it was an S.D.S. kind of idea: destroying the bureaucracy, destroying the professions," said Ms. Ravitch, referring to the radical group Students for a Democratic Society. "The liberal idea is that you raise problem-solving to the highest level, making the solution more equitable. The closer to the neighborhood, the more personal and intense the politics."
But as Kenneth T. Jackson, professor of history at Columbia University and president of the New-York Historical Society, pointed out, despite their battle cries in Ocean Hill-Brownsville, Brooklyn, the stormiest of the three districts set up to test community control, the activists were espousing a distinctively conservative American idea. While in much of the world education is run by a central government -- France has a single education authority; Australia has six -- in America there are 15,000 independent school systems run by local residents.
In Ocean Hill-Brownsville, the largely black school district began firing white, mostly Jewish teachers, and the teachers' union, led by Albert Shanker, went on a series of strikes over two months in 1968. The atmosphere was aggravated by accusations of racism and anti-Semitism. When the dust settled and the State Legislature divided the city into 32 school districts in 1969 and stripped the mayor of power over schools, many thought the union and the politicians had hijacked the new law. It gave the local boards no real power over the selection of teachers and it fragmented the system so much that no one truly ran it.
"What it did was create 32 bureaucracies, and it didn't achieve what its advocates wanted, which was to have decisions made as close to the child as possible," Ms. Ravitch said.
In too many places, the boards soon proved they were not doing the job any better than the centralized board and often did it far worse. People elected to the nine-member local boards often had little knowledge of budget and personnel issues. There was a widespread revolt against professional credentials, and principals and teachers were often chosen because of their race or religion.
The boards, with their control over jobs and contracts, became springboards for political careers. Embarrassments mounted as school board members were accused of sometimes pathetic crimes of petty opportunism like stealing a school's grand piano or forcing principals to hand out campaign literature.
Just as bad, the newly empowered communities soon became indifferent. Turnouts of 5 percent were the norm in board elections. Then in another twist in the strange arc of decentralization, the teachers' union capitalized on the apathy and began floating its own board candidates. It soon became the system's most powerful player, exercising veto power over the choice of chancellors as well local superintendents.
Still, in many districts like District 2 on the East Side of Manhattan or District 26 in northern Queens, decentralization worked as planned, resulting in the election of civic-minded people who were familiar with the desires of residents and put strong principals at the heads of schools, which attracted the best teachers and turned out high-performing students. Frank J. Macchiarola was so impressive as chairman of School Board 22 in the Mill Basin and Manhattan Beach areas of Brooklyn that he was named chancellor.
In the end, legislators in high-functioning districts like State Senator Frank Padavan, a Republican, were the most reluctant to abandon decentralization, but by then middle-class whites, and many blacks, had forsaken the schools for religious and private schools or the suburbs.
When a businessman, Michael R. Bloomberg, took the mayoralty, he realized that what he saw was no way to run a $12 billion enterprise. He could not name his own chancellor, move good principals to the toughest schools or reward good teachers. Other mayors had felt this way too, but this time the black and Hispanic neighborhoods that originally pushed for decentralization were ready to forsake it, and the energized new immigrants now dominating the schools had no stake in it.
"The entire house was a house of cards and they realized how dysfunctional it was to the kids in their neighborhood in an increasingly resegregated school system," said Harvey Robins, the city's director of operations under former Mayor David N. Dinkins. 
Mr. Jackson puts it more stoically. "A lot of times there's an idea where people come to it for the finest of reasons and that it ought to work, but what you think ought to happen doesn't actually happen," he said.

HEADLINE: Experts Wary of G.O.P. Drug Plan 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 15 

 BODY:
A Republican plan to provide prescription drug benefits to the elderly through private insurers is drawing a skeptical reaction from many health policy experts. The plan, they say, would face problems like those that have plagued Medicare's attempt to encourage the use of health maintenance organizations.
 Private health plans were once seen as Medicare's best hope for controlling costs. In 1998, the Congressional Budget Office predicted that half of all beneficiaries would eventually be in such managed care organizations. But the market has been extremely unstable. Many H.M.O.'s have found federal payments inadequate and pulled out of Medicare, dropping 2.2 million beneficiaries since 1998. 
 The House Ways and Means Committee plans to vote next week on a bill to add drug coverage to Medicare, the largest expansion of the program in its 37-year history. The full House is expected to pass the legislation a week later.
Under the proposal, Medicare would pay subsidies to private entities to offer insurance covering the costs of prescription drugs. Such "drug only" insurance does not exist, and many private insurers doubt whether they could offer it at an affordable price.
"I'm very skeptical that 'drug only' private plans would develop," said Bill Gradison, a former congressman who was president of the Health Insurance Association of America from 1993 to 1998.
Representative Bill Thomas, the California Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, insisted: "We should rely on private sector innovation in delivering the drug benefit. The private sector approach offers the most savings per prescription."
But John C. Rother, policy director of AARP, which represents millions of the elderly, said, "There is a risk of repeating the H.M.O. experience" with any proposal that relies heavily on private entities to provide Medicare drug benefits.
Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, lamented the exodus of H.M.O.'s from Medicare and asked, "Why in the world would we want to make the same mistakes with the prescription drug benefit?"
About 5.6 million, or 14 percent, of the 40 million Medicare beneficiaries are in private health plans. People dropped from such health plans can go back to Medicare's original fee-for-service program or enroll in another H.M.O., if they can find one. 
Many companies sell insurance to fill gaps in Medicare coverage, but premiums for such Medigap policies have increased rapidly in recent years, and only 3 of the 10 standard policies include drug benefits.
Richard A. Barasch, chairman of Universal American Financial Corporation of Rye Brook, N.Y., which sells Medigap coverage to 400,000 people, said he seriously considered offering a separate insurance product just for drug costs. But after much research, Mr. Barasch said, he concluded that it was not feasible because most of the buyers would be people with high drug expenses.
Under the Republican proposal, insurers and other companies would submit bids to the government, specifying the premiums they proposed to charge for drug coverage. These companies would manage the benefits and would share the risk of financial loss if subscribers' drug costs exceeded expectations.
Asked about such proposals, Mr. Barasch said: "I don't think it's impossible, but the odds are against it."
Participation in the drug plan would be voluntary. But Republicans said the benefits would be so attractive that 95 percent of Medicare beneficiaries, including people with low drug expenses, would sign up.
Richard I. Smith, vice president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a lobby for drug makers, said he believed that Medicare payments to companies offering drug benefits might be more adequate than the payments to H.M.O.'s. Because of "a rigid formula," Mr. Smith said, payments to many H.M.O.'s have grown only 2 percent a year, while costs have increased 10 percent a year.
In the Senate, both parties are working on Medicare drug legislation, but no consensus has formed and no votes have been taken.
The House Republican plan envisions a large role for companies that now manage pharmaceutical benefits for many working families with private insurance. Such companies, including Merck-Medco, Express Scripts and AdvancePCS, negotiate discounts with drug manufacturers and pharmacies. Under the Republican plan, such companies would also assume financial risk, like insurance companies, if they wanted to do business directly with Medicare.
Thomas M. Boudreau, senior vice president and general counsel of Express Scripts, said: "We are not enthusiastic about that approach."
Under the Republican proposal, any company offering prescription drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries would have to be licensed under state law as "a risk-bearing entity" or would have to meet federal standards meant to guarantee financial solvency.
Blair Jackson, a spokesman for AdvancePCS, said: "We are typically paid a fee, generally less than $1, for each claim. But we do not bear financial risk."
H.M.O.'s have long boasted that they hold down health costs, but their ability to do so has been challenged by hospitals and doctors demanding higher payments. Companies managing Medicare benefits would face similar pressures from drugstores.
The National Association of Chain Drug Stores recently sent a bulletin to its members opposing the Republicans' Medicare drug proposal.
Crystal S. Wright, vice president of the association, said: "This could be an economic disaster for community pharmacies. Benefit managers are likely to get even more leverage than they currently have to reduce pharmacy reimbursement."
Under the Republican drug plan, a typical beneficiary would pay premiums of $34 a month, a $250 deductible, 20 percent of drug costs from $251 to $1,000 a year and 50 percent of drug costs from $1,001 to $2,000. Beneficiaries would then be responsible for all drug costs until they had spent a total of $4,500 of their own money. Medicare would cover all drug costs beyond that.
But, House Republicans said, insurers could set different premiums and benefits, so long as the overall value of each drug plan was equivalent to that of the "standard coverage" suggested by the government. 
The Republican plan is part of a bill costing $350 billion over 10 years. A Democratic alternative would offer more extensive benefits, at a much higher cost to the government.

To the Editor:
 Re "Hospital Accreditor Will Strictly Limit Hours of Residents" (front page, June 13): 
 Complaints by teaching hospitals that limiting the work hours of interns and residents to the equivalent of two full-time jobs will pose an economic burden, while true, are beside the point. Hospitals have exploited residents as cheap labor for decades to their own enormous financial advantage -- ignoring the burden of chronic fatigue and inordinate stress on these young doctors and, more important, threatening the lives of patients.

NEW TRAIN STATION

BYLINE:  By Ronald Smothers 

 BODY:
 Governor McGreevey last week announced plans for a new New Jersey Transit train station in Little Falls at the edge of Montclair State University and along the Midtown Direct line through Montclair, which will travel directly to Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan. The service, and the station, had been delayed by lawsuits by the town of Montclair over fears of residential displacement and concerns about parking problems. The station will include a six-story parking deck for 1,300 cars when it opens in 2004. At $36 million, It will all be financed by New Jersey Economic Development Authority bonds on land deeded to the state by the university.

Indians Are a Wanted Team in Interleague Play

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
This is prime rivals weekend, the weekend on the interleague schedule when geographical or otherwise natural rivals play each other. 
 The Yankees are playing the Mets at Shea Stadium, the White Sox and the Cubs are playing at Wrigley Field, Texas is at Houston, the Canadian teams are in Montreal, the Florida teams in Miami, Kansas City in St. Louis, Anaheim in Los Angeles, Oakland in San Francisco and Pittsburgh in Cincinnati. 
 Pittsburgh and Cincinnati? Interleague rivals? Not only are the Pirates and the Reds in the same league, but they are also in the same division. How does that make them interleague rivals? 
It doesn't, but while other teams are playing interleague games in what, for the most part, are attractive matchups, the Pirates and the Reds are playing just three more of the 18 games they have with each other this season.
Unlike past seasons, neither team is playing its prime rival from the American League, which in both cases is the Cleveland Indians. The Indians like their rivalry with the Reds and do not necessarily see one existing with the Pirates, but from the Pirates' perspective, having the Indians play in Pittsburgh is a big plus.
All three games in a three-game series with the Indians at PNC Park sold out last season. The Pirates sold out only one other three-game series in the first year in their new park. Of the seven games that sold out before the All-Star Game break, three were with the Indians.
In Cincinnati, meanwhile, the Reds experienced a similar attendance boon with the Indians. Their three-game series drew 108,400 fans. The Reds' next largest attendance for three games with the same team was 91,299 for the last three games of a four-game series with the Chicago Cubs. When the Reds played in Cleveland, all three games sold out, making it one of seven three-game series the Indians sold out among 21 three-game series that they played at home. The Pirates did not play in Cleveland last season.
Neither team is playing in Cleveland this season, and the Indians are not playing in Cincinnati or in Pittsburgh. Instead the Indians are playing the Rockies in Colorado and the Arizona Diamondbacks at home, and the Reds and the Pirates have each other.
Katy Feeney, Major League Baseball's scheduling expert, called the Cincinnati-Cleveland-Pittsburgh combination a three-way problem. 
"Pittsburgh considers themselves a prime rival of Cleveland, and Cincinnati considers themselves a prime rival of Cleveland, so it makes it difficult," she said. "Over the last couple years we've tried to figure it out and balance it. This year nobody got them." 
Feeney said the scheduling problems begin with the uneven number of teams in the two leagues and become compounded with the different number of teams in the divisions. Throw in the rotation of divisions this year, and the right mix never emerged.
"You wind up with discrepancies and this is one of them," Feeney said. "I don't want to say it got lost in the shuffle, but it just really didn't work for this year without doing some further imbalancing."
One official said an early schedule had the Pirates and Indians playing. "Then when they tried to work all the numbers," he added, "it didn't work."
Not surprisingly, Feeney heard from officials of all three clubs about what they saw as a gap in the schedule.
"We obviously would very much like to play the Indians," said Dick Freeman, the Pirates' chief operating officer. "I am somewhat sympathetic to the schedule makers. I seldom call. But I did on this one to tell her I was not happy over the fact that we weren't playing them. We were all disappointed. I let Katy know that. I'll be interested to see what happens next year." 
John Allen, the Reds' chief operating officer, said the Indians' absence from the Reds' schedule has not gone unnoticed in Cincinnati. "It's been a topic of conversation on the talk shows," he said. "We're the only natural rivals not playing. We're disappointed by it. We understand that we unfortunately were the odd man out because of the numbers. I've had conversations with Dennis Lehman in Cleveland. They feel the same way as we do. They wish we could have continued it. We both feel strongly and we've expressed our desire to revive it in the future."
Lehman, the Indians' executive vice president for business, said the Indians have had more involvement with the Reds, including a defunct series of preseason exhibition games in Columbus for the Ohio Cup. 
"I guess Pittsburgh would work O.K.," Lehman said, "but from our drawing standpoint, the Reds make more sense. It makes sense to reinstitute that rivalry. Whether it happens I don't know, but John agrees. We'd like to play each other in the future. But clearly either one would be fine."
In the meantime, Lehman said, the Indians are pleased with having the Diamondbacks as a substitute this season. "From an attendance standpoint, it's fine," he said. Allen offered a similar view on the Reds' coming series at home with Seattle and Oakland. "The advance sale is pretty good," he said.
Assuming that the schedule makers could make the numbers work, they could probably make everybody happy by scheduling an Indians-Pirates series in Pittsburgh and home-and-home series for the Indians and the Reds. 
"We're going to try and put them in," Feeney said. "The problem is the three-way. We're looking at different ways, maybe a rotation. That's probably what we'll look at doing. It's a compromise, of course, but nothing works perfectly. The prime rival issue in interleague play is always being discussed."

Castillo a Streak Hitter
Just like that, Luis Castillo became a .300 hitter again. 
It might not have been that simple, but Castillo, the Florida Marlins' second baseman, followed some advice from Bill Robinson, the Marlins' hitting coach, and today has a 30-game hitting streak and a .329 season average.
Castillo was a .300 hitter in 1999 and 2000, reaching .334 the second of those seasons. But then he plunged to .263 last season, stroking 39 fewer hits in two fewer times at bat. As if to show that performance was no fluke, the switch-hitter was hitting .262 this season before beginning his major league-longest streak May 8.
"Earlier in the year he was taking so many pitches that he took third strikes," Manager Jeff Torborg said. "Bill encouraged him to be more aggressive, and he made an adjustment with his front leg from each side of the plate. All of a sudden it came together. He's selective from both sides of the plate but still aggressive. It was just a little adjustment that Bill has made with him and he believes in."
The little adjustment has made for a big difference. Castillo has compiled a .390 average during the streak, the longest in the majors since Vladimir Guerrero of Montreal reached 31 games in 1999.

Irabu Not Fit to Close
From April 24 through May 22, the Texas Rangers' new closer gained saves in 10 successive save opportunities and in 10 of the team's 15 victories. And then? Don't ask.
Manager Jerry Narron has not summoned Hideki Irabu into a game, in the ninth inning or any other inning since June 8. In the six times Irabu pitched before his appearance in the fifth inning against Houston yesterday, he allowed 14 earned runs and gave up 8 home runs in six and a third innings. No surprise that Irabu was the losing pitcher in four of those games.
He allowed three runs in the ninth inning, two on a Joe Randa home run, for a 7-5 Kansas City victory. He gave up consecutive 11th-inning home runs to Carlos Beltran, Mike Sweeney and Randa for a 10-7 Royals victory. Against Anaheim, home runs Brad Fullmer and Tim Salmon hit against him in the ninth tied the score, and Troy Glaus's two-run homer against him in a three-run outburst in the 10th ended the game, 7-5. Finally, Andruw Jones slugged a three-run homer against him in the 10th for a 6-3 Atlanta victory.
After one of those games he said that maybe his body was not fit for the closer's role. That does not say much for his body, because it did not fit the starter's role too well, either.

Balancing Competition
Baseball officials are concerned about competitive balance. Maybe they should follow the example of the National Basketball Association.
"What we've done can certainly work in other sports," David Stern, the N.B.A. commissioner, said the other day about the league's economic system. "The soft cap allows you to keep your players in place. And the competitive balance is good."
So good the Los Angeles Lakers have won the championship the last three seasons.
Or maybe baseball should copy the National Hockey League, whose championship the Detroit Red Wings have won three of the last six seasons, doing it this year with the league's highest payroll, a reported $65 million. 
They are owned by Michael Ilitch, who as owner of the Detroit Tigers has the major leagues' 18th-highest payroll and is among the so-called low-revenue clubs seeking more of the wealthy teams' revenue so that baseball can improve its competitive balance.

Looking to Suburbs to Map 9/11's Reach

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton

 BODY:
ONE of the many mysteries left in the wake of Sept. 11 is just how hard the attack on the World Trade Center hit New York City's economy. Really hard, obviously.
 But how hard, exactly? And how much of the past year's economic carnage came from the national recession, rather than from the disaster in Lower Manhattan?
 One place to look for an answer is the suburbs. And particularly the "suburb" that is New York State's second-largest economy: Long Island. 
 The New York region is so tightly linked that many economists consider the whole schmear, from Fairfield County in Connecticut down to Staten Island, east to the Hamptons and west well into New Jersey, to be a single economy.
 In the past the region has often behaved that way. From 1989 through 1992, New York City lost 9 percent of its jobs; Long Island lost 8 percent; Westchester lost 7 percent; no one was thrilled.
 But this time around, things are different. Because while New York City has been suffering, Westchester, Rockland and especially Long Island have been doing pretty darn well, thank you very much.
 Want to see some numbers? (If not, feel free to skip the next few paragraphs.) In the 12 months ending in April, New York City lost 107,3000 jobs, a 2.9 percent drop; nationally, the job count was down about 1.1 percent in the same period.
 Almost all of the surrounding areas had job gains, particularly long Island, where the number of jobs actually edged up by more than 8,000 or 0.7 percent. Rockland and Westchester Counties rose 0.2 percent. Unemployment rates show the same pattern. The jobless rate reflects where people live, not where they work, and is almost always higher in the city than anywhere within commuting distance. But it has climbed faster in the city over the last year than in the adjacent areas.
 In April, the most recent month for which there is data, the jobless rate in the city was 7.5 percent, up 2.2 points in 12 months. In Westchester, Rockland and on Long Island, unemployment is below 4 percent, and in each place has increased by roughly one percentage point in a year.
 All of this tends to suggest that the crater in New York City's economy was, indeed, caused by terrorists.
 To be sure, New York City's economy had started softening well before Sept. 11, and the jobs that disappeared earlier in 2001 cannot be blamed on the calamity.
 But, adjusting for seasonal factors, 67,000 jobs vanished during the last quarter of the year, said Jason Bram, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the disruptions of the trade center attack can probably be blamed for most of those losses. During that period, he noted, employment on Long Island was basically stable.
 But he and other economic gurus agree that there are other factors taht help account for the difference between the city and the outlying areas.
 One, obviously, is size; the city's economy dwarfs those of the northern suburbs, and by some measures is twice as large as the economy of Connecticut. Even Long Island doesn't have half the jobs of the city.
 The workers outside the city tend to be wealthier and better educated than those in the five boroughs as a whole, and the places where they work are different, too. For one thing, those places tend to be smaller, said Marc Goloven, an economist at J. P. Morgan. Smaller firms are less likely to have the wholesale layoffs that have afflicted big companies in the city.
 After Long Island's defense industry went into a tailspin in the 1980's, the economy there was transformed to contain a wide diversity of smaller businesses, many of them inolved in technology, said Gary E. Huth, the Long Island analyst for the new York State Department of Labor. Other areas of the state now look at Nassau and Suffolk Counties as a model.
 Certain businesses that have been slammed by the recession or the economic aftermath of Sept. 11 - stock brokerages, advertising agencies, garment factories - are just a lot less important outside the city. "We don't have Broadway," Mr. Huth said. "Some of the reverberations just didn't reach out as far" as Long Island.
 Long Island's economy has not been untouched, he added, and unemployed people there are having a tough time. But compared to the city, he said, "In general, things have been better here."

 A GHOST'S MEMOIR
The Making of Alfred P. Sloan's
"My Years With General Motors."
By John McDonald.
202 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
The MIT Press. $24.95.
 WHEN corporations are riding high it is well to remember that corporate arrogance is a danger to the public, and also to corporations, on whom arrogance tends to backfire. Insolence at Merrill Lynch, for instance, has just resulted in bad press, big fines and an image dive. Looking back, we see that the chemical industry's attempt to suppress Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring" made the industry look worse than the book alone could have. 
There was a similar incidence of corporate arrogance occurring about the time of "Silent Spring," and with a similar blowback: General Motors tried to block publication of "My Years With General Motors," by its former leader and inspiration, Alfred P. Sloan. Ultimately the work became a classic. Like Carson's book, it benefited greatly from corporate arrogance directed against it. 
But though "My Years With General Motors" is now studied at business schools, the story behind the story, as newscasters like to say, has not been told. Sloan's volume was actually written by John McDonald, an editor of Fortune magazine. McDonald spent five years on it, then another five fighting General Motors' suppression. McDonald, who died in 1998, tells the tale in "A Ghost's Memoir," a captivating and revealing chronicle. It is moderately padded with lengthy, 1950's-style business correspondence, and future historians will probably not rush to study these letters. But the book gives a fine account of how one man's persistence resulted in total legal defeat of what was the country's largest corporate entity. Read in conjunction with "My Years With General Motors," it supplies essential understanding of what happens when corporations aim large-bore weapons at their own feet.
McDonald became a leading business writer in the early postwar era, when serious reporting about big business was gaining currency and Fortune was a newsstand colossus. At the time intellectuals shunned business journalism; corporations were to be denounced, not reported on and figured out. McDonald joined Peter Drucker and a few others as intellectuals who found management culture fascinating. McDonald was also a fan of the New York art scene, a friend of the poet Robert Penn Warren and a student of mathematical game theory, but he loved writing about big companies.
Sloan more than anyone else made General Motors happen, pulling it up from one of many competing car brands (Hudson, Reo, Willys) into a company that peaked with more than half of total American automobile sales, plus most of the refrigerator and diesel locomotive markets. Sloan's innovations included offering a full auto line, allowing buyers to trade up as their incomes rose; separating engineering and marketing; insisting that G.M. become one of the first big companies with outside auditing, so that stock buyers would believe its profit claims; tying executive pay to performance; emphasizing styling; and combining car sales with financing.
All seem obvious strategies now, but only because the success of General Motors made them so. Sloan, who ran the company from 1923 till the late 50's, was among the inventors of the modern large corporation. 
McDonald agreed in the late 50's to ghost Sloan's memoir. Though they would spend days on end together, McDonald says he never addressed his subject as anything other than "Mr. Sloan." (Today top managers tell mail clerks to call them Ken or Carly, while awarding themselves pay multiples hundreds of times greater than Sloan would have accepted.) A manuscript was produced, and General Motors sued to block publication. The company proposed an abridged version that Bowdler himself would have found prissy. Sloan, in his 80's, tossed in the towel and signed over his advance to McDonald, thinking that would close the matter. 
McDonald, however, refused to quit. He countersued G.M. He endured pressure from the brass at Time Inc., Fortune's owner, who were terrified that G.M. would pull its advertising. After a prolonged legal and lobbying battle, recounted here, the writer prevailed. Sloan's book was an immediate hit when published in 1964, G.M. heavy-handedness having succeeded in assuring a sensational reception. 
Rereading "My Years With General Motors" today, one strains to discover what caused the corporate reaction. Most of the book is straightforward recitation of management theory. "The function of the Engineering Policy Group in the development of a new model in General Motors is a good example of the work of a policy group" is a typical sentence. 
General Motors must have opposed the book partly because the 50's carried wartime secrecy over into corporate culture; its proposed bowdlerized version of "My Years" deleted even the most harmless specifics. But the company's real problem was that the book defended bigness. G.M. then feared that the Justice Department would sue to break up both its car and locomotive businesses on antitrust grounds. 
In "My Years," Sloan speaks of corporate bigness as the appropriate outcome for whoever makes the best product at the best price. Surely every executive thought the same, but you weren't supposed to say that. Nor were you supposed to say, as Sloan did, that the goal was to best the competition. Sloan even tossed around the world "monopoly" a couple of times, though he anticipated modern economic theory in believing that a true monopoly could never hold because any company making runaway profits or sacking its buyers with poor wares would only draw in competitors who would be its undoing. This is pretty much what occurred when the Big Three later collided with Japanese car makers. 
Perhaps "My Years With General Motors" should hold in the annals of business writing a stature similar to that held by "Advise and Consent" in political writing. "Advise and Consent," published in 1959, shocked readers with depictions of back-room Senate deals and high-pressure lobbying. Sloan's book shocked readers with a premise equally unsurprising now: that corporations organize themselves with the goal of maximizing returns.
John McDonald made a double contribution by putting "Sloan's" book together, then fighting to get it into print.

 REINVENTING THE BAZAAR
A Natural History of Markets.
By John McMillan.
278 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company. $25.95.
 HERE is the perfect book for the Age of Enron. "Reinventing the Bazaar" doesn't suggest immediate solutions for cleaning up the mess in Texas -- it was written well before the scandal broke -- but it provides a long-term perspective, an intellectual framework, for understanding what went wrong, how we should be thinking about correctives and what a properly functioning market economy should look like.
John McMillan, a professor of economics at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, is more than a proponent of free markets. He is a celebrant, an enthusiast. He delights in taking us on an economist's tour of the world -- introducing us to the Dutch flower market in Aalsmeer; the centuries-old camel fair of Rajasthan, India; the brave, persistent vendors of Accra and peddlers of Hanoi, who keep coming back despite the brutal efforts of their governments to suppress them.
Markets, McMillan explains, empower people by encouraging autonomous decision making and individual participation;
in the jargon of the moment, they are "proactive." Markets generate productivity and efficiency, allowing resources to flow where they can most usefully be employed. They are flexible in ways that no centrally planned system can match. "For poor countries," McMillan writes, "they offer the most reliable path away from poverty. For affluent countries they are part of what is needed to sustain their living standards."
Put two people together and it won't be long before one of them is figuring out what he can sell to the other. Markets emerge under the most dire conditions. Rwandans living in refugee camps following their genocidal civil war found ways to set up food exchanges and general stores. British prisoners during World War II swapped their Red Cross rations among themselves, using cigarettes as a form of currency. Rembrandt helped create an art market in 17th-century Holland. Mozart entered the marketplace to escape the domination of patrons and maintain his artistic freedom. 
So far, so familiar. But McMillan has another shoe to drop. Markets may arise spontaneously as "the most potent antipoverty engine there is," yet as they develop, becoming more complex, they need rules and structures to perform properly. Sometimes the rules will come from the participants, working together in their common interest. The wholesale diamond trade of New York City is regulated by the Diamond Dealers Club, which sees to it that oral agreements are adhered to. The New York Stock Exchange originated at the end of the 18th century in the closed auctions of 24 brokers who had discovered that free riders attending the daily outdoor auctions on Wall Street were distorting the actual prices of stocks (and undercutting commissions).
The most important, most necessary regulator, however, is the state. Markets achieve their full potential, McMillan insists, only if the government is providing infrastructure. He identifies five conditions that government must guarantee if markets are to flourish: information has to flow freely; people have to be able to trust one another; competition must be assured; property rights must be protected; and side effects like pollution have to be controlled. Without state intervention, markets can scarcely grow beyond primitive face-to-face transactions. The libertarian utopia of complete laissez-faire does not give you prosperity, it gives you Somalia. In 2000, five years after the United Nations had departed, Somalia was a country without a government. No taxes were being collected, and consequently the number of small businesses exploded. Yet the economy has not been a success, and will not become one. Businesses have to dispose of their own garbage, generate their own electricity, find their own sources of water. In the absence of a police force, protection money has to be paid out. Inefficiencies prevail.
McMillan is waging a two-front war here, battling against those who think markets are inherently exploitative and those who think markets can do no wrong. Markets, he writes, are human institutions, with human imperfections. They do not necessarily work well, and they are "too important to be left to the ideologues." Without effective government oversight to assure good corporate market behavior, we can expect two, three, many Enrons. And everyone will suffer as trust declines and investment shrinks. "Countries with stronger investor protections have bigger capital markets," McMillan points out. "The efficacy of the stock market varies with how activist the government is in setting the platform." Ronald Reagan once famously declared, "Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem." Ronald Reagan was wrong.
He was wrong because, as McMillan shows, there are no easy answers. Economies are complicated, and the interactions between governments and economies are also complicated. Decisions must be made pragmatically, on a case-by-case basis. "Reinventing the Bazaar" is full of examples. Why, for instance, did Silicon Valley become the center of the computer industry and not Route 128 in Massachusetts? Experts would have predicted the opposite. But Massachusetts had an intellectual property law that prohibited employees from taking the knowledge they had acquired in their current jobs to new jobs. In California, which had no such law, job-hopping was rampant. Individual companies suffered because knowledge they had developed was widely shared. But the industry as a whole prospered. "A subtle aspect of market design, in other words, was a crucial element of Silicon Valley's success." Market design has also been responsible for the effectiveness of the federal government's acid rain program. In 1990, Washington created tradable emissions allowances, permitting companies to buy and sell the right to pollute. The government continued to set pollution standards, but the market would do the work of determining how much sulfur dioxide each individual company would be allowed to emit. Efficient companies sold their allowances and were rewarded; inefficient companies were penalized. And even environmentalists got into the act by buying allowances and withholding them. Most experts, McMillan reports, say emissions allowances have been more successful than any previous program at reducing acid rain.
One of McMillan's most arresting examples concerns AIDS and the pharmaceutical industry. Why shouldn't anti-AIDS medications be dispensed free to third world sufferers too impoverished to pay for them? Moralizers won't like that McMillan performs a cost-benefit analysis while people are dying, but his point is that there are costs no matter which course of action is chosen. Drug companies depend on profits to perform the research that leads to new medication, McMillan observes. No profits, no research, no new drugs. In this case, he concludes, abrogating the companies' patent rights would save lives without greatly affecting profits, since there is such a small market for AIDS drugs in the third world. But, he goes on, there is a grim side to this story. "Letting the poor nations free-ride is of potential benefit only with diseases that strike the affluent countries and have the U.S. and European markets as an inducement to innovation. With tropical diseases, no patents would mean no research." And even with patent protections, unless economists can come up with ways to change the market dynamics of the pharmaceutical industry, the drug companies will spend more on fighting baldness than they do on fighting malaria.
As this example shows, markets can function properly and still produce undesirable results. "The challenge of market design," McMillan states, "is to devise mechanisms, or to allow mechanisms to evolve, that channel the pursuit of profits in a socially productive direction." Ultimately, this is a book about tinkering, a technocrat's plea to all of us to recognize that the big ideas are usually wrong, that the truth is not so much in the details as in the adjustments to the details. For a technocrat, McMillan is a surprisingly accessible writer; he deserves a wider readership than he will probably find (though when it comes to his own specialty of constructing public auctions, he can sound like the dinner guest who goes on talking long after you have stopped listening). Still, McMillan's world is not quite the real world. If he had his way, many of the country's most contentious domestic issues and many of the globe's most pressing economic problems would be handled by locking a bunch of economists in a room and letting them hack away at market designs. He may be right. And he may well get the hearing he deserves at institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. But pragmatism and rationality have never gotten the crowds out of their seats, cheering. In the marketplace that we call the democratic arena, it will surely be the great simplifiers who continue to set the terms of the debate.

HEADLINE: Amtrak Must Die 

BYLINE:  By John Tierney; John Tierney, who wrote the Big City column, now works in The Times's Washington bureau.

 BODY:
Before we start on Amtrak, I should confess a longstanding bias. I have been praising trains for as long as I have been speaking. In March 1954, at the age of 11 months, I was on the station platform in Lafayette, Ind., when a train from Chicago suddenly appeared around the bend. The sight and sound of the huge diesel locomotive apparently triggered something in my brain. After my grandmother got off the train, I described her arrival by uttering my first sentence.
 "Gaga choochoo," I said, and went on repeating it for months. The fixation moved on to "The Little Engine That Could" and continued through adulthood. I covered the walls of my apartments with paintings of locomotives and rode trains across America and Canada, over the Andes, around Europe. I developed an appreciation for even the miserable trips, like the one on Amtrak's Crescent that ended in New Orleans with an elderly man declaring that his three years in a Russian prison during the Bolshevik Revolution were never this bad. No matter how often Amtrak disappointed, I kept riding. In the hierarchy of train lovers, I was at least a train buff and maybe even a "rail fan," which is the formal term for the ultimate obsessive. The informal term, coined by railroad workers and now used by the obsessives themselves, is "foamer," as in foaming at the mouth. 
 I sometimes worried that trains were economic dinosaurs. But when the free-marketeer in me suspected Amtrak was a government boondoggle, the foamer said it was only fair to subsidize trains since there was already so much aid going to planes and highways. For a long time, I enthusiastically rode trains but avoided economic analyses of rail travel. My policy toward Amtrak was don't ask, don't tell. 
This year, though, the figures have become hard to ignore. Amtrak is nearly bankrupt, and just threatened to shut down the whole system in July. It has hocked just about everything it owns, including a portion of Pennsylvania Station in New York that was mortgaged last year to cover three months of operating expenses -- the equivalent, critics noted, of mortgaging your house to pay grocery bills. Amtrak's president, George Warrington, abruptly quit in March, shortly after a federal commission recommended to Congress that his railroad be dismantled. One of Warrington's last tasks before quitting was to go before the House Appropriations Committee and renounce his previous promises that Amtrak was on a "glide path" to self-sufficiency. 
"Frankly, Mr. Chairman," he said to Representative Harold Rogers, "we've run out of tools in the toolbox to keep the service together."
Rogers consulted a page of numbers, frowning like a father going over his son's MasterCard bill, until he came to a line with $347.45. That was the amount of money per passenger that Amtrak lost on the Sunset Limited train running from Florida to California. 
"Why," Rogers asked, "is this route still being run?"
A fair question. The previous week I had been contemplating it myself aboard that very train. There is a simple answer, which Amtrak's president provided, but first let me give you a foamer's perspective. 
I picked up the Sunset Limited in Houston, which, like many American cities, has a beautiful train station without any trains. The stately marble terminal built by the Southern Pacific Railroad now serves as the vestibule of a baseball stadium. Train passengers have been shunted to the edge of downtown to a no-man's-land of junkyards and warehouses. The station, which looks like a small-town bus depot, sits beneath freeway ramps. It's not an inspiring place to start a trip, but at least we're not standing in line to have our shoes searched, and there is still nothing like a locomotive for making a grand entrance. 
Boarding the train, I head for one of the two sleepers, the modern version of the Pullman cars that used to be manned by porters known for their "miles of smiles." The porter for my sleeper is not smiling. He barely looks at me as he announces: "You can't use your room. I haven't made it up yet."
I go up to the dome car and watch the receding lights of Houston's skyline. A lounge car on a long-distance train must be the friendliest place in America -- nowhere do you find so many different kinds of people happy to talk to strangers. As midnight approaches, a drunken young guy in an orange T-shirt is dispensing romantic advice.
"I can tell you two still love each other," he says to a 40-ish pair sitting across from him. The woman, an attractive redhead named Catherine, has been explaining that she used to be married to the man next to her, Robbie, and was amazed to run into him on the train.
"No, we're not in love," Catherine says. "I swear to God, I had no idea he would be on this train." Robbie, a handsome guy if you don't mind the shoulder-length gray mane of an aging heavy-metal rocker, disagrees with her.
"Now tell me you don't think about me every day," he says.
"I don't think about you every day," she says. "Just sometimes."
"You're lying."
The drunk persists. "I never saw you before in my life, but I can tell you love each other."
"It would never work," Catherine says to Robbie. "You'll never change."
"There you go again," Robbie says. "You were always giving up on me. Just 'cause I didn't come home didn't mean I was with someone else."
She starts sobbing. He gets up and walks behind her so he can stroke her shoulders. "I never stopped loving you," he says.
She looks up. "You slept with my sister!"
"You slept with her first!" 
An elderly woman nearby looks on in horror as the drunk goes on telling them they're meant for each other.
I retreat to my room, which the attendant has made up, though he left a damp dirty towel on the floor next to the toilet. There's more indifferent service at breakfast. The Transcontinental special, an omelet, is reasonably good, but the staff is unfriendly and unenergetic. When an enormous lake appears outside next to the train in the middle of the desert, I ask a waiter -- who makes this trip twice a week -- what we're looking at. He shrugs.
"I have no idea," he says. "Water."
Up in the dome car, though, the sights are being enthusiastically described by a guide from the National Park Service, which manages this 65,000-acre lake along the Mexican border named the Amistad Reservoir. As the train proceeds west, the guide identifies the varieties of local sagebrush and tells us where a member of Butch Cassidy's gang was killed trying to rob a train. The foamers in the car are blissfully taking pictures and assiduously tracking the train's progress. Two rail buffs from England covetously fondle my G.P.S. receiver, which pinpoints our location to within 50 feet. Its electronic map one-ups their paper map, but then I'm promptly outfoamed by one of them, a composer from London named Henry Lewis, who gives me a CD of railroad songs from his musical revue titled "Brief Encounters on the Penistone Line."
The musical comedy, which has been performed on that line, is the latest of what Lewis calls his "transport revues." One of his most successful, "Joan of Kent," was about an English housewife who hears voices in the supermarket telling her to oppose the new high-speed railroad from London to the Chunnel. "I was sympathetic to her," he says, "but all my subsequent shows have been pro-rail."
The other passengers include some phobics afraid of flying, especially after Sept. 11, but most seem to be here because they like trains. 
"You see stuff you weren't really meant to see," says Catherine Suddarth, the redhead who was arguing with her ex-husband last night. She explains that the train ride is her vacation -- and that he isn't really her ex-husband. "I never saw him before in my life. We made up the marriage as we went along for that other guy's benefit. One of those things you do on a train." Suddarth, a market researcher who lives in Greensboro, N.C., is on a one-week circuit of the country. "It's just a great way to relax and meet people, but you have to be in a certain mind-set. You have to adapt to whatever happens." 
The least happy passengers are the ones paying attention to the timetable. The train keeps slowing down or stopping altogether, generally without explanation. As we cross Arizona Saturday night, we're three hours late, normal for this route. "The problem is that some passengers are on regular time," a mechanic says. "We're on Amtrak time."
Shortly before dawn on Sunday, we come to an especially prolonged halt in the California desert. After a cryptic announcement -- We had an accident" -- rumors circulate in the dining car and the dome car. The foamers have placed us precisely 102 miles southeast of Palm Springs, next to a campground used by young Californians racing all-terrain vehicles on the sand dunes. A passenger reports hearing thumps just after the engineer braked. The thumps are explained by another passenger who has been listening to a police radio: the train ran over someone.
Were kids in dune buggies playing chicken with the locomotive? That theory is popular until we hear that the engineer saw the victim, a young man, lying immobile in the tracks, and that his dune buggy was found parked nearby. Was it suicide? Did he get drunk and pass out? A crowd in the dome car debates the possibilities as police cars come and go and teenagers go on racing their dune buggies alongside the train. One passenger, a veteran who has ridden these dunes himself, hypothesizes that the victim was dead before the train got there. "There are always accidents when guys get drunk at night and go out riding," the veteran says. "Maybe he was killed, and his buddies said: 'Let's move him to the tracks. That way no one can investigate what happened, and his family will collect some money from Amtrak.' " Later, though, the local coroner's office will find no evidence of foul play in the death of Michael Black Jr., a 20-year-old busboy from Chino. 
When the train finally starts moving, three and a half hours after the accident, there's no hope of reaching Los Angeles in time for passengers booked on the train for Northern California and Oregon. To catch up with it, they have to get off at our next stop, Palm Springs, and ride a chartered bus several hundred miles up the coast. It could be worse. A few weeks ago the Sunset Limited was already so late by Tucson that it couldn't get to Los Angeles in time for the start of its return trip, so the train simply turned around in Tucson, leaving the passengers with a 500-mile bus ride to Los Angeles. 
We're nearly eight hours behind schedule when we pull into our penultimate stop, Pomona, but then we suddenly make up so much time that we're only six hours late arriving in Los Angeles. The secret to this miracle is in Amtrak's timetable. It allows two hours and 42 minutes for the 32-mile trip from Pomona into Los Angeles, which actually takes only about 50 minutes. Amtrak routinely pads its timetables this way, and yet one-third of its long-distance trains still arrived late last year. Tony Haswell, who led the passengers' advocacy group that lobbied for Amtrak's creation in 1971, used the Freedom of Information Act to identify the worst train of all: the Sunset Limited, which, in the stretch between New Orleans and Los Angeles, pulled in late more than 70 percent of the time. Haswell refuses to take it anymore, even though the train stops right in his hometown, Tucson. "I have to go to a wedding in Houston," says the man who is hailed as the father of Amtrak, "but I'm going to fly."
Why does Amtrak keep running the Sunset Limited? Because it goes through so many Congressional districts. Amtrak's president acknowledged it himself in his reply at that hearing. 
"We are a creature of the political process," Warrington replied. The Sunset Limited, he explained, is "important to maintaining a fragile political national coalition to support Amtrak."
Amtrak's defenders often say that if Congress would just provide a generous and "secure" source of financing -- ideally a share of the revenue from gasoline taxes -- we'd have trains like the ones overseas. But those railroads are good in large part because they're not sprawling, unwieldy systems like Amtrak. If there were a European version of Amtrak, one centralized monopoly running the continent's trains, it would be pandering to politicians in the Pyrenees and in Ukraine by running a half-empty train from Madrid to Moscow -- and subsidizing it with revenues from the Paris-Lyon trains. 
The Acela, which runs on the Northeast Corridor, is Amtrak's closest thing to a success story, particularly since its airline competition was slowed by security delays. Before Sept. 11, the US Airways and Delta shuttles carried nearly 60 percent of the passengers between New York and Washington; now nearly 60 percent of passengers go by train. But Acela has had more than its share of embarrassing missteps. After a painfully long planning process -- the Acela's debut, in 2000, was three years behind schedule -- Amtrak produced a train that goes nowhere near as fast as its European counterparts. Because of track restrictions and a goof in its construction (it turned out four inches wider than planned, so it can't properly tilt on some curves), the Acela hits its peak speed of 150 m.p.h. for only 18 miles between New York and Boston. While European countries have been laying new high-speed tracks, Amtrak is deferring maintenance on tracks in the Northeast Corridor to subsidize long-distance trains elsewhere.
Europe's national railroads suffer from some of the same problems as Amtrak: meddling politicians, inept management, a bloated central bureaucracy and an unproductive work force protected by powerful unions. (Amtrak's veteran workers receive up to five full years of severance pay if their routes are shut down.) But in Europe the international rivalry has put pressure on the railroads to improve service -- German pride required a high-speed train to match the French TGV. Most foreign railroads are subsidized, but the best ones require much less help than Amtrak, and some, notably in Japan, are private companies providing superb and profitable service. If America really wanted to emulate Europe and Japan, we'd break Amtrak up into smaller railroads run either by regional public agencies or by private companies.
During the past decade, Amtrak's costs have been increasing while airlines and bus companies have been cutting theirs. Train lovers and Amtrak executives love to mention the "hundreds of billions of dollars" of federal money spent on highways and airports and air-traffic control. But virtually all that money comes directly from drivers and airline passengers through taxes on gasoline and plane tickets. While taxpayers provide the average Amtrak rider with a subsidy of 30 cents per mile, the average driver or passenger on a plane or bus gets less than a penny, according to Wendell Cox, a member of the Amtrak Reform Council, overseers appointed by Congress and the president. 
Still, don't trains deserve a subsidy because of all the social and environmental benefits they provide? Don't they ease congestion, save energy and reduce pollution? Not enough to notice. Americans use cars, planes and buses for 99.8 percent of the miles they travel between cities, so the remaining 0.2 percent scarcely matters. Analysts at the Cato Institute calculate that even if Amtrak's trains disappeared from the relatively popular Northeast Corridor lines, there would be no need for extra flights (the air shuttles would simply use bigger planes), and each lane of the New Jersey Turnpike would have to accommodate at most 47 additional cars per hour -- just 2 percent of the lane's capacity.
For most Americans, trains are either unavailable or too inconvenient and expensive compared with planes or buses. Cutting the Sunset Limited might actually result in fewer trucks on the roads because it would be easier to ship freight by rail if Amtrak weren't given priority on the Union Pacific's tracks. What environmental or economic sense does it make to give 170 passengers on the Sunset Limited priority over a freight train that's keeping 500 trucks off the road? 
While Amtrak executives claim they need subsidies to counter the unfair competition from highways, the freight railroads have been operating profitably and gaining market share from trucks during the past decade. American freight railroads have been so successful that their biggest problem is congestion on the tracks. Their executives bitterly resent being forced to let Amtrak use their tracks at discount rates. In addition to complaining about the delays that result, they have been warning that it's dangerous to mix faster passenger trains with freight trains on congested tracks. 
The freight railroads, like the airlines and bus companies, were forced to become more efficient after their industry was deregulated. Would Amtrak's customers also benefit if the federal government stopped trying to control the passenger-train business? Congress could make a clean break by reviving a 19th-century tradition for dealing with failing railroads: liquidation of assets. That's the approach recommended by Joseph Vranich, a former spokesman for Amtrak who became its chief critic with a 1997 book titled "Derailed." He calls the railroad "a halfway house for bad managers." In conjunction with libertarians at the Cato Institute and the Reason Public Policy Institute, Vranich has proposed letting a court sell off Amtrak's assets and consider bids from public organizations, like regional transit agencies or consortiums of states, and also from private companies. Vranich, unlike some of his libertarian allies, doesn't mind the idea of continuing federal subsidies to the new owners of the tracks and trains. "But if we have to subsidize any passenger trains," he says, "let's get our money's worth."
A less radical reform for American trains would be to introduce competition gradually, as the Amtrak Reform Council recommended to Congress. Its plan would turn the Northeast Corridor over to a new public corporation, essentially a regional public agency run by state and federal officials. Amtrak would initially keep operating trains in the Northeast and elsewhere, but within several years, private and public competitors could be allowed to bid for routes.
Some optimists believe that short-distance trains in the Northeast and other densely populated corridors -- Southern California, Florida, parts of the Midwest and Texas -- could cover their operating expenses and possibly generate a profit if they were run by a private company freed of political constraints (like labor contracts dictated by Congress). Not even optimists, though, expect Amtrak's long-distance network to become profitable. Long-distance trains have been losing passengers to planes throughout the world, including Europe. Whatever reform or rescue gets through Congress may well involve shutting down some of the costlier trains, starting with the Sunset Limited. Yet even if the Sunset Limited no longer crosses the Southwest, there may still be solace for train buffs who want to see the desert in style. The new hope, as I discovered on my way home from California, is to reinvent another grand railroad tradition: Fred Harvey and the Harvey Girls.
When you board the American Orient Express, as I did in Los Angeles, the first clue that you're not on Amtrak comes in the lobby of the train station. A line of smiling porters in crisp blue-and-gold uniforms is waiting there, and they will not take no for an answer when they offer to carry your bag. They escort you to the train, a collection of half-century-old Streamliner sleepers and lounge cars with gleaming brass and rich mahogany. The trains were refurbished at a cost of $15 million during the 1980's in the mistaken belief that business travelers wanted a deluxe overnight train between Washington and Chicago. There weren't enough people with both the time and the expense accounts to support a regularly scheduled train. Only after that venture went bust did a new owner find a way to profit from long-distance train travel.
The secret was to go even slower than Amtrak. Our train would take 10 days to get from Los Angeles to Washington. It would meander on little-used tracks -- rare mileage," as foamers call it -- and stop along the way to let the passengers go sightseeing. We were on a "land cruise," a new term in the travel industry, although the concept wouldn't have seemed novel to 19th-century railroaders. The national parks in the West were created in large part because the railroads wanted to sell tickets to sightseers. The first stop on our trip, the Grand Canyon, became a tourist destination thanks to the Santa Fe Railroad. When we got off the train a few steps from the canyon, we were visiting not merely a natural wonder. To historians of the travel industry, to scholars of chain restaurants and hotels, this was the shrine to Fred Harvey, the great patron saint of tourists.
Until Harvey came along in the 1880's, service in the railroad industry was even worse than it is today on Amtrak. When the train stopped to get water for the steam engine, passengers would dash into a shack next to the tracks for a 20-minute meal of greasy, stale, often rancid food. Harvey, a freight agent on the Burlington Railroad, couldn't interest his own railroad in better meals, so he took his vision of a fast-food chain to the Santa Fe, which was then desperate to attract riders. After he took over restaurants along the Santa Fe's route, the railroad prospered with a new advertising slogan, "Meals by Fred Harvey."
To improve service, Harvey trained a crack corps of waitresses called Harvey Girls. At a time when it was said there were "no ladies west of Dodge City and no women west of Albuquerque," Harvey carefully recruited girls of "good character" and housed them in supervised dormitories. Dressed in starched aprons and high collars, they became Western icons of domestic virtue, inspiring a Judy Garland movie ("The Harvey Girls," with its Oscar-winning train song, "On the Atchison, Topeka & the Santa Fe") and a Will Rogers line: "They have kept the West supplied with food and wives." Harvey became renowned for paying his employees well while also terrifying them with surprise inspections. When he died in 1901, his last words to his sons were reported to be, "Don't cut the ham too thin."
After visiting El Tovar Hotel and the rest of Harvey's legacy at the Grand Canyon, I realized he wouldn't last long at Amtrak. The railroad has some wonderfully dedicated workers who love trains, but Amtrak has never figured out what to do with the ones just there for a paycheck. Even after its recent Service Success program sent the entire work force off for weekend training sessions, the ratings of customer satisfaction did not improve. 
But Fred Harvey would feel right at home on the American Orient Express. As we were heading away from the Grand Canyon, we sat down to dinner at tables decorated with flowers and set with china, silver and crystal. The four-course meal was prepared by Warren McLeod, a veteran of Manhattan's best restaurants. (His last job was as poissonier at Alain Ducasse.) His food was consistently great, but the biggest contrast with Amtrak was his attitude. Unlike the dining-car attendants on the Sunset Limited, he did not believe in ordering diners out of the car the minute he was scheduled to be off duty. When some stragglers showed up one morning just as breakfast was supposed to be ending, he immediately announced he'd be open for another hour. When I talked to him later, he couldn't understand my surprise.
"It was just common sense," he said. "Food is available all day long here. If you come to me and say, 'I've got a snacky thing going on,' I'll say, 'Give me 10 minutes, and I'm all over it.' "
The American Orient Express could afford service like this because it had three dozen workers taking care of just 80 passengers, whereas Amtrak had just a dozen or so staff members looking after the 170 passengers on my trip. Still, there isn't that much difference in the cost. The American Orient's basic fare -- covering meals and a shared room with a couch, two bunk beds, a sink and a small cubicle with a toilet -- was $3,990 per passenger, which sounds astronomical compared with the $660 it would cost for similar amenities on the Sunset Limited's transcontinental trip. But then, the trip on the Sunset Limited is only three days, whereas the luxury train keeps you fed and entertained for 11 days. The fare per day per passenger works out to $220 on Amtrak versus $363 on the luxury train, and remember, the fare on the Sunset Limited doesn't cover all of Amtrak's costs. The Sunset Limited loses an average of $115 per day per passenger. When you add that in, the cost per passenger on the Sunset Limited climbs to $335 per day, nearly the same as the fare on the luxury train. 
The American Orient Express is doing so well that it is refurbishing a second train and expanding its itineraries, adding trips through Mexico, the antebellum South, the Canadian Rockies and New England during foliage season. This summer a rival, the Acadian Railway Company, is starting similar trips from New York through Maine and Canada. So far the land-cruise business is still beyond most people's price range and appeals mainly to the elderly, but then that was the condition of the ocean-cruise business a couple of decades ago. Ship operators have since cut costs to attract the middle class as well as younger passengers, and train operators could probably do the same if the heavily subsidized competition from Amtrak didn't make it harder for them to build a larger customer base and achieve economies of scale. If Washington had reacted to the demise of the trans-Atlantic passenger ships by nationalizing ocean liners and subsidizing mediocre service, there'd be a lot fewer private cruise ships plying the waters.
I tried making these arguments to the train buffs on the American Orient Express. We were sitting on what we called the foamers' bench, a round settee, watching the Texas desert through the wraparound windows at the rear of the train. The view couldn't have been lovelier, and we were thrilled to think that this very observation car had once been part of the fabled Twentieth Century Limited, but my companions wanted more. "I love this train, but I want Amtrak too," said Karl Zimmermann, a railroad historian who was one of the lecturers on board. "I like a working train that's taking me from one place to another. I don't want to just have cruises." 
I said it's not fair to have taxpayers subsidize our hobby, but my conviction wavered when the conductor came by and mentioned an upcoming sight. The reason we were pulling into a siding, he said, was to make way for the Sunset Limited, which was coming from the opposite direction on this stretch of single track. 
I dashed to the vestibule and leaned out to watch the distant locomotive approaching. Bracing for the roar, for another gaga choochoo moment, I wondered if this would be the last time I would ever see this train. Was the Sunset Limited going literally and figuratively into the sunset? I was preparing to mourn the end of a tradition as the last car disappeared into the West, but I didn't get the chance. The Sunset Limited ingloriously coasted to a halt right alongside us. 
"They've lost their head-in power," our conductor said. As we pulled out of the siding, the Sunset Limited was still sitting out there in the sagebrush baking in the midday heat. It was not the romantic last glimpse I was hoping for, but maybe that's just as well. Sometimes a foamer needs to see that Amtrak is going nowhere. All it's doing is blocking the tracks.

HEADLINE: The Attorney General Goes To War 

BYLINE:  By James Traub; James Traub, a contributing writer for the magazine, last wrote about school testing.

 BODY:
A few years ago, Eliot L. Spitzer, the attorney general of New York and a Democrat, was invited to speak before the Federalist Society, the legal group whose members abhor the use of courts to force political change -- at least liberal political change -- and have helped formulate the key conservative tenet that power should devolve from the central government, including the federal courts, to the states. "I told them that I had had an epiphany and I was now a fervent Federalist," Spitzer said. "Having won this job as attorney general of a state, this devolution of power was a wonderful thing: they were limiting the feds, they were shifting to us, so we could go off and sue the tobacco companies." Spitzer claims that his audience was "ashen." This seems unlikely, but melodrama is so foreign to Spitzer's nature that perhaps he can be permitted this one moment of self-satisfied hyperbole. 
 We are, in fact, in the midst of an era of widespread state-level judicial activism, and Eliot Spitzer is the most activist, or at least the most prominent, attorney general around. Since being elected in 1998, at age 39, Spitzer has expanded the scope of the office by using novel approaches to the law in order to go after large-scale targets -- including gun manufacturers, drug companies and Midwestern polluters -- often in concert with other state attorneys general. He has won some and lost some. But nothing Spitzer has done has remotely had the impact of the news conference he held April 8, at which he announced that research analysts at Merrill Lynch had published false and misleading stock recommendations, an act he characterized as "an outrageous betrayal of their trust and a shocking abuse of the system." 
 The dominoes haven't stopped falling since. In one giddy two-day period, Harvey Pitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and a stout believer in industry self-regulation, announced that he had changed his mind and ordered an investigation of his own, and David Komansky, the chairman of Merrill, which until that moment had furiously rejected the allegations, publicly apologized for the deception. And then on May 21, Spitzer
announced that Merrill had agreed to pay a $100 million fine; to issue a "statement of contrition"; and to compensate its research analysts "only for those activities and services intended to benefit Merrill Lynch investor clients," rather than, as had been the case, according to how much they helped the firm's investment-banking business. There is wide disagreement on Wall Street about how profoundly the settlement will alter the behavior of investment banks, but even Merrill's most staunch defenders, like Edward Fleischman, a securities lawyer and former S.E.C. official, says that Merrill and other companies are likely to change practices and policies "because they want to be perceived by their clients as having their clients' interests first and foremost." Spitzer has provoked fear -- and some loathing -- on Wall Street.
I first visited Spitzer in his office in downtown Manhattan a few weeks after the news conference. He greeted me with a young man's bone-crushing handshake. Spitzer is a kind of Dudley Do-Right character: earnest, a bit stiff, with one of those unvaryingly deep voices that project precocious moral authority. He has a forehead made prominent by a receding hairline and a chin you could play pinochle on -- a granite, prosecutorial chin. For all that, he gives the impression of being relatively equable -- a bit zealous, perhaps, but not driven by the furies. "He doesn't have the extra chromosome," as a friend of his puts it. 
Spitzer was an editor of the law review at Harvard Law School, and he has the talented law student's gift of sorting particulars into bright categories. He listens to questions with the avidity of a tennis player waiting to smash back a serve, and once he knows where you're going, he starts muttering "Right, right, right" as he waits with diminishing patience for you to finish. When I asked Spitzer whether the new states' rights movement had in some sense made his investigation of Merrill possible, he said, "Let's disaggregate the pieces." Attorney general activism, he said, probably has less to do with new legal doctrine or judicial decision-making than with "an emotional shift" toward deregulation and deconcentration of power that began under President Reagan and has gathered force under George W. Bush. Spitzer quoted something else he had said to the Federalists: "Isn't it the case that there was no ideological content to the pure notion of where the decisions are made?" 
Of course there was; Spitzer and other attorneys general are filling a void that was intended, by the anti-Washington right, to be filled by the marketplace -- by, say, self-regulating Wall Street businesses -- not by other legal actors like state A.G.'s. James Tierney, who teaches multistate litigation at Columbia Law School and served for 10 years as the attorney general of Maine, confirms Spitzer's view (and adds that the new activism also has a great deal to do with the nationalization of the economy). Tierney considers Spitzer's investigation of Merrill and other investment banks a trailblazing action that will spur his colleagues elsewhere. "Once the attorneys general have entered a field," he says, "they don't go out."
An attorney general who interprets his consumer-protection mandate expansively can exercise a form of power that is almost more legislative than judicial. I spent a morning watching Spitzer, and I was struck by how explicitly he was seeking to forge, or at least shape, social policy. He spent an hour preparing to argue an appeal in a case his office had brought seeking to prevent gun manufacturers from distributing guns to retailers that, in turn, made guns available to criminals -- a form of judicially mandated gun control. (That Spitzer had decided to argue this extremely difficult case himself illustrates the pleasure he takes in the intellectual aspect of the law.) Spitzer had brought the case under the state's public-nuisance laws; at the time, no court had ever agreed to apply such laws to any consumer product, much less a gun. Indeed, no other state attorney general had tried to sue gun manufacturers. The case, not surprisingly, had been thrown out by a lower court. An assistant at the meeting, playing the role of judge, suggested that it was federal regulators, who monitor gun sales, that should be bringing the case. Spitzer's answer was, in effect, "They haven't."
Later in the morning, Spitzer met with the head of his labor bureau to go over a proposal for owners of produce stores to sign a code promising to pay workers the minimum wage as well as extra wages for overtime -- in exchange for which the owners would be exempt from future litigation. He discussed with his chief deputies continuing negotiations with the owners of Midwestern utilities he had sued under an untested provision of the federal Clean Air Act. Spitzer argues that acid rain from the Midwest is drifting into New York. Peter Lehner, head of the attorney general's environmental protection bureau, reported that while the utilities no longer fear federal action from the deregulators in the Bush administration, they were deeply worried about the states. Spitzer smiled -- the expression of a man who considers himself the Federalist Society's worst nightmare. 
And to hear the Federalists, he is. Walter Olson, a Federalist in good standing, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute and the author of a book soon to be published on mass litigation, says that on guns, "Spitzer wishes to second-guess the results of the democratic process." Olson says that the fact that Spitzer is asking a judge to impose penalties on gun manufacturers -- including out-of-state gun manufacturers -- should cause "the mental alarms of all conservative federalists to start ringing." 
Eliot Spitzer grew up in Riverdale, a wealthy enclave in the Bronx. His mother was an English teacher and his father an engineer who made a fortune in real estate. The family dinner table was the scene of high-minded debate. The youngest of three children, Eliot was sent off to Horace Mann, a private school consisting back then almost entirely of terribly serious, intellectually combative well-to-do Jewish boys like himself. From there he went to Princeton, where he continued to be high-minded, scholarly and combative. Carl Mayer, a friend and classmate, says that he and Spitzer specialized in "intensely fierce competitions," whether in running, tennis, basketball or even spaghetti-eating. As a freshman, he occasionally commuted back to the Bronx in order to serve as treasurer of the Benjamin Franklin Democratic Club.
Though this was a time when student government enjoyed an extremely dim reputation at Princeton, Spitzer ran for student-body president in his sophomore year and won. He took the job very seriously and did it very well. There is a widespread view among Spitzer's old friends that politics was always his destiny. Spitzer, however, sees himself in a very different light. The pattern, he says, was a passionate interest in government, in service -- not in politics. He was thinking Cyrus Vance, not Mark Green.
Spitzer went on to Harvard Law School and joined the Manhattan district attorney's office in 1986. Michael Cherkasky, who was Spitzer's boss in the labor-racketeering division, says that he recognized the young man's brilliance and "fast tracked" him. Spitzer masterminded one of the best-known cases of his time, an investigation into mob control of trucking in the garment district; he conceived the idea of offering Thomas Gambino, the chief suspect, a deal in which Gambino could avoid jail by agreeing to plead guilty to a criminal offense, make a $12 million restitution and promise to stay out of the business. Cherkasky describes it as an ingenious solution and a "creative use of law enforcement."
Spitzer left the D.A.'s office in 1992 for the duly prestigious firm of Skadden, Arps but found that he was bored by private practice. The reigning attorney general, Robert Abrams, had stepped down after a run for the Senate, and an election was coming up in 1994. It was an elective office, but it was a legal office, and it had a wide ambit in social and economic issues. Spitzer decided to run. He had no important backers, no ties to the Democratic Party and no political skills. He would have been a laughable candidate save for one thing: he was rich. Spitzer spent $4 million, which buys a great deal of attention in a primary race for attorney general. Spitzer ran as a pro-death-penalty, tough-on-crime Democrat, despite the fact that A.G.'s have relatively little to do with criminal issues. 
He finished last in a field of four. But he almost immediately began campaigning for the next election, slogging across the state and presenting himself to county leaders, who were surprised to discover just how much this rich Harvard boy wanted one of the state's least glamorous jobs. This time around, he won the primary and beat the Republican incumbent, Dennis Vacco, in a race so close that it took six weeks for Spitzer to be declared the winner. 
The Merrill Case represents the convergence of a number of forces: the new state-level activism, deregulation at the federal level and Spitzer's own ambitious legal formulations and flair for public relations, a talent common to all successful prosecutors, at least in New York. Spitzer's office began its investigation last summer, and it chugged along uneventfully until January, when Spitzer discovered the e-mail messages that Merrill Lynch's analysts had been sending to one another and to the company's investment bankers. Suddenly, he felt that he had not only proof of guilt but also a mighty cudgel with which to beat the firm into submission. Those messages have now joined Sherron Watkins's letter to Kenneth Lay warning of accounting fraud at Enron as iconic documents of corporate fraud. 
There is a curious difference, though, in that the authors of the e-mail messages plainly felt that they were engaging in conventional, if possibly unfair, behavior. The routine behavior was using stock recommendations as a marketing device to attract investment-banking business rather than as an analytical tool for investors, though the bank publicly represented the research as just such a tool. A ringingly positive recommendation from a celebrity analyst could do wonders for a client's stock offering, though of course it would mislead the naive investor. What made the e-mail messages so powerful is that they often caught the analysts at moments of bad conscience, as when, most famously, Henry Blodget, Merrill's celebrated Internet analyst, threatened that he would no longer "cut companies any slack" and thus that "we are going to just start calling the stocks . . . like we see them, no matter what the ancillary business consequences are."
Spitzer's release of those explosive documents had precisely the effect he had calculated -- they created public outrage. Merrill's initial response was that the e-mail messages had been taken out of context and that the charges demonstrated "a fundamental lack of understanding of how securities research works within the overall capital-raising process." When I first contacted Merrill, an official promised to put together a group of bankers to defend the company's position for me. But that meeting never came off. Merrill's stock lost $9 billion in value in the wake of the release of the e-mail messages, and the company gave up the fight. 
The reaction on much of Wall Street and in the business press was that Merrill had done nothing that merited state intervention and that Spitzer had essentially blackmailed the company into submission. An editorial in Barron's argued that "half-wit speculators" who purchase risky stocks on analysts' recommendations don't deserve legal protection and that Spitzer was trampling on the First Amendment rights of the analysts. Spitzer's answer was that most investors did not, in fact, understand that the analysts' recommendations were rigged, and, as he says, "I've got a job, and it's to protect small investors." 
It is also true that the regulation of the stock exchange has traditionally been left to the exchange itself and to the S.E.C. But Spitzer argued that the regulators had failed to pursue or even recognize the inherent conflict he had uncovered, and he seized on a state securities law, the Martin Act, that had been used in the past to pursue boiler-room operations and Ponzi schemes.
Spitzer initially hoped to force Merrill to build a sort of church-state wall between the research and banking sides but backed off when Wall Street figures explained that research could not survive without being subsidized by banking. Spitzer continued to maintain, however, that he had to eliminate the incentives for analysts to cook their recommendations, and so the agreement he reached with Merrill not only spells out the activities for which analysts can and cannot be compensated but also establishes a "Research Recommendation Committee" to embed these new rules in the firm's daily decision-making.
Financial authorities are not altogether persuaded that even these measures will change so deep-seated a system. John Coffee, a professor at Columbia Law School and an expert on financial law, says, "I think at the margin it does represent significant reform," but adds, "Analysts are still going to be partly a neutral umpire and partly a securities salesman." Coffee also notes, "For those people who were screaming about how reckless Spitzer was, I think the industry, and Merrill specifically, can thank its lucky stars, because he had it in his power to crucify them." In exchange for reaching a final settlement with Merrill, Spitzer has forgone the opportunity to put Blodget and others under oath for the equivalent of public grand jury testimony. Nevertheless, he has extended his investigation to virtually all the major Wall Street banks, and Merrill's competitors are now on notice about the price they may have to pay to avoid a fate worse than Merrill's. 
A recent Op-Ed in The Wall Street Journal suggested that Spitzer had taken on Merrill for the same reason Rudy Giuliani had supposedly targeted insider trading -- to "further his own career." Spitzer of course denies the allegation, but you cannot hurt your political standing by crusading against Wall Street at a time when millions of Americans want someone to blame for the evaporation of a chunk of their assets. (Spitzer's position is considered so impregnable that the Republicans have put up a virtually unknown judge to oppose him this fall -- an indubitable proof of political success.)
Democratic officials do, in fact, view Spitzer as their very own Giuliani -- a prosecutor who wants to go far, and will. According to a vision of Spitzer's future now floating around New York Democratic political circles, this fall the Republican governor, George Pataki, will beat either Andrew Cuomo or Carl McCall, who are seeking the Democratic nomination, and then retire at the end of his third term. And in 2006, as one ranking Democrat puts it, "it's going to be King Kong vs. Godzilla" -- Spitzer vs. Cuomo for the Democratic nomination. "Look for Eliot and Andrew to be always positioning themselves against each other in regard to 2006," he adds. Hank Sheinkopf, who was Spitzer's media consultant in the 1998 campaign, says: "He brings the right side and the left side of the Democratic Party spectrum in one place. He's a tough competitor, extraordinarily smart, and who knows where he'll end up?"
Spitzer still does not consider himself any kind of politician. In his own mind, he is the same thing he has always been: a public-spirited lawyer. "I'm not really suited for other kinds of office," he told me.
I asked if he meant that the rumors about 2006 were baseless. Spitzer saw that he had made a misstep, and a pained grin twisted his long jaw. He paused -- even a short pause feels long with Spitzer -- and then said mechanically, "The only position I'm thinking about running for now is re-election."
I asked another member of Spitzer's 1998 team if I should assume that Spitzer was running in 2006. "You shouldn't assume it," he said. "You should know it."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/New Jersey; 
Two Historically Significant Sites to Become Offices

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN 

 BODY:
THE First Union Bank building in Elizabeth and the Summit Opera House in Summit, two historically significant structures in New Jersey that had fallen on hard times, are being given new lives as commercial office space.
 In both cases, grand old facades will be repaired and restored, while neglected interiors will be revamped and rebuilt. 
 The three-story limestone bank building, on Broad Street next to the train station in Elizabeth, is "right at the heart" of the city's historic midtown district, said Mayor J. Christian Bollwage. St. John's Episcopal Church and its cemetery, where tombstones date to the Revolutionary War, are two blocks away on Broad Street, Elizabeth's main road downtown.
The bank building, built in 1909, has a neo-Classical-style exterior with a granite base and an ornate hanging clock. Inside, there is a lavishly ornamented vault with gothic spires at its corners that will be preserved as a showpiece when the office space is modernized. 
The First Union building housed only a bank until seven years ago, when it closed its doors amid a wave of bank consolidations. It stood as an elegant, empty shell for five years while First Union considered offers to buy it.
"There were some far-out proposals for use of the property," said Mr. Bollwage, who has been mayor since 1993. "They wanted to put a Dollar Store in there and rip out part of the facade for a sign. And there was a proposal for an indoor flea market, if you can believe it, which I actively opposed.
"It was important to both government and business leaders that this building not fall to this type of use." Elizabeth's downtown has made a comeback, with commercial space downtown now 98 percent occupied, the mayor said, and the bank building is the only midsize space still vacant.
Daniel Sullivan, the executive director of the nonprofit Elizabeth Development Corporation, a quasi-public agency that serves as the city's development arm, describes the structure as the best possible location for commercial property. "You walk outside and you're at the train station," he said. "It is located at the busiest intersection, on the busiest street, and besides that, it's the most beautiful building -- aside from the church -- that we have." 
Two years ago, the development corporation, which is run by the business community with federal block grant funds funneled through the city, bought the bank building and began working on plans for a suitable resurrection.
"It will become office space," Mr. Sullivan said earlier this month, "maybe offices for attorneys or doctors, maybe even a bank again on the first floor where the vault is." Mr. Sullivan said he vividly recalled going into the imposing building, then housing Union County Trust, as an 18-year-old on his way to Seton Hall University to apply for a $2,000 college loan.
"It looks the way a bank -- with capital letters -- should look, or least that's what a person of my vintage thinks a bank should look like," Mr. Sullivan said.
The architect for the project, Matthew B. Jarmel, a principal of Jarmel Kizel Architects and Engineers of Livingston, said: "We want to respect the historic appearance of the building. At the same time, the goal of our renovation is to make the building as flexible as possible."
Mechanical systems are being modernized and upgraded, Mr. Jarmel said, and windows will be replaced with energy-conserving restoration models in the same style as the existing windows.
Originally, the building had a three-story lobby with skylight windows, according to the architect. That grand space was covered over at the first-floor level -- probably for heat conservation purposes -- about 30 years ago.
"Our thinking now is to take that two-story space above the lobby ceiling and construct two floors within it," Mr. Jarmel said. "That will increase the floor area of the building by 10,000 square feet, taking the total to about 25,000 square feet. We will put an elevator in the lobby, after we take out the old single-passenger elevator at the back of the bank."
IN Summit, the project also entails both restoration and modernization. The developer, Sheldon Gross Realty, took over the property when it fell into receivership after mortgage forfeiture.
Sheldon Gross, president and chief executive of the company that bears his name, said the Opera House was built about the same time as the bank in Elizabeth. The building, which is across the street from Summit Town Hall, originally, was a performing arts hall, and it still has massive organ pipes running up one of its walls.
The building has a yellow brick facade with columns and tiled cornice detailing, storefront windows at ground level and tall arched windows above. "Inside, it has had a lot of additions and changes," Mr. Gross said. "We're not sure when they were all put in -- but some aspects are obviously not original."
At the time the building went into receivership, Mr. Gross said, two brothers, members of the Ryder family, which had possessed the Opera House for many years, owned it. The brothers evidently lived and worked there, he said. There are two apartments on the third floor and the brothers operated a small business in one of them, restoring and selling exotic music boxes.
Meanwhile, a high-tech computer company called Face to Face -- a Lucent Technologies spinoff -- operated from the totally renovated and modern second floor. "It's kind of amazing," Mr. Gross said. "You walk into the old Opera House building, and upstairs there is the office with state-of-the-art computers, a dropped ceiling and completely up-to-date lighting, a gorgeous kitchen, everything a modern office has."
The computer company folded in the dot-com crash last year, he said. After it stopped paying rent, and the J. B. Winberie restaurant on the ground floor got into a dispute over building repairs with the owners and moved out, the building owners could no longer meet their mortgage payments, Mr. Gross said. The building went into receivership, and the bank turned it over to Mr. Gross's property management company to restore it to economic viability.
Mr. Gross, who lives not far from the Opera House, said that he had long known the building as a landmark and that he used to dine at Winberie.
"We are negotiating with Winberie's to move back in," he said. "We are also looking for a tenant for that gorgeous second-floor space. The only tenant at this time is an antiques store called Design One on the first floor."
The restaurant owners have said they would want to reopen in the Opera House building only if its historic character was preserved, Mr. Gross said.
"It's a great building, right across from Town Hall," he said. "Everybody knows it and loves it. It would be very bad to alter the exterior, from the point of view of p.r. We are working with historical contractors to repair and restore it."
Sheldon Gross Realty has handled restoration work before, having done it with an old industrial building in Cranford and a mixed-use building in downtown Montclair.
The exterior of the Opera House needs considerable work: repointing of the brick, repair and replacement of leaky windows, repair of the gutters that form part of the cornice and some roof work.
Last fall, just after the building changed hands, a steam heating valve got stuck, and water began flooding from the third floor down. His company's specialists in heating, ventilation and cooling "had to rush in," Mr. Gross said. "And we had to decide right then what the approach would be on making repairs. It would have been easy to rip off part of the roof and put the heating/cooling units up there.
"But we didn't. That just wouldn't have been right for this building."

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
This Time, The Fed Is Boxed In On Rates

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
IN his public statements, Alan Greenspan is upbeat. The recovery is happening, he says. Let's hope so. When an upturn seems in danger of fizzling, as this one does, the Fed normally keeps it on track by cutting interest rates. This time, however, Mr. Greenspan is a spectator just as the rest of us are, unable for now to exercise his power.
 A turning point may even be at hand, justifying a rate cut to prevent a slowing economy from deteriorating into another recession -- the famous double dip that a few weeks ago appeared so unlikely. But this is one of those awkward moments in the annals of the Federal Reserve when acting to offset the next anticipated twist in the economy is not feasible. The Fed is boxed in. Raising rates, or lowering them right now, would be harmful. 
 The Fed has tied its own hands. Mr. Greenspan and his fellow policy makers have signed onto the proposition that the economy is expanding. That was the message in their statement after their last meeting, in early May. And nothing they have said in public since then has substantially amended that view. Some have also said that over the long run, interest rates cannot stay as low as they are.
Taking their cues from the Fed, and from their own optimism, Wall Street forecasters have been trying to predict when the policy makers will begin to raise rates in anticipation of rising inflation. Three months ago, many expected the first increase to come at the policy makers' meeting on June 25 and 26; now they expect it in the late fall. 
Virtually no one publicly imagines a rate cut as the Fed's next step. Mr. Greenspan himself steers people away from that option, and in doing so has shelved it, although signals of economic deterioration -- falling stock prices, weakening retail and auto sales and signs of deflation -- might in fact justify more stimulus from the Fed as protection against a dip back into recession. 
Unanticipated stimulus, however, would be no stimulus at all. An abrupt rate cut after so much happy talk about recovery would be viewed as an announcement that Mr. Greenspan and his colleagues had lost faith in the recovery. "Lowering rates would scare the living daylights out of everyone," said Albert Wojnilower, an economic consultant and forecaster. Whatever relief consumers would receive from lower rates would be offset by their fright. Adding to the damage, the weakening stock market would undoubtedly take another dive.
But if lowering interest rates now would be bad timing, raising them seems wrong-headed. In an unsteady economy, the potential damage from a rate increase is considerable.
Debt payments would rise, for example. The dollar might strengthen, hurting exports. Profits would be squeezed. Home sales would suffer from higher mortgage rates, perhaps ending the phenomenal rise in home prices in recent months. Rising home prices have allowed sellers to come away with more cash, which many have then used for spending. Just as an unanticipated rate cut would pull down stock prices, so would a rate increase.
So raising rates is not an option. And neither is lowering them, until the Fed regains leeway to do so by changing its message. Maybe that is beginning to happen. Last Wednesday, the Fed issued its beige book, a quarterly assessment of economic conditions based on data collected by its 12 regional banks. The economy continued to expand through May, the beige book concluded, but the details described an expansion that was noticeably less robust than the one portrayed in the previous book, issued on April 24.
THE Fed manipulates the economy by raising or lowering the federal funds rate. This is the interest that banks and other lenders charge each other to acquire funds, which they relend to the public at a slightly higher rate. Fighting the recession as well as the damage from the punctured stock bubble and from Sept. 11, the Fed cut the federal funds rate to 1.75 percent last year, its lowest level in a generation. It has remained there for more than six months.
Some economists contend that another rate cut, even if justified, would not be of much help. After all, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is already down to 6.71 percent; how much lower can it go? If the bottom has been reached, then the Fed is really in a fix. Others, however, say that with inflation edging down, the inflation-adjusted "real" cost of borrowing is gradually rising, just when it should not be.
Opportunity exists. If the Fed can get the message right, a rate cut this summer would be a helpful boost for an increasingly uncertain economy -- and recognition from the Fed that this is not an easy recovery.

Who's on First? Must Be Buffett, Because Greenspan Is at Bat

BYLINE:  By Patrick McGeehan (COMPILED BY HUBERT B. HERRING) 

 BODY:
Leave it to William H. Miller III to start a collection of baseballs autographed by famous financiers.
 Mr. Miller, the cerebral manager of the Legg Mason Value Trust mutual fund and an avid fan of the Baltimore Orioles, took along a ball when he visited the legendary investor Warren E. Buffett last month. 
He got the idea, he explained at a lunch last week at the Rainbow Room in Manhattan, after attending the All-Star Game in 1993. 
 That day, he snatched a ball that one of his sons had intended to be signed by one of his own idols, and scored a coup: the first -- and possibly only -- baseball signed by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve.
At a steakhouse in Omaha, his set grew to two when Mr. Buffett signed as Warren "the Whip" Buffett.
"Now he's got both ends," Mr. Buffett said on Thursday. "He's got the sublime with Alan, and he's got the ridiculous with me. Now he can fill them in." Patrick McGeehan

HEADLINE: Secrets Of the Yo-Yo's 

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN DOWD; E-mail: liberties@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Karl, Karl, Karl.
 All this time, we've been hearing about what a big brain you are, how you have the pulse of every constituency, from Baptist Hispanics in rural areas to suburban moms who watch 15 hours a week of the Lifetime channel, at your clever fingertips. 
 We've heard about your disquisitions on American history, like your contention that William McKinley was really smarter than his political boss, Mark Hanna.
But now, tragically, we discover you're just another PowerPoint pinhead with a color-coded chart.
A megalomaniac marooned in the banality of demography. 
The White House was in a swivet over the Case of the Slipped Disk, as CNN dubbed it -- one of several odd slip-ups lately by the formerly disciplined and tight-lipped Bush administration.
Roll Call, the Capitol Hill newspaper, first reported the too-good-to-be-true story of a Democratic Senate staffer happening upon a computer disk dropped on a street corner by a White House intern -- can't the White House recruit any discreet interns? -- containing a confidential analysis of the 2002 election by Karl Rove and the White House political director Kenneth Mehlman.
With Karen Hughes leaving, Mr. Rove is giddily spreading his wings in the West Wing. As chief of staff Andy Card told Ron Suskind in the new Esquire, Karen and Karl had a moderate and conservative "beauty and the beast" routine going.
Now we will be treated to the beast, unleashed.
The strategist from Texas has been nicknamed "Boy Genius" by the president and aggrandizes himself as "The Honorable Karl C. Rove" in the lost-and-found slide show.
If you think the secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood are lame, check out the secrets of the Yo-Yo Brotherhood.
The Rove doctrine is simple in the extreme: "Maintain Base." The base he lists sounds like a lyric from "Oklahoma!" -- "Farmers, Ranchers, Coal & Steel." Even before we learned Mr. Rove's deepest, darkest secrets, we had already cottoned on to the fact that looser standards on coal dust and higher steel tariffs were campaign initiatives.
"Identify Issue Synergies," the White House political team exhorts. What on earth is an issue synergy? Is that the intersection between Enron and Halliburton?
"Maintain a positive issue environment," they instruct. Not a positive global environment, of course, just a positive issue environment. In midterm elections, they intone, "Presidents' standing matters." No kidding.
Karl urges Republicans to "Focus on War." Milking that war again. And "Promote Compassion Agenda." Not compassion itself, mind you, just the trompe l'oeil agenda.
Karl predicts that the Democrats will "question the President's Middle East Strategy."
The Democrats might do that if they can ever figure out what the president's Middle East strategy is.
The politico also thinks the Democrats will pound the G.O.P. with "the Budget, Tax Cuts and Enron for Class Warfare." Why must the Democrats always pester the Haves with that Have-Not piffle?
In his "Summary of Recent Data," Karl happily reports: "No evidence that Enron attacks, POTUS political activity or economy has significantly impacted the President's rating."
A predictable insight into the Rove world view. He worries about Enron as a potential political attack rather than an economic calamity in which thousands of people lost their shirts and their jobs.
And the phrase "POTUS political activity" is an acknowledgment that despite the strenuous public attempts of aides to mythologize W. as someone who always does the right thing, rather than the calculated thing, this president, like the one he succeeded, can put pragmatism over principle.
Mr. Rove sanguinely refers to the deeply jittery economy as "recovering," making it sound like a movie star at a Malibu rehab center.
The maps and charts bear the stamp of the chief political adviser's "Office of Strategic Inititatives." The name sounds uncomfortably close to the Office of Strategic Influence, the shadowy department in the Pentagon that was going to plant deliberately false stories in the foreign press -- before word leaked out and Rummy was forced to shut it.
Since our tax dollars are paying for this stuff, next time they lose something, let's hope it's a bit more sophisticated.

PERSON: Sir Deryck C. Maughan 

HEADLINE: Private Sector; 
A Knight Moves Up at Citigroup

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS

 BODY:
WHEN Sanford I. Weill, the chief executive of Citigroup, broadened the list of his possible successors last week, his promotion of Sir Deryck C. Maughan was the biggest surprise.
 The elevation of Sir Deryck to chief executive of Citigroup's international division was portrayed by Mr. Weill and other Citigroup executives as a reward for his fine work. But for some time, Sir Deryck hardly appeared to be Mr. Weill's favorite son. 
 A British-born banker known for his reserve, political skill and well-cut suits, Sir Deryk had been marginalized by Mr. Weill. Four years ago, Salomon Smith Barney, the Citigroup investment banking division that Sir Deryck helped run, reported a $325 million net loss for the third quarter, largely because of turmoil in financial markets after Russia's financial meltdown. 
Mr. Weill quickly replaced Sir Deryck and his co-chief executive at Salomon, Jamie Dimon. Mr. Dimon was forced out, but Sir Deryck stayed, taking on a less visible role as a vice chairman advising on corporate strategy. At the time, his prospects at the firm were considered slim.
Mr. Weill, 69, has given no indication that he is about to retire, and there are several executives who could succeed him. In the field are Robert B. Willumstad, the president of Citigroup and head of its consumer bank; Michael A. Carpenter, the head of the investment bank and corporate loan group; and Thomas W. Jones, who runs asset management. But Sir Deryck, 54, is now also perceived to be a candidate.
"He has gradually gained influence with Sandy over the last few years," said one senior Wall Street executive who knows both men.
Both Mr. Weill and Sir Deryck declined to be interviewed. But in remarks after Sir Deryck's promotion last Tuesday, Mr. Weill praised him, showing no signs of whatever tensions might have existed before. "Deryck has done a terrific job for us," Mr. Weill said. "He is a terrific team player."
Sir Deryck, a native of Consett, a coal mining town in northern England, began his career as an adviser on economics and finance for the British Treasury; he ran Salomon's Tokyo office from 1986 to 1991.
Handsome and 6-foot-3, Sir Deryck, who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in January for his contributions to British business and commercial interests in the United States, joined Mr. Weill in March on a list of the best-dressed businessmen published by Avenue magazine, a New York publication about the city's wealthy.
Mr. Weill got to know Sir Deryck in the early 1990's. Soon after Sir Deryck was named as chief executive of Salomon Brothers, Mr. Weill called to introduce himself and asked Sir Deryck to join the board of Carnegie Hall, of which Mr. Weill is chairman.
Because Sir Deryck has had a low-profile role at the company for the last four years, his ascent within Citigroup has surprised many executives who know him. "Some people viewed him as a cigar-store Indian," said one Wall Street executive.
But Sir Deryck's success at a hodgepodge of responsibilities he has assumed over the last few years brought him back into Mr. Weill's favor. He has been running Citigroup's Internet strategies, overseeing a team that handles mergers for Citigroup and acting as chairman of the firm's fast-growing business in Japan.
Wall Street executives say Sir Deryck has proved a quiet ally to Mr. Weill, who built Citigroup into the nation's biggest financial services conglomerate.
"Deryck has done nothing but a good job," said Jeffrey B. Lane, the chief executive of Neuberger Berman, the money management firm, and a former vice chairman at the Travelers Group, a predecessor to Citigroup. "At some point, performance has its own rewards."
Sir Deryck first became a Wall Street personality because of backing from another powerful financier, Warren E. Buffett. In 1991, Mr. Buffett chose him, then little known outside the firm, to run Salomon after the firm's survival was threatened by an internal scheme to manipulate the market for United States Treasury securities. 
Mr. Buffett, whose company had a large investment in Salomon, had stepped in as interim chief executive after Salomon's chief executive, John H. Gutfreund, resigned. Mr. Buffett needed to hire someone quickly to run Salomon day to day. "It was the luckiest decision I ever made," Mr. Buffett said.
Sir Deryck was a good choice, said one former Salomon executive, because he had just returned to New York after five years in Japan and was untainted by the Treasury scandal. Sir Deryck's reserve and charm were also rare at Salomon, famous for unpolished, irreverent traders.
Mr. Buffett said Sir Deryck was good at soothing angry regulators, including the Federal Reserve, as well as nervous customers. "He went down into the foxhole with me and in the end he came through under the most extreme conditions," Mr. Buffett said, adding that Salomon's balance sheet was shrinking by $1 billion a day at that time.
Although Sir Deryck got Salomon past the crisis, he had mixed success taming the firm's volatile trading profits. In 1994, the firm lost $963 million, before taxes, and he changed Salomon's compensation plan, cutting some executives salaries with Mr. Buffett's blessing. The move alienated some of the firm's top bankers and traders. The next year, Sir Deryck was the subject of an unflattering cover article in New York magazine titled "The Crash of a Wall Street Superhero." 
In 1997, Sir Deryck sold Salomon to Mr. Weill, who coveted the cachet of Salomon's name. But after the losses the next year, Sir Deryck's prospects looked dim.
Even if he was unable to manage Salomon's unruly trading business, Sir Deryck has excelled at the behind-the-scenes assignments Mr. Weill has handed him. Two years ago, Mr. Weill asked him to manage Citigroup's Internet strategy, which had been consuming hundreds of millions in cash with little in tangible results. Sir Deryck reduced the division's costs to less than $100 million a year from $550 million and increased the number of consumers using Citigroup's services online to 18 million as of the end of May from 3 million, according to the company.
As manager of a team overseeing Citigroup's acquisitions, Sir Deryck's talents became increasingly useful as the company ventured overseas. These deals include an investment in Nikko Securities of Japan in 1998 that has proved highly successful, and two acquisitions: the investment banking division of Schroders, in 2000, and Mexico's second-largest bank, Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival, for $12.5 billion last year.
Mr. Weill's acquisition of Salomon also looks like a better deal. The investment bank has gained market share, particularly after the merger of Travelers and Citicorp allowed Salomon bankers to offer loans to corporate clients. The division's profits also became less volatile with the addition of Citicorp's consumer banking business, which typically does well when corporate banking is in a slump, as it has been the last two years. 
Some executives who know Sir Deryck say that avoiding the limelight is probably the right strategy at Citigroup. "You can't stay that long working for Sandy unless you are a member of the team," Mr. Lane said. "Sandy is a big believer in the team concept."
Sir Deryck is no novice, said Michael F. Holland, the president of Holland & Company, a money management firm, and a former Salomon executive. "He keeps a profile appropriate to his next success."

A Senate subcommitteehearing amplifies the Internet domain name debate.

BYLINE:  By Susan Stellin 

 BODY:
WITH Congress busy investigating failures within United States intelligence agencies that have national and global consequences, the shortcomings of the organization charged with managing the Internet's address system may seem trivial by comparison.
 Nevertheless, a Senate subcommittee held a hearing last week to examine whether that organization was adequately carrying out its mission. The questions echoed those heard in other investigations in Congressional halls: namely, how to deal with an entity operating largely in obscurity, mired in bureaucracy and in desperate need of more effective oversight. 
 The impetus for the hearing was widespread dissatisfaction with the organization, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, known as Icann. It was established in 1998 as a nonprofit entity to take over responsibility for the system that translates domain names like yahoo .com into numbers recognized by the network. 
Though no one disputes that the address system is functioning, Icann has proved poorly equipped to handle numerous related policy matters. The organization itself has acknowledged as much, embarking on its own reform process several months ago. So far, though, the debate over the reform plan, like much of the two-hour hearing last Wednesday, has failed to resolve a critical question: Who exactly are Icann's constituents?
Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who is chairman of the subcommittee, the Senate Commerce Committee's panel on science, technology and space, opened the hearing with a comment that highlighted the group's murky role. "Suffice it to say Icann is not exactly a household word in this country," Mr. Wyden said. "Americans know little about what it is or what it does."
In fact, in four years of operation, Icann has largely occupied itself with overseeing the businesses that sell domain names, a legacy of its original mandate to introduce competition to a monopoly previously operated by Network Solutions (now VeriSign Inc.) under a contract with the Commerce Department.
A primary role has been enabling about 100 companies, known as registrars, to sell Internet addresses to the public, as well as selecting and contracting with companies to manage new domain extensions like .biz, .pro and .info.
Together, these businesses contribute about 90 percent of Icann's revenue, said M. Stuart Lynn, the president and chief executive of Icann. Mr. Lynn added in an interview last week that this financial arrangement had not been a driving force in policy decisions. Still, it has undoubtedly affected Icann's focus.
Although Icann has primarily focused on setting the ground rules for the domain-name market, the business of buying and selling domain names remains a mysterious, insular world.
The frenzy for acquiring Internet addresses has generally died down, but anecdotal evidence suggests that a large proportion of Internet addresses are still bought by speculators who hope to resell these names at a profit, or by individuals and companies that have registered names solely to prevent others from using them. (Indeed, several operators of new domain extensions actively market these so-called defensive registrations to trademark owners.)
Mr. Lynn acknowledged that Icann needed a better sense of who is registering domain names and whether they are being used; he said that is one recommendation of a report that is expected to be released this week by an Icann committee formed to suggest criteria for evaluating the new domain extensions. 
Illustrating the widespread complaint that Icann operates at a sluggish pace, these criteria are being recommended nearly two years after the domain extensions were chosen. Icann's board still needs to approve the criteria, and the actual evaluation will not occur for months.
As Mr. Lynn pointed out, it may be too soon to evaluate the success of the domain extensions, some of which have only recently become available. But the early indicators are not particularly encouraging, even though supporters say the introduction of new domain names has been one of Icann's primary accomplishments.
So far, 700,000 .biz addresses have been registered, according to NeuLevel, the domain's operator, while .info's operator, Afilias, says 850,000 addresses have been registered. Both companies began accepting registrations last summer, and both have been hindered by problems in their processes for distributing addresses. For example, some speculators were able to register addresses with fake data during advance registration periods meant for trademark holders.
Global Name Registry, operator of the .name extension, which is intended for individuals, said it sold 75,000 Web addresses and 57,000 e-mail addresses from Jan. 15 to May 15. The operator of the .coop extension said it had registered just under 6,000 addresses, and .museum has registered about 2,000. By comparison, as of the end of March, VeriSign reported current registrations of 21.3 million address for .com, 3.5 million for .net and 2.4 million for .org.
Beyond the number of addresses registered is the much more intriguing question of how many of these domain names are actually being used. There is little data on that topic, which would seem to be an important area to investigate in determining where Icann should now focus its efforts.
On that note, Mr. Wyden promised that Congress would stay involved as the reform process continued. He also encouraged the Commerce Department to exercise its oversight role more actively before deciding whether to renew Icann's contract next fall.
But if Congress and the Commerce Department are going to play constructive roles, they need to look beyond theoretical discussions about Icann's structure and processes and become more familiar with the quotidian frustrations those who use the address system encounter.
Among those frustrations are many of the so-called policy questions widely considered beyond Icann's charter: how to handle complaints that registrars have placed hurdles in the way of customers who want to transfer their domain names to another registrar; how to deal with systems that allow certain domain buyers priority access to names when they expire; how to determine the circumstances under which trademark owners are given preferential treatment in allocating Internet addresses; and how to decide what data should be made publicly available about domain registrants (and whether registrars should be responsible for verifying that data).
The only consensus that emerged last week was that Icann ought to narrow its focus to the technical management of the address system. Just who should then handle all the related policy matters that Icann, by default or design, has taken on (though not necessarily resolved), remains unanswered.
As Mr. Lynn noted, "If not Icann, where else do the policy decisions get made? I haven't seen one real suggestion that has substance."

After a Gloomy Prognosis, a Loss at Random House

BYLINE:  By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK 

 BODY:
Peter Olson, the chairman of Random House, played the Cassandra of the book business last fall, warning at every opportunity that a prolonged downturn was gripping the industry. To adjust to it, Mr. Olson instituted cost cuts and layoffs at Random House, the largest trade book publisher, that sent ripples of anxiety through authors and agents but left some rivals scratching their heads. 
 Now it turns out that Mr. Olson may have been projecting. The biggest downturn last fall appears to have been at Random House. This month, Random House's parent company, Bertelsmann of Germany, disclosed that Random House recorded an operating loss of 15 million euros ($14.2 million) in the second half of 2001, the first loss in at least four years at Bertelsmann's book division. Bertelsmann is privately owned and made the disclosure as part of its preparations for a planned public offering. 
 All major publishers felt a decline in demand for books because of the recession and the terrorist attacks, but none of the other major publishers that publicly report results suffered as much. Revenue for the last six months of the year fell slightly at Penguin Putnam, held steady at HarperCollins and rose to $377 million from $350 million at Simon & Schuster. None reported losses. 
A spokesman for Random House, Stuart Applebaum, said that one-time factors contributed to the poor results. Its Argentine publishing subsidiary, Sudamericana, incurred a big accounting charge and steep losses because of that country's economic troubles, and a German reference publishing division was closed. In the United States, Random House recorded one-time expenses associated with its cost cuts, Mr. Applebaum said. 
Still, those costs were relatively minor compared with Random House's total revenue of 1.09 billion euros for the second half, mostly from the United States and Europe. Mr. Applebaum defended Mr. Olson's gloomy prognosis for the United States market and the necessity of the layoffs. The difference in Random House's reported results and the results of its rivals, Mr. Applebaum said, "has to do with what each of us reports in our results as much as it does with the actual over-the-counter marketplace" for books. 
"We stand by our suggestion that the fall of '01 was a very difficult time certainly for Random House but also for the booksellers and the industry over all," he said. He acknowledged, however, that although sales have not returned to their peak, the downturn has been shorter than some had feared. "The happy news," he said, "is that it appears that our retailers and our publishers are beyond that, and it is behind us."

Nasdaq's first annual report is short on information, and in some respects misleading.

BYLINE:  By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
MANY companies this year have proclaimed that their annual reports disclose more financial information than ever before. But that is not a trend being followed by a company that wants to go public, the Nasdaq stock market.
 Nasdaq's first annual report, released last week, has almost no financial information printed in it, and what information it does contain is misleading. 
 The report does have page after page of photographs, including four of Hardwick Simmons, who became Nasdaq's chief executive last year after he stepped down as chief executive of Prudential Securities. One photo showed him with Michael Jackson, another with Martina Navratilova. 
There is also no shortage of slogans. "The Power of an Idea" is the phrase on the cover. Inside, across other photos, Nasdaq proclaimed itself to be "the democratization of capitalism and the desire to move mankind forward" and "an energizing force at the center of the global economy."
But the pages include no balance sheet, no earnings statement, no cash flow statement. In his letter to shareholders, which follows 11 pages of photos, Mr. Simmons did briefly mention profits but offered few details beyond saying that net income rose to $40.5 million in 2001 from $23.2 million in 2000.
Asked about Nasdaq's decision not to print its financial statements in its annual report, Bethany Sherman, Nasdaq's senior vice president for corporate communications, stated: "We are not yet a public company. This is the way our shareholders wanted us to communicate with them." Ms. Sherman added that Nasdaq's 2,700 shareholders did have financial statements mailed to them with the annual report.
Those shareholders include brokerage firms and Nasdaq-listed companies, which bought stock in 2000 and 2001 at the beginning of a process that Nasdaq hopes will conclude with a public offering. When the process is finished, its former parent, the National Association of Securities Dealers, will no longer own a stake in Nasdaq but will continue to regulate it.
It is traditional for a new chief executive, in his first letter to shareholders, to note when his tenure began and to say something nice about his predecessor. But Mr. Simmons made no mention of Frank G. Zarb, who chose Mr. Simmons to succeed him as chief executive in February 2001 and as chairman in September. A photo of Mr. Zarb is included in the annual report, but the caption did not mention him, instead noting that the former New York Mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, appeared with New York paramedics. By contrast, the captions of all four photos that included Mr. Simmons did identify the new chief.
The annual report may not have made room for conventional financial statements, but it did devote the better part of a page to its "QQQ" product, tracking shares on the Nasdaq 100 index. It reported how successful the product has been in attracting trading volume but did not mention that the price of those shares fell 36 percent in 2000 and another 33 percent in 2001.
One problem for Nasdaq these days is that many companies it used to promote have become disasters for investors. Most of the companies go unmentioned. The company that received the best play in the report is not what one might expect from one of Nasdaq's slogans, which proclaims it to be "the new establishment, the better idea, the new economic landscape."
The company, Silgan Holdings, whose stock rose 191 percent last year while the Nasdaq composite index fell 21 percent, had a two-page photo of its workers on a factory floor in Langhorne, Pa., where plastic food containers are made.
Although no financial statements are printed, any worker at Silgan Holdings -- or anyone else -- who gets the annual report can learn Nasdaq's financial details by using the right kind of computer. Attached to the last page of the report is a small CD that has Nasdaq's 10-K report, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That CD warns, "Do not play in slot-loading-type CD player," a message that does not encourage an effort to get the information. Ms. Sherman said that CD had also been provided to all Nasdaq shareholders.
And there are a few interesting things in the 10-K. It turns out that the increase in net income mentioned by Mr. Simmons in his letter to shareholders is more than a bit misleading. A new accounting rule in 2000 led to a large write-off and made 2000 seem much worse than it was -- and the comparison, therefore, much better.
Mr. Simmons' letter in the annual report did mention there was a change in accounting rules but was silent on its effect. The 10-K disclosed that without the change, net income in 2001 would have been $30 million, down 79 percent from $145.2 million in 2000. That is very different from the 75 percent increase in the net income figures cited by Mr. Simmons.
Near the end of the annual report are the "Guiding Principles of the Nasdaq Stock Market," which appear next to a photo of Mr. Simmons. "We believe that complete and accurate information is required for the capital markets to efficiently allocate capital," states the first principle.
Asked if the annual report lives up to those principles, Ms. Sherman replied, "All of our communications are in keeping with our guiding principles."

HEADLINE: Marion Levy Jr., 83, Authority On the Modernization of Societies 

BYLINE:  By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Marion J. Levy Jr., a scholar of sociology and international affairs who wrote about modernization theory, which seeks to explain why some societies undergo rapid economic development and corresponding social change, died on May 26 in Princeton, N.J., where he lived. He was 83. 
 The cause was complications from Parkinson's disease, according to Princeton University. 
 Dr. Levy retired in 1989 as Musgrave Professor of Sociology and International Affairs at Princeton. He had taught there since 1947 and was chairman of its department of East Asian studies for a time. 
He once said that "the fundamental problem posed by modernization is whether human animals can adjust as readily to longevity, affluence, and peace as they have in the past to shortgevity, poverty, and war." He predicted that life in a modernized world "is likely to become crowded, affluent, nasty, brutish and long." 
His writings include the book "Modernization: Latecomers and Survivors" (1972), and the two-volume work "Modernization and the Structure of Societies" (1966), which examined the differences between societies that were relatively nonmodernized and those that were relatively modernized. He carried out innovative scholarship about why Japan, not China, was in the vanguard of modernization in Asia, concluding that while many assumed the two countries were similar when they were first opened to Western influence, in reality the similarities were only superficial.
Marion Joseph Levy was born and raised in Galveston, Tex., was a Navy lieutenant in Asia in World War II and received a doctorate in sociology from Harvard.
He is survived by his wife, Joy; a daughter, Dore J. Levy of Providence, R.I., who is a professor of comparative literature and East Asian studies at Brown; two sons, Noah, of Atlanta, and Amos, of Manhattan; five grandchildren; and a sister, Ruth Levy Kempner of Galveston.

HEADLINE: Advancing Glacier Threatens an Alaskan Fishing Village 

BYLINE:  By The New York Times 

DATELINE: YAKUTAT, Alaska, June 16 

 BODY:
Hubbard Glacier, one of the world's largest, is threatening the economic life of this tiny, predominantly Tlingit fishing village on the southeast Alaskan coast.
 Within days, the advancing glacier could block the outlet of Russell Fjord, a 30-mile-long habitat of porpoises, seals and salmon at the end of the Situk River. 
 The glacier has done this before, most recently in 1986, with an ice dam that turned the fjord into a new lake, Russell Lake, swollen with freshwater runoff. It endangered trapped wildlife for months as the level of salt in the water fell, but after several months the ice dam gave way and the glacier retreated. 
The fear being voiced now was also voiced then: that if the ice blockage is severe and protracted, the lake may swell and spill its banks, flooding the Situk River and smaller streams east of Yakutat that are vital to the area's commercial and sport fishing industries.
"That would devastate the town," said Mayor Thomas Maloney, a former commercial fisherman.
Yakutat's lodges and bed-and-breakfasts cater to fishermen from around the world, and to tourists who hire local pilots to fly over the area's spectacular glaciers. But Mr. Maloney says he is more concerned about the already financially hard-hit commercial fishing boats that catch salmon in the milewide estuary at the end of the river. "If we lose the commercial fishermen," he said, "we lose the town."
Despite occasional retreats, the Hubbard Glacier has been advancing since the 1890's. Its most recent ice dam across the fjord was formed in May 1986, when the water rose a foot a day and in a matter of months produced a 100-square-mile lake. 
An effort was undertaken to save the stranded animals, and various plans were proposed to blow open the passage. While volunteers tried to catch seals to carry them to safety, many skittered across the ice dam on their own. But the ice dam was structurally weak. By October, that corner of the glacier had been breached by the rising waters of the fjord, and the remaining seals and porpoises returned to the open waters of Yakutat Bay.
"This is the closest it's come since the 1986 damming," said Dennis Trabant, a glaciologist with the United States Geological Survey, who has studied the Hubbard Glacier since its previous closing. Glaciologists who flew over the site late Thursday estimated the gap at 100 feet.
In addition, this time the wall of ice poised to crunch into the far side of the fjord is wider and more likely to last. That has people worried.
"We've suffered over 9/11 like everyone else, with visitor cancellations," said Loretta Eades, the general manager of Leonard's Landing Lodge. "I just hope that this doesn't add to it."
As it happens, Yakutat is able to receive first-rate advice, and some consolation, from the world's leading experts on glaciers. The International Glaciological Society met here last week, and its scientists are of two minds about the Hubbard's assault. Though they did not wish their hosts ill, they were energized by this example of the forces they study. 
"What's truly amazing is that it is happening now, while we're all here," said Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo. "It's like Disney World for glaciologists."
The scientists may also have good long-term news. "Initially, the fisheries in the rivers that are going to be flooded will be damaged severely," Mr. Scambos said. "But as the years go by, they'll probably come back better than ever, because Russell Lake will be a huge potential spawning area for the salmon."
It is even possible that the glacier will retreat at the last moment.
The advance of Hubbard Glacier seems to run counter to what many glaciologists see as one likely effect of global climate change: a great loss of ice by most of Alaska's glaciers. But the Hubbard, being a tidewater glacier, operates differently than valley glaciers, which do not empty into bodies of water. 
At the glaciology symposium, research was presented by the Geophysical Institute at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, showing that over the last five years, Alaskan glaciers -- even factoring in those like Hubbard that are growing -- have been melting and adding almost twice as much water to the world's oceans as the entire Greenland ice cap. 
The melting is most pronounced in the region that includes Yakutat.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 24, 2002

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article last Monday about the advance of Hubbard Glacier, which is threatening the economic life of a fishing village by advancing toward Russell Fjord in southeastern Alaska, misstated the fjord's geographic relationship to the Situk River, which could flood if glacier dammed the fjord. It is northeast of the river, not at the end of it.

HEADLINE: Falling Wages and Troubled Lives: Town Stumbles as Economy Shifts 

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: SULLIVAN, Ind. 

 BODY:
"Take time to care," says the sign on the road into this small town in southeastern Indiana. But time and care seem to be things that people here and in surrounding Sullivan County have little left to spare.
 "People are so worn out these days, they don't want to run anything," said Paula Followell, 41, a legal secretary for her husband, Douglas. "They are busy scraping together multiple paychecks and commuting to work." 
 Mr. Followell, 56, complained that few people had time to get involved in the community anymore. "We don't have any interest from anyone young," he said of the town, which is 100 miles southwest of Indianapolis and the seat of Sullivan County. 
The drop in civic engagement follows an upheaval in work and wages that has left the town, in the words of a Sullivan banker, Bruce Walkup, "flat in the Dumpster."
In Sullivan County, population 21,751, men's incomes dropped 11 percent in the 1990's, according to the 2000 census. The jobs in strip mining coal, which paid about $50,000 a year, all but disappeared, and by the end of the decade, the median men's income here had fallen to $30,207.
As men's wages have declined, more women have taken jobs to make ends meet. Fifty-four percent of adult women now have full-time jobs, up from 46 percent 10 years ago. Their earnings rose correspondingly in the decade, by nearly 16 percent, to $20,790, though that still left them making far less than men.
The figures are similar around the country: men's median earnings nationwide fell over the last decade by $889, or 2 percent, to an inflation-adjusted $37,057. At the same time, women's earnings rose by 7 percent, to $27,194.
The stark result of this shift, people here say, is a condition in which everyone is a breadwinner and the whole town loses.
The old town square here, once a center of activity, is a much quieter place.
"There's no interaction," said Bill Tennis, 61, a retired funeral director whose two grown children have left Sullivan for Indianapolis. On Friday nights not so long ago, Mr. Tennis said, "the stores on the square would stay open to 8 or 9 o'clock. You'd come to town, pass the news around."
Jeff Canfield, 37, pastor of the Word of Life Church on Court Street, said: "We had a National Day of Prayer at the beginning of May at a church on the square. It was interfaith. We had five clergy. Four people showed up. We have a difficult time getting people for children's classes. It's not that people are bad. It's just priorities."
Because Chamber of Commerce board members can no longer make time for evening meetings, they settled on a May meeting at noon. "We had 4 of 15 of them there," said Joan Smith, the chamber's volunteer secretary. As for the Jaycees, the younger men and women who run the town's September festival, she said, "I would say they do not have enough members now to keep their charter."
The Optimists and the Women's Club have gone. The Rotary Club, the Lions Club and the Elks remain, but they are having trouble attracting new members. "We are almost nonexistent in volunteer groups," said Jean McMahan, owner of the News Stand, a lunch counter and magazine store on the square, and a former city councilwoman.
"The few people who do it can't do it all," Mrs. McMahan said. "The mothers are so busy, working, trying to keep clothes clean and meals on the table. They get home and it's, 'Get out of my hair and let me get this washing done.' "
Bruce Ayers, 49, has an old-fashioned, well-paid, blue-collar job as a laborer for the gas company. His wife, Debra, 47, is a legal secretary. They have a son, Justin, 14, and live close to the square in a neatly kept 1920's house with a big red front porch.
Together they make a little more than $50,000 a year, Mrs. Ayers said. While she says that she likes her work and that she is pleased that she can buy her son everything he needs at J. C. Penney, she has little spare time for anything more than teaching Sunday school. 
For many people, life has gotten worse. "More kids are out running the streets because they cannot pay a sitter and pay the bills, too," said Tina Gourley, 38, a bartender at Runt's Lounge, a dim and cavernous bar on a corner of the town square. Ms. Gourley, who is divorced, is raising two daughters, 15 and 10, lately with some support from her ex-husband.
Last year, when she worked the bar's night shift, from 5:30 p.m. to 3:30 a.m., she relied on a woman in a neighboring trailer to keep an eye on her children.
It didn't work. "My older daughter couldn't handle the responsibility of taking care of her sister, plus taking care of herself," said Ms. Gourley, who now works days. "So she went wild. She was getting suspended from school for fighting. She stole a car. They put her in a juvenile home for a weekend."
According to the county's circuit court judge, P. J. Pierson, rising rates of juvenile delinquency and drug abuse are the result of people working more and spending less time with their children. "You have a responsibility of a parent to teach values," he said. "These must be taught at home, around the kitchen table." 
Families are breaking up because parents are working too hard, he said. In 1990, about 7 percent of the adults in Sullivan County were divorced, according to the census. By 2000, the number had risen to 12 percent.
To address these problems, Judge Pierson runs a school in his courtroom every other Saturday morning for about 20 youths who have been getting in trouble. He requires them to bring forms from their teachers noting how they have been doing in school. "They remain in the school until all their grades are up to at least C's or they reach 18," Judge Pierson said.
Of course, men whose wages have declined have felt particular pressure. Though blue-collar, heavy industry jobs that enabled many men to support a family have been evaporating for three decades, the decline from 1989 to 1999 spread beyond jobs in factories, mills and mines to those in offices, stores, warehouses and trucking.
Some have turned to the drug business. In the county jail, half of the 64 inmates in May had been arrested on charges of making or selling methamphetamine. "It's an epidemic," Sheriff Ed Martindale said. "A lot of them are trying to make a living."
"One was doing $150,000 or $160,000 a year," Mr. Martindale said. "A lot of them are illiterate. They can't get a decent job." When they raid a family's methamphetamine lab, his deputies seize the children. Placement of children in foster care, often with grandparents, has surged with the rise in drug abuse, he said.
Others, though, are trying education. "I made $52,000 a year mining coal," said Walter Burns, 46, who was nursing a Budweiser in Runt's Lounge. "I've been going to college for two years. I'm going to become different, educated. It's like a two-class system in this country. You're educated or not."

HEADLINE: Census Finds Rising Tide, And Many Who Missed Boat 

BYLINE:  By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
If the lingering question about the economic boom of the late 1990's remains how widely or narrowly were the winnings shared, the answer has long been expected to lie in the 2000 census data on income and poverty.
 But as the numbers began rolling out in recent weeks, they struck some people as counterintuitive: Amid the longest peacetime expansion ever, median income actually dropped and poverty rose in a handful of surprising places. 
 Now demographers and economists are using those data and others to piece together a picture of who made a killing, who merely got ahead and who fell behind, and to figure out why a few places widely assumed to have flourished now look as though they did not.
These things are certain. Nationwide, prosperity increased during the decade; incomes rose and poverty in most places declined. And, economists and sociologists say, the gains landed disproportionately in the laps of a small fraction of Americans already exceptionally well off. 
Inequality increased, as it has since the late 1970's, but at a slower rate nationally than in the 1980's, some experts said. Other data suggest, according to one economist, that the percentage of families earning less than $25,000 dropped significantly in the second half of the 1990's.
The fate of people in the middle seems less clear-cut. While the median household income rose in the Northwest, South, Midwest and Southwest, it dropped in parts of the New York metropolitan area, in some other Northeastern cities and in swaths of Southern California.
Many experts suspect immigration helps explain those patterns. As low-wage workers poured in from places like Central America in pursuit of a better life, the midpoint on the income spectrum in some places with large foreign-born populations may have, paradoxically, inched down. At the same time, native-born people moved out -- from the New York region to the Southeast, from Los Angeles to places like Nevada, some demographers say. Though those people may have moved up economically by moving away, their departures may have helped lower the median in the places they left behind.
"You see how the arithmetic works?" asked Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. "When you have a lot of people entering from the rest of the world, and many of them enter at the lower rungs of the wage distribution, then you can have a situation where everyone is prospering and the median income is declining."
But immigration is not the only possible explanation. Americans may tend to forget that the decade began with a recession; incomes for many people declined in the early 1990's and poverty increased. In some places, like the New York region, the recovery did not begin until the second half of the decade. Only late in the 1990's did median income catch up and exceed the 1989 levels.
"Between 1989 and 1993, there's a big drop in median income," said Edward N. Wolff, a professor of economics at New York University who specializes in income and wealth inequality. "It wasn't until 1998 that things got back to where they were in 1989. So by 2000, median income was a bit ahead of where it was 10 years ago, but not much."
At the same time, the job base shifted in some places; lower-wage jobs replaced higher-wage ones. When defense spending shrank and aerospace-industry jobs in Southern California dwindled, what took root were jobs in the garment industry and service sector, said Bruce Katz, director of the Center on Urban and Metropolitan Policy at Brookings.
"All of us here have been trying to figure out what do these regional variations mean," Mr. Katz said. "How much of it is attributable to the demographic shifts that are happening in these metropolitan areas and how much is attributable to the underlying economy?"
Then there are those who have doubts about the data itself. 
Eric Kober, director of housing, economic and infrastructure planning for the New York City Department of Planning, described as "extremely counterintuitive" the census's finding that the percentage of people in the civilian labor force and the percentage of people employed actually declined nationally and especially in New York City.
Mr. Kober said that the census data for the 25 biggest cities showed that the percentage of people employed tended to drop most in cities with large numbers of foreign-born residents while the rate increased in affluent cities with lower percentages of foreign-born people, like Denver and Columbus, Ohio. 
Mr. Kober suggests that the numbers are wrong. He traces the problem to what he says is a growing unwillingness by people in certain groups to answer the detailed income questions on the census long form. He contends that the data underestimate employment and income in places like Los Angeles and New York City, where median income dropped in four boroughs.
"They may be skewing the national data and accounting for this situation we're seeing, where there is a 50 percent decline in welfare nationally and yet a decline in the percentage of adults working," he said. "It can't be."
On average, median household income rose by nearly $3,000 nationally between the 1990 and 2000 censuses. The states with the biggest increases ranged from Colorado and Oregon to Mississippi. Those with the smallest increases included California, New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island and the District of Columbia. In Connecticut, on average, median household income dropped.
William H. Frey, a demographer at the University of Michigan, sorts the states roughly into three types: "Mature melting-pot states" with large number of foreign-born who make relatively low wages, like New York and California; "emerging growth states" in the South and West, growing through domestic migration; and "heartland states" attracting few immigrants and losing domestic migrants. 
In the melting-pot states like California, Professor Frey sees a "barbell economy" with growth at the bottom and the top and a thinning out for the group in the middle. In the emerging growth states, like Colorado, incomes were strongly up. In the heartland states, incomes rose moderately as the aging baby boomers who dominate those places moved into their high-earning years.
Even within some states and metropolitan areas, there is considerable variation. In California, median income declines were heavily concentrated in the Los Angeles region, in counties including Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino. In sharp contrast, there were big increases in median income in counties in the San Francisco Bay area and around Silicon Valley.
In many places with big increases, the gains went disproportionately to people in the top fifth of the income spectrum, according to Andrew A. Beveridge, a sociologist at Queens College who analyzed the census data for The New York Times. People at the top gained the most and people at the middle and bottom gained considerably less.
In San Francisco County, for example, where the median household income rose by $11,854, to $55,221, the income of people in the top fifth of the income spectrum rose by $33,584, to $117,730, Professor Beveridge found. The income of the people in the bottom fifth rose by $3,374, to $21,153. The income of people in the middle rose by $16,961, to $70,470.
"Most of the prosperity has gone into the hands of the rich," said Professor Wolff of N.Y.U., citing his own findings from other data. "The top 20 percent did well in the 90's. And even among that group, it's the top 1 percent that made out like bandits."
He said the pattern was especially pronounced in New York state. Citing city and state statistics, he ascribes the pattern to two things: the high concentration of New Yorkers working in industries like finance that did especially well in the 1990's, and the abundance of others working in low-wage service-sector jobs catering to the first group's needs.
"For every investment banker, you have one or two delivery men to feed them during their long working hours," Professor Wolff said. "So, in a sense, the high-income group in the city also creates this low-income group. It's a sort of symbiotic relationship."
Though it is not possible to draw conclusions about economic and social mobility based on the census data released so far, Jared Bernstein, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research organization in Washington, said other data he had studied suggested that the rate of movement out of the lowest income categories picked up in the late 1990's.
Comparing the 1980's with the 1990's, he said, "These were both eras wherein economic growth was not shared equally. But in the 1990's, the latter half especially, families were more prosperous throughout the income scale. It didn't reverse the tide of inequality. It just slowed it down, to some degree."

PERSON: Robert Whitehead 

HEADLINE: Robert Whitehead, Who Brought Top Playwrights to Broadway, Dies at 86 

BYLINE:  By MEL GUSSOW 

 BODY:
Robert Whitehead, the debonair and distinguished theatrical producer, who refused to let questions of economics take precedence over his artistic standards yet still managed to be a successful businessman, died Saturday at his home in Pound Ridge, N.Y. He was 86 and also had a home in Manhattan.
 When Broadway celebrated Mr. Whitehead's 80th birthday in 1996, the evening was titled "Mister Class," a reference to "Master Class," the Terrence McNally play that he produced (starring his wife, Zoe Caldwell, as Maria Callas). In Broadway terminology, Mr. Whitehead was considered a class act, the opposite of razzle-dazzle. During his nearly 60 years in show business, he presented some of the 20th century's most important playwrights on Broadway and was a quiet, assertive force, often a mediator and a man with impeccable taste. 
 As Arthur Miller said in his autobiography, "Timebends," Mr. Whitehead was one of "a handful of producers . . . who longed for artistically ambitious and socially interesting plays and could put their money where their mouth was." 
During the last half of the 20th century, Mr. Whitehead's name on a play (often with Roger L. Stevens as his partner) was an assurance of quality, and, unlike so many other producers, Mr. Whitehead dared to take chances. He presented plays by Mr. Miller, Tennessee Williams, Eugene O'Neill, Thornton Wilder, Carson McCullers, Friedrich Durrenmatt, Jean Anouilh and Robert Bolt, and in most cases he was an integral part of the creative process, involved in everything from the script to the casting to the promotion of the play once it had opened.
With his mustache and carefully combed hair, Mr. Whitehead had the suave look of a 1940's matinee idol (like Douglas Fairbanks Jr. or Errol Flynn), although Williams told him he thought he looked like a riverboat gambler. As he aged, he began to look more like a diplomat, which, of course, was the role that he habitually played offstage in the theater world. 
Mr. Whitehead was born in Montreal on March 3, 1916. His father, William Thomas Whitehead, owned textile mills. His mother, Lena Mary LaBatt Whitehead, an opera singer, came from the family that owned the LaBatt brewery. Mr. Whitehead's cousin, on the LaBatt side, was Hume Cronyn, who was older by five years. The cousins spent summers together and played theater games when they were children. 
"I always had the heroic role," Mr. Cronyn once said, "and he always ended up in the cellar, which was the jail or dungeon." In his 1991 memoir, "A Terrible Liar," Mr. Cronyn praised Mr. Whitehead as "one of the most distinguished and respected theatrical producers in the English-speaking world." He had employed numerous actors, Mr. Cronyn wrote, "but with a gross lack of familial feeling and a marvelous evasiveness, he has always managed to avoid employing me." Tongue in cheek, he said the fruit cellar experience was being held against him. Actually in 1986 Mr. Whitehead was a producer of "The Petition" starring Mr. Cronyn and Jessica Tandy.

Tentatively Choosing a Career
 After attending Trinity College School in Montreal, Mr. Whitehead came to New York to work in the theater without a clear idea about which path to choose. His good looks landed him roles as an actor. Briefly he went to acting school, and in 1938 he began his career at the Barter Theater in Abingdon, Va. He acted, worked as a stage manager and built scenery. As he recalled, "I was haunted by the question of whether I had any talent for any aspect of the theater -- or was this a vagabond escape from responsible activities?" 
With World War II on the horizon, he said, "The hope and excitement of a life in the theater began to seem unproductive, unimportant and selfish." Then he read an essay by Harold Clurman, the director and critic, and it enlarged his respect for the theater as a collaborative, even noble profession. Clurman's words suggesting that theater "must be a vital conversation with society" lifted Mr. Whitehead's spirit and gave him "an understanding and an impetus that have informed my commitment ever since." Ten years later, the two met and eventually worked together on 14 productions, a partnership that helped sustain Broadway as a place for serious drama.
In 1942 Mr. Whitehead enlisted in the American Field Service and became an ambulance driver in North Africa and, later, Italy. Returning to New York after the war, he decided to become a producer, at first in collaboration with Oliver Rea, whom he had met in the United States Army.
During the summer of 1947, while acting with Bert Lahr in "Burlesque" in Marblehead, Mass., he read the Robinson Jeffers version of "Medea" and decided to produce it. That year, when Mr. Whitehead was 31, he took the play to Broadway in a production starring Judith Anderson and John Gielgud. At first, Gielgud had agreed only to direct, but Mr. Whitehead quickly persuaded him also to undertake the role of Jason.
Then, again with Mr. Gielgud (as Raskolnikov, playing opposite Lillian Gish and Dolly Haas), Mr. Whitehead produced a dramatization of Dostoyevsky's "Crime and Punishment." Because both plays were successes, he became known as a man who could make art work in the marketplace. In 1950 he said: "Broadway has the idea that things are either commercial or art. Actually all real art is commercial. I have never seen a really artistic play that failed, unless it was badly done."
In contrast with larger-than-life competitors like David Merrick, Mr. Whitehead did not naturally lend himself to anecdotes, or to controversy. The stories that surrounded him were usually ones of gentle persuasion. For example, there is the case of Carson McCullers's "Member of the Wedding," a modest and wistful play about the awakening of youth. This was the first collaboration between Mr. Whitehead and Clurman as producer and director.
Daringly, he cast Julie Harris, who was 24 and at the beginning of her career, in the central role of the 12-year-old Frankie Addams. One very important role remained open: Berenice, the black cook who was the pillar of this Southern family. Mr. Whitehead decided he wanted Ethel Waters, the blues singer and musical actress.
As the story goes, he tracked her down in a second-rate nightclub in Detroit and returned with her to her room in a boarding house. She said, "Every night I get on my knees by that bed and pray that God will send me a good booking." "Miss Waters," Mr. Whitehead said, "I have a good booking." She hesitated about playing the role because "there is no God in this play." 
Before she accepted the part, she said that instead of singing the Russian lullaby mentioned in the script, she wanted to sing something of her own choice. To an audience of Mr. Whitehead and Ms. Harris, she sang "His Eye Is on the Sparrow." When it was over, Ms. Harris cried, as theatergoers were to do at that moment when the play was on Broadway. That song later became the title of Miss Waters's autobiography. 
The third major role was that of 7-year-old John Henry West. Unable to find a suitable child actor, Mr. Whitehead and Clurman remembered that Fritz de Wilde, an actor in the company (later the stage manager), had a son the correct age. Without previous training, Brandon de Wilde read for the role and was hired.
Although Clurman was the director, he had the audacity to write about the production in "The New Republic," while disclaiming that it was actually a review. In it he credited Mr. Whitehead with believing that it was possible for the play to be a box office success: "Fortunately, there are producers like Robert Whitehead and his associates who are eager to face real theatrical problems because they think of them not primarily in the light of 'investments' but as objects of their love . . . it is only through such love that good theater, and ultimately good business, can be made."
Mr. Whitehead returned the compliment. He said that the director had "set a blazing fire" and that "the actors feel they are embarking on a voyage of danger and magnificence that will bring them into a realm of acting they have never achieved before."

A Five-Star Year
Mr. Whitehead and Clurman worked together on "The Waltz of the Toreadors" (with Ralph Richardson), "Bus Stop" (with Kim Stanley) and "A Touch of the Poet" (with Helen Hayes and Ms. Stanley), among other plays. In 1957, Mr. Whitehead was represented by five plays on Broadway: "Separate Tables," "Orpheus Descending," "The Waltz of the Toreadors," "A Hole in the Head" and "Major Barbara," and only one of them, "A Hole in the Head," could be considered a standard commercial offering.
At other times, he presented Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne in "The Visit" by Friedrich Durrenmatt, Katharine Hepburn in "A Matter of Gravity" and "The West Side Waltz" and Paul Scofield in Robert Bolt's "Man for All Seasons" (which won a Tony Award as best play).
After Mr. Whitehead's wife, Virginia, died (in 1965), Mr. Cronyn introduced him to Zoe Caldwell, the Australian actress who was appearing with Mr. Cronyn at the Tyrone Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis. They were married in 1968. Studiously Mr. Whitehead tried to keep their careers separate, but when he was producing "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie," a friend suggested that Ms. Caldwell should play the title role. Ms. Caldwell went on to win a Tony Award as best actress. Years later, he directed her in a revival of "Medea" and in "Lillian," a one-woman play about Lillian Hellman.

Lincoln Center Disappointment
In 1960 Mr. Whitehead and Elia Kazan were named to head the first Lincoln Center theater company. They seemed to be natural choices, Mr. Whitehead as a producer with an instinct for art, Mr. Kazan as a director with a long string of successes. With Clurman as literary adviser, the Lincoln Center Repertory Theater opened in 1964 with "After the Fall," a new play by Arthur Miller, directed by Mr. Kazan and starring Jason Robards. Since construction had not been completed at Lincoln Center, the play was presented in the company's temporary headquarters at the ANTA Washington Square Theater.
Despite all the anticipation -- partly because of the anticipation -- the play proved to be a disappointment, although it did well at the box office. The record did not improve with the subsequent Lincoln Center productions, Eugene O'Neill's "Marco Millions," S. N. Behrman's "But for Whom Charlie," "The Changeling" (Mr. Kazan's first attempt at staging a Jacobean classic) and Mr. Miller's "Incident at Vichy." After one season, and following a clash with George Woods, chairman of the theater's board, Mr. Whitehead and Mr. Kazan found themselves forced to leave their positions.
In his autobiography, "A Life," Mr. Kazan said, "So the effort to set up a repertory theater in New York's Lincoln Center, which had started with a burst of energy and hope, ended with falsehoods and the crunch of disgrace." Leaving Lincoln Center was a major setback for Mr. Whitehead. In the years that followed, he did not speak about it publicly. But he never lost his zest for presenting serious theater, and he was soon back on Broadway.
He continued his collaboration with Mr. Miller, as a producer of "The Price," "The Creation of the World and Other Business," the revival of "Death of a Salesman," starring Dustin Hoffman, and "Broken Glass." He was also one of the producers of Harold Pinter's "No Man's Land" (starring John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson) and "Betrayal" and Tom Stoppard's "Artist Descending a Staircase."
In addition to his wife, he is survived by his sons, Sam, who is a theater critic, and Charlie, who is in theater production. Funeral services will be private.
This month Mr. Whitehead was given a special Tony Award, which he added to the array of honors he had accumulated during his lifetime in the theater.
After the deaths of his rivals David Merrick and Alexander Cohen in 2000, Mr. Whitehead was the last surviving major producer from Broadway's heyday. In an interview in The New York Times, he was asked if producers ever retired. His answer was a definite no. He said, "We always feel there might be another show that will give us that kick."

HEADLINE: Company's Ills Further Deflate Buffalo's Hopes 

BYLINE:  By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

DATELINE: BUFFALO 

 BODY:
Finally, for this luck-challenged Rust Belt city, it appeared fortune was shining.
 A big company was not only moving in 1,000 jobs -- after decades of corporate flight -- but it planned to build a 15-story office tower to boot. And not just anywhere, but right on the waterfront, making the building a gleaming catalyst to jump-start the moribund heart of the city. 
 "They were the biggest new player to come to town in years," said Andrew J. Rudnick, president of the Buffalo Niagara Partnership, a business trade group.
As luck would have it, the conquering hero was Adelphia Communications. And as the company, the sixth-largest cable system in the nation, sits in the cross hairs of investigations and tries to fend off bankruptcy, people here have taken to calling the mess "Buffalo's Enron." 
The Securities and Exchange Commission and two federal grand juries are investigating Adelphia after it disclosed off-the-books lending of more than $3 billion to its founder, John J. Rigas, his family and Rigas-controlled companies. Mr. Rigas, whom The Buffalo News in 2001 called the city's "most powerful and effective business leader," and other family members gave up control of the company in May. Analysts say a bankruptcy filing is imminent.
Few people here, apart from Adelphia executives, now believe the $125 million tower will ever be built. Many worry about the hundreds of jobs that Adelphia has already created here, if the company declares bankruptcy and breaks apart. They have given up on Mr. Rigas's dream of turning Buffalo into the second headquarters for his Pennsylvania company.
And, as if to dig the dagger into the city's heart a bit deeper, it happens that the Rigases own the beloved Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League, giving rise to fears in this sports-mad town that the family may have to sell the team to outsiders to help climb out of the financial morass. That, Mayor Anthony M. Masiello said, "would be devastating to the psyche and image of this city."
Civic leaders say they have already lined up unnamed local investors to buy the Sabres if the Rigases have to sell, and N.H.L. officials say they want a team in Buffalo as long as fans keep supporting it. (About 70 percent of season tickets have already been sold for the 2002-03 season.) 
The city's latest bad turn has been greeted here with either a collective shrug -- Buffalo hurting? What else is new? -- or dismay at yet another rut on the long comeback trail from job loss and blight.
"It's one more nail in Buffalo's coffin," said Aaron Platz, 30, a Buffalo resident, alluding to a litany of troubles that includes the layoffs of more than 300 teachers and school administrators in 2001 and a steady decline in population that has left the city with 292,000 people, half of its peak in the 1950's.
Todd Parmington, 45, the chief executive of a wholesale distribution firm, seemed resigned to the city's taking one step forward and two steps back. "It's yet another piece of bad news for an area that I believe has become immune to bad news," he said.
Yet people here seem to have a harder time believing the bad news about the Rigas family. In John Rigas (pronounced RIG-iss), the city believed it had found a savior it could relate to.
The son of Greek immigrants from Wellsville, N.Y., 70 miles south of here, Mr. Rigas, 77, built his cable television empire from scratch, starting in 1952 with a small company in western Pennsylvania that eventually expanded to western New York. It has claimed 5.8 million subscribers in 31 states and Puerto Rico, but recently disclosed financial data suggesting it may have inflated that figure by about 200,000.
The Rigas success story captured the fancy of this city of immigrants and blue-collar workers, and in interviews over the years Mr. Rigas said he always felt a connection to Buffalo, where he attended church in his boyhood. Sabres fans took to the tall, white-haired man who mixed with the everyday folks in the nosebleed seats at the team's arena, across the street from a parking lot where he had proposed the office tower.
Mr. Rigas first bought a stake in the Sabres in 1994 and got controlling interest in the team in July 2000, a month after he reached a deal with the city and state to build the office tower for a regional headquarters in Buffalo, the company's second corporate home after Coudersport, Pa.
Sports fans hoped Mr. Rigas would stabilize the financially precarious Sabres; Adelphia's undisclosed loans include $130 million to a Rigas-controlled partnership that owns the team.
City and state leaders, meanwhile, saw the Adelphia tower as an even bigger boon to western New York, where the decades-long collapse of the manufacturing base has left the region in economic shambles. The Buffalo area, once known for its industrial might, has lost more than half of its factory employment since 1958, dropping to 88,700 industrial jobs today from 194,300 in 1958. 
When the tower project was announced in June 2000, Adelphia promised to create 1,000 new jobs -- and came through with at least 800, deploying them in buildings in and around Buffalo -- to support its expanding fiber optic and cable network. The city and state answered with tax breaks and other incentives, including $50 million the state offered to develop the office tower.
Mayor Masiello called the tower project a "monumental economic development achievement." Gov. George E. Pataki flew in for the announcement and said it would "launch this region's economic renaissance into the 21st century."
These days, despite doubts here and on Wall Street, Adelphia's official stance is that a building is still in the works. "Our short- and long-range plans call for a significant work force based in Buffalo," the company said in a statement.
But that view is not shared by state and city officials. A call to the governor's office was referred to the Empire State Development Agency, whose chairman, Charles A. Gargano, lamented the expected loss of the building, but said, "The governor is strongly committed to ensuring the $50 million remains in Buffalo for economic development initiatives."
Mayor Masiello said waterfront development would continue. Improvements are being made to parks, buildings are being converted to housing, and there are plans for a retail and business center for the Sabres' old arena, now abandoned. The city is also banking heavily on a proposed Indian-run casino downtown, provided a state law adopted last fall stands up to court challenges.
"We are not standing still, holding our breath," the mayor said.
Some Buffalo leaders still hold out hope that another corporate suitor will come calling and deliver the tower. "I see this potential crisis as an opportunity," said Joel A. Giambra, the Erie County executive.
But real estate analysts are skeptical. "There aren't an awful lot of people begging to bring companies, the big ones, in here," said Howard Saperston Jr., a real estate executive here since 1963.
Many Buffalonians weather their city's ups and downs with equal reserves of pride and skepticism. This is why people like Bill Slater, 62, a taxi driver and lifelong resident, can in one breath extol the virtues of his city -- close-knit families, a can-do spirit tested with every winter storm, fine colleges -- and in the next question whether it will ever get better.
Standing on a downtown street where "you can roll bowling balls down here at night and not hit nothing," Mr. Slater said he always had his doubts that Adelphia could turn things around. "My gut feeling is, it's tough to put up a building like that with the city on its heels," he said.
But like so many Buffalonians, he has not given up.
"Someone is going to buy that company and turn it around," he said. "And Buffalo will come out all right. Well, I hope."

HEADLINE: Tourists Discover the Mainstay of Artists and Students: Hostels 

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
There is a block in Times Square that Disney never got to. On that block, Osamu Kawahara runs what could be considered a pleasant New York accommodation. It has elegant hardwood floors, lovely interior windows and umbrellas that are given out on the honor system. The rooms are neat and private, and the furniture is shiny.
 To get there, though, one must walk south of the Port Authority Bus Terminal, past an all-night liquor store known for serving customers of all ages, a gaggle of homeless people, a pack of rats and a couple of stinky, smoky garages. Mr. Kawahara runs a hostel, a form of housing that has traditionally served as the temporary home of New York's struggling artists, visiting students and others who consider cheapness an important amenity. And lately, his 16 beds have rarely been empty. 
 The one thing his guests seem to agree attracted them to the hostel, Times Square Beds and Rooms, near Eighth Avenue on West 40th Street, is the price: $38 a night, plus taxes, and a minor assault on the visual and olfactory senses on the way. 
There is little doubt that since the global economic recession began last year, hostels and other hotel alternatives, from apartment swapping to staying with friends and relatives, have become a much more popular way to spend a day, weekend or month in Manhattan. 
"Immediately after Sept. 11 we had about 80 cancellations," Mr. Kawahara said. "Since then, we have seen many more middle-class people and couples who are from Japan or Europe who want to stay in a hostel, even though hotels are offering sharp discounts."
A steady stream of tourists have returned to New York in recent months. But hotel owners estimate that their revenues have not increased at the same pace as the people-per-square-inch on the streets of Times Square, in part because tourists are looking for cheaper alternatives to expensive hotel rooms.
For instance, those in the apartment-swapping business report that more guests are looking to trade with New Yorkers. And at hostels like the Chelsea Star Hostel, where Madonna stayed as a struggling musician in 1981 and 1982, middle-class Europeans are among the largest group of visitors. And some foreign business travelers have been choosing the Union Square Inn, which has cable television and maid service, over the chic W Hotel a few blocks away.
Hotel occupancy in Manhattan in April was 75.6 percent, down 2 percent from the same month last year, according to PFK Consulting. Average room rates in April were $191.75, down 11 percent from a year ago.
According to a survey of 56 hotels conducted by the city's convention and visitor's bureau, NYC & Company, advance booking information suggests that the occupancy rate will be around 72 percent in July, or 1.6 percentage points lower than the same month last year. The survey forecasts occupancy rates of 76.7 percent in August, down 2.4 percentage points from last year. Some of that decrease, tourism officials say, can be attributed to penny-pinching tourists who choose to come but stay in less expensive accommodations.
Support for this argument is mostly anecdotal and comes mainly from hostel owners who say that on average their occupancy levels are at or about 2 to 3 percentage points higher than what they were at this time last year.
Among such occupants are people like William and Robin Korb, of Chippewa Falls, Wis., who stayed this month at the Big Apple Hostel, on West 45th Street near Avenue of the Americas, a stone's throw from the Marriott hotel in Times Square. They were packed in a cramped dormitory-style room with their three daughters, Alex, Gabrielle and Rachel, and two of Rachel's friends and fellow Girl Scouts, Kristina Wolff and Lauren Berg.
On a recent afternoon Big Apple's lobby looked as if it could have been the set for a United Colors of Benetton ad: there was a stylishly dressed student from Japan, a man with dreadlocks and a German woman in bright red pants. The rooms have only bunk beds, guests bring their own linens, maid service is not an option and the only amenity appeared to be a deck on the rear of the place.
Still, Mr. Korb was not shy about his reasons for staying at the hostel: "It was incredible that we could be that close to where everything was happening for that price," he said.
The Korbs paid $33 per person per night, or $1,155 for five nights. A room with a single bed at the nearby Marriott is about $259 a night. Big Apple's self-described front desk guy, Tony Santiago, explains the interest in hostels with a story about a recent customer, "a well-to-do Australian woman" who figured she had saved $300 by staying at the hostel rather than a hotel. "Imagine all the shoes I can buy for $300," he recalled her saying. "And she did buy a lot of shoes," he said. "That is all she was in New York for."
Mr. Santiago said he thought that middle-class American and foreign visitors had finally discovered hostels as the inexpensive alternative to hotels that student travelers have long known them to be.
"Why would you pay so much money to be in Times Square?" he said. "You are not going to find anything for $33 a night in Times Square that is going to be clean and absent of bums and drug addicts."
Hostels are not the only businesses thought be benefiting from more cost-conscious consumers. 
On craigslist.org, a Web site that offers classified-ad listings for several cities, the number of apartments available for swapping in New York has more than doubled, to 54,605 in April 2002, up from 17,583 in August 2001.
Craig Newark, the founder of craigslist.org, said he is seeing about 300 apartment swap postings a week in New York. "For summer, we are on an incline, and it is rising on a very steep climb," he said.
Heidi Dubose, a German immigrant who has lived in New York with her American husband for two decades, has two spacious, furnished one-bedroom apartments in a building on Fulton Street in Lower Manhattan that she rents to out-of-town visitors on vacation or on business. Lately, she said, she has had no trouble filling the apartments, which she rents for $185 to $285 a night, even though they are only blocks from ground zero. 
"People started coming back to the area when the Ritz-Carlton and the Marriott opened," Ms. Dubose said, adding that business is as good as it was last year, which is much better than she expected. "But many people are looking for something that is less expensive and more private - they are willing to give up the amenities of room service and daily cleaning." Similar rooms at the Ritz-Carlton, for example, are running for about $400 a night. 
Whitney Gaylord and a friend decided that they did not want to pay a penny to stay in New York this summer. So they swapped their one-bedroom Paris flat for an apartment in Washington Heights. 
"Money is definitely a factor," she added. "You have to ask yourself, 'Why sublet or stay in a hotel when you can swap for free?' " 
At Times Square Beds and Rooms, Mr. Kawahara said he was so busy he was considering cutting back on advertising and just letting his business grow by word of mouth. Business has been so good, he said, that he has started to limit his patrons only to foreign guests who make advance reservations over the Internet.
"I am surprised," he said. "With the economic troubles and Sept. 11, I thought for sure that this would be a bad year. I am so surprised - but we are actually talking to our landlord about starting another hostel in a building he wants to buy downtown."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; 
2 Agencies Shut Offices As Work Falls Off

BYLINE:  By SAUL HANSELL 

 BODY:
Two agencies are closing offices.
 Arnold Worldwide in Boston is closing its San Francisco office, citing the continued weak advertising economy there. 
 The top two executives of the office -- Jim McGinn, president, and Stu Cooperrider, creative director -- will return to the Arnold headquarters in Boston, in jobs to be determined. 
Work for remaining clients like Gulf Lubricants and Keynote Software will be completed in the next few weeks and then the 17 other employees of the office will be laid off.
The closing of the office, which became part of Arnold when Arnold acquired Ingalls Moranville in 1999, does not affect the offices of sibling agencies like Arnold MPG, for media, and Magnet, for public relations. Arnold, Arnold MPG and Magnet are all units of Havas.
Also, Grey Worldwide, part of the Grey Global Group, is closing its office in Fort Worth, as a client, the Texas Dairy Queen Operators Council, shifts its account to Loomis in Dallas. Eleven employees are being laid off.
The Fort Worth office became part of Grey in 1998 when Grey acquired the council's agency, Regian & Wilson. At the closing, the office had billings estimated at less than $5 million; its remaining account, Pro-Cuts, is being resigned. Grey continues to handle the worldwide account of International Dairy Queen, part of Berkshire Hathaway, from its Los Angeles and New York offices.

HEADLINE: A Nation in Search of Its Mission 

BYLINE:  By David Gergen; David Gergen is director of the Center for Public Leadership at the Kennedy School at Harvard and editor at large of U.S. News & World Report. He served as a White House adviser to four presidents.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
President Bush deserves praise for proposing to create a new architecture for homeland security, a reversal of his earlier position. And he will win acclaim if -- in reversing his previous hands-off stance on the Middle East conflict -- he settles differences within his team and produces a solid plan for that conflict. Too many presidents in the past have stubbornly clung to their ideas, refusing to adjust to changing circumstances and forcing the country to pay a cruel price. Remember Woodrow Wilson? Hoover? L.B.J.?
 Give credit to Mr. Bush for adaptive leadership. But there is a big challenge that has so far received short shrift and needs a fresh look: the creation of a new sense of purpose in our national life. How can we transform the good will and willingness to sacrifice since Sept. 11 into meaningful and lasting changes in our communities and culture? Nine months after the attacks, our opportunity on that civic front is rapidly slipping away. 
 Most of us have become mere spectators in the war on terrorism. While anxiety about a second strike remains high in big cities along the coasts, I find in travels to the interior of the country that people have generally returned to their daily routines, leaving the struggle to others. The ups and downs of war have become something one follows in the newspapers, just like the stock market. Of course people are rooting for more victories -- indeed, they are rooting for the president, too -- but their level of engagement is low. Some polls show that worries over the economy, education and health care are crowding out concerns about the war.
Now that the debate in Washington has become focused on intelligence failures, most people have become even more disengaged, viewing the bureaucratic restructuring as having very little to do with them. At the same time, there is no call for common sacrifice from either the White House or Congress. As the political columnist Mark Shields points out, this is the first major war since the United States-Mexico war of 1846 that America has fought without having a draft or a tax increase. While more than 3,000 Americans were killed in the Sept. 11 attacks, the rest of us now face little more than inconvenience when we travel. There are no blood drives, no rationing and fewer enlistments in the armed forces than were expected. (Inquiries about military service spiked upward after the attacks, but actual enlistments have remained relatively flat.) 
Our greatest leaders recognized that in order to mobilize support for a long war, they must not only demand common sacrifice but link it to a galvanizing vision of what life would be like after the guns were silenced. Washington could afford to lose more battles than he won because his fellow colonists believed that with victory, they would become a free people. Lincoln sustained support during many a dark moment by kindling dreams of a lasting union and more liberty. In 1941, as war approached, Roosevelt called for universal sacrifice from business, labor and agriculture and laid out his vision of a world with Four Freedoms. His 1944 State of the Union address called for a "second Bill of Rights" for all Americans -- an audacious economic plan that guided the Democratic and some Republican presidents for the next half-century.
Demands for sacrifice and a vision of what can come afterward are fundamental to wartime leadership. Mr. Bush can still demonstrate that leadership by linking present sacrifice with a better future in several ways. He can, for example, roll back his tax cuts and propose that the savings be redirected toward a broad social cause like improving the lives of children. If the war is about securing their safety, after all, why should we not be equally concerned about securing their health and education? Why not seize this moment to make the war about something positive, instead of allowing it to be focused exclusively on how we ward off the negative?
The president obviously cherishes the tax cuts, but along with the string of giveaways in Congress to farmers and others, Washington is sending a clear signal to the public that this war is painless and that we can have a war and life as usual. Not only is this untrue, but it does little credit to Mr. Bush. Only by insisting on the same discipline at home as on the international front will he be able to gain for himself and his political party lasting appeal with the American voters.
He can do even more to invigorate our spirit if he alters direction and embraces universal national service -- setting up programs that ask all eligible young people between 18 and 24 to spend at least a year in civilian or military service. To his credit, Mr. Bush has already started down this road, calling for creation of a USA Freedom Corps, and he continues to call for volunteerism in his public speeches. But a close look at the president's program reveals that it would reach only a tiny fraction of the young. His administration would fund an increase in the Peace Corps from 7,000 to 14,000 participants and an increase in Americorps from 50,000 to 75,000. 
But the census shows that the number of Americans between the ages of 18 and 24 now stands at 27 million. The USA Freedom Corps would enroll less than one half of one percent of these people, a far cry from the level of participation that Americans would willingly support if a bold program were in place.
Today's younger generation is one of the most idealistic in years. On college campuses students began volunteering in record numbers long before Sept. 11. As the Rev. Peter Gomes of Harvard writes in an insightful new book, one can hear a cri de coeur from students today who are asking how "to make a life, and not just a living." A call for universal service would help them find the answer. It would also teach us as a nation, as previous wars have taught us, what we share as Americans.
If he can succeed in the war on terrorism, Mr. Bush will be remembered as a very good president. If he brings peace to the Middle East, he will earn international honor. But if he also creates a new sense of national purpose before this moment fades, he could enter the front ranks of American presidents.

HEADLINE: Common Foe For Musicians And Labels 

BYLINE:  By LAURA M. HOLSON 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, June 16 

 BODY:
Four months ago, recording artists were nearly at war with their recording companies, comparing the relationship to that of indentured servants forced to serve corporate bosses concerned mostly with filling their coffers.
 Politics, though, can make friends of even the most ardent foes. 
 In the next few weeks, United States lawmakers are expected to introduce legislation backed by both artists and recording companies who are suddenly joined against what they consider their newest enemy: the radio conglomerates whose practices, they contend, cost them millions of dollars each year.
The bill, which is sponsored by Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, will address several issues, including whether to limit consolidation in the radio industry by imposing a cap on the number of stations a company can own. He will also seek to limit the practice of record labels' paying independent promoters to promote new hits to station programmers, something that has gone on for decades, but is now being described as a new form of payola. 
The artists and labels have come together out of necessity, largely an outgrowth of the big problems facing the music business. Sales of new albums have plummeted as consumers have figured out how to access music over the Internet. Artists are demanding more flexible recording contracts and better accounting. At the same time, corporate parents, forced to shore up their own balance sheets, are demanding that record labels cut costs.
"Any time you have changes in the dynamics of an industry, you have an opportunity to rejigger the economic pie," said Carey Sherman, president of the Recording Industry Association of America, the Washington lobbying group which represents record companies.
Greg Hessinger, national executive director of the American Federation of Television and Recording Artists, added, "No one wants to be left behind." But what is striking to many is what they consider to be the teapot calling the kettle black: the recording companies, who for the most part have been gobbled up by large global media conglomerates themselves, are attacking the radio industry for its consolidation. The Universal Music Group, for one, a division of Vivendi Universal, has distributed nearly one of every three new albums sold so far this year. And just last week, BMG Music, which is owned by Bertelsmann, announced it was buying the Zomba Music Group, the largest independent record company, which it already owned a stake in.
"Now it's all about synergy and economics of scale," said Michael Bracy, director of government relations for the Future of Music Coalition, a Washington think tank for artist rights.
Some critics say that recording companies lost a big promotional opportunity when they failed to capitalize on the popularity of Internet music early on. Instead, says David Goldberg, vice president and general manager of music for Yahoo.com, record labels treated independent online music concerns as competitors instead of valuable, promotional vehicles. That approach, he said, bolstered the dependence of labels and artists on radio. (The Justice Department is currently investigating the online activities of the recording industry because of antitrust concerns.)
To be sure, radio stations, recording companies and the artists they represent have a complex relationship. In 1996, the federal government lifted the ban on the numbers of radio stations a single entity could own and the industry shifted almost overnight. According to federal records, from March 1996 to March 2001 the number of radio stations increased 7 percent while the number of owners dropped 25 percent. The biggest acquirer was the Clear Channel Communications, based in San Antonio, whose properties have swelled since then to 1,244 radio stations, 36 TV stations and 135 concert venues they either own, operate or have a stake in.
With that came a change in the way recording companies dealt with independent promoters, the agents or middlemen who have flourished since the 1950's and who are hired to pitch new songs to radio programmers.
Independent promoters work like this: Promoters pay a broadcaster or radio station a yearly promotional fee, which allows them to pitch songs on behalf of a label. In return, promoters are given an advance look at the list of new songs added each week. In exchange for that information, a record label can pay a promoter several thousand dollars for each new song added.
Consolidation in the radio industry, though, added a new twist. In the past two years, the radio conglomerates -- including the largest chain, Clear Channel and smaller chains like Radio One -- have designated promoters they want to work with exclusively. (Some executives estimate the recording industry pays independent promoters as much as $200 million a year overall.) Mr. Sherman of the Recording Industry Association said overall promotional costs began to rise dramatically, prompting protests from record executives.
It also made it harder for less-well known acts to get airplay, artist advocates contend. "The focus has gone toward the bean counters and the love of profit," Mr. Bracy added. "But there is a question of what is good for culture."
Kraig Kitchin, president of Premiere Radio Network, a division of Clear Channel, described the situation this way: "I'm not going to tell you our company needs the independent promoter. Record companies do."
He said promoters are less necessary for the stations because, as is the case with his company, program directors collect reams of data and talk among themselves to help make programming decisions not only at one radio station, but countrywide. "That dynamic needs to be taken into account by the labels," he said.
In some ways it already has. A private complaint among record executives (but one they will not say publicly) is that their money is not buying what it used to, that it was easier for a promoter to influence a radio station's playing list when the decision-making by programmers was not so centralized.
"The question," Mr. Sherman said, "is what is the value of the relationship we are trying to capitalize on?"
Not much anymore, according to some in the industry, which is why corporate parents see promotion as a convenient place to trim.
So why then do not recording executives just refuse to pay independent promoters, something they can individually do without Congressional backing? (If they agreed as a group they could run afoul of anti-trust laws.) Many are afraid not to, they say, because they fear retaliation from promoters or radio programmers who could decide to not play new or lesser-known acts.
But as importantly, labels do not trust each other, saying competition is so fierce they will do anything to get what is perceived to be an edge.
"Even if we agree not to do this, someone else will," said one recording executive who asked not to be named. "No one wants to be first. Everyone is in such a huge fit to increase their market share, people will do whatever it takes."
By asking Congress to legislate promotional expenses for them, said another executive, it gets recording executives off the hook. "That way no gets screamed at by their bosses."
Fred Davis, the New York music lawyer whose firm represents bands like Linkin Park and Puddle of Mudd, said the interdependence between radio, musicians and record labels is going to have to be rethought and change with the new pressures in the music business.
"We are all scratching at a declining stream of revenue," he said. "The problem is there is no way to evolve right now unless you totally reinvent the business model."

HEADLINE: Korean Insurers Are Allowed to Expand 

BYLINE:  By DON KIRK 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, June 16 

 BODY:
The South Korean finance ministry announced a sweeping proposal today to allow the country's largest conglomerates, or chaebol, to open insurance firms and build on the ones they already have.
 The ministry said the measures, included in legislation that the National Assembly is expected to adopt in the next few months, would also remove rules that have prevented banks from marketing insurance products. 
 At the same time, in an effort to protect insurance firms and their customers, the bill would impose new limits on the amount of credit they can extend.
The legislation, the first since the basic insurance bill was adopted 25 years ago, seeks to streamline an industry that was hard hit by the economic crisis that swept the region in late 1997. 
The Korea Deposit Insurance Company, an agency of the finance ministry, took over one of the nation's biggest insurers, the Korea Life Insurance Company, at the height of the crisis and is still looking for a buyer.
Although the government has been trying to cut down on the power of the conglomerates that have long dominated the Korean economy, the net effect of the legislation would be to remove restrictions that kept the country's five biggest business groups from expanding on the insurance companies they already own. 
Banking officials described the bill as long overdue considering the size of the industry, which has 22 life and 22 nonlife insurance firms.
The bill would mean that both Hyundai and the LG Ggroup, two of the largest conglomerates, would be free to go into insurance for the first time. Other conglomerates, notably the Samsung group, Korea's largest conglomerate, which includes Samsung Life Insurance, could expand on the kind of insurance they now offer.
Equally important, the bill would answer the frequent complaints of foreign bankers that the government imposes restrictions that make it difficult to operate here.
Under the program, banks could become insurance companies as well, entering a field that was previously closed to them. Banks have been calling for years for the freedom to diversify into insurance, as do firms in the United States and Europe.
The government viewed the legislation as part of an effort to loosen tight restraints on the Korean insurance industry, which potential foreign investors have often described as bogged down in regulations that impede the growth of Korean firms and discourage investors.
The measures are the second overhaul of existing legislation that is giving conglomerates more power than they have ever had in the financial business. The National Assembly has passed a bill that will raise the number of shares that a conglomerate company can own in a bank from 4 percent to 10 percent.
The bill, however, also seeks to reduce the risks of pressure from the conglomerates that would turn insurance companies into financial tools for their own security and enrichment.
The legislation would impose a ceiling of 12 percent of an insurance company's equity on the amount that it can lend to any single creditor and a ceiling of 40 percent of assets on the extent of loans to a group and its subsidiaries. 
Nor could an insurance company buy stocks and bonds in a conglomerate or its subsidiaries with a value above 60 percent of the company's equity.
The commitment of the government in enforcing such rules appeared questionable, however, since none will take effect until 2007 while companies were expected to open insurance companies and build on the ones they have as soon as possible after the bill goes into law, probably in the fall. The rules, when they do take effect, would appear to give a conglomerate huge influence over the fortunes of any insurance firm under its control.
At the same time, the legislation would make it far easier for an insurance company, regardless of who owns it, to go into business and then to profit by investing.
Under the legislation, a company would need no more than 5 billion won, about $4.1 million, to go into business as opposed to the current minimum of 10 billion won. The bill would remove all barriers to an insurance company investing inside Korea and raise the limit on investment abroad from 20 percent to 30 percent of an insurance company's assets.

HEADLINE: Toehold on a Long Trek to Heal India-Pakistan Rift 

BYLINE:  By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: KARACHI, Pakistan, June 16 

 BODY:
American diplomacy in Pakistan and India this month has produced a tiny victory for each side in the struggle over Kashmir, a toehold on which to proceed. But the car bomb that killed 11 people outside the American Consulate here on Friday made clear that the road to any long-term solution will be difficult and dangerous.
 High-level visits to both countries this month succeeded in pulling them back from the brink of war. They opened the way for tentative steps that could address the roots of their long-running conflict over Kashmir. 
 But a total of one million soldiers remain on alert on both sides of the frontier of the two countries. Shelling and gunfire continue in that disputed Himalayan territory. In a worst-case scenario, both countries have nuclear weapons. 
In Pakistan, Islamic militants who feel betrayed by the government's abandonment of the Taliban in Afghanistan and now by its clampdown in Kashmir are fighting back with the only weapon they have, more violence.
If they can destabilize the government of President Pervez Musharraf in Pakistan or provoke retaliation by India, they could undermine the fragile process begun with the visits of Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld.
In concrete terms, those visits produced only modest gestures and assurances. But analysts said both sides seemed now to be seeking a way to end the confrontation that, as Mr. Rumsfeld emphasized, is exhausting both of them militarily and economically.
"It could be that this is just a pause in what would be seen as a perpetual crisis in South Asia," said Philip Cohen, a South Asia expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
On the other hand, he said, "Sometimes out of a crisis you get a moment when both sides can move freely.
"Let's hope this is such a moment," he added. "The United States is uniquely placed now, as never in history, to do something."
Its close economic and military relations with both countries have put it in a position to act as an impartial broker, or at least as an honest messenger between them.
The small victories won by each side addressed important concerns. 
India won the support of the United States, as well as other nations, for its position that Pakistan has actively been aiding the infiltration of militants across the border and that General Musharraf could therefore cut them off.
"India has squeezed him and been successful in turning the rest of the world against him," said Pervez Hoodbhoy, a leader in Pakistan's antiwar movement. "So he's really feeling the heat."
As the American officials shuttled back and forth between the capitals, Pakistan gained too. Without any formal declaration, a foreshadowing of the dialogue it had been seeking over Kashmir had begun.
India has ruled out negotiation, saying the subject of Kashmir was already closed. The large portion of Kashmir that it controls, it insists, is part of India and neither Pakistan nor any other country has any role to play there.
But it is precisely this delicate game of message-carrying that opens the possibility of an eventual resolution to a deadlock of counterclaims over mostly Muslim Kashmir that has persisted since Pakistan and India were partitioned in 1947, and has already caused two wars between them.
"If left to themselves, given the personal animosities on both sides, it is hard to imagine Indian and Pakistani leaders getting together and making serious progress," said George Perkovich, a South Asia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington.
Two weeks ago, General Musharraf and Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee of India were at an international conference in Kazakhstan and refused not only to shake hands but even to look at each other.
Days later, Mr. Armitage visited both leaders and carried statements of their positions back and forth between them.
"This is not mediation," Mr. Perkovich said. "Let's be clear about that. Does a telephone wire mediate? No. It basically carries messages. That's the kind of role the United States can play."
Part of this role will be to assure India that Pakistan is keeping its word to halt infiltration by militant groups over the border into the Indian part of Kashmir. Both countries are considering an American offer to provide technical surveillance that could include motion sensors, satellite images and observation by unmanned aircraft.
If he keeps his pledge to seal the border -- to move from the military to the diplomatic arena -- General Musharraf risks accusations at home that he has betrayed the Kashmir cause.
To survive a domestic backlash, from opposition parties or disaffected military men, he needs to be able to show that he has won concessions from India -- a softening of its military posture and a dialogue on Kashmir. 
A first hint came today that India might relax its alert status along the border. Even though there have been attacks in Kashmir in the last 24 hours that have killed a dozen people, Indian military officials said that for the first time since their Kashmir buildup began in December, some soldiers and officers would be permitted to go on leave.
As both sides maneuver delicately, they both must watch the calendar.
The crucial month is October, when local elections will be held in the Indian portion of Kashmir and national parliamentary elections will be held in Pakistan.
Indian officials have said they do not expect to remove their troops from the border before then, guarding against violence by Pakistan-backed militants bent on disrupting the Kashmir vote.
Analysts said India was determined to complete the election before opening any real dialogue with Pakistan and to use what it expected to be a favorable vote as a bargaining piece.
If war can be averted until then, Kashmir's early snows will be likely to delay it further, making both infiltration and military action difficult and unlikely.
In that case, the next crisis may come as it did this year -- or be averted by a new era of statesmanship -- when the snows melt next spring.

HEADLINE: Powell's Trial Balloon 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Building on an idea from Egypt's Hosni Mubarak, Colin Powell went on Arab television last week to launch a trial balloon. 
 Speaking of "a Palestinian state called Palestine," he said "it may be necessary to have a provisional state, an interim step. . . . something that we can create that is, that can be called a state." This was followed by a six-column headline: "Bush Is Said to Tell Saudis He Will Offer Plan for Creation of a Palestinian State." 
 But when asked about this notion of recognizing a state on West Bank and Gaza land now occupied by Palestinian forces unwilling to control suicide bombers, President Bush's press secretary said only "the president receives advice all the time." 
Here's my advice: Don't step into this trap. It's a lose-lose idea. 
1. Statehood, even if qualified as provisional or interim, confers a degree of sovereignty. That means control of borders, the ability to make treaties, and to import arms from Iraq and by sea from Iran. 
2. Partial statehood would give Arafat control of an airport. A plane loaded with fuel or explosives could hit a major Tel Aviv building within three minutes, too quickly for Israeli jets to scramble. Ritual condemnation would follow. 
3. Any form of statehood would limit Israel's ability to search out bomb factories and arrest terrorist leaders. What is now a tolerable sweep into disputed territory would be denounced in the U.N. as invasion pure and simple. That would trigger European economic boycotts and draw Arab allies into a wider war. 
Why, then, offer Arafat's autocracy this pre-emptive prize? State Department Arabists claim it would show "movement" away from solid Bush support for Israel and, in the still-dovish Shimon Peres's phrase, offer a "political horizon" to Palestinians. But some of us see recognition of an unreformed P.L.O. as offering a taste of triumph to jihadists from Netanya to New York. 
Nobody doubts that statehood will be part of an eventual settlement. That goal provides a powerful incentive for Palestinians to take command of their destiny. But if killing Israeli civilians is rewarded piecemeal, responsible Palestinian leaders will be less likely to fight a civil war being waged against them now by Hamas and the Islamic Jihad -- whose stated goal is to drive Jews out of the Middle East. 
What about Mubarak's "timetable" for full statehood, with a down payment of the 40 percent of the West Bank and Gaza now under Palestinian control, including almost all the Arab population? That is similar to the territorial timetable dreamily agreed to at Oslo, which assumed that regular concessions of land would lead to mutual trust and peace. Instead, Israel's calibrated concessions led to Arafat's insatiable demands and ultimately to war. A timetable for a state of Palestine would become a deadline for Israeli negotiators. 
Why didn't Ariel Sharon, last week in Washington, strongly and publicly oppose it? Maybe because he trusts Bush and underestimates Powell's media savvy; maybe Sharon did not want to appear to be following Likud's recent unequivocal lead against talk of statehood now. I reached him at his farm last night. 
"The Bush administration knows very well our position," the prime minister said. "It is premature now until the full cessation of terror and its incitement, and until there is real reform. I was willing to discuss cease-fire under fire, but I cannot discuss political developments under fire. Many things must happen before that is discussed." 
He wouldn't say what he told Bush on this, but his use of "premature" suggests that once violence subsides and a peace partner emerges, Sharon would be willing to tie the long-term interim agreements he seeks to interim or provisional forms of Palestinian sovereignty. I think statehood should be the deal-closer, and such salami slicing of statehood would be a mistake for the reasons enumerated above, but to strain an old metaphor, it's hard to be more Catholic than the pope. 
A more truculent reaction to Powell's trial balloon of phased statehood comes from Saeb Erekat, Arafat's top negotiator, who demands all or nothing. What if the only statehood Bush offers leaves Israelis at checkpoints between Palestinian cities looking for suicide bombers? He told The New York Times: "I'm afraid that you're going to have a bigger explosion than you're having now."

HEADLINE: How to Split Up the Bipolar F.B.I. 

BYLINE:  By Duncan DeVille; Duncan DeVille, a public service fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School, was an assistant United States attorney in Los Angeles from 1998 to 2001.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
When Robert S. Mueller III, director of the F.B.I., testifies this week before the Congressional intelligence committees, one important question will be whether to move counterterrorism operations out of the bureau. The Congressional leaders who favor doing so are right about the need to break up the F.B.I. But its counterterrorism and counterintelligence work should not be shifted, as some have proposed, into the new Department of Homeland Security envisioned in President Bush's bold proposal. They should go instead to a new, separate office, an American version of Britain's domestic intelligence agency, MI5.
 The F.B.I.'s 28,000 employees are already divided into two disparate branches. The traditional law enforcement agents react to crimes that have already occurred -- for example, bank robberies, kidnappings and organized crime activities. The counterintelligence agents work to disable national security threats -- uncovering Soviet spies in America during the cold war, for example, or finding Qaeda operatives today. 
 Strangely, F.B.I. agents go back and forth between the two branches. Typically a tour of duty is a few years long, yet an agent might find herself chasing terrorists one year and interviewing bank robbers the next.
Further, the counterintelligence wing has long been needlessly hobbled by rules of criminal procedure used in trial courts. Its cases rarely make it to trial; the purpose of its investigations is to gain intelligence that can be used to fight national enemies. Yet this wing's agents are bound by rules that would apply if they were preparing a case for trial: Miranda warnings for detainees, disclosure of confidential informants, disclosure of payments to sources. Some exceptions can be made under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, but getting approval has been difficult, and overly cautious practices are ingrained in F.B.I. counterintelligence agents.
At the same time, the current system poses a threat to civil liberties. When we push the envelope of due process in fighting a war, we also potentially empower the traditional law enforcement wing of the F.B.I. to use these powers in its cases.
Splitting the F.B.I.'s wings could leave the traditional domestic law-enforcement part as the Federal Bureau of Investigation while creating a smaller, more effective way of managing counterintelligence work.
The British agency for domestic intelligence, MI5 (as opposed to MI6 of James Bond fame, which covers foreign intelligence), offers a good model for a new American agency that would assume the F.B.I.'s intelligence functions. MI5 (the official name is the Security Service) is a civilian agency under the authority of the home secretary. It is charged with protecting Britain's national security against terrorism, espionage, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and attacks aimed at crippling the national economy. MI5 has been very effective at infiltrating and weakening foreign saboteurs. In fact, so effective that in 1992 responsibility for leading the intelligence effort against Irish republican terrorism on the British mainland was transferred to it from Scotland Yard and other law-enforcement agencies.
Of course we must be vigilant in making sure that an American domestic intelligence agency is restrained in its powers and operates in line with the civil liberties safeguards that apply to federal law-enforcement agencies now. External oversight by Congress is essential.
Some will argue that the new Department of Homeland Security should house the F.B.I. counterintelligence functions. However, the Department of Justice is a better home for them. The new agency's duties would, after all, still be related closely to law enforcement. Possibly, however, parts of spy agencies like the C.I.A. and the Defense Department intelligence agencies should be folded into the MI5-like agency.
President Bush's bold proposal for the new cabinet department will be hard to get through Congress; this F.B.I. reorganization would step on even more toes. But momentum is growing to fix the F.B.I., and the changes must be substantive. We can learn from the British model.

PERSON: Tim Tompkins 

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES; 
Dirty Thoughts, Dirtier Bombs and Times Square

BYLINE:  By LYNDA RICHARDSON 

 BODY:
THERE are many questions to ask Tim Tompkins, the president of the Times Square Business Improvement District, as he steps out into the clamorous neighborhood, ambling down Broadway, scooting west over to the "New 42nd Street," heading up still-scuzzy Eighth Avenue.
 Let's start with the less scary stuff. Are the prostitutes and petty thieves returning to the district's neon-lit fringes, as some reports suggest? Mr. Tompkins is prepared, armed with police statistics. 
 He hasn't seen any, but security was increased on Eighth Avenue anyway. "Because Times Square is such a high-profile place, there has to be zero tolerance," he says on the way to the area the other morning. "But the reality is that the crime stats are down and they keep going down."
The prospect of sleaze slithering back into Times Square is certainly less frightening than the chilling reminders these days about dirty bombs and how a nuclear device in a suitcase on West 43rd Street could send 20,000 people to kingdom come.
But Mr. Tompkins, 38, doesn't act as if Armageddon is around the corner. Even on this muggy day, he has the unruffled look of a pleasant television anchor, with his neatly groomed hair, pink tie and black suit. He walks briskly.
He has reason to step lively. He's catching a plane in a few hours to Bilbao, Spain, where he was invited by business leaders to talk about the transformation of Times Square.
Mr. Tompkins is the former director of Partnerships for Parks, a group he founded seven years ago to generate community support for neglected parks. He now presides over a district that provides extra security, sanitation and big-time boosterism in an area where you are lucky to find a scrawny tree. The district, which has an annual budget of $5.9 million, includes 5,000 businesses and 500 property owners.
Times Square, he says, "is a crazy, manic version of town square."
He has other good lines: "Times Square is not humanity at its best or its worst but at its most, which is a lot of what New York is. That's what gets sent out to the rest of the world. Times Square is the definition of what New York is."
Isn't that kind of the worry? Should people feel safe here?
"I feel that the honest answer for so many of these issues is unanswerable," says Mr. Tompkins, leaving his visitor unsatisfied -- and apologizing for it. "That's not to say you can't do things, but you also can't kid yourself about the capacity to fully cover every contingency."
Mr. Tompkins began his job in February, becoming the de facto mayor of Times Square. But unlike when the district was created in 1992 to rally against the neighborhood's reputation as a dangerous, seedy place overflowing with peep shows and pornography shops, he faces new quality-of-life challenges after Sept. 11.
Dirty thoughts to dirty bombs. What a difference a decade makes.
"Until a couple of weeks ago, people were talking about eyeball scanners, and now, there's talk about dirty bombs and radiation detection," he says, referring to the headlines at the Broadway newsstands. "Nobody right now has been talking much about anthrax and chemical and biological weapons, but that was the topic du jour. So the key is to be nimble. Part of the nature of my job is to stay on top of whatever issues come up."
He says the district is sending its 50 public safety officers to police antiterrorism workshops, strengthening its neighborhood watch consisting of shopkeepers, property managers and private security guards, and creating an inventory of hidden surveillance cameras, which could lead to their coordinated use against terrorism.
"There are legitimate concerns we need to be sensitive to, but we also need to be as cooperative as possible with any police initiatives to reduce our collective vulnerability," he says.
Mr. Tompkins is known for his adeptness in dealing with different constituencies, but also for being cautious at times. Perhaps that's why he talks so much about things meriting discussion.
YET he gets as animated as a cheerleader when he discusses the possibility of putting public art in temporarily vacant retail spaces and paying more attention to design.
His learning curve isn't huge. From 1993 to 1995 he was the senior project manager on the revitalization of West 42nd Street at the New York City Economic Development Corporation, and in the late 1980's, he worked for the city's Charter Revision Commission.
Growing up in suburban Philadelphia, he knew in eighth grade, while working on the school newspaper, that he would go into public service. His father owned a printing business. His mother raised four children -- he was the youngest.
Since 1986, he has lived mostly in New York. But in the early 1990's, Mr. Tompkins, who is gay, followed his partner to Paris, where he studied French at the Sorbonne, then to Mexico, where Mr. Tompkins was the national editor of The News of Mexico City, an English-language newspaper. He has an M.B.A. from Wharton.
He is now unattached and, he stresses, available, though he shares an apartment with that former boyfriend a few blocks away in Hell's Kitchen. Oh? "All relationships in New York City are fundamentally driven by real estate," he says, laughing.

Call It Dodgers Lite, But Brooklyn Loves It

BYLINE:  By IRA BERKOW 

 BODY:
TWO freshly minted Brooklyn Cyclones, members of this Class A baseball team that is more or less a wisp -- less would be the key word here -- of the late, loved and lamented Dodgers, were in this kaleidoscopic part of the universe for the first time yesterday, and feeling their way.
 One, a 22-year-old pitcher named Eric Templet, is from Gonzalez, La. The other, Kevin Deaton, a 20-year-old, also a right-handed pitcher, is from Cocoa Beach, Fla. 
 They were sitting in a dugout at KeySpan Park, with the empty, swooping rides of the nearby Coney Island amusement park just beyond the outfield fences. The players were about to work out in preparation for their opening game tonight against the Staten Island Yankees, and home opener tomorrow -- with 98 percent of this season's tickets already sold for the 7,500-seat stadium in baseball-starved Brooklyn. 
Templet had extolled a popular Cajun restaurant in his hometown, named "Hymel's" (pronounced "e-mail"). "It's on the levee," he said. He cited as specialties of the house the crawfish etouffee as well as the Mississippi mud pie. 
He was asked if he knew of any places to eat in Brooklyn. "Hmm," he said. "No. Just got here."
Deaton did. "Nathan's," he said, with just the slightest air of the gourmet. "It's the hot-dog-eating capital of the world. I saw a tape on television the other night of the hot-dog-eating contest they held last July 4. I saw a 97-pound Chinese woman eat 22 1/2 hot dogs" -- that " 1/2" came in for emphasis -- "in 12 minutes. It was pretty disgusting. And she only finished third! In fact, the Chinese swept."
The Cyclones, an instant hit last season, are a Mets farm team, and these players, as well as their manager, Howard Johnson, the former Mets infielder, and the pitching coach, Bob Ojeda, the one-time Mets pitcher, are hoping to find their way across the borough to the big stadium in Queens.
Johnson was the batting coach for the Cyclones last season, the first year of their existence. So he knows the ropes of the league and what the players can expect, though, he admits, he has something in common with his players. He still hasn't figured out the subway system.
And he doesn't wear his 1986 Mets World Series ring, the symbol of reaching the highest levels of the profession. Managers or coaches sometimes wear such jewelry as a spur, perhaps, to their young charges. HoJo doesn't wear it yet, anyway. "We've just moved from San Diego," he said, "it's still packed away." He is moving here with his wife, Kim, and their three children.
The Cyclones, one notch above the rookie leagues, were a good team last year and named co-champions of the league when the final series was halted after Sept. 11. Some players have advanced to higher levels, but none to the parent club. It would seem at first thought that, the way the Metsies have been playing this season, any team that wins anything in their organization should be able to send some help to Shea Stadium. Like tomorrow. Johnson was more restrained.
"We feel we've got some bona fide prospects here," he said, "and they might prove it out in a few years. This a developmental league, but we also want to teach winning."
Two of the standouts are Dominicans named Rodriguez. Andres Rodriguez, 21, is a lanky, slugging first baseman, and Edgar, 22, is a third baseman, from the small town of San Pedro de Macoris, where, improbably, scores of major leaguers have come from, from Sammy Sosa to Jose Offerman to Luis Castillo. Edgar says that to make the major leagues, he must work on his "concentration."
Johnson said that a major part of his job was to keep the players "relaxed." "Most of them are straight out of college, and haven't played before big crowds," he said. "And tomorrow night there's going to be a full house -- like 6,500 people in the ballpark in Staten Island." 
An intense rivalry has developed between the teams from the two boroughs, and the Yankee and Mets organizations. "And there's going to be television," Johnson said. "Haven't told them about the television." Might get them too hyper.
And as one watched the players go through their drills, with Johnson and Ojeda watching closely, it was all like a dream. A little dream ballpark, the big dream of the future.
Tyler Beuerlein, a 23-year-old catcher who went to Cal and majored in economics and is in his second year with the Cyclones, was asked if he knew how to get to Shea Stadium.
"Literally or metaphorically?" he said.
The same was asked of pitcher Dave Lohrman. When told the old joke about the way to get to Carnegie Hall was "practice, practice, practice," Lohrman smiled wanly.
"That about sums it up," he said.

HEADLINE: Peruvians Riot Over Planned Sale of 2 Regional Power Plants 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, June 17 

 BODY:
Hundreds of troops took control of Peru's second-largest city today after the government imposed a state of emergency to end violent protests against the sale of two state-owned electricity generating companies.
 The protests, which began on Friday and are the largest since President Alejandro Toledo took office 11 months ago, prompted the government on Sunday to ban public protests and suspend constitutional guarantees for 30 days in the city, Arequipa, and its province. 
 The protesters, worried that the $167 million sale of the regional companies, Egasa and Egesur, to a Belgian company would mean higher utility prices and layoffs, spilled into the center of Arequipa, a city of one million people. 
The police used tear gas over the weekend to disperse crowds; one canister killed a 25-year-old university student. The Peruvian Air Force flew up to 17 Americans out of Arequipa to Lima on Sunday.
The crisis in Arequipa is a serious test of Mr. Toledo's government, which has been buffeted by protests from people frustrated with the administration's inability to relieve poverty.
The standoff, which was unusually violent, underscores the deep frustration across Latin America with government efforts to privatize state industries. Officials contend that privatization saves money and improves services. But many Latin Americans, frustrated by rising poverty and stagnant economies, say auctioning off government assets benefits only a few.
"The response from Latin America, the grass-roots response, has been growing rage over the privatization thrust," said Larry Birns, director of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs in Washington, which has studied privatizations. 
Peruvians, recalling how privatization under the former president, Alberto K. Fujimori, netted billions of dollars that were largely stolen or misspent, worry that auctioning off state companies will only continue to line the pockets of corrupt officials.
Residents in Arequipa are particularly angry because, they contend, President Toledo is reneging on a campaign promise not to auction off utilities. The president said in a nationally televised address on Sunday, however, that the sales would benefit Arequipa's people. He said the sale, to Tractebel S.A., an energy division of the giant French utility group Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux, would go through despite the protests.
Indeed, the government sees privatization as crucial to the economic well-being of Peru. The government has said it hopes to earn $800 million from privatizations this year, money Mr. Toledo has said would translate into infrastructure and jobs. 
The government's promises, though, did little to assuage concerns. Protesters defied the state of emergency by congregating in Arequipa's main square, while others blocked roads in southern Peru. Fearing the spread of protests, the government ordered tanks and troops into the streets of Lima today.

HEADLINE: Bahrain Tries to Fill In Potholes on Road to New Government 

BYLINE:  By NEIL MacFARQUHAR 

DATELINE: MANAMA, Bahrain 

 BODY:
Behind the pricey hotels and pruned palm trees, much of this capital and its surrounding villages consist of cramped little streets that a car negotiates with difficulty. 
 The politics of this island state of 650,000 people run a similarly jagged course. A new monarch pitches his smooth vision of a government abandoning repression, but feelings on the back streets run more ragged. 
 There, slogans denounce the absolute rule of the dynasty and warn against imitating the thousands of Americans stationed here at the home port of the Fifth Fleet. "American-style haircuts are the start of being corrupted," reads a line spray-painted across a concrete wall. 
The Khalifa monarchy is now engaged in an effort to still the anger of these poor warrens, an experiment being monitored throughout the Persian Gulf and the Arab world beyond. This spring, King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa, who is 52, made good on the first step toward easing away from one-man rule with municipal elections. The vote for a national Parliament is expected in October.
Repressive Arab governments are watching to see if the experiment produces the magic balance required to maintain their grip on power while introducing just enough openness to ease the simmering frustration of the new generation.
Young Arabs express increasing anger about their inability to find jobs and buy houses, and at watching the world advance while they stagnate. They see the campaign against terrorism as an assault on Islam and chafe at the inability of the Arab world to improve the lot of the Palestinians, and they seethe. 
"How can you stop the fire inside people?" hissed a rail-thin 25-year-old man in the government unemployment office here. He gave his name, then retracted it when he noticed police officers and other officials who materialized behind him. "People have no chance to live." 
The potential for instability is plain. In April, Islamic opposition groups rallied tens of thousands of people to anti-American demonstrations, to protest the United States' support of Israel. One 24-year-old demonstrator was shot to death after rioters breached the wall of the United States Embassy. The stencil of his portrait is now spray-painted on walls across the island, often with the slogan "Death to America." 
The protests recalled the violence of the mid-1990's, with its deadly friction between between the ruling Sunni minority, who have most of the wealth, and the Shiite majority, which is largely poor. At the time the Shiites were barred from jobs in the security services, out of fear that they would act in the interests of Shiite Iran, across the Persian Gulf.
Members of the Shiite population staged a violent rebellion, seeking a greater voice in running Bahrain. Bombings and violent demonstrations led to about 40 deaths. Hundreds of militants were exiled, and thousands of political prisoners were jailed under draconian security laws. 
The new king, who ascended Bahrain's throne in 1999, released the prisoners, welcomed home most exiles and abolished the security law under which hundreds of dissidents were imprisoned or exiled, in cases handled in closed courts. He also promised the first elections since his late father dissolved Parliament and suspended the Constitution in 1975.
This island nation is considered too tiny to serve as a model for, say, Saudi Arabia next door. The demographics, too, are different. But Bahrain does share certain traits with other Arab governments.
"There is a big similarity among Arab governments in dealing with their people," said Majid Milad al-Jazeeri, a high school Arabic teacher newly elected to one of the municipal councils in Manama. "They meet the people's demands for more freedom with violence, with beatings, tear gas, jail and torture." 
Mr. Jazeeri speaks from experience. The police stormed through his narrow street at 3:30 one morning in December 1994. Not finding him at home, they took his wife and brother hostage until he turned himself in. He was accused of trying to re-create the Iranian revolution in Bahrain and was sentenced to three years in jail. He was freed for two weeks and then thrown back in, this time without charges. He stayed in jail until the new king decreed the amnesty.
"Before criticism was dangerous, but now the road is open for almost any," Mr. Jazeeri said, noting recent marches over the demand for jobs.
Still, people in Bahrain wonder how much democracy their ruler can deliver. Many Bahrainis thought they were going to get back the 1973 Constitution, with a single legislative chamber boasting wide powers. Instead the king promulgated a new Constitution creating an appointed upper house that can effectively block anything the elected Parliament does. (It also gave women the right to vote and run for office, as they did in the municipal election.) 
"There is a step forward toward democracy, but it is just a step," said Sheik Ali Salman. "It is less than what people expected." Sheik Ali, 37, is the leader and religious guide of Wifaq, a conglomeration of Shiite Muslim opposition groups that captured about 22 of 50 seats on the five municipal councils.
"The people lack a voice in the system, that is the main problem," he said. "Either the king does it, or no one else can." 
Experts say that in the long run, the principal goal of the ruling family is to ensure stability to attract foreign investors who can create jobs. But the violence of the 1990's caused foreign banks and other companies to flee.
"O.K., if we want full democracy, we are going backward, but if you compare it to reality, it is a big step forward," said Sawsan Shair, a columnist at the newspaper Al Ayam.
She said that in the old days, the ruler periodically threw open the doors of the palace to listen to complaints. It was a Bedouin system that is still widespread in all Persian Gulf countries, but the growth of the population and the complexity of government show its limitations as a simple form of democratic system. 
"We want stability," Ms. Shair said, "and you cannot have that without giving people some role in making decisions."

HEADLINE: Tyco Sues Ex-Lawyer And Director 

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
Tyco International filed suit yesterday against Mark A. Belnick, its former general counsel, and Frank E. Walsh Jr., its former lead independent director, contending in separate cases that the men wrongly took millions of dollars from the company.
 The outlines of the accusations in the lawsuits, which Tyco filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan, had already been disclosed. But the details add to the accusations' impressions that senior executives enriched themselves personally at Tyco's expense. 
 Mr. Belnick was paid $20 million that was not disclosed to Tyco's board and received $14.9 million in no-interest loans under a program that was supposed to pay for employee moving expenses, according to the suit against him. More than $10 million in loans went to Mr. Belnick's purchase of a vacation home in Utah, the suit contends. Mr. Belnick also falsified records so that his pay and bonuses would not be disclosed to the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to the suit. 
In addition, Mr. Belnick refused to cooperate with the company's internal investigation into undisclosed pay and benefits to L. Dennis Kozlowski, Tyco's former chairman, and other executives, according to the suit. On June 10, the day Tyco fired him, Mr. Belnick destroyed confidential company records from his computer at Tyco's offices in New York, according to the suit.
The suit demands that Mr. Belnick immediately repay the loans and any other misappropriated money.
Mr. Walsh and a charity he controlled received a $20 million bonus from Tyco in 2001 that was not disclosed to Tyco's board, according to Tyco's suit against him. Mr. Walsh, who led the committee that determined the pay of Mr. Kozlowski, asked Mr. Kozlowski personally for the bonus. Mr. Kozlowski approved it without consulting anyone else, according to the suit, which demands that Mr. Walsh return the $20 million, plus interest.
Representatives for Mr. Belnick and Mr. Walsh denied the accusations.
"It's a malicious and substanceless lawsuit," said Stanley S. Arkin, a lawyer for Mr. Belnick. "He certainly didn't misappropriate any money."
Mr. Arkin said that the files Mr. Belnick destroyed were personal financial records and his children's school records. "That's nobody's business but his," he said.
Mr. Walsh, in a statement, called the lawsuit "an overreaction to the recent and well-reported problems and management changes at Tyco."
Mr. Belnick and Mr. Kozlowski hid details of Mr. Belnick's employment agreement with Tyco from the company's personnel department even before Mr. Belnick began working for Tyco in 1998, the lawsuit contends. The hidden details included provisions that Mr. Belnick would receive a cash bonus at least one-third as large as Mr. Kozlowski's and that his pay and bonuses were guaranteed for three years, even if he left the company.
Mr. Belnick also repeatedly received cash and stock bonuses from Tyco that were approved by Mr. Kozlowski but not disclosed to the board, according to the complaint. In 2000 alone, those bonuses totaled more than $20 million. Mr. Belnick also borrowed $14 million from Tyco using no-interest loans backed only by promissory notes, the suit says.
Late in 2001, Mr. Belnick drafted another $20 million retention agreement, which he presented to the board only after it had been completed, according to the suit.
In all, Mr. Belnick received about $70 million in cash, stock, stock options and loans from Tyco during his three and a half years at the company, according to the suit and people who have been briefed on the company's internal investigation.
In addition, Mr. Belnick did not disclose his loans from Tyco to the S.E.C., as the agency's rules require, and manipulated the company's financial statements so his compensation would not be publicly disclosed, the suit says.
Mr. Arkin, Mr. Belnick's lawyer, said that his client was an outstanding general counsel and that Mr. Belnick planned to countersue. "This lawsuit is an offensive and shabby tactic," he said.
Mr. Walsh received his payment for encouraging Tyco to buy the CIT Group, a financial services company, in late 2000 and early 2001, according to the suit against him. After Tyco agreed to buy CIT for $9.2 billion, Mr. Walsh asked Mr. Kozlowski for a $20 million finder's fee for his part in the deal. Mr. Kozlowski agreed to pay Mr. Walsh $10 million and donate another $10 million to the Community Foundation of New Jersey, a charity advised by Mr. Walsh.
In his statement yesterday, Mr. Walsh said he had negotiated the CIT deal at Mr. Kozlowski's direction and noted that his fee had been disclosed in Tyco's proxy.

HEADLINE: A Slaying in 1982 Maintains Its Grip on Asian-Americans 

BYLINE:  By LYNETTE CLEMETSON 

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
The tone for the event had to be just right solemn but powerful, backward-glancing, but forward-moving. For more than two hours, in the cramped suburban office of a group called American Citizens for Justice, a gathering of mostly Asian-American college students mulled over programs and speakers, buttons and T-shirts to make their message resonate.
 They were preparing to commemorate the day 20 years ago on June 19 that Vincent Chin, a Chinese-American, was beaten to death by two auto workers who apparently believed he was Japanese. 
 The killing, in the midst of a recession linked, in part, to the Japanese auto industry, sparked widespread protest and a grassroots expansion of an Asian-American political movement that began on college campuses in the 1960's. The collective outrage led to a broadening of laws and attitudes regarding civil rights and hate crimes.
Two decades later, many Asian-Americans say they face a continuing struggle to be seen and heard in a nation that still views race issues largely in terms of black and white. 
Persistent stereotypes, like the "perpetual foreigner" with questionable allegiances or the "model minority" taking over academic and professional institutions, foster a social and political climate as potentially dangerous, activists say, as the one that led to Vincent Chin's death.
This year, remembrances like the one here -- which includes an all-day civil rights "teach-in" and a screening of the 1989 documentary "Who Killed Vincent Chin?" -- are planned in cities across the country, including New York, Washington, Los Angeles, Chicago and Philadelphia.
Organizers say the commemorations are especially important now, with anti-foreign sentiment running high after Sept. 11 and many United States citizens under suspicion because of their ethnicity. But for Asian-Americans the vigils also offer a chance for personal reflection. 
"The tragedy marked our political coming of age," said Helen Zia, a writer who helped found American Citizens for Justice in response to the Chin killing. "But we also need to consider where we go from here."
The initial response to the death of Mr. Chin, in many ways, reflected the relative invisibility of Asian-Americans as a political force in 1982. Mr. Chin met his assailants, Ronald Ebens, a supervisor at Chrysler, and his stepson Michael Nitz, who had recently been laid off, at a strip club in Highland Park, a small blue-collar city surrounded by Detroit, where Mr. Chin was having his bachelor party. 
A dispute started inside the club about a stripper. Then a dancer heard Mr. Ebens hurl profanities at Mr. Chin, blaming him for the loss of American jobs. Moments later, according to court documents, Mr. Ebens and Mr. Nitz chased Mr. Chin down the street and crushed his skull with a Louisville Slugger.
Asian-Americans called the killing a hate crime. But a judge ruled the death was no more than the tragic end to a barroom brawl. The two pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter, and as part of the plea agreement, were sentenced to three years of probation and $3,780 in fines and court fees.
The court's response to the death of Mr. Chin -- a 27-year-old industrial draftsman who was raised in Detroit and whose livelihood, like those of his killers, depended on the American auto industry -- set off shockwaves through Asian communities across the nation.
"It sent a chilling message that it didn't matter if you worked for American companies and spoke English without an accent, you still weren't regarded as a red-blooded American worthy of rights," said Frank Wu, a law professor at Howard University and author of "Yellow: Race in America Beyond Black and White."
After the verdict, American Citizens for Justice, a coalition of Asian-Americans and supporters from other groups like the Urban League and the Anti-Defamation League, organized protests.
Mr. Chin's mother, Lily Chin, had come to the United States from China after World War II to marry David Chin, a Chinese-American who fought for the United States during the war. Inspired by Mrs. Chin's grief and determination, the American Citizens for Justice took its message to the federal government. 
Federal authorities prosecuted Mr. Ebens and Mr. Nitz on civil rights grounds, in the first such case involving an Asian-American victim, but ultimately lost in 1987. 
Mrs. Chin died last week in a Detroit nursing home.
The fact that many of those now committed to Mr. Chin's legacy were toddlers at the time of his killing is a sign both of progress and of continuing challenges. 
Since Mr. Chin's death, the Asian-American community has grown substantially, both in sheer numbers and political influence. The population of Americans with Asian or Pacific Island heritage has increased roughly 70 percent in the last decade, to more than 12 million.
Asian-American advocacy groups have won significant political victories in the last two decades, from a 1988 law granting reparations to Japanese-Americans interned during World War II to the expansion of mandates for bilingual voting materials in heavily Asian districts, as part of the Voting Rights Act of 1992.
As their political influence has increased, though, so have acts of prejudice and intimidation. Anti-Asian incidents -- from vandalism to murder -- ranged from 400 to 500 a year in the mid-1990's, according to the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium, a Washington-based advocacy group.
The group received reports of nearly 250 ethnically motivated incidents in the three months following Sept. 11, most involving South Asians thought to be Arab.
Such tensions are emboldening a new generation of Asian-American advocates. This spring, Asian-American groups from several colleges organized a boycott of the clothing retailer Abercrombie & Fitch to protest a line of T-shirts with caricatured images of Asians and slogans like "Wong Brothers Laundry Service: Two Wongs Can Make It White."
Abercrombie & Fitch withdrew the line of T-shirts. A spokesman for the retailer apologized, saying, "It's never been our intention to offend anyone."
Roughly 60 colleges and universities now offer either degrees or courses in Asian-American studies, and the Vincent Chin case is frequently used as a teaching tool.
Many students, especially those from first-generation immigrant families, still struggle against a cultural reluctance to speak out. The Chin case "teaches students the price of invisibility," said Scott Kurashige, an assistant professor of Asian Pacific American Studies at the University of Michigan.
Ijun Lai, a University of Michigan senior, cannot watch the documentary about the Chin killing, which was nominated for an Academy Award in 1989, without crying. The fact that Mr. Chin was perceived to be a foreigner hits a nerve with her.
Raised in a predominantly white suburb of Chicago, Ms. Lai, 20, hung out at shopping malls with friends of many ethnic groups and listened to the Smashing Pumpkins, Boyz II Men and Korean hip hop. Even so, she cringes when recalling one of her earliest memories of college -- a group of rowdy young men bowing and yelling "welcome to America" at her as she walked down the street.
Ms. Lai is now co-chairwoman of the university's United Asian American Organizations, an umbrella group of 26 student groups seeking to promote Asian-American issues. 
For many Asian-American students, the popular notion of Asian-Americans as a "model minority" is as damaging as negative stereotypes of the past.
The concept of an inherently super-achieving group that churns out violin virtuosos, high-technology entrepreneurs and geniuses who blow the curve in physics classes, causes Cesar Herrera, whose parents emigrated from the Philippines when he was a toddler, to roll his eyes.
"It completely discounts diversity within our communities and the very real problems of many Asian-Americans who are poor and struggling," said Mr. Herrera, a 20-year-old University of Michigan student who grew up in working-class neighborhoods in Ohio and Michigan trying to steer clear of Asian street gangs.
Michelle Lin, co-chairwoman with Ms. Lai of Michigan's Asian-American student coalition, said "It's like the administration actually uses the whole 'model minority' thing to keep from giving us resources."
Ms. Lin, Mr. Herrera and Ms. Lai acknowledge that most Asian-American students on the Michigan campus are not as politicized as they are. When the Asian-American student group called a meeting to vote on a statement supporting the university's affirmative action programs, a heated debate broke out. The measure passed by only one vote.
But that kind of diversity is what they want other Americans to recognize. They call it part of the social and political legacy they have inherited from the death of Vincent Chin.
As the meeting for the Chin remembrance ended, one last issue remained. The final event is to be a march to Mr. Chin's gravesite, led by a group of drummers and students carrying banners. But the group's budget did not have enough money left to pay for the bold banners the students hoped to have made.
An original member of American Citizens for Justice offered a piece of memorabilia the group has saved for 20 years, a long white banner with blood-red letters that read, "It's not fair" -- Mr. Chin's last words before he slipped into a coma.
The room went briefly silent, until one student said: "Yeah, that's good. Let's carry their banner." Heads nodded in agreement, hoping the message would resonate.

HEADLINE: Racing to Plug A Budget Hole In New Jersey 

BYLINE:  By LAURA MANSNERUS 

DATELINE: TRENTON, June 17 

 BODY:
New Jersey legislators started their final, frantic attempt today to close a multibillion-dollar budget gap for the next fiscal year, a quest that has consumed Gov. James E. McGreevey's first months in office.
 The dispute shaping up over the budget, which must be passed in the next two weeks, is sharper than those of the last eight years, when Republicans held a lock on the governor's office and both houses of the Legislature. In addition, after a decade of prosperity, tax revenues began to plunge this year, and projections have grown increasingly dire each month. 
 The budget is the first major test of the new power of the Democrats, who now control the governorship and the Assembly and share control of the Senate.
The fight over the centerpiece of Mr. McGreevey's budget, a restructuring of the state's corporate business tax, has been especially contentious. In the face of continuing protests and even an advertising campaign by business owners, the Senate Budget Committee abandoned its plan to vote on the bill today.
The committee approved a 60-cent increase in the cigarette tax and a plan to borrow from the unemployment insurance fund. But other major components of the budget, including a bond deal to borrow more than $1 billion against revenue expected from the state's settlement with tobacco companies, remain in committee.
Under the State Constitution, a balanced budget must be in place before July 1, the beginning of the fiscal year. By then, lawmakers must close a $5.3 billion gap between projected revenue and spending.
Since the Senate is split 20 to 20 between the parties, Mr. McGreevey must win one Republican vote for each of his tortuously crafted revenue bills. So far, with the exception of the cigarette tax, Mr. McGreevey has been unable to dent the Republicans' resistance to higher taxes.
Today, lobbyists and business owners filled the cavernous room where the Senate Budget Committee meets, with an occasional "End Corporate Freeloading" button bobbing among the suits. The committee heard testimony into the evening.
Administration officials, while referring to the governor's business tax plan as simply "closing loopholes," say the plan will raise $800,000 to $1 billion in new revenue, roughly twice what the tax brings in now. But business groups estimate the new tax formulas would cost them about $3 billion more.
Small and medium-sized businesses object especially to the "alternative minimum assessment," now a flat $200 tax, which would be calculated under a new formula based on gross receipts or gross profits. The administration maintains that more than three-quarters of the corporations in the state pay only the minimum tax, a figure continually disputed by business groups.
In testimony today, John E. McCormac, the state treasurer, said that 60 percent of the state's 268,000 corporate taxpayers would be unaffected by the new formula.
As Mr. McGreevey has done since he announced his budget in March, Mr. McCormac spoke of large corporate taxpayers that can avoid taxes by shifting assets to other states.
Contrasting the small retailer with the national chain-store competitor, Mr. McCormac said: "I assure you that you will find, in case after case, that the large national company has retained tax attorneys that are skilled in exploiting tax loopholes, bringing their company's reported profits to zero."
The tax plan was also defended by Richard D. Pomp, a law professor at the University of Connecticut, who said the eroding corporate tax base was largely attributable to the fairly recent trend of big accounting firms working out sophisticated strategies for state taxes.
"All states are in the same boat," Mr. Pomp said. "New Jersey is the one that wants to do something about the problem. The whole country is watching, and I think if something good comes of this it will be widely emulated."
Business groups say the state would suffer further losses. Joseph R. Crosby of the Council on State Taxation, a Washington-based group, said that six states had even more serious shortfalls than New Jersey, but none was raising corporate taxes.
The Legislature is set to vote the same day on increased aid to the city of Camden, which was approved by committees in both houses today.
The plan would funnel $175 million into the city from various state agencies and authorities.
Senator Wayne R. Bryant of Camden County said the figure included $75 million in new revenue and $100 million that they city would have received anyway.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 19, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about negotiations over the New Jersey state budget misstated the projected range of revenue from proposed revisions to the corporate income tax. It is $800 million to $1 billion, not $800,000 to $1 billion.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Economists Push for Microsoft Penalties

BYLINE:  By AMY HARMON 

 BODY:
Days before closing arguments are scheduled in the Microsoft antitrust trial, a group of six leading antitrust economists has filed a last-minute brief urging the federal judge presiding over the case to impose tough penalties on the company.
 The economists, each of whom has served as chief economist of the Justice Department's antitrust division, argue that a strong judicial directive to restore the competition thwarted by Microsoft's illegal acts is necessary to ensure the effectiveness of antitrust law in an economy increasingly dominated by technology companies. 
 "It is our recommendation that the court cast a wide net, looking for rules or actions that will increase competition today by lowering entry barriers," the economists wrote. 
It is not clear whether Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the Federal District Court in Washington would consider the economists' arguments, which were submitted in the form of a "friend of the court" brief late last week.
Microsoft argued yesterday that the brief should be rejected, in part because two of the economists, Timothy Bresnahan and Daniel Rubinfeld, worked for the Justice Department while it was pursuing its case against Microsoft. "The economists' brief ignores these conflicts of interest," Microsoft's lawyers wrote.
The economists note that none of them are being paid by anyone in regard to the current litigation. Of the others who signed the brief, Richard Gilbert also worked for the Justice Department under the Clinton administration, George Hay served under the Carter administration, and Bruce Owen and Lawrence White worked under the Reagan administration.
"As I've followed the debate over remedies, I've become convinced that some of the broad principles that we hope the judge will take into account when she makes her ruling haven't been addressed," said Mr. Rubinfeld, an economics professor at the University of California at Berkeley. "This is not meant to be an attack on Microsoft."
Last June, an appeals court held Microsoft liable for acting illegally to squelch the Netscape Navigator Web browser and the Java programming language of Sun Microsystems to protect its Windows PC operating system monopoly against what it perceived as a nascent threat.
But the court acknowledged that there was no proof that Netscape and Java would in fact have evolved to challenge Windows. And Microsoft has argued that even without its illegal acts, there is little reason to believe that the landscape for computer operating system software would look any different from what it does today. As a result, the company says, it should be subject only to restrictions that relate directly to the specific illegal acts.
The appeals court threw out a lower court judge's order to break up the company, sending the case back to the district court to decide on the appropriate remedy. In November, the Justice Department and nine states agreed to a settlement with Microsoft.
Now Judge Kollar-Kotelly must decide whether that settlement is in the public interest and, separately, whether to impose any of the stiffer penalties proposed by the nine states that have continued the litigation against Microsoft. Closing arguments in that trial are scheduled for tomorrow.
In their brief, the economists contend that strong restrictions on Microsoft's behavior are warranted to deter future monopolists from taking a gamble that they could act illegally because there would not be sufficient proof that such acts made a difference.
"The court should not give the benefit of the uncertainty to Microsoft," Mr. Rubinfeld said.

HEADLINE: No Limit, for Now, on a Dieting Supplement 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17 

 BODY:
In a victory for the food supplement industry, the government has decided to wait for further studies of the popular weight-loss supplement ephedra before deciding whether to limit its use.
 Makers of the popular supplement, also known as ma huang, praised the action while a consumer group said everyone involved in the decision should be fired. 
 But Tommy G. Thompson, secretary of health and human services, said it was not clear whether ephedra is dangerous. 
"It is crucial that we have a full understanding of these dietary supplements," Mr. Thompson said in a statement.
He said that the RAND Corporation, a research organization, would finish a "comprehensive review" of the studies on ephedra and that this would be the basis for further study by the National Institutes of Health.
Makers of the supplement have insisted for years that their product is safe when taken as directed. Ephedra supposedly increases metabolism and can raise the heart rate. It is similar to the pseudoephedrine used in over-the-counter cough, cold and allergy products.
"As the F.D.A. has advised, adverse event reports alone regarding ephedrine-containing dietary supplements do not provide a scientific basis for assessing the safety of these products," Jan Strode, a spokesman for one maker of the supplement, Metabolife, said in a statement.
But Public Citizen, a consumer group that has tried for years to have the products taken off the market, expressed outrage. The announcement "not only fails to ban ephedra dietary supplements but also fails to seriously warn against the use of these products," said Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of the group's health research arm. He added that officials "responsible for this dangerous cowardice" should be fired.
In January, Health Canada, Canada's equivalent of the Food and Drug Administration, expressed concern about excessive doses of ephedra, also known as ephedrine, and asked makers to recall products containing high doses.
The Mayo Clinic Proceedings published a study in January that reviewed reports from 1995 to 1997 about adverse reactions to ephedra and found some serious reactions even at recommended doses. The study found 11 sudden deaths, 16 strokes and 10 heart attacks in patients who took products containing ephedrine.
The Department of Health and Human Services said the F.D.A. was strengthening its system for encouraging doctors and consumers to report any health problems possibly related to a drug or supplement.
"These products are not for everyone," said Dr. Lester Crawford, deputy commissioner at the food and drug agency.
No one under 18 should take ephedra, nor should pregnant women, nursing mothers, people taking certain drugs or patients with diabetes, glaucoma or heart disease.
In 1997, the food and drug agency proposed limiting doses of ephedra and taking other steps to restrict its use. It withdrew the proposals in 2000 after industry groups and a Congressional audit said they were not supported by scientific evidence.

HEADLINE: U.S. Criticizes Israel's New Electronic Fence Along West Bank 

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, June 17 

 BODY:
As President Bush headed into final consultations on new proposals for Middle East peace, the White House and the State Department offered veiled criticism today about Israel's construction of a new security fence on the West Bank, warning that it should not constitute unilateral declaration of a border.
 The State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said Israel's precise intentions in building the new electronic security fence remained unclear, but added, "To the extent that it is an attempt to establish a border, we would have to say that really has to be done through direct talks." 
 For months the administration has urged Israel to reduce barriers to Palestinians' movement in order to relieve high unemployment and a looming social crisis in their territories. Today Mr. Boucher said, "We do remind the Israelis that offering hope to Palestinians, offering them a decent life, an end to the barriers, is an important part of achieving security and peace." 
Laura Bush, in a rare comment on foreign policy, said on the American Urban Radio Network, "I don't know that a fence will be some longlasting sign of peace."
But in remarks at the National Press Club here, Israel's transportation minister, Ephraim Sneh, a retired general, said the fence was intended to defend against infiltration from the West Bank. "The purpose is to make the penetration of suicide bombers to Israel impossible," he said. 
Senior administration officials have long been skeptical that a barrier dividing Israel from the Palestinian areas would be practical, and a White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, also distanced the administration from Israel's decision. "Israel has a right to defend itself," he said, "but all parties have to be aware of the consequences of their actions."
Mr. Bush continued today to fine-tune his proposals for stepping up peace efforts, meeting with Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and others in anticipation of an announcement as soon as Wednesday.
Details of the plan remain unclear, including the date and venue of an international peace conference envisioned for this summer. But officials familiar with the president's recent talks with Arab leaders have said Mr. Bush has resolved to support some form of Palestinian state to give immediate hope to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza -- an idea Israel opposes. 
Progress toward final statehood would be linked to reform of Palestinian institutions, but the short-term goal is to revive serious peace talks.
Mr. Bush acknowledged the difficulty of settling such questions today by again suspending the building of an American embassy in Jerusalem, invoking a legal provision saying such a move was not consistent with national security. 
During Mr. Bush's election campaign, he said he would move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, which Israel claims as its capital. In a message today informing Congress of the further delay, Mr. Bush said he remained "committed to beginning the process of moving our embassy to Jerusalem." Successive administrations have debated such a move for decades.
Over the weekend Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said it was still premature to declare even an interim Palestinian state, and the reaction of Palestinian and Arab officials to the idea has ranged from cool to dismissive. Administration officials said today that it was by no means certain that Mr. Bush would back the idea.
"I would not think the Palestinian state is the centerpiece," one senior official said. "The key issues are: there needs to be reform of Palestinian institutions, there needs to be direct discussion between the parties, there needs to be international participation in the process and there needs to be some idea of how and when this produce can produce results."
Israeli and Palestinian officials also await word from Mr. Bush. "We know what went in, now we're going to see what comes out" of the process, one Israeli diplomat said.
Among the ideas bubbling up was a new proposal presented to Secretary Powell on Friday by Nabil Shaath, a top Palestinian cabinet minister. While repeating many longstanding Palestinian positions, it also appeared to show some softening on tough issues like the return of refugees and control of Jerusalem, American officials said.
"It's encouraging to see that the Palestinians are looking at how two states can live side by side," one senior administration official said, describing the proposal as a conciliatory effort to an administration that has been deeply skeptical of the Palestinian leadership. "But it's important to remember that the president and the secretary have been hearing from a lot of people."
In an interview with The San Jose Mercury News, Mr. Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, said no Palestinian state could spring from the current Palestinian Authority, which she said "is corrupt and cavorts with terror."
That drew a sharp response today from Yasir Arafat, who said during a tour of schools in Ramallah, "We are doing what we see as good for our people and we do not accept any orders from anyone.

HEADLINE: Afghan Leader Vows Political Reforms and War on Corruption 

BYLINE:  By CARLOTTA GALL 

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, June 17 

 BODY:
Afghanistan's newly elected president, Hamid Karzai, laid out his plans for government to the 1,600 delegates of the grand council today, promising to defend them against intimidation and to reform the intelligence service and judicial systems.
 His speech went some way toward mollifying delegates, who have been voicing frustration at the lack of progress on other important issues since the grand council, or loya jirga as it is called, voted overwhelmingly last Thursday for Mr. Karzai to be leader of a new two-year transitional administration. 
 Mr. Karzai already faces a phenomenal task to make his country capable of feeding itself again and to rebuild its shattered economy and infrastructure. Today he promised to do much more, proposing fundamental reform in almost every government department that would remove the old Soviet-based system and create a modern, Western-style government of democratic control and accountability. 
He announced he was forming commissions to oversee the civil service, the judiciary, foreign aid, the media, foreign trade and business, human rights, and private property. Mr. Karzai also promised to return to the loya jirga on Tuesday with details of his cabinet, which is the burning issue for most delegates here. 
The foreign minister, Abdullah, said that within the next day or two Mr. Karzai would present the loya jirga with his decisions on major posts, including ministers of defense, interior, finance, justice and possibly foreign affairs.
Mr. Karzai suggested that some delegates should remain in the capital after the loya jirga ends, to take more time to decide how to form a national assembly. 
The loya jirga, which has run already for seven days, was scheduled to end today. United Nations staff members who have helped organize the event said they now expected it to end on Wednesday.
Mr. Karzai began his speech by denouncing incidents of intimidation against delegates that he said had been brought to his notice. "If you are under pressure come and tell me," he said. "If I do not act on that, then you can tell me to leave my post."
He promised important reform of the military and the intelligence service, and said a military commission and a national security commission would be formed to ensure that the armed forces would serve the interests of the people.
"Afghanistan has a great need for a national army, an army that all the people can trust, an army that can defend all the borders of Afghanistan and that will serve in the defense of Afghans," he said. 
Foreign countries, including the United States, were already helping build and train the Afghan National Army, and a military commission would oversee its development, he said. He also vowed to change Afghanistan's intelligence service, which retains strong elements of its K.G.B.-style predecessor, the Khad, which he said in its time had killed thousands of people and caused many to live in fear. 
"We should have an intelligence service that people are not afraid of, that works according to the law and cannot go into people's houses without permission and take people and put them in jail," he said. "They should work for the country against terrorism, and I promise, the intelligence service of Afghanistan will work for you, the people of Afghanistan."
He said he would also work to encourage foreign investment, in part by increasing government transparency and reducing corruption. His judicial reform would include monitoring of judges, Mr. Karzai said, and the prosecutor's office would be brought under the justice department. 
The law of the land would be according to Islam and Sharia law, he said. But a senior adviser, Ashraf Ghani, said later that Afghanistan was returning to the civil and criminal law established in 1964. He said the government would not enforce punishments like amputation or stoning.

HEADLINE: Critics Christen Ship Project As an Off-Course U.S.S. Pork 

BYLINE:  By LESLIE WAYNE 

 BODY:
Two years ago, with waving flags and hula dancers swaying, the government announced an ambitious program to build two passenger cruise ships -- the first in a United States shipyard since the 1950's -- and provided more than $1 billion in loan guarantees to get the program going.
 It did not hurt that the ships were to be built in the Pascagoula, Miss., shipyard where the father of Trent Lott, the Republican Senate minority leader, once worked. As a result, Senator Lott became one of the strongest supporters of the program, which was named Project America. 
 Today, the project is being derided as an example of political pork gone wrong. What remains of Project America is an unfinished hull the size of two football fields and pieces for a second ship lying around. The hull is not floatable; it has neither a completed bow or stern; and its future is in doubt. The price to the government for the failed project is $187 million -- money the government is trying to recoup by putting the half-finished hull on the market. 
This dismal reality only confirms the worst fears of the project's critics -- and is a far cry from the high hopes of those who backed it. Critics, who call Project America corporate welfare, say it shows the dangers lurking behind the tens of billions in loan guarantees the government has extended to an array of businesses, among them airlines, the housing industry and American exporters.
"This has turned into a corporate welfare debacle," said Stephen Moore, senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a Washington research group that promotes free-market economics. "Congress likes loan guarantees because they do not show up on the budget and appear to be free to taxpayers. Yet there are so many instances, like this one, where the project explodes into the taxpayers' lap."
Who wants to buy a half-finished cruise ship? Not many, it turns out. Not the Navy, which turned down a proposal from a Mississippi congressman to run it as a rest-and-relaxation ship for battle-weary troops. Not commercial cruise lines still trying to lure passengers to existing ships after the terrorist attacks last September. 
"It's very difficult," said Jean E. McKeever, associate administrator for shipbuilding at the Maritime Administration, which is now advertising for buyers. "That's been shown by the lack of a satisfactory response to our ads."
For Project America's Congressional backers, Senator Lott among them, the ships were a way to jump-start the dormant commercial shipbuilding industry. The ships were being built by American Classic Voyages and fell into the government's hands after the company filed for bankruptcy protection last October.
As an extra dollop of support, Congress had passed legislation giving American Classic and the two 1,900-passenger ships a monopoly on the Hawaiian cruise market.
In the critics' corner is Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican, who put Project America on his annual "pork" list. In the meantime, the project's failure is being investigated by the inspector general's office of the Department of Transportation and by the General Accounting Office.
On Senator McCain's side is the Bush administration, which has tried to eliminate the shipbuilding loan guarantee program -- only to be thwarted by Congress. This year, for instance, the administration is asking that the program be given no funds, while a letter is circulating in the Senate seeking $50 million for it. The program is run by the Maritime Administration. 
Between those two points of view lies a seven-story hull sitting under the hot Southern sun, hardly a tantalizing prospect for anyone.
That includes the Navy. The Mississippi Democrat whose Congressional district includes the Pascagoula shipyard, Representative Gene Taylor, led an all-out push this year for the Navy to buy the hull. He even put language into the military appropriations bill encouraging the Navy to do so. Mr. Taylor is a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee.
Mr. Taylor's idea was to turn the hull into a floating military barracks. A cruise ship, the argument went, would give sailors more space and better facilities than many of the barracks where they currently live overseas and would provide the Navy with a quick escape route if anti-American sentiment should build on foreign shores.
In addition, after noting that the Navy had leased the Cunard Princess to provide a floating respite for gulf war troops, Mr. Taylor thought a Navy-owned cruise ship could do the same. 
What tired soldier would not want to enjoy what the Project America ship would offer -- one of 950 staterooms, most with outside balconies; a spa and swimming pool; a 590-seat cabaret lounge; an 840-seat theater; a four-story atrium; and, according to the ship's promotional literature, a "uniquely Hawaiian outdoor performance stage."
"It would be similar to a college dorm," Mr. Taylor said. "In our all-volunteer military, you would have housing with a movie theater, health care and a swimming pool. It would be a floating barracks. It also provides protection against any security threat. Heck, if there are any problems, you can take it beyond the horizon and your troops are safe."
But the Navy declined, saying it needed destroyers and other warships instead.
While Mr. Taylor's proposal might seem lighthearted, his intention is anything but. He wants to keep workers employed at the Pascagoula yard, formally known as the Ingalls Shipyard, and encourage someone -- anyone -- to finish the ship.
"This is America," Mr. Taylor said. "People wait for something to go on sale before they buy. My hunch is a cruise ship company or third-party investor is waiting for the price to get right before buying and finishing it. Taxpayers would be better off if the ships were finished and we got as good a price as possible."
Senator Lott did not respond to requests for comment. 
The Maritime Administration's loan program is intended to support domestic shipyards by guaranteeing the debt issued to finance commercial ship construction. Last year, the agency guaranteed $362 million; in 2000, $885 million.
When a project fails -- as happened after American Classic's bankruptcy filing -- the government steps in to pay off the debtholders. 
In this case, the $187 million went to institutional investors who had bought Project America debt, which became worthless after the American Classic bankruptcy. The largest shareholder and chairman of American Classic is Sam Zell, the Chicago financier who made a fortune as a financial turnaround artist.
Mr. Zell cannot complete the ship and, with the Navy out of the picture, it is hard to see who would buy the hull and pay the millions needed to turn it into the passenger ship it was intended to be. For more than 50 years, all cruise ships have been made in Europe or the Far East, where construction costs are lower and shipyards have pioneered the latest in cruise ship technology. Moreover, the cruise ship industry, while rebounding after Sept. 11, is still looking more to fill existing vessels than to buy new ones. 
"You can't even float the hull out at this point," said Joseph Hovorka, a maritime analyst with Raymond James. "I don't know what anyone would do with it at this point. You wouldn't see a major ship company like Carnival or Royal Caribbean coming in to buy it. There's not a roster of companies out there wanting to build a cruise ship, certainly to take on a project of this size."
Even before Sept. 11, Project America had run into trouble. It had fallen behind schedule and was far over budget. As a result, Northrop Grumman, which owns the shipyard, took a $60 million write-off from it and American Classic lost $100 million. The yard itself will continue to make and repair Navy vessels.
"The project was behind schedule and millions in the hole," said John Graykowski, former administrator of the government's shipbuilding program. "The terrorists' attack masked this reality and perhaps allowed the emperor to maintain his modesty. "
Still, the impact of Sept. 11 was stunning. David Heller, a lawyer for American Classic, said, "You cannot imagine the body blow that 9/11 brought to the whole viability of the project."
For the moment, Northrop Grumman has assigned 350 workers to make the ship floatable while the government looks for a buyer.
At its worst, the Project America hull could be chopped up for scrap. But, with the keel laid, much interior work done, and a large part already built, many feel it would be a shame to reduce it to rubble.
For that reason, Mr. Taylor, the Mississippi congressman, remains optimistic. "It would be a mistake to drag it down to Mexico and scrap it," he said. "That would be the worst of all worlds. I do think that, with time, someone will see its value and will make a cruise ship out of it."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL; 
Hotels Learn the Importance of the Expectations Built Into a Brand Name

BYLINE:  By JOE SHARKEY 

 BODY:
For a while early last year, the gossipy hotel industry cackled with the tale.
 The Marriott hotel chain, eager to polish the image of its most upscale brand, JW Marriott, had taken over the tony Rihga Royal Hotel on West 54th Street in Manhattan and renamed it the JW Marriott New York. 
 The new signs were barely up, the gossips reported gleefully, when a number of show business celebrities who always stayed at the Rihga when they were in New York went into a swoon of the vapors and started canceling reservations. No one in that world, it seems, wanted to have to tell colleagues: "Call me in New York. I'm at the Marriott." 
A few months later, the hotel restored the Rihga Royal name and downgraded the "JW Marriott" to smaller print.
J. W. Marriott Jr., the soft-spoken chief executive of Marriott International, the hotel company founded in 1957 by his parents, winced when asked why during a recent lunch in New York. "Branding is very important," is all Mr. Marriott would say about the Rihga Royal's/JW Marriott's adventures with snob response.
It sure is. As hotel companies have gobbled up competitors over the last decade, creating giant corporate umbrellas over a hodgepodge of names, it has become more important than ever to distinguish one name from another. At the high end, social cachet is all important. In most segments, customers demand predictable levels of service and price. But whether it is for a budget motel on Interstate 95 or a luxury palace in Tokyo or New York, establishing a brand identity within a clearly defined market niche has become the most important component of marketing to business travelers.
"They want to do business with brands they trust," said Bala Subramanian, a senior marketing executive for the Hilton Hotels Corporation in Beverly Hills, Calif., which established the Hilton brand in the 1950's and more recently acquired an array of brands, including Doubletree, Embassy Suites and Hampton Inn. 
Trust, in the industry's view, is a customer's belief that a certain brand will consistently deliver a dependable product fit for a specific, well-defined travel need. That product can range from a comfortable but cheap roadside room with a work desk, two phone lines and a free breakfast in the lobby to an opulent downtown hotel with a luxury name.
Right now, some of the most intensive competition is at the top end, where entrenched American icons like the Ritz-Carlton and the Four Seasons are being aimed at by foreign chains that hope to win over younger, freer-spending business travelers with more sumptuous design, more lavish service and more cutting-edge technological products like wireless Internet access on wide plasma-screen monitors.
When many of the world's traditional top-name hotels were built in the first half of the last century, their business clientele tended to be "men aged 60 or up," said Juergen Bartels, the chief executive of London-based Le Meridien Hotels and Resorts, which is owned by Nomura International, the Japanese company, and operates 144 luxury hotels in 55 countries.
"Today, the demographics have completely changed" in the top end of the business, he said, with the clientele becoming younger and more female. "And the farther away a customer goes, the less price-sensitive he or she is," Mr. Bartels said. To capture that customer, he has introduced a $1.2 billion, three-year program to remake Le Meridien into what he called "a marketing-driven company that uses high-quality, art-and-high-tech design and the best-trained staff."
At the same time, hotel companies with well-established American brands in the upscale category just below the highest luxury level, like Hyatt International, are moving to burnish their image abroad.
Hyatt International has been opening its top-level Hyatt Grand hotels in world "gateway cities," especially in Asia, while at the same time opening more boutique-like Hyatt Park hotels in other prime locations, said John Wallis, Hyatt International's senior vice president for marketing. Hyatt International, which now has 60 hotels and 22 resorts in 38 countries, has another 17 hotels in development, including a 122-room Hyatt Park hotel scheduled to open in July at the Place Vendome in Paris.
Another high-end hotel company, Wyndham International, has been aggressively promoting its brand to frequent business travelers through a customer-loyalty program that allows repeat customers to choose various personal services and amenities, and another program that encourages the growing number of female business travelers to regard Wyndham as women-friendly.
Recently, Wyndham also began offering free, unlimited long-distance telephone calls to members of its ByRequest program, responding to what it said was severe dissatisfaction about hotel phone fees among travelers.
Next, responding to widespread dissatisfaction about sky-high prices for food and drink items in many hotel minibars, Wyndham is considering a drive to promote in-room minibars with reasonable prices, said Fred Kleisner, the chairman and chief executive. "I just don't think you should have to pay $15 for a can of peanuts," Mr. Kleisner said.
Across the board, hotels are becoming ever more rigidly segmented by class. Besides the activity in the high-end scrum, dozens of brands compete furiously in several levels of the highway motel business, from the cheapest motel to the all-suites properties with extensive workstation amenities in rooms that appeal to business travelers who usually go by car. Others compete for the lucrative convention and meetings business.
All of these market niches were rattled by the souring of the economy last year and by the terrorist attacks that curtailed business travel for a time and prompted a shift to trains and cars from planes for shorter trips. As a result of the changes in business-travel behavior, big hotel chains have been scrambling to negotiate long-term contracts with corporate buyers based on the chains' abilities to offer volume discounts over a wide range of brands.
All of this busy marketing comes against a gloomy backdrop. While hotel fortunes have been slowly improving since the winter, last year was by all accounts a disaster. In the United States, average hotel profits were off 19.4 percent, the first drop since 1991 and the sharpest since 1938, according to PKF Consulting's Hospitality Research Group.
Any recovery will come niche by niche, hotel analysts say. Last year, for example, limited-service hotels, like the big highway chains, fared best in a bad climate, with profits off only 9.4 percent. Convention hotels, clustered in about 25 big cities dependent on air travel, suffered the most, with earnings down 24.3 percent, PKF said.
On the other hand, with business travel back up, "the upper-upscale and upscale segments" have been experiencing a "significant rebound in demand," according to a recent report by Bjorn Hanson, the chief hotel researcher for PricewaterhouseCoopers.
Hilton Hotels aims each of its brands at a specific market niche, from the highway traveler to the corporate executive on an important big-city visit. In many cases, the same customer will stay at a full-service Hilton on some occasions, and a limited-service roadside Hampton Inn on others, said Mr. Subramanian, the company's marketing executive.
In any case, said Adrian Kurre, the senior vice president for brand management at the Hilton-owned Waldorf-Astoria, whether staying at the Waldorf or a motel by the Interstate, "The most important thing a business traveler wants today is consistency."
