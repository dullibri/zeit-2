HEADLINE: Their Daily Bread Is a Local Call Away

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS

 BODY:
SKOWHEGAN, Me.
THE 250 farmers, bakers, millers, scientists and just plain eaters, all of them fanatics about the kind of bread that is so good it doesn't need butter or jam, gathered here last month for the fourth annual Kneading Conference. They spent two days at the fairgrounds talking about locally grown, mostly organic grains -- and how, after 100 years of neglect, breads made from them are beginning to pop up, in limited quantities, nationwide.
There were plenty of freshly baked loaves, hot out of an assortment of portable bread ovens, to persuade the uninitiated that nothing tastes as good as bread made from richly flavored varieties of grain.
The Kneading Conference is part of a quiet revolution whose center is Skowhegan, a town in central Maine that produced enough grain in the 1830s to feed 100,000 people. As interest in local food has risen, federal and state agriculture departments are underwriting experiments to find the best varieties of wheat, and artisanal bakers are eagerly trying the flours they produce. But it is the conference that has helped turn the scattered movement into the next new thing for locavores, and the practical topics discussed this year -- building more gristmills, making old farm manuals available -- reveal its progress from infancy to adolescence. 
The demand for local grain is being fueled by bakers, who are responding to requests, often insistent ones, from customers. Michael Scholz of the Albion Bread Company in Albion, Me., started baking with local flour in 2004, selling the bread at a farmers' market. ''I never have enough,'' he said. ''I have people in tears. One 80-year-old lady screamed at me: 'Who took the last five baguettes? You louse, you louse.' ''
Michael Richard, a documentary videographer from Maine, explained the phenomenon less colorfully: ''We're just blown away by the quality of the bread,'' he said. ''It's nuttier. It has more taste and more texture.'' Unlike commodity wheat grown in the Midwest, for which consistency and yield are the primary considerations, local wheat is selected for nutrition and taste.
At first, farmers were skeptical of local grains, said Jim Amaral, who owns three Borealis Breads stores in Maine and began using local flour in 1994.
''But the patrons have always been very, very supportive,'' he added. Today, 10 to 20 percent of the wheat in Mr. Amaral's breads is local.
Heather Darby, an agronomist at the University of Vermont, is its coordinator for a joint program with the University of Maine to find the best grain for northern New England. ''The interest in local food in the last two years has put a spotlight on what we are doing,'' she said.
That attention didn't happen overnight. Jack Lazor, a farmer in Westfield, Vt., has been growing wheat since 1977 and selling it to local food co-ops. Today, he provides them with 600 to 1,000 pounds of flour weekly. His and other local farms, like Grassland Farm, supported the conference.
Many bakers are now deep into local grains as well. Orwasher's Bakery in Manhattan is selling Ultimate Whole Wheat, from a farm in the Finger Lakes region. Wheatberry Bakery in Amherst, Mass., started a community-supported agriculture group for grains two years ago: it now has 175 members. David Mostue, who owns an old pear orchard in Medford, Ore., will offer a community-supported agriculture group for grains and other storage crops this winter. And in Vermont, the Red Hen Baking Company in Middlesex is selling a Vermont loaf named for Cyrus Pringle, a wheat breeder and native son. Some champions of local grain look to it not just for nutrition and taste, but also to help make food supplies secure and reduce energy costs.
Fred Kirschenmann, an organic farmer and a distinguished fellow at the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture at Iowa State University, told the Kneading Conference that industrial farming must eventually change. ''It is not possible to maintain the current system,'' he said.
The main problem, as he sees it, is the cost of energy, but others include the decreasing availability of water and a less stable climate.
King Arthur Flour, a 220-year-old company in Norwich, Vt., which sells Vermont Grains -- its first, and for now only, bread made from Vermont flour -- helped finance this year's conference.
''We can no longer have foodstuff grown thousands of miles away,'' said Tod Bramble, national sales director for the company's bakery flour. ''We have to get ready for a time when it won't be a viable option.''
Stephen Jones, director of the Washington State University Research and Extension Center in Mount Vernon, said: ''We have to decentralize grain growing. The price of grain for Maine and Washington State should not be determined in Minneapolis, Kansas City or Chicago, where grain futures are traded. When the cost of wheat skyrocketed in 2008, it had nothing to do with shortages.''
The attendees also discussed more immediate concerns, like the shortage of seeds for old varieties of grain, the high cost of new farming equipment and, on the East Coast, the scarcity of old equipment that can be refurbished. Some were worried about a lack of information about ''lost'' grains and how to grow them, but Dr. Jones said his lab had found almost all the old Agriculture Department pamphlets and had put them online.
For small farmers who want to grow more grain, the lack of gristmills is another serious obstacle. There were once 10,000 in northern New England. Today, the closest mill to Skowhegan is three hours away.
Amber Lambke, the driving force behind the Kneading Conference, is working to change that. With Mr. Scholz of the Albion Bread Company, she bought an unoccupied 1863 county jail for $65,000, with their own money, gifts and grants. They need to raise another $300,000, but slowly the jail is becoming a gristmill, as well as a center for sustainable agriculture and a farmers' market.
The conference grew out of Ms. Lambke's desire to help down and out Skowhegan, where she moved when she married a local doctor. But the town is not an unlikely place for such a gathering. Before railroads made it possible to buy grain cheaply from the Midwest, Maine grew plenty.
Grain-growing there is spreading. Three years ago, the Skowhegan area had 2 grain farmers; today, there are 22.
One aim of the conference, Dr. Jones said, is to let people know they are not alone. This is especially true of farmers as they face the big growers who -- perhaps a trifle concerned about the trend -- tell them not to bother with local grains because they can provide any kind of flour that anyone wants.
The movement has other worries, like price. Growing local grain is labor-intensive and usually organic, meaning cheap pesticides are not an option, and it is done on a small scale, meaning it lacks the economies of agribusiness. And while local grain will not be traded on the commodities market, it will still most likely be affected by commodity prices.
Another concern -- one that is foremost for King Arthur and other commercial bakeries -- is the consistency of local flour. Until there is more local grain available, there is no way to judge that consistency. But neither artisanal bakers nor home bakers see consistency as a problem. ''You can adjust if you know what you are doing,'' said Kendra Michaud, a baker from Montville, Me. Michael Jubinsky, of the Stone Turtle Baking and Cooking School in Lyman, Me., agreed. ''It's a learning curve,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Winners of Aid For Education Are Mostly in the East

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
When Secretary of Education Arne Duncan announced on Tuesday the latest states to win the Race to the Top competition -- and a share of $3.4 billion in federal financing -- he said they were chosen because they outlined the boldest plans for shaking up their public school systems.
But others noted another common denominator: geography. 
Of the dozen states that have won major grants to date in the two-part grant contest that is the Obama administration's signature education initiative, 11 are east of the Mississippi and most hug the East Coast, including Florida and Georgia in the South and New York and Massachusetts in the North. Among the winners, Hawaii is the lone geographic exception.
Educators in many of the states that did not win, or did not even participate in the competition -- which includes every state from Tennessee west to the Pacific -- said they were hamstrung from the outset.
They said the competition's rules tilted in favor of densely populated Eastern states, which tend to embrace more the ideas that Washington currently considers innovative, including increasing the number of charter schools and firing principals in chronically failing schools.
But those rules have seemed a poor fit for the nation's rural communities and sparsely populated Western regions, experts said.
In small towns, for example, there is often just one school, so setting up a parallel charter school might not be feasible. It can also be hard to attract principals to such communities. And many of rural states do not have the resources or staff to write sophisticated grant applications.
''This whole effort had more of an urban than a rural flavor,'' said Armando Vilaseca, commissioner of education of Vermont, whose state did not participate in either round of Race to the Top.
Congress appropriated more than $4 billion for the competition in last year's economic stimulus program. Delaware won $100 million and Tennessee won $500 million in Round 1 in March. The 10 winners of the competition's second round were the District of Columbia (which was treated as a state for its application), Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, Ohio and Rhode Island.
Mr. Duncan has distributed all but about $75 million of the $3.4 billion that remained to Tuesday's winners, and was still deciding what to do with the remaining money, he said.
Mr. Duncan apportioned the latest awards according to the number of students in each state. New York and Florida each won $700 million; Georgia, North Carolina and Ohio won $400 million; Massachusetts and Maryland won $250 million; and Rhode Island and the District of Columbia won $75 million.
''The creativity and innovation in each of these winning applications is breathtaking,'' Mr. Duncan said.
In both rounds, Mr. Duncan selected the winning states after judges assigned a rank to each state's proposal.
The competition was designed to reward what President Obama considers exemplary educational ideas and practice, in hopes that other states will adopt similar practices.
The president's goals include expanding the number and quality of charter schools, updating the way school districts evaluate teachers' effectiveness, improving student data-tracking systems to help educators know what students have learned and what must be retaught, and turning around thousands of the lowest-performing schools.
States earned points if they raised their standards and the rigor of standardized tests. Dozens of states responded to that incentive by adopting common standards in English and math written over the last year at the request of the National Governors Association.
Colorado and Louisiana were not among the winners, even though both states endured divisive legislative battles to change education laws in ways favored by the administration, to improve their chances of winning Race to the Top money.
Many experts had considered those two states sure winners.
''This list of states raises questions for me about the criteria,'' said Frederick M. Hess, a director at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative research group who has followed the competition closely. ''I'm just puzzled. I'm sure this is giving the administration heartburn.''
Mr. Duncan apologized to both Colorado and Louisiana in the conference call announcing the winners, saying he was ''very sorry'' that Colorado would go unrewarded and ''I'm deeply disappointed that we weren't able to fund Louisiana.''
Asked whether he was concerned that almost all of the winning states were Eastern, Mr. Duncan noted that Hawaii was among the winners. ''We went as far west as we could go,'' Mr. Duncan said. ''We want to work with Western states. Geography was irrelevant.''
Of the 11 states that declined to participate in one round or the other, many said that they considered the rules stacked against them. All are rural or Western except Maryland, which declined to participate in the first round: Alaska, Maine, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Vermont and Washington.
But some rules governing other federal money are stacked in their favor. For example, most federal education money flows to states, using formulas that give rural ones more federal financing per student than their big urban counterparts.
One aspect of the rules that especially rankled rural areas was a four-part federal menu of strategies for turning around failing schools, three of which included firing the principal.
This month Mr. Vilaseca, the Vermont commissioner, along with colleagues from Alaska, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming, wrote to Mr. Duncan criticizing the idea.
''Replacing the principal in the most rural of communities does nothing to build the leadership capacity of these small schools, where recruitment and retention is a continual problem,'' the 10 rural educators wrote.
They also objected to the focus on charter schools; competing states were rewarded with 40 points -- out of 500 possible points -- for encouraging more charter schools.
''We have many small towns with one public school, elementary through high school, that has less than 200 students, so the numbers aren't there to justify creating charter schools,'' said Dan Guericke, director of the Mid-Central Educational Cooperative in South Dakota, who helped assemble that state's Race to the Top application for the first round.
After South Dakota placed last in Round 1, the state decided not to reapply, Mr. Guericke said.
Grant-writing is a third area in which rural states were at a competitive disadvantage, he said. Many of the winning states spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on professional writers, drawn from consulting groups like McKinsey, to prepare applications that in many cases ran to more than 500 pages.
South Dakota's application was written by a full-time school teacher and a community volunteer, Mr. Guericke said.

HEADLINE: Racial Patterns Are Found in Recent School Budget Elections

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS; Nate Schweber contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Voters in most school districts in New York State passed proposed budgets this year, but in some of the places where the budgets failed or where they were narrowly approved, a revealing correlation emerged.
Budgets tended to fare worse in districts with a large number of white voters and a large number of nonwhite students. And in the four districts in the state where the majority of registered voters are white and nonwhite students make up the majority of the school population, the budgets were defeated.
To be sure, the statewide pattern was not repeated in every district. Other factors influenced the outcomes, and budgets were also defeated in the three districts where blacks and Hispanics constitute most of the eligible voters as well as the students. 
Still, sociologists say the outcome suggests the possibility of a growing demographic divide over public policy -- school spending, in particular -- that has been identified elsewhere in the country between an older, white electorate and a population of voters who are younger and members of minority groups.
''In New York, it appears that white voters in districts with large numbers of minorities, and minority voters themselves, often voted against school spending increases,'' said Andrew A. Beveridge, a Queens College sociologist who analyzed the budget vote results for The New York Times. ''This very well might undercut educational opportunities for such minorities, while depressing property values in districts with a substantial share of minorities. It may increase the statewide gap between blacks and whites in both school performance and wealth.''
Robert B. Ward, deputy director of the Rockefeller Institute of Government in Albany, said: ''The aging of the population clearly will be an increasingly important factor in the politics of school finance in the coming decade or two. It could very well play some role next year when the Legislature is confronted with saying yes or no to a property tax cap.''
An analysis in 2007 by the Population Reference Bureau concluded that states with a large number of white voters and a large number of public schools serving mostly nonwhite students tended to spend less on schools than states in which voters and students were of similar ethnic makeup.
In May, New York voters approved about 92 percent of school district budgets, compared with 97 percent the year before. (In the state's biggest cities, school spending is part of the municipal budget.)
In Poughkeepsie, where nearly 85 percent of the students are black or Hispanic and about 60 percent of the eligible voters are white, ''it was the first time our budget failed,'' said Ellen Staino, president of the Board of Education. ''We do try very hard to reach out to get involvement in voting, but there does seem to be more voter turnout from the white population than from the Hispanic or African-American population,'' she said. ''It is in everyone's best interest to support education to maintain a well-educated society.''
Proposed budgets were defeated in the three other districts -- East Ramapo, Ossining and Schenectady -- where the majority of eligible voters are white and the majority of students are not.
A number of local school officials said that with so many younger residents moving away, a big political factor in school budget votes, regardless of race, was the large number of older voters who did not have school-age children.
In East Ramapo, which has a growing Hasidic population and where most public school students are not white, Nathan Rothschild, the president of the Board of Education, said, ''Economics is a bigger factor when the majority of voters do not have children in public schools.''
Ira Oustatcher, the schools superintendent, said: ''The balance is what's the best you can do and your community can afford. It really has never become a racial issue here.''
In Wyandanch on Long Island, where a majority of both eligible voters and students are black or Hispanic, Rodney Caines, the Board of Education vice president, also cited the age gap. (The budget lost there and in Mount Vernon and Westbury, where most students and voters are nonwhite.) ''I wouldn't necessarily say it's racial,'' he said, ''but what you're left with are older residents who no longer have students in the district.''
In New Jersey, where a majority of school budgets were rejected this year for the first time since 1976, a different pattern emerged. With Gov. Chris Christie ''capping state spending on education,'' Dr. Beveridge said, ''voters in wealthy districts approved budgets that not only lead to better education for their kids, but to higher real estate values.''

HEADLINE: Led by Germany, Manufacturing in Europe Is Stronger Than Expected

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS -- Euro zone manufacturers met with unexpectedly strong demand for industrial goods in June, a report showed Tuesday, suggesting Germany's export-driven factories will continue to strengthen output -- even as the American economy slows and fears linger that the debt crisis could return to hamper the Continent's recovery.
Eurostat reported from Luxembourg that industrial new orders in the 16 countries sharing the euro rose 2.5 percent in June from May, and 22.6 percent from June 2009. Excluding the volatile transportation-related sector, orders grew 1.6 percent from May. Demand for capital goods was the largest component of the increase, rising 5.3 percent in June. 
Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News had expected overall June orders to rise about 1.5 percent.
The report came as the German government said gross domestic product expanded 2.2 percent in the second quarter from the first quarter, confirming its earlier estimate, showing growth well above its European peers and the fastest pace of expansion since East and West Germany were reunified in 1990.
German exports rose 8.2 percent in the quarter, aided by the 12 percent decline in the euro against the dollar this year. That juggernaut performance helped the overall euro area economy to grow by 1 percent in the second quarter, Eurostat, the European Union's statistics office, said Aug. 13, the fastest in four years.
''The upswing in Germany has much more solid basis than people thought,'' Ralph Solveen, an economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said. Overseas demand is still the main driver, he said, but investment in machinery and equipment has also risen, and even private consumption -- which rose 0.6 percent for its first gain in a year -- ''is looking a little better.''
''There's a good chance that we'll see an ongoing recovery of the German economy,'' Mr. Solveen said, ''but we can't be sure that will be true for all of Europe.
''And the pace of growth will likely slow, because what we've seen was at least partly a countermovement to the sharp drop after the Lehman Brothers shock, which might now run out,'' he added, referring to the bankruptcy of the investment bank in September 2008 that is widely thought to have exacerbated the global financial crisis.
In the factory report, Eurostat also revised upward May's figure to show a 4.1 percent rise from April, compared with the 3.8 percent rise it previously reported.
The data, which are seen as a leading indicator because they refer to orders received but not completed, added to the picture of a relatively solid economy, in line with Markit's euro zone flash composite purchasing managers' index Monday that showed services and manufacturing activity at 56.1 in August, down from 56.7 in July, but still above 50, the dividing line between growth and contraction.
The German Federal Statistics Office also reported Tuesday that the government deficit had reached 3.5 percent of G.D.P. in the first six months, above the 3 percent limit dictated by the so-called Maastricht criteria for membership in the euro.
While investors have little doubt that Chancellor Angela Merkel's government, which projects the deficit will rise to 4.5 percent of G.D.P. this year, can handle its spending, the announcement served as a reminder of the precarious state of public finances across the Continent.
Like other European governments, Germany has said it will move aggressively to cut the gap, even at the risk that doing so will weigh on growth.
The debt concerns, which were partly allayed in May after aggressive intervention by European leaders and by the European Central Bank, have continued to simmer throughout the summer.
The yield on Greek 10-year government bonds has climbed back to around 10.9 percent, despite central bank purchases on the secondary market; that is down from the May 7 peak of 12.4 percent, but shows steady upward movement since their recent low of 6.1 percent on March 17.
German bond yields, on the other hand, fell to new lows. The 10-year bund fell to 2.18 percent from 2.28 Monday.
Mr. Solveen attributed the move to fears that the United States might fall back into recession and expectations that major central banks would keep rates at ultralow levels for some time.
He said the main risks to the European economy were external, the possibility that Asian growth would slow substantially or that the United States would enter a double-dip recession. While the sovereign debt issue remains on the minds of investors, Mr. Solveen said, it was probable that it would remain subdued for the rest of this year.
One prominent economist, the Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, argued Tuesday in a radio interview that the focus on deficit reduction was exaggeratedly counterproductive.
''Cutting back willy-nilly on high-return investments just to make the picture of the deficit look better is really foolish,'' Bloomberg News quoted Mr. Stiglitz as telling RTE radio in Ireland.
''Because so many in Europe are focusing on the 3 percent artificial number, which has no reality and is just looking at one side of a balance sheet, Europe is at risk of going into a double-dip,'' Mr. Stiglitz said.

HEADLINE: Growth of Japanese Exports Slows for 5th Straight Month

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's export growth slowed for a fifth straight month in July, the government said Wednesday.
The value of exports climbed 23.5 percent from a year earlier, to 5.98 trillion yen, ($71 billion) the Finance Ministry said. Exports expanded 27.7 percent in June and 32.1 percent in May. 
Cooling global demand poses a major risk for Japan's export-driven recovery. With demand lackluster at home, the country has depended on high-growth countries like China to fuel its economy.
The latest figures come as the country faces the growing threat of a strong yen, which hit a new 15-year high against the dollar Monday.
An appreciating yen shrinks the value of repatriated profits for exporters like the Toyota Motor Corporation and the Sony Corporation and makes their products less competitive overseas.
Japan's economy grew at an annualized rate of just 0.4 percent in the April-June quarter, losing its place to China as the world's No. 2 economy.
Economists expect exports to continue slowing in the months ahead as governments around the world wind down stimulus measures and focus on controlling spending and debt.
Prime Minister Naoto Kan is expected to develop a new stimulus package and has asked ministry heads for ideas. He spoke with Masaaki Shirakawa, governor of the Bank of Japan, by phone on Monday, though the two disappointed markets by not discussing currency intervention.
Exports to China rose 22.7 percent in July, while those to the United States were up 25.9 percent. Shipments to the European Union expanded 13.3 percent.
Demand for machinery jumped more than 53 percent, and motor vehicle exports rose 27.1 percent.
Imports in July rose 15.7 percent to 5.18 trillion yen ($61.5 billion), resulting in a trade surplus of 804.2 billion yen ($9.5 billion).

HEADLINE: Housing Market Plunged in July, Fueling Anxiety

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
Americans' long infatuation with owning a home, which even the economic collapse of 2008 could not kill, shuddered and stalled last month.
Housing sales in July plunged 25.5 percent below the level of a year ago, the National Association of Realtors said on Tuesday, as buyers lost the spur of a government tax credit. The steep descent surprised nearly every analyst and put the volume of single-family home sales at the lowest level since 1995.
The financial markets took the news badly, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing down 134 points to a six-month low. As investors sought security, the yield on the two-year Treasury note fell to a record low.
Mortgage rates are the lowest in modern memory while affordability, because of price declines of 30 percent in many areas, is the highest in at least a decade. The government is allowing buyers to put only a token amount down, guarantees lenders against default and regularly issues proclamations that the worst is over. 
Apparently, all of that is not enough to put a floor under housing. With unemployment steady for month upon month at more than 9 percent, and with millions heavily in debt or simply skittish, many potential buyers are lost to the market.
No region was immune in July, with sales in the Northeast dropping 30 percent, the Midwest falling by a third, the South down 20 percent and the West off 23 percent.
The report ''shows that there's a lot more work yet to do,'' the White House deputy press secretary, Bill Burton, said at a briefing on Martha's Vineyard, where President Obama is vacationing.
Real estate helped drive this recession, and no one expects it to be a help in getting out. Instead, the urgent question is how much it will drag down other parts of the fragile recovery.
The turmoil in housing, which is likely to lead to further price declines this winter, could send growth in the second half of the year below 1 percent, said Joel L. Naroff, an economist. ''It won't be a double-dip recession but it might feel like it,'' he said.
Analysts had been expecting a drop in July home sales because the month was the first time in a year that buyers were ineligible for the government housing tax credit. But the consensus expectation was for a decline of about 13 percent.
The $8,000 tax credit increased sales and stabilized prices last year, which led Congress to expand and extend the incentive through this spring.
The cost was about $30 billion. Economists said that just as the credit had artificially buoyed the market, the end of the credit was artificially depressing it. ''If you pay them, they will come. But when ya stop paying them, they leave in droves,'' the economist Tom Lawler wrote in an e-mail.
His conclusion: ''People shouldn't panic.''
Those on the front lines of real estate describe an unusual standoff between buyers, who can afford to be fickle as rarely before, and sellers, who feel they cannot go lower. For many sellers, agents say, another 5 percent would mean taking a loss.
''What few buyers are out there circle a listing like a vulture, waiting from the day of its debut until it's left for dead,'' said Glenn Kelman, chief executive of the online brokerage Redfin. Then, he said, they might make a low-ball bid.
Mr. Kelman said that what made the sales drop ''even more breathtaking'' was that it was happening in July, which is typically when demand peaks. Sales were down 27.2 percent from the rate in June.
Over the last 20 years, sales of existing homes have averaged about 4.9 million a year. The sales volume in July equates to an annual rate of 3.83 million.
''Truly gut-wrenching,'' said Jennifer H. Lee, senior economist for BMO Capital Markets.
Mr. Lawler, whose forecast for July was much more accurate than his colleagues' estimates, said housing would truly be healthy only when there was enough employment growth to spur the creation of new households. For instance, adult children who are living at home will have to get places of their own.
Few think that will be happening any time soon. In the meantime, there will be too many homes on the market, which tends to push down prices as sellers compete.
A normal market has an inventory level of less than six months. While relatively few new sellers put their homes on the market in July, the drop in sales was sufficient to push inventory levels up to 12.5 months. That exceeds any level since records were first collected in 1999.
Prices have been stable for much of the last year, a trend largely due to the tax credit. The Realtors' group said Tuesday that the median existing-home price for all housing types was $182,600 in July, up 0.7 percent from a year ago.
Most housing experts think prices will fall another 5 to 10 percent this winter. That makes this a miserable time for those who want to sell, not to mention those who do not want to be reminded that the walls sheltering them are worth a tiny bit less each day. But it is quite a hopeful moment for buyers who have waited patiently through the bust and have a bit of nerve.
Jimmy and Lisa Penz looked for a condo in Chicago when they got married in 2007 but could not make the finances work. Last year, when Lisa was pregnant, they looked again to no avail. Using their emergency cash for a down payment would have been wrong, they thought.
Time was on their side. Next month, the couple and baby Jackson will move into a home in the suburb of Arlington Heights for which they paid a little less than $400,000.
''Because we waited, we were able to afford a fourth bedroom,'' said Mr. Penz, a consultant.
His house, he knows, is ''an illiquid asset, a long-term asset, something I won't be able to tap in for cash. But we chose a place we'll be able to stay for a long time, to ride out any trouble.''
Once upon a time, before everyone from the banks to the buyers to the sellers got greedy, that was how everyone thought about the housing market. And however bumpy the path, that is once again the market's future, said Mr. Kelman of Redfin.
''It's not the apocalypse,'' he said. ''People will buy homes when they need to move or want the house, not when they want to make money. There will be winners and losers -- not just, as in years past, winners and bigger winners.''

HEADLINE: In Debate, 3 Republicans Vie For Chance to Oust Gillibrand

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
SCHENECTADY, N.Y. (AP) -- The three Republicans competing for Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand's seat promoted their credentials as fiscal conservatives, praised the Tea Party movement and attacked the incumbent in a televised debate on Tuesday night. 
Joseph J. DioGuardi, a former Westchester County congressman, Bruce A. Blakeman, a former Long Island lawmaker, and David Malpass, a former Bear Stearns chief economist, are competing for the Republican nomination in the Sept. 14 primary. The winner will face Ms. Gillibrand, a Democrat who is far ahead in polls and fund-raising, in the November general election.
The candidates spent much of the hour criticizing Washington for profligate spending and promising to rein it in if elected. Mr. Blakeman boasted about cutting Nassau County spending. Mr. Malpass said a ''massive upheaval'' was needed in Washington, and Mr. DioGuardi criticized the federal debt.
''We still have Washington spending money we don't have,'' Mr. DioGuardi said in the hourlong debate, which was shown on YNN cable network stations across the state.
They also took aim at each other. Mr. Blakeman said Mr. Malpass was at Bear Stearns when it took bailout money. Both Mr. Malpass and Mr. DioGuardi attacked Mr. Blakeman for a tax increase when he was in the Nassau County Legislature.
But the debate also highlighted what they agreed on. All three said military commanders should weigh in before a decision is made on the ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy on gays in the military. They supported the death penalty. They each said the Tea Party was constructive.
Mr. Blakeman differed from the other candidates in saying that creationism should be taught in public schools.
On global warming, Mr. DioGuardi said he believed in it, Mr. Blakeman said the jury was still out, and Mr. Malpass said he did not believe carbon dioxide created from human activity was warming the planet.
Criticizing Ms. Gillibrand, Mr. Malpass said she voted for too much spending, Mr. DioGuardi called her in lock step with President Obama, and Mr. Blakeman said she had made a ''U-turn'' on gun rights after she moved to the Senate from the House.
Responding to the debate, Ms. Gillibrand's campaign said none of the three were capable of serious solutions to create jobs and improve the economy.

HEADLINE: Burger King Sounds Cautious Note After Income Falls

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Burger King Holdings on Tuesday forecast weak demand for its new fiscal year amid a struggling economy. The chain also said it was unsure how costs for ingredients like beef would affect it. 
Burger King did not issue an earnings forecast for fiscal 2011, but said that high unemployment in the United States and government austerity programs in several European countries would weigh on same-restaurant sales.
The company, which competes with McDonald's and other chains, said it expected commodity costs in the United States to be flat in fiscal 2011, but cautioned that the prices of wheat and beef were uncertain.
Burger King is more vulnerable to a weak job market than McDonald's, the market leader, and Wendy's because young men account for a larger share of its customers. That demographic group has had huge job losses in industries like construction and manufacturing.
Burger King said net income fell to $49 million, or 36 cents a share, in the fourth quarter ended June 30, from $58.9 million, or 44 cents a share, a year earlier.
Analysts on average were expecting earnings of 34 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters.
Burger King said foreign currency exchange rates reduced fourth-quarter earnings by 1 cent a share.
Revenue slipped 1 percent, to $623 million, missing analysts' expectations of $635 million.
Worldwide sales at restaurants open at least 13 months were down 0.7 percent, versus the 0.8 percent fall that analysts expected.
McDonald's global same-restaurant sales were up 4.8 percent for the June quarter; Wendy's reported a 1.7 percent fall in sales at established North America restaurants.
Burger King expects to add 225 to 275 new stores in fiscal 2011, with more than 90 percent of the net restaurant growth to take place outside of the United States and Canada.
Shares in Burger King were up 1.68 percent at $16.90 amid broader market losses because of weak housing data. Some analysts linked the rise to short covering.

HEADLINE: The Customer Always Comes Last

 BODY:
The credit card industry is working hard to subvert the Credit Card Act of 2009, which banned many of the industry's most predatory practices. The Federal Reserve Board, which oversees and coddles this industry, needs to ensure that consumers get the protections Congress intended, and Americans so clearly need. 
The law's final provisions went into effect this week, and if they are vigilantly enforced, they should end many of the abuses that had become standard practice.
It requires card issuers to give a 45-day notice before raising interest rates, bars companies from raising interest rates on existing balances under all but a few circumstances, and requires that late charges and other penalties be ''reasonable and proportional'' to the customer's infraction.
It also bars companies from charging customers upfront fees that come to more than 25 percent of the available credit line. This was intended to put an end to ''fee harvester'' credit cards, under which consumers could be charged hundreds of dollars in fees for cards that left them with credit limits as low as $50.
Watchdog groups say that companies are already eagerly exploiting gray areas in the law, either by concocting new charges or relabeling old, disallowed charges.
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch recently reported the case of an elderly pensioner who was charged $179 in initial fees for a credit card that carried a credit limit of only $250. An executive of First Premier Bank, which issued the card, suggested to the paper that the charge was legal because the new law ''does not preclude fees charged prior to the account being opened.'' That sounds like a scam to us.
The Fed also needs to take a hard look at problems cited last month by the Pew Charitable Trust Safe Credit Cards Project. It found that despite the law's demands for more transparency, card issuers are still withholding important information. Companies are failing to disclose penalty interest charges, which could double or even triple the interest rate for cardholders who fall two months behind.
Time and again, the credit card industry has demonstrated its disdain for its customers. The Fed needs to press these companies to live up to the law.

HEADLINE: In History-Rich Region, a Very New System Tracks Very Old Things

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY; Duraid Adnan contributed reporting from Baghdad.

 BODY:
The field of archaeology and the timeworn Middle East would not seem the obvious places to look for a wiki revolution. But next month in Jordan, officials who oversee that country's vast store of antiquities will begin an experiment aimed at bringing 21st-century tools to the task of protecting ancient sites, which is an especially pressing need in neighboring Iraq, where looting is once again on the rise.
Over the last four years the Getty Conservation Institute in Los Angeles, with financing from the World Monuments Fund and help from the Jordanian Department of Antiquities, has built an ambitious Web-based system that will allow archaeologists and conservators there, for the first time, to gain access to decades' worth of records about Jordan's sites and to monitor the condition of those sites much more easily.
Known by the slightly science-fiction-ish name MEGA -- for Middle Eastern Geodatabase for Antiquities -- the system functions in both English and Arabic, and the information in it is obtained via Google Earth satellite images. These let users find any of Jordan's more than 10,000 sites, from the ancient city of Petra to tiny unearthed remnants from antiquity, like wine presses, threshing floors and burial grounds dating to the Neolithic period. 
While field reports on those sites -- with information about potential threats, like development, livestock or looting -- were previously cataloged on a local database in Jordan, the new Web-based system allows this information to be found and updated much more quickly and easily. The system would not keep tomb robbers away by itself but would allow Jordan -- and other countries, if the system catches on -- to track damage, theft and other changes and to respond with a more efficient use of resources.
''The classic rule in preservation is that you can't preserve something until you know you have it,'' said Timothy P. Whalen, the director of the Getty Conservation Institute, a branch of the J. Paul Getty Trust. ''This kind of tool to do that does not exist anywhere right now.''
The system is scheduled to open in September, but only to authorized users. Many archaeologists say they hope it will eventually become open to a much broader group of scholars and conservators around the world to view and add to, or comment upon, the information in the database.
''It's a kind of openness that is still a very new concept in parts of the Middle East,'' Mr. Whalen said.
Ziad al-Saad, the recently named director general of the Jordanian Department of Antiquities, said in a telephone interview from Amman that the country -- where security and access to official information are touchy topics -- was actively considering making the system freely accessible. ''We want to be able to share what we have here with everyone,'' he said.
He added that he considered the system an important step forward in how antiquities-rich countries like his will safeguard their treasures. ''Tourism is a prime sector of our economy, and our archaeological sites are key to that,'' he said. ''We like to call Jordan an open museum. You find antiquities wherever you go here.''
The project, which cost about $1 million to develop, was not initially intended to begin in Jordan, but in Iraq, where the looting of the National Museum in Baghdad in the wake of the 2003 invasion set off international alarms about the threat to some of the world's oldest artifacts. With so much attention on the museum, Mr. Whalen said, the Getty and some others in the antiquities field decided that they could help most by focusing on the threat to archaeological sites, which were also being cleaned out wholesale by thieves in the chaos after Saddam Hussein's government was toppled.
But the chaos and violence in Iraq ultimately prevented the Getty from being able to work with officials there to create what was originally planned to be a local database program, not one that utilized the Web.
''The idea of shipping a couple of big computers to Iraq and hoping that they would get there and that it would all work just seemed too crazy,'' said Alison Dalgity, a senior project manager at the Getty who helped develop MEGA.
And so the institute accepted an invitation from Jordan to develop the system there first, a plan that coincided with a sea change in Web-based mapping tools and the rise of open-source software, meaning that the system could exist on the Web and be built and updated cheaply.
The need for such a monitoring system in Iraq is dire. The looting of ancient sites has increased again after several years of relative calm, largely because of the withdrawal of American troops and the failure of a new Iraqi antiquities police force, which is vastly understaffed, to step into the breach.
Even Jordan, which has been effective at protecting and preserving its sites, struggles with the incursions of modernity upon antiquity -- among them thieves, construction projects that unearth and destroy mosaics, and unfenced livestock that wander in and damage sites. Ms. Dalgity, who traveled many times to the Middle East over the last several years as the system was being built, said that on her most recent trip to Jordan, in late July she visited the remains of a 1,300-year-old Umayyad palace near Amman, whose frescoes were marred with graffiti.
Last February conservators from the Getty met in Cairo with Iraqi antiquities officials to plan instituting the system in Iraq after it became operational in Jordan. Even though Iraq has stabilized greatly since the Getty first began working to establish a monitoring system, Mr. Whalen said, security problems and shifting lines of bureaucratic authority remain as hurdles to putting the program in place.
''It's still too early to even speculate about it,'' he said, about expanding to Iraq. ''We'll just have to see what kind of stability develops.''
But the official who oversees archaeological sites in Iraq said that from his perspective the country was fully prepared to move ahead as soon as the Getty was ready.
''I think that the security situation makes the other side think twice before they start working,'' Qais Hussein Rashid, the director of the State Board of Antiquities and Heritage in Iraq, said in an e-mail interview. But he added that ''we are ready, our sites are ready, our teams can reach to any point in Iraq,'' and that as soon as the Getty agrees to a memorandum of understanding about the project, ''we will start the very next day.''
Mr. Whalen said that if the program proved effective in the Middle East, it could be easily adapted for use almost anywhere by plugging in different maps and adjusting categories used by local archaeological field teams.
''We could just turn off the Arabic switch,'' he said, ''and even, you know, Canadians could use it if they wanted to.''

HEADLINE: Tastykake Baker Finds a Home in the Revamped Philadelphia Navy Yard

BYLINE: By JEFF SCHLEGEL

 BODY:
PHILADELPHIA -- Tastykake butterscotch Krimpets, fruit pies and other baked goods are as much a part of this city's culinary tradition as cheese steaks and soft pretzels. So when the company that makes them, Tasty Baking, outgrew its longtime plant in North Philadelphia several years ago, there was little question that a new bakery would be inside the city limits.
Tasty Baking joined with economic development officials, the city and the governor to relocate to a neglected corner of the redeveloping Philadelphia Navy Yard, where in May it opened a 345,000-square-foot bakery, packaging and distribution center. The company calls the plant the largest ''green'' bakery in the world because of its efficient water and energy systems, its use of recycled building materials, and other environmentally friendly attributes. 
For the company, whose regional distribution ranges from Ohio to Connecticut to Florida, the move was about increasing both efficiency and production. ''You drive efficiency and then reinvest it into the brand,'' said Tasty Baking's president and chief executive, Charles P. Pizzi. He added that along with another plant in southeastern Pennsylvania, ''we'll have the capacity to go beyond our current distribution.''
The roughly 1,200-acre Navy Yard took shape in the 1870s at the confluence of the Delaware River and the Schuylkill in South Philadelphia. Its zenith came in World War II, when more than 40,000 people built ships there. When the cold war ended and the military downsized operations in the mid-1990s, the site was shut down as part of a wave of base closings.
But the tract has been transformed in subsequent years, and today it is a bustling, mixed-use economic zone with tenants that include old-school industrial plants, a research center, shipbuilding and repair operations and corporate headquarters like those of Urban Outfitters.
Tasty's new plant occupies 25 acres of a 50-acre parcel on the west end of the yard. That area, also referred to as the back end, was once so off the beaten path -- both physically and conceptually -- that it was not included in a development plan prepared by the Philadelphia Industrial Development Corporation, the city's nonprofit economic development arm that took over the site in 2000.
One recent day on the steps leading up to the visitor's mezzanine overlooking a Tastykake production floor, Mr. Pizzi pointed to a large mural of the former plant, a 550,000-square-foot, six-floor building constructed in 1922.
''That's a pretty old building to run a business out of,'' he said. ''Our challenge was moving out of that facility and into this one, which I equate with going from a Ford pickup truck into a Maserati.''
Tasty's former plant had grown inefficient, Mr. Pizzi said, and was limiting the company's ability to grow. The new plant occupies one giant floor where the product lines run in a continuous flow from raw goods to packaging, enabling the company to boost production.
From the mezzanine, which eventually will host public tours, Mr. Pizzi surveyed the seven production lines where stainless-steel machinery cranks out some four million food items a day. A seemingly endless march of bakery products rolled out of ovens and were injected with jelly, smeared with peanut butter and lathered in chocolate icing before heading toward other machines that wrapped them, boxed them and loaded them onto skids to be carted off to the warehouse.
''You can imagine how much more efficient this is than a six-story building,'' Mr. Pizzi said.
Mr. Pizzi, who became Tasty Baking's chief executive in late 2002, said he realized early on that the company needed a new plant. He reached out to the development corporation, the city and Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania to see what kind of deal they could work out to build a modern plant that would keep several hundred manufacturing jobs in the city.
Tasty Baking chose the Navy Yard and selected Liberty Property Trust of Malvern, Pa., to build the plant. Liberty and a minority partner, Synterra Partners of Philadelphia, are developing a 70-acre section of the yard called the Navy Yard Corporate Center. Tasty Baking moved its corporate headquarters there in 2009, and is the anchor tenant of a four-story, 95,000-square-foot building that bears its name.
Liberty and Synterra built the plant for $50 million, and Tasty Baking is leasing the building. To pay for $78 million in equipment, Tasty received $31 million in public financing in the form of loans from the development corporation, the city and the state. A group of four banks, led by Citizens Bank, picked up the balance.
A group of local, state and federal infrastructure funds provided roughly $20 million for new roads and infrastructure on the Navy Yard's west end, which should bring even more development.
Liberty plans to develop a 200,000-square-foot industrial building near the Tasty Baking plant, said John Grady, executive vice president of the Philadelphia Industrial Development Corporation.
But all is not sunshine and cupcakes at the new Tastykake plant, where production problems prevented the company from filling some $1.3 million in orders in the second quarter. ''Getting all of the new equipment in rhythm is going to take time,'' Mr. Pizzi said.
That said, initial returns on the plant -- at least from the industrial development corporation's perspective -- are positive. ''By far, the back end where Tastykake is has gone through the greatest transformation at the Navy Yard,'' said Mark Seltzer, the corporation's director of leasing and development.

A new report on retail prices of brand-name drugs shows the 217 products most used by older Americans increased by an average of 8.3 percent during 2009, the largest increase in years, even as inflation was negative.
Over the last five years, according to the report to be released on Wednesday by the senior lobby AARP, the retail prices for the most popular brand-name drugs increased 41.5 percent, while the consumer price index rose 13.3 percent. An AARP official called for measures to hold down drug prices. 
Drug industry officials challenged the finding, however, saying select brand-name prices did not reflect the reality of more people using low-price generic drugs. Generics now account for about 75 percent of all dispensed prescriptions in the United States, according to IMS Health, a research firm.
The industry pointed to a broader survey of drug prices showing they rose by 3.4 percent during 2009. The survey, conducted by the government for its official Consumer Price Index, includes generic as well as brand-name drug prices, Jonathan Church, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said on Tuesday.
John A. Vernon, an assistant professor of health policy at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, praised the AARP for changing its methods to count retail prices instead of wholesale prices. But Professor Vernon, who had consulted for drug companies and challenged the AARP wholesale price report at a Congressional hearing last year, said its new report was still flawed.
''It can easily be shown that branded prices are higher here than they are in other countries, but we have the lowest and the most competitively priced generic drugs in the world, and the generic share is going up rapidly,'' he said. ''Just focusing on brands I think is unfair.''
John C. Rother, executive vice president for policy and strategy for the AARP, agreed that generic drug prices had held stable or declined. But he said the group's new retail price analysis showed why many older Americans were struggling to pay the cost of brand-name drugs they needed for chronic medical conditions.
AARP has changed the method of its annual drug report to look at retail prices, responding to industry complaints last year that measures of wholesale prices, showing brand-name increases far in excess of inflation, were misleading because they did not consider manufacturer discounts. The new report, however, finds the same result on price.
''Brand-name retail prices have been accelerating year-to-year even when inflation has been nonexistent in the rest of the economy,'' Mr. Rother said in an interview by phone Tuesday.
The incontinence drug Flomax led the way with a 24.8 percent rise in retail price last year, to $4.09 a pill. Flomax sells for $4.42 a pill on drugstore.com, while its generic equivalent, tamsulosin, sells for $3.63 a pill.
Ann Wainwright, a spokeswoman for Boehringer Ingelheim, did not answer questions about Flomax prices in an e-mail, but said the company was committed to access to medicines, including free medication for eligible low-income patients.
The Flomax patent expired this year, opening the gates for generic competition.
During 2009, among the most popular brand-name drugs, retail prices rose 6 percent, to $5.40 a day, on Nexium from AstraZeneca; 8.8 percent, to $5.06 a day, on Plavix from Bristol-Myers Squibb; 7 percent, to $5.50 a day, on Prevacid from Takeda; 6.8 percent, to $4.21 a day, on Protonix from Wyeth; and 4.1 percent, to $4.03, on Lipitor 20-milligram tablets from Pfizer, the report says.
The AARP reported overall increases of 8.3 percent in 2009, 7.9 percent in 2008, 7 percent in 2007, 6.1 percent in 2006, when Medicare drug benefits started, and 6 percent in 2005. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, including generic prices, reported drug price increases for the same years of 3.4, 2.5, 1.4, 4.3 and 3.5 percent. Both used weighted averages to account for product usage.
The AARP report says many older Americans rely on brand-name drugs for chronic illnesses. It says higher prices push them more quickly into a coverage gap known as the ''doughnut hole,'' where they have to pay the full cost of drugs.
That gap is being phased out over the next 10 years under the new health care law, including drug industry discounts on brand-name drug prices in the coverage gap.
The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry trade group in Washington, released a statement on Tuesday saying ''prescription medicines represent a small and decreasing share of growth in overall health care costs in the United States.''
''Not only is the recent rate of growth for prescription medicines historically low, but the recent decline in drug spending growth has contributed to one of the lowest rates of total health care growth in the past 50 years,'' the group said.
The statement cited reports that Medicare drug spending had been far less than initially projected, partly due to generics.

HEADLINE: Establishment Candidates Prevail in Primaries, With Exceptions

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE; Gary Fineout contributed reporting from Naples, Fla., Marc Lacey from Phoenix, Abby Goodnaugh from Boston, Catharine Skipp from Miami and Lloyd Dunkelberger from Altamonte Springs, Fla.

 BODY:
MIAMI -- Incumbent and establishment candidates beat back strong primary challenges, for the most part, on Tuesday in contests in five states across the country.
It was one of the last big nights of the 2010 primary season, before the all-important general election campaign that could decide who controls Congress and, inevitably, the warp and weft of the second half of President Obama's term.
The results proved that in an election season where voter dissatisfaction is running high, established politicians cannot be counted out, even against insurgents who have considerable personal fortunes to bankroll their upstart campaigns.
In arguably the starkest example, the race to be Florida's Democratic candidate for the United States Senate, Kendrick B. Meek, 43, a congressman from Miami, defeated Jeff Greene, a 55-year-old real estate mogul. 
At the same time, in Arizona, Senator John McCain handily dispatched his Republican challenger, J. D. Hayworth, and Gov. Jan Brewer, a Republican, was also victorious, as was Senator Patrick J,. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont.
The most notable exception to the night's dominant theme came in Florida's Republican primary for governor. The wealthy outsider, Rick Scott, 57, a former health care executive whose smiling face became a ubiquitous presence in television spots here, defeated Attorney General Bill McCollum, 66.
Both the Senate and governor's races in Florida carried particular national import, with the state's junior senator potentially tipping the balance over which party controls the Senate, and the governor set to preside over redistricting in this, the fourth-largest and biggest swing state in the nation. Till the bitter end on Tuesday, both primary battles were defined by lavish spending and caustic attacks. And the general election does not hold the promise of greater civility.
Mr. McCollum refused Tuesday night to concede to Mr. Scott, saying the vote counting would continue into the early morning hours.
''This has been a tough, grueling battle all the way through,'' Mr. McCollum told several hundred supporters gathered in a hotel meeting room shortly before 11 p.m. ''At the end of the day, we don't know the results.''
Mr. Meek will face Marco Rubio, the Republican, and Gov. Charlie Crist. Mr. Crist abandoned the Republican Party in April when he looked likely to lose to Mr. Rubio, who won the Republican primary essentially unopposed.
Mr. Crist released a statement on Tuesday night calling Washington ''a swamp of partisan bickering, finger-pointing and destructive political games'' and saying ''we need independent leadership.''
In his victory speech, Mr. McCain said it was ''a tough, hard-fought primary'' and predicted Republicans would win majorities in both the House and the Senate in November. Calling this a ''consequential election,'' he railed against staggering unemployment, housing market in crisis, a river of red ink and ''a government that does not seem to realize the trouble we're in.''
In the race for Florida's governor's mansion, Mr. Scott will face the Democrat Alex Sink, the state's chief financial officer, who won easily on Tuesday, and Lawton Chiles III, the son of a former governor, who is running as an independent.
During the Senate campaign, Mr. Greene repeatedly accused Mr. Meek of being a do-nothing career politician beholden to special interests -- spending $23 million to get the message across. Mr. Meek, who seemed surprised at first by the challenge, hit back hard, accusing Mr. Greene of profiting from the foreclosure crisis and living a life out of touch, in mansions or on his yacht that traveled to Cuba and often counted Mike Tyson as a guest.
In his victory speech, Mr. Meek said he had spoken to Mr. Greene, who offered his support, but Mr. Meek received his loudest applause with a small swipe at his former opponent. ''Some people call it career politician,'' he said. ''I call it public service.''
In the Republican governor's primary, trailing 47 percent to 43 percent with more than 90 percent of the vote counted, Mr. McCollum said: ''We're not where we would like to be.'' But he insisted he still had hope with the votes not being final in some of the state's larger counties where he ran well.
He was blindsided by Mr. Scott, a wealthy Naples businessman who had never run for office. Mr. Scott, who built his $218 million net worth in part by creating the Columbia/HCA healthcare giant, jumped into the governor's race in the spring and opened his personal checkbook.
He spent more than $50 million in the record-breaking primary.
Mr. Scott, managed to overcome the hurdle of name recognition; when he visited a Jacksonville Jaguars game just before Election Day, he was greeted like a celebrity. At a time when the economy is the No. 1 issue for voters, Mr. Scott outran criticism surrounding his role as chief executive of Columbia/HCA, a hospital chain that paid $1.7 billion in fines for fraudulently billing the federal government. The investigation began while he was still at the company, though the fines were handed down after he left.
Mr. Scott had come under fire for refusing to release a deposition he gave days before he entered the governor's race in a suit against Solantic, a chain of medical clinics that he founded.
And even on Tuesday, the assault continued. In Naples after lunch, Mr. Scott appeared at a church to vote, and was greeted not just by a small band of supporters, but also by a critic in a smock and surgical mask who heckled him with a bullhorn. He identified himself only as ''Doctor Dave,'' but later conceded that he was not a doctor.
But Mr. Scott won over voters in a tight race with his constant television presence and consistency on issues like job creation and immigration. Even when Doctor Dave attacked, supporters like Alyse O'Neill -- an elderly volunteer -- came to Mr. Scott's aid. ''I don't know where you came from,'' Ms. O'Neill told the heckler, before demanding to know whether he was a paid operative from the Republican establishment.
Mr. Scott provided attacks of his own. He first surged ahead by accusing Mr. McCollum of being soft on illegal immigration. When Mr. McCollum reversed himself and proposed a law in Florida similar to a tough measure recently passed in Arizona, Mr. Scott told voters his opponent was a liar.
In one television spot, his campaign also compared Mr. McCollum to a dirty diaper that voters needed to toss out.
For many voters, frustration with the status quo was often being balanced with distrust of newcomers.
In Arizona -- where turnout may have been suppressed by temperatures that reached the triple digits -- polls had already shown Mr. McCain, 73, with a comfortable lead over challenger Mr. Hayworth, 51, a conservative former radio talk show host and congressman. Ms. Brewer became governor when Janet Napolitano stepped down to become secretary of homeland security.
Voters seemed to be confounded by their options. Many seemed be holding their noses at the polls.
''I don't like either of them,'' said Blanche Kinsley, 84, a retiree, who voted for Mr. McCain without much enthusiasm. ''But I used to hear J. D. Hayworth on the radio and he annoyed me.''
In Alaska, Senator Lisa Murkowski also faced an insurgent candidate, the Tea Party favorite Joe Miller, but after outspending him significantly she appeared to have a comfortable lead heading into the primary.
In Vermont, Mr. Leahy defeated a newcomer, Daniel Freilich, a doctor and Navy veteran. But an insurgent also won in one of Oklahoma's two Republican runoffs for House seats. In his first run for office, James Lankford, a youth camp director and political newcomer, defeated former State Representative Kevin Calvey in the Fifth Congressional District.

HEADLINE: A $39 Billion Bid Is a Bet on Potash

BYLINE: By UNA GALANI and MARTIN HUTCHINSON

 BODY:
The price of potash is all-important to BHP Billiton, the Australian mining company. BHP's $39 billion hostile bid for the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan is essentially a bet on demand for the commodity.
According to calculations by Reuters Breakingviews, every $50 increase in the long-term price of a metric ton of potash, currently $350, adds about $20 to the Potash Corporation's share value. BHP's $130-a-share offer roughly reflects the current pricing situation.
To value the Potash Corporation, start with its other businesses. The phosphate and nitrogen units are worth about $11 billion, according to Morgan Stanley estimates. The company's stakes in smaller listed rivals have a current market value of $8 billion. 
The potash business is trickier to value. Deutsche Bank estimates that building two million tons of new potash capacity requires a $4 billion investment. On that basis, replacing the Potash Corporation's 11.2 million tons of capacity would cost $22.4 billion.
Knock off next year's estimated net debt of $3.5 billion, and the company's standalone value is around $38 billion, or just about what BHP is offering.
Yet that valuation doesn't capture the company's plans to increase potash capacity to more than 17 million tons by 2015 -- or BHP's intention to produce almost as much potash as possible.
Assuming long-term potash prices remain at their current level, and that BHP runs the operations at 90 percent of future capacity, the potash business could generate earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of around $3.2 billion after deducting local taxes. Apply a peer group multiple of nine times, and the Potash Corporation is worth about $148 a share, or right around where the shares are trading.
If potash prices dip to $300 a ton, the bid already looks full. But what if long-term prices rise? Only two years ago, potash peaked at $600 a ton. At $500, Potash shares could be worth $207 each, close to their highs during the commodity boom.
In the Year 2110
If the railroad operator Norfolk Southern can issue 100-year bonds, why can't the United States Treasury? Maturities longer than the current 30-year maximum would reduce refinancing needs and appeal to institutions. But investors might demand more return for the risks than Treasury would be willing to pay.
Norfolk Southern's new bonds yield just under 6 percent, about 0.9 percentage points more than the company's 30-year debt. There's a similar spread between yields on Britain's perpetual War Loan paper and 30-year gilts. Based on the current 30-year Treasury yield of around 3.6 percent, the government would probably expect to sell 100-year bonds at a yield of no more than about 4.5 percent.
Investors, however, could look at the 1960-2010 average inflation rate of about 4.1 percent and demand a real return of 1.7 percent, in line with today's yield on 30-year Treasury inflation-protected securities. So they might expect a yield nearer 5.8 percent. That gap could be tough to close.
Aside from pricing, there's the credit problem. Though lithium-powered skateboards may serve for transportation next century, Norfolk Southern still has 37,000 miles of track and associated land holdings, which will retain real value.
Uncle Sam, however, has a $15 trillion actuarial deficit on Social Security over 75 years and an $88 trillion gap on Medicare. In 100 years, those shortfalls will be current. If the federal government is tempted to print money to excess, the real value of 100-year bonds could erode rapidly.
Finally, there's liquidity. Ultra-long maturity bonds are not traded much because institutions buy and hold them. Norfolk Southern reduced this problem by reopening an old issue that matures in 2105. But if the Treasury started annual sales of century bonds, it would create 70 new maturities before new 30-year issues started coinciding with the remaining repayment time on the 100-year bonds.
Perpetual paper, oddly enough, is potentially more liquid, because new issues are identical to those outstanding. For example, Consols, sold repeatedly since starting in 1751, formed the bulk of the British government's financing in the 19th century and are still outstanding.
If Treasury has the ultra-long term in mind, perpetuals could be a better answer than 100-year bonds. The pricing gap might still be there. But they would be more liquid and avoid focusing investor attention on America's potential solvency in 2110.

HEADLINE: Sustaining The Forest, Maintaining A Bridge

BYLINE: By CATE DOTY

 BODY:
There are 11,000 tropical wood planks in the Brooklyn Bridge boardwalk, and millions of feet and wheels tread on them every year. Eventually, the boards wear out and must be replaced. Currently, the city uses similar tropical hardwoods, though under pressure from rain-forest advocates, it has begun to test alternative materials. 
But a Manhattan architect and sustainable-development consultant has proposed a third way: a dedicated, sustainably managed patch of rain forest to grow Brooklyn Bridge planks.
''If we're going to take wood and use wood,'' said Scott Francisco, the architect, ''let's do it in a way that's beneficial.'' Mr. Francisco calls his project the Brooklyn Bridge Forest.
While Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg promised the United Nations General Assembly that the city would reduce its use of tropical hardwoods, Mr. Francisco argues that the bridge's boardwalk, a landmark for New Yorkers and tourists alike, should be made out of natural wood, not a synthetic or recycled product, and he says the bridge's engineers agree.
So his plan is to solicit donations - probably starting around $1,000 a board, Mr. Francisco said, although a sliding scale is possible - in exchange for the donor's name burnished into a boardwalk plank.
The donations would in turn finance an endowment and stewardship for a 5,000-acre forest in an as-yet determined country - perhaps Guyana, which has several sustainable forestry projects. The wood for the boardwalk and future replacements would come from the forest, which would be maintained by the project and protected from development and from non-sustainable agriculture.
The forest would not grow in Brooklyn, but the bridge would grow from the forest.
''We want to create a link between the product where it's used and the forest that it came from,'' Mr. Francisco said. ''This is an acreage that is going to be managed and monitored within the life of the bridge.''
Mr. Francisco said that he had been in touch with the city's Transportation Department, which maintains the bridge and its boardwalk, but that it was too early to discuss any actual partnership with them. The department did not immediately respond for a request to comment on the proposal.
The idea flies in the face of Mayor Bloomberg's statement on limiting the use of rain-forest wood in public infrastructure. Rain-forest protection groups also take a hard line against the cutting of any tropical hardwoods, regardless of stewardship. But Mr. Francisco said that rain-forest wood would continue to be harvested in any case, and added that his project provided a way to sustain a forest while using its wood and creating public awareness of the environmental impact.
The project is in its infancy; right now Mr. Francisco is looking for corporate underwriting. He also realizes he is wading into a contentious debate over the rain forests.
''Things get very delicate when you start talking about tropical hardwoods,'' Mr. Francisco said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: With New Products, Nissan Plays Up Innovation Angle

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
EIGHT years after urging consumers to ''Shift'' their buying behavior when it comes to cars, trucks and minivans, Nissan North America is changing brand themes.
In a campaign that is scheduled to get under way on Saturday, Nissan North America, part of the Nissan Motor Company of Japan, will proclaim its mission is to provide ''Innovation for all.''
The change will also bring more humor to Nissan advertising than has been evident recently: the addition of a sound at the end of each commercial, meant to symbolize the Nissan brand, and a new voice-over announcer for the commercials, the actor Robert Downey Jr. 
Nissan is ''rallying around innovation,'' said Jon Brancheau, vice president for Nissan marketing at Nissan North America in Franklin, Tenn., as embodied by the Leaf, the mass-market electric car that the company is to bring out at the end of the year.
Leaf is ''the poster child for innovation,'' Mr. Brancheau said on Tuesday morning at an interview in New York, and as such will be ''absolutely critical'' to how the Nissan brand fares.
The new campaign, like its predecessor, is being created by the Los Angeles office of TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group.
Switching to a discussion of innovation is intended to convey a leadership position for the Nissan brand, said Rob Schwartz, chief creative officer at TBWA/Chat/Day Los Angeles, who joined Mr. Brancheau for the interview.
The goal is not to play up ''innovation for innovation's sake,'' Mr. Schwartz said, but rather to concentrate on what he called ''human-centric innovation,'' as conveyed through displays of new products like the Leaf and the highlighting of features found on Nissan products.
In introducing a brand image campaign, Nissan North America joins a lengthening list of major marketers that includes AT&T and Procter & Gamble.
The trend signals that advertisers focused mostly on short-term sales during the worst of the economic downturn are beginning to raise their sights to the point where they want to also try burnishing brand images.
''We're moving ahead,'' Mr. Brancheau said, despite the recent signs that the economic recovery is sputtering. ''Economically, we do think there is light at the end of the tunnel.''
Another purpose of the campaign is to ''drive a stake in the ground,'' he added, to show consumers how committed Nissan is to improving its products.
In the next two years, Nissan North America will ''turn over 80 percent of our portfolio,'' Mr. Brancheau said, as ''many of our core models'' like the Quest minivan are replaced with new versions.
''This is a window in time that's certainly important in terms of our growth,'' he added. ''We don't anticipate backing off at all.''
Nissan is having a good 2010 to date, with sales in the United States through July totaling 522,669, up 24.6 percent, from 419,591 in the first seven months of 2009.
''Shift,'' which was introduced in 2002, will remain for now in ads in the United States, but it will be played down as ''Innovation for all'' is played up. The ''Shift'' theme will continue as the brand theme in the rest of the world, Mr. Brancheau said.
''We'll monitor how well 'Innovation' is working and evaluate whether to keep 'Shift,' '' he added.
The lighter touch that Nissan and TBWA/Chiat/Day hope to add to the brand image is typified by a moment in one commercial in which Mr. Downey suggests that Nissans might someday be equipped with force fields.
And in a spot for the Leaf, a polar bear is shown leaving its native habitat as the ice melts and traveling through unfamiliar landscapes until arriving in a suburban driveway. It at first seems as if the commercial will be a plaintive paean for environmental conservation.
But the spot takes a wry turn as the bear goes up to the owner of the Leaf and gives him a fervent, well, bear hug, to thank him for buying the car.
The intent is to offer ''a little twist, perhaps a wink,'' Mr. Brancheau said, to offer some relief from the serious tack that so many car ads take.
The sound at the end of each Nissan spot is reminiscent of the so-called aural branding that Intel does in its commercials.
''We're calling it the sound of innovation,'' Mr. Schwartz said, adding that each commercial is to begin and end with a brief flash of light -- and yes, he called it the ''flash of innovation.''
The sound and lights are to help the spots stand out amid the sea of auto advertisements.
The hope is that the arrival of Mr. Downey, who replaces a voice-over announcer named Dave Hoffman, will instill ''a very confident tone'' in Nissan's brand communications, Mr. Brancheau said, ''whether people recognize the voice or not.''
The ''Innovation for all'' theme echoes one that briefly appeared in recent ads for Chevrolet, ''Excellence for all.'' The Chevy theme was discontinued when a new vice president for marketing, Joel Ewanick, joined the Chevrolet parent, General Motors.
''It's a different idea,'' Mr. Brancheau said of the focus on innovation, adding that even if Chevrolet had kept its theme, ''I'm not sure we would have wavered'' in making the change in brand themes.
Nissan North America will increase ad spending drastically this year compared with last year, Mr. Brancheau said, but declined to be specific.
Nissan North America spent $449.1 million last year to advertise in major media, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP, down 43.9 percent from the $800.2 million spent in 2008.
For the first five months of 2010, Kantar Media reported, Nissan North America ad spending totaled $249.1 million, up 23.4 percent, from the $201.8 million spent in the first five months of 2009.

HEADLINE: Boehner Urges Obama To Fire Economic Team

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
CLEVELAND -- Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader, called on President Obama on Tuesday to fire his top economic advisers as Mr. Boehner tried to make the economic case for restoring Republicans to the majority in Congress in the November elections.
In a speech at the City Club of Cleveland, Mr. Boehner, who is in line to be House speaker in the event of a Republican takeover, unveiled a five-point plan that he said would provide an effective economic alternative to the Democrats' course. 
He singled out Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and Lawrence H. Summers, the head of the National Economic Council, as responsible for failing to turn the economy around, saying the president should replace them with officials who have ''real-world experience.''
''We do not have the luxury of waiting months for the president to pick scapegoats for his failing stimulus policies,'' Mr. Boehner told a friendly audience here in his home state.
Mr. Boehner's speech was part of an emerging effort to raise his public profile and establish him as a credible political leader on such issues as the economy. Mr. Boehner, a 20-year Congressional veteran, would be the most likely choice for speaker if Republicans gained the net 39 seats needed to catapult them into the House majority in November.
Mr. Boehner also called for an extension of the Bush-era tax cuts that are due to expire at the end of the year. He urged the president to present Congress with a plan to reduce federal spending to the 2008 levels in place before the approval of last year's stimulus plan.
''That would show Washington is ready to get serious about bringing down the deficits that threaten our economy,'' he said.
Democrats pushed back hard against Mr. Boehner's remarks, saying he was recycling ideas that had failed when Republicans controlled Congress and the White House in the Bush years from 2001 to 2009. They said Mr. Boehner and his Republican colleagues would push tax cuts for the affluent and provide the same lax oversight of the financial industry that led to the financial meltdown in 2008.
''For eight years before we arrived, Mr. Boehner and his party ran this economy and the middle class into the ground,'' Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said at an event at the White House. ''They took the $237 billion surplus they inherited from the Clinton administration and left us with a $1.3 trillion deficit, and, in the process, quadrupled the national debt -- all before we had turned on the lights in the West Wing.''
Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, said Mr. Boehner had done voters a favor by making it clear that if Republicans were to regain control, they would return to what she called the ''failed Bush economic policies that produced a deep recession, record deficits, a loss of eight million jobs and an unprecedented financial crisis.''
Democrats also noted that even as Mr. Boehner criticized the stimulus spending as a failure, a new Congressional Budget Office report said the spending had lowered the unemployment rate in the second quarter of the year, had led to the employment of 1.4 million to 3.3 million people and increased productivity by as much as 4.5 percent.
Mr. Boehner was part of the band of forceful Republicans who engineered the party's takeover of the House in the 1994 elections. He lost his position in the leadership after the 1998 elections but was restored to the upper ranks in 2006 when Tom DeLay, who was then majority leader, had to step aside.
In his speech Tuesday and in a meeting with reporters afterward, Mr. Boehner acknowledged that Republicans were culpable in letting federal spending escalate when they held power. But he said the near-unified Republican resistance to Democratic proposals on health care, the stimulus spending and climate-change legislation was intended to show the public that Congressional Republicans had regained their discipline.
''We began to show people we are different,'' Mr. Boehner said, ''but we have to continue to prove to people that we are who we say we are.
''And I don't just mean differently than the way Democrats are running it today. I mean differently than both Democrats or Republicans in the past. That means challenging the old ways in Washington, getting to the bottom of what drives people crazy, and then fixing it once and for all.''
Mr. Boehner, who has long been a foe of earmarks and other Congressional spending meant to benefit home-state interests for political purposes, said: ''I think we should go through every line item in the budget and ask ourselves if the spending is so important we are going to ask our kids and grandkids to pay for it. And if doesn't meet that test, then why in the hell are we doing it.''
He said business operators around the nation were anxious about investing in an uncertain business climate given the new policies coming out of Washington.
''The prospect of higher taxes, stricter rules and more regulation has employers sitting on their hands,'' said Mr. Boehner, who used his speech to remind Ohioans of his own upbringing as part of large Roman Catholic family whose parents owned and operated a bar in Cincinnati.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Hit Again, This Time by Housing Data

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; David Streitfeld contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended lower Tuesday for a fourth consecutive day, unable to rebound from a disappointing report on existing-home sales.
The Nasdaq closed lower for a second day, missing a four-day losing streak by rising less than a point on Friday.
''There is basically a bubble of negativity right now,'' William Smith, the president of Smith Asset Management, said. ''The market has got a very short memory. It is day to day. Today it is terrible housing numbers, which were anticipated.'' 
The National Association of Realtors said in its latest report that existing home sales in July were at their lowest level in more than a decade. The purchases of existing homes declined 27.2 percent last month to a 3.83 million annual rate. Analysts had expected a 13.4 percent decline.
At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 133.96 points, or 1.32 percent, 10,040.45. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 15.49 points, or 1.45 percent, to 1,051.87, and the Nasdaq fell 35.87 points, or 1.66 percent, 2,123.76.
Mr. Smith said the housing numbers had been anticipated, possibly making it easier the Dow to recover somewhat from 180-point decline in mid-morning trading.
''Fears of another leg down in real estate are certainly weighing on hopes for broad-based economic recovery,'' said Nicholas Colas, the ConvergEx Group chief market strategist.
Health care, industrials, materials, financial and consumer discretionary stocks were all down by about 1 percent or more.
Investors will take in several other reports this week, including data on new home sales and durable goods on Wednesday and the latest estimate on second-quarter economic output on Friday. All are expected to reinforce the notion that growth in the United States has slowed.
Most economists expect the latest snapshot of second quarter growth to be revised sharply lower. Trade deficit figures and revisions to other statistics point to growth of 1 to 1.5 percent in the quarter, rather than the previous estimate of 2.4 percent,
Economists from Capital Economics said in a research note that policy makers might turn to regulatory and trade policy as an alternative means of bolstering the economy.
Mr. Colas said another issue was the extent to which analysts would have to cut expectations. ''It is clear that analysts have started to cut their revenue expectations,'' he said. ''We have hit the tipping point.''
Mr. Colas said that a gathering of Federal Reserve officials at the end of the week was also generating some apprehension, especially after the central bank's decision to buy government debt. ''There is almost a fear of what they are going to try,'' Mr. Colas said.
The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, will address the annual symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyo., on Friday.
The tone for Wall Street was set before the opening bell, with markets in Asia and Europe also falling. Investors will get looks at several reports other than housing later this week, including data on durable goods and economic output that are expected to reinforce the outlook that growth in the United States has slowed.
Keith B. Hembre, the chief economist and chief investment strategist at First American Funds of Minneapolis, said the lower Asian markets, the weakness in Europe and the home sales were factors weighing on the market.
''It is the fundamental backdrop of decelerating economic growth, and overseas influence,'' Mr. Hembre said. ''The yen continuing to be sharply stronger is generally not good for risky assets.''
''And then, of course, the time of year: It is the summer doldrums,'' he added. Trading volume has been low, even for August, with many traders staying on the sidelines because of the uncertainty.
The rates on Treasury bonds continued to fall as investors sought a safe haven. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was 2.53 percent, down from 2.60 percent late Monday.
The declines that reached Wall Street on Tuesday started in Asia, with the Nikkei in Tokyo declining 1.33 percent to 8,995.14 -- closing below 9,000 for the first time since May 1, 2009. The Nikkei's decline is the result of a stronger yen, which hit a 15-year high against the dollar. That has caused shares of many Japanese exporters, including electronics companies and automakers, to fall. A stronger yen makes Japanese products more expensive in the world markets.
Earlier Tuesday, the dollar fell to 84.36 yen, slightly above the earlier low of 84.17 yen.
Shares were also lower in Europe, amid concerns about weakness in the American economy.
In London, the FTSE 100 was down 78.89 points, or 1.5 percent, while the DAX in Frankfurt fell 75.47 points, or 1.2 percent. The CAC 40 in Paris was 62.12 points, or 1.75 percent, lower.
Oil prices also declined.

HEADLINE: Dire Predictions For Drilling Ban Are Not Seen Yet

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When the Obama administration called a halt to virtually all deepwater drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater Horizon blowout and fire in April, oil executives, economists and local officials complained that the six-month moratorium would cost thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in lost revenue.
Oil supply firms went to court to have the moratorium overturned, calling it illegal and warning that it would exacerbate the nation's economic woes, lead to oil shortages and cause an exodus of drilling rigs from the gulf to other fields around the world. Two federal courts agreed.
Yet the worst of those forecasts has failed to materialize, as companies wait to see how long the moratorium will last before making critical decisions on spending cuts and layoffs. Unemployment claims related to the oil industry along the Gulf Coast have been in the hundreds, not the thousands, and while oil production from the gulf is down because of the drilling halt, supplies from the region are expected to rebound in future years. Only 2 of the 33 deepwater rigs operating in the gulf before the BP rig exploded have left for other fields. 
While it is too early to gauge the long-term environmental or economic effects of the release of 4.9 million barrels of oil into the gulf, it now appears that the direst predictions about the moratorium will not be borne out. Even the government's estimate of the impact of the drilling pause -- 23,000 lost jobs and $10.2 billion in economic damage -- is proving to be too pessimistic.
There are several reasons the suspension has not cut as deeply as anticipated.
Oil companies used the enforced suspension to service and upgrade their drilling equipment, keeping shipyards and service companies busy. Drilling firms have kept most of their workers, knowing that if they let them go it will be hard to field experienced teams when the moratorium is lifted. Oil companies have shifted operations to onshore wells, saving industry jobs.
And the administration has dropped repeated hints that the offshore drilling ban will be eased or removed before it is set to expire on Nov. 30.
Michael R. Bromwich, the director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement, the agency responsible for policing offshore drilling, said Monday in a letter to the presidential commission investigating the accident that it was possible that the moratorium would be lifted before Nov. 30 for certain types of rigs.
Mr. Bromwich's boss, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, said the agency was ''ahead of schedule'' in drawing up new rules to allow drilling to resume and suggested that the moratorium could be eased as early as next month.
Oil workers idled by the government-imposed drilling suspension are not eligible for BP money intended for people directly affected by the spill, like gulf shrimpers and charter-boat captains. But BP has set aside $100 million to compensate rig hands and support workers who lose their jobs because of the moratorium. The Rig Workers Assistance Fund has not started to make payments.
Oil companies continue to lobby for a lifting of the ban and warn that if it goes on much longer they will move their operations elsewhere. Yet they are hedging their bets by keeping crews and equipment on standby, expecting the pause to end well before the end of the year.
''It's like a taxi that stops but the meter keeps going,'' Ola Morten Aanestad, a vice president for Statoil, the Norwegian company that is a major producer in the gulf, said of its stranded rigs. Statoil has invested in a half-dozen drilling projects that are now frozen by the moratorium, including two in which it is the main operator.
''We are looking at what other alternatives there are elsewhere, but I can't predict what will come about,'' Mr. Aanestad said.
But he added that Statoil had not laid off any gulf workers. ''Our base assumption is we will be able to resume our activities and work with our deepwater leases,'' he said.
The Noble Corporation, a major offshore driller, had six rigs operating in the gulf before the BP accident and has since acquired a seventh. All are now in limbo, said John Breed, a company spokesman, who added that the company was ''looking at opportunities outside the United States.''
But Mr. Breed said the company had not let any rig workers go so far.
''Our goal has been to try to maintain the continuity of our work force, but how long that will go on we don't know,'' he said.
Mr. Breed said a long moratorium would hurt not only the drillers but also the service companies that do the seismic work, the caterers who feed the thousands of rig workers and the sellers of uniforms and safety boots.
The moratorium is likely to have a modest immediate effect on domestic oil production. The Energy Department projects that the moratorium will bring a decline of 120,000 barrels a day in deepwater production in 2011, but domestic daily crude oil production is still expected to increase by 30,000 barrels a day, to 5.46 million barrels.
Eleven deepwater gulf projects operated by major companies like Shell, Chevron and BP that were supposed to begin operating over the next year have been delayed, meaning that 400,000 fewer barrels of oil will be produced in 2015 than originally anticipated, said Leta K. Smith, director of exploration and production trends at IHS-CERA, an energy consulting firm.
But while that would represent about 7 percent of current domestic production, the probable delay in production would be at most six months to a year. ''The total reserves that will eventually be produced will be the same,'' Ms. Smith said.
Deepwater oil drilling has played an increasingly important role in world energy markets in recent years, and that has not changed after several accidents in the waters of Australia, Britain, Mexico and the United States.
Since 2006, nearly half the total oil and gas reserves added worldwide have been in deepwater areas. Six million barrels of oil a day, or 7 percent of total global production, are now produced in deepwater areas. Global deepwater oil production is expected to double by 2030.
With the world becoming increasingly dependent on deepwater oil supplies, the BP spill has so far had a very limited effect on drilling around the world. Britain has stepped up inspections of offshore rigs. Brazil has announced a safety review that will take a year to complete before it makes any regulatory changes related to its fast-growing offshore drilling industry. Angola has increased inspections.
But there are few signs of any slowdown in drilling. In Norway, which already has strong regulations, the BP accident at first shook the industry. An auction of about 100 offshore lots was initially postponed, but in the end, only six lots in environmentally sensitive areas were kept off limits. In Nigeria and Ghana, some government officials have expressed caution about deepwater drilling, but there have been no significant delays.
''Other countries are not overreacting,'' said Robert Johnston, director of energy and natural resources at Eurasia Group, a consulting firm. ''The BP crisis has created new concerns about safety and the environment, but at the same time countries like Norway with declining oil production, or countries like Trinidad with declining gas production have a strong incentive to go forward in deep water.''

CORRECTION-DATE: August 30, 2010

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A picture caption on Wednesday with an article about the impact of the Obama administration's moratorium on virtually all deepwater drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico referred imprecisely to the oil rigs shown off the coast of Louisiana. While deepwater rigs in the gulf have indeed been idled, as the caption noted, the picture showed shallow-water units.

HEADLINE: Some Business Skills to Go With the Passion

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
IT'S a recipe for a role model: economic anxiety and America's inherent optimism. Enter that paragon of self-reliance, the entrepreneur.
''You are the president of a very important company -- You Inc.,'' said Thomas J. O'Malia, director of the Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies at the University of Southern California. ''And that's true regardless of whether you are starting your own business or working inside a large organization.''
The entrepreneurial ideal has been in ascent for years. But the shaky economy, it seems, is making the mystique of the entrepreneur a meme of the moment as never before.
But is the rise of the entrepreneurial role model just the latest self-help fad? Or is there real substance to the concept of entrepreneurship? Can it be studied and learned? 
There seems to be no shortage of effort. Courses in entrepreneurship are now offered by more than 1,200 American universities, and by thousands more organizations including community colleges, small-business development centers and chambers of commerce. Many of the courses are continuing education programs for people with job experience. They include one-week courses, night classes, online offerings and graduate degree programs.
The courses vary widely, but they typically seek to leave students with some blend of two things: an entrepreneurial mind-set and a tool kit.
In a start-up or inside a big company, the entrepreneurial approach emphasizes the pursuit of opportunities with small teams and few dollars, quickly and flexibly. The mentality, experts say, is that of the insurgent ''attacker'' rather than the established ''defender.'' Look first to customer needs -- solving some problem and getting paid for it -- to build a business.
''And keep the F-word in mind -- focus,'' advised William K. Aulet, managing director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Entrepreneurship Center. ''The No. 1 reason new businesses fail is lack of focus.''
One course the M.I.T. center offers is an intensive, one-week entrepreneurship development program that costs more than $8,000 (companies and governments often pay some or all of the costs for their managers).
''You see that the essence of the entrepreneurial spirit isn't so much about money as it is about passion,'' said Tetsuya O'Hara, 47, who took the M.I.T. course last December. ''It's a perspective that goes beyond business, forcing you to think about what matters most to you.''
Mr. O'Hara, director of advanced research and development at Patagonia, the outdoor clothing maker, said he had applied the program's thinking in his job, which involves working with outside companies to explore new technologies and business concepts. Before the entrepreneurship program, he had a list of almost 200 projects he might pursue. Today, he has winnowed that list to two priority projects. ''I already got a lot of return from the course,'' he said.
Another participant, J. Patrick Bewley, vice president of global marketing strategy at Acxiom, a consumer data marketer, said one insight he took from the program was the importance of assembling strong teams of people with open minds, willing to experiment, learn rapidly and constantly refine ideas to improve them. ''You have to build that culture of resilience within your group,'' said Mr. Bewley, 34.
Both opportunity and necessity are motivations for starting new businesses. A report in May, based on data from the Census Bureau, found that new businesses were formed in 2009 at the highest level in 14 years, despite the weak economy. At the least, challenging economic times can prompt people to rethink their options.
That is what happened to Saudia Davis, a former movie publicist, who worked promoting independent films like ''My Big Fat Greek Wedding.'' She lost her job in 2007, when her employer cut her department. ''I could find a new job or gamble and put everything on the table to start my own business,'' recalled Ms. Davis, 32.
She chose to take the entrepreneurial plunge. Her grandmother had been a house cleaner, and Ms. Davis had long thought that house cleaning could be made more healthy and environmentally friendly for the clients and the cleaners. Her company, Greenhouse Eco-Cleaning, in Brooklyn, was founded to pursue that vision of cleaner cleaning. It uses no toxic cleaning agents like ammonia or formaldehyde, and checks the allergies of clients and their pets to avoid using materials that might aggravate those conditions.
Ms. Davis had never started a business before, and her work experience in movie promotion and her education, as an English and Africana studies major at Bowdoin College, were scant preparation. She found a business-building course called FastTrac, offered by a nonprofit economic development organization in New York, the Industrial and Technology Assistance Corporation. She took the 12-week course of evening sessions in 2008, with a development grant paying for half the $1,000 tuition.
The course work, Ms. Davis recalled, covered business functions like accounting, operations and marketing. ''But it also gave me an understanding of what it takes and how all the slices of the pie that go into making a business come together,'' Mr. Davis said.
Today, her company employs 12 people and has 600 household and office clients. Initial plans to manufacture green cleaning products have been postponed -- too capital-intensive and distracting, Ms. Davis said. One lesson learned, she adds, is that the entrepreneurial journey is all-consuming. ''The closest thing I have to vacation is sleep,'' she said.
The FastTrac coursework is developed by the Kauffman Foundation, a philanthropy with $2 billion in assets, dedicated to entrepreneurship research and education. The FastTrac courses are offered in 37 states, by local development organizations, chambers of commerce and other groups. The courses range in cost from $700 to $1,500 depending on the course, teaching venue and the audience, though grants and scholarships are often available.
Kaplan, the private education company, announced in July that it would begin offering some FastTrac courses online, for $882 a course. And the Kauffman Foundation earlier this month overhauled its free Web site, www.entrepreneurship.org, with resources for aspiring and practicing entrepreneurs.
The entrepreneurial mindset, says Bo Fishback, the Kauffman Foundation's vice president of entrepreneurship, is a personal asset that can be applied to any field. ''It's a mentality that sees every problem out there not as a setback but as an opportunity to fix,'' he said. ''Some people will start businesses, but others will take that mindset with them into corporations and government.''
It worked out that way for Carrie Coker Britt. After three years working for an Atlanta law firm as a recruiter and administrator, Ms. Britt decided against going to law school.
Instead, Ms. Britt attended Georgia Tech's business school, and joined a program that puts doctoral science students, law school and business school students in teams to work on start-up projects. The goal of the program is to teach people from different disciplines to work together to accelerate the entrepreneurial process in high-tech start-ups. One team project she worked on won a competition at Georgia Tech and a $10,000 prize.
Today Ms. Britt, 32, works as a software sales representative for I.B.M., covering thousands of accounts in Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and Mississippi. Her job, she says, requires quickly researching industries and figuring out how I.B.M. technology can help individual businesses. ''It's very entrepreneurial, fast-paced, and you're constantly looking for new and better ways to be successful,'' Ms. Britt said.
And, she adds, there is another benefit to having gone through the entrepreneurial program, Ti:ger, for Technological Innovation: Generating Economic Results. ''It was critical to getting the job I have now,'' Ms. Britt said. ''It differentiated me from other candidates.''

HEADLINE: Shaping Tea Party Passion Into Campaign Force

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- On a Saturday in August when most of the political class has escaped this city's swelter, 50 Tea Party leaders have flown in from across the country to jam into a conference room in an office building on Pennsylvania Avenue, apparently unconcerned that the fancy address does not guarantee air-conditioning on weekends. They have come to learn how to take over the country, voter by voter.
Look for houses with flags, they are instructed; their residents tend to be patriotic conservatives. Marine flags or religious symbols, ditto. Take doggie treats with you as you canvass neighborhoods -- ''Now they are your best friend; it's dog person to dog person.'' Don't just hand out yard signs and bumper stickers for your candidate -- offer to plant them on the lawn or paste them on the bumper (front driver's side works best.) Follow up with thank you notes, the handwritten kind. Be polite, and don't take rejection personally: ''Remember, it's for freedom!'' 
This is a three-day ''boot camp'' at FreedomWorks, the Washington advocacy group that has done more than any other organization to build the Tea Party movement. For 18 months, the group's young staff has been conducting training sessions like this one across the country, in hotel conference rooms or basements of bars, shaping the inchoate anger of the Tea Party with its libertarian ideology and leftist organizing tactics.
The goal is to turn local Tea Party groups into a standing get-out-the-vote operation in Congressional districts across the country. Sarah Palin made community organizing a term of derision during the 2008 presidential campaign; FreedomWorks has made Tea Party conservatives the surprise community organizing force of the 2010 midterm elections, showing on-the-ground strength in races like the Republican primary for the Senate in Alaska on Tuesday, where the upstart Joe Miller was leading Senator Lisa Murkowski in a race that may take weeks to call.
''This movement, if we can turn out hundreds or thousands to the streets to protest and wave signs and yell and make an impact on public policy debate, then we can make a lot of difference,'' Brendan Steinhauser, FreedomWorks's chief organizer for the Tea Party groups, told the leaders gathered here. ''But if those same people go and walk neighborhoods and do all the things we're talking about, put up the door-hangers in the final 72 hours and make the phone calls, we may crush some of these guys.''
In recent months, FreedomWorks has teamed up with Glenn Beck, the biggest celebrity of the Tea Party movement to promote it. This weekend, with many Tea Party supporters descending on Washington for a rally that Mr. Beck is holding at the Lincoln Memorial, FreedomWorks is staging a convention where Tea Party candidates will address 1,600 activists.
Through its political action committee, FreedomWorks plans to spend $10 million on the midterm elections, on campaign paraphernalia -- signs for candidates like Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida are stacked around the offices here -- voter lists, and a phone system that allows volunteers to make calls for candidates around the country from their home computers. With ''microfinancing'' grants, it will steer money from FreedomWorks donors -- the tax code protects their anonymity -- to local Tea Parties.
Other groups will spend more. On the left, a coalition of unions plans to spend at least $88 million; on the right, Americans for Prosperity will spend $45 million.
But FreedomWorks's pitch to activists is that the money is not really the point. It is about convincing friends, neighbors and strangers in Congressional districts where 100 or 1,000 votes can make all the difference. The activists tend to be a zealous lot to start with; FreedomWorks urges them to channel that energy by becoming precinct captains, knocking on doors and learning from the way that Barack Obama -- not someone Tea Party supporters generally admire -- wrapped up the Democratic nomination for president by organizing the caucus states.
FreedomWorks was founded in 1984 as Citizens for a Sound Economy, which was financed by the Koch Foundation, the underwriter for many libertarian causes. In 2003, it hired as its chairman Dick Armey, the former Texas congressman and House majority leader who was a force behind the 1994 Republican takeover of Congress.
While Mr. Armey serves as a kind of ambassador for FreedomWorks, the day-to-day task of organizing Tea Party groups has gone to a staff of about 20 hard-charging conservatives in their 20s and 30s -- a striking contrast to a movement that is made up largely of people twice their age and more. Tea Party leaders at the boot camp gasped when Mr. Steinhauser emphasized the importance of going after so-called Reagan Democrats and then noted that he himself was not born until 1981, after Ronald Reagan's first inauguration.
Staff members like to say that they model FreedomWorks on the Grateful Dead or Virgin Atlantic Airways: they want to build a like-minded community, an endeavor that is as much fun as work.
But they are also deeply ideological; a portrait of Ayn Rand hangs on the office walls along with one of Jerry Garcia. FreedomWorks was founded to promote the theories of the Austrian economic school, which argues that economic models are useless because they cannot account for all the variables of human behavior, and that markets must be unfettered to succeed.
New employees receive a required-reading list that includes ''Rules for Radicals,'' by Saul Alinsky, the father of modern community organizing, and ''A Force More Powerful,'' about 20th-century social movements, as well as Frederic Bastiat's ''The Law,'' which argues that governments are essentially stealing when they tax their citizens to spend on welfare, infrastructure or public education. FreedomWorks urges Tea Party groups to read the same works. (''It's better than 'Going Rogue,' '' said Mr. Steinhauser, referring to Ms. Palin's memoir.)
While other conservative groups have tried to mobilize the Tea Party energy, FreedomWorks moved first, and most aggressively. Hours after Rick Santelli called for ''a Chicago tea party'' in a widely viewed rant on CNBC in February 2009, it put up a Web site with tips on how to hold a tea party, then a Google map of events. As more people found the map on Web searches, they e-mailed FreedomWorks information on their own events, ultimately allowing Mr. Steinhauser to compile a list of thousands of Tea Party contacts across the country.
That list allowed the group to mobilize volunteers to Massachusetts in January to campaign for Scott P. Brown, who won the United States Senate seat that had been occupied by Edward M. Kennedy for nearly 50 years, and to Utah to elect Mike Lee as the Republican nominee for Senate after Tea Party groups deposed the three-term incumbentRobert F. Bennett. About 180,000 people voted in the primary that Mr. Lee won; FreedomWorks says 30,000 had received a phone call or a visit from its volunteers.
Its candidates are libertarians and economic conservatives, but in the 2010 midterm elections, FreedomWorks is urging Tea Party groups to work for any Republican, on the theory that a compromised Republican is better than Democratic control of Congress.
Mr. Steinhauser has traveled to 42 states to train local groups or meet with leaders in races where FreedomWorks hopes to make a difference. But the Tea Parties like to think of themselves as leaderless organizations, and are suspicious of attempts to co-opt their energy.
In a swing through New England last month, he met with activists eager to defeat Charlie Bass, a former Republican congressman from New Hampshire who is running again in the Sept. 14 primary. But they did not want to endorse either of the Tea Party candidates because they feared their membership would resent anything that looked like top-down control. ''You have to endorse,'' Mr. Steinhauser told them. ''If you don't, the bad guys will.'' Each group should endorse separately, he advised, so that the local news media would write a new story each time.
Still, the activists were eager for outside advice.
''If you give us the education, we'll do the work,'' Robert Horr, the chairman of the Cumberland County Tea Party, in Maine, told him. ''Just aim us.''
Mr. Steinhauser encouraged the Maine activists to start getting behind candidates to challenge Senator Olympia J. Snowe, a Republican up for re-election in 2012.
FreedomWorks is focused particularly on midterm races in Florida, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania. For the boot camp in Washington, it had flown in representatives from those states.
Nan Swift, FreedomWorks's campaign manager, encouraged them to stage dramatic events to call attention to their candidates -- ''Everyone already thinks we're crazy, embrace it!'' -- and to sign up for their opponents' e-mails, then go to their events and swamp them with signs.
Mr. Steinhauser urged them not to waste their energy on districts so deeply Democratic that they cannot be won.
Still, he did not cut off any opportunity; after all, he noted, no one thought Scott Brown could win. ''This year, if there's one message you can take away,'' he said, ''it's that nothing is impossible for us.''

HEADLINE: Social Networking Your Way to a New Job

BYLINE: By FARHAD MANJOO

 BODY:
UNTIL just a few years ago, looking for a job was a relatively straightforward process. Write a resume. Scour job sites or the classifieds. Submit an application for listings that seem appropriate. Reach out to recruiters. Then, wait.
''It doesn't work that way at all anymore,'' said Nancy Halverson, senior vice president for learning and talent development at the recruiting firm MRINetwork.
Like everything else in business, the job-search process has undergone a revolution since the advent of Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other social networking sites. Job hunters today must learn to navigate the sometimes slippery social mores of online discourse -- for instance, learning to promote themselves without coming off as self-involved. 
At the same time, they must be constantly vigilant about managing their online reputation; the slightest slip may discourage potential employers.
''It's almost like social media has replaced the white pages,'' Ms. Halverson said. ''Recruiters don't even know how to find you if you don't have a presence online. It's nonnegotiable -- you have to have a profile on a social networking site.''
For many people looking for work, however, the technological requirements of the modern job hunt present a profound hurdle. Increasingly, these people are turning up for help at the career offices and continuing education departments of their local universities and community colleges.
''Teaching people how to use these new tools is really becoming one of the main things that we do in career counseling offices,'' said Nancy Richmond, assistant director of career counseling and exploration at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''We're showing them that using social media is a great way to show employers that they're on the forefront of cutting-edge trends. It can be extremely helpful for their careers.''
Twice a semester, Ms. Richmond's office holds workshops teaching students and alumni how to use LinkedIn and other social networks. She also offers one-on-one tutoring to help people brush up their online profiles and counseling on how to approach potential employers or networking contacts online.
Such sessions have become a mainstay at colleges around the country -- often, colleges say, because students are demanding them. This fall, the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire will offer a series of continuing education courses called ''The Language of Social Media,'' which aim to give people a quick on-ramp to the world of online networking.
The course came out of a series of classes that Laurie Boettcher, a local social media enthusiast, had been teaching at her chapter of the Chamber of Commerce; the courses were so well attended, a university spokeswoman said, that the school decided to take up the series for itself.
''We think it's important not just to teach people why they should have a presence online, but also to teach them about how to be consistent -- what's appropriate in how you represent yourself online, and how you should go about promoting yourself,'' Ms. Boettcher said.
It's sometimes a tricky process, as many people looking for work have never had reason to set up a presence online and have no idea how to go about it. These people worked in industries like manufacturing, where Facebook and Twitter weren't a part of daily life. Or they had plugged away at the same company for decades and never felt the need to make a resume, let alone a LinkedIn page describing their job history.
In an economy that ejected people from jobs suddenly, and with such finality, career counselors say, these people feel bereft -- they have all the skills necessary for new jobs, but few of the skills required for the job-search process.
It's not the technical skills that are the toughest to master; what's often more difficult for people who haven't used networking sites, say job coaches, is mastering the subtle social skills involved in asking people online for help.
It's an art that can befuddle even technically adept people. In 2008, Oliver Schmid, an I.T. consultant based in Los Angeles, lost his job with a German technology company. Jumping into the job market for the first time in 20 years, Mr. Schmid did what job seekers have always done -- he sent out his resume and waited for companies to call him back. He didn't get any takers.
''People who looked at my resume just didn't seem to fall in love,'' Mr. Schmid said. The real problem, Mr. Schmid said he believed, was that the resume didn't tell his whole story -- it didn't explain his range of experiences, nor the full measure of his passion and creativity on the job.
Scouring the Web for tips on job hunting, Mr. Schmid found several sites and forums with advice on how to set up his ''personal brand'' online. He began to blog about his work and then to use Twitter to reach out to others in his profession.
''I was very uncoordinated at first, really stumbling a lot. I didn't know what I was doing or what to talk about,'' he said. But over a period of a few months, Mr. Schmid got the hang of it -- he got better at writing short posts about his work, at pointing out his posts to the right people on Twitter and being consistent, but not overbearing, in advertising himself.
All of this took a lot of work. Miriam Salpeter, a job coach based in Atlanta, says that one of the main conversations she has with unemployed people concerns expectations -- even if you do everything online correctly, there's no guarantee you'll find a job immediately.
''What you're really trying to do on social networks is expand your sphere of influence,'' Ms. Salpeter said. ''You want to grow the number of people that know about you. As more people get to know about you and see who you are, that can pay off.''
That's how things played out for Mr. Schmid. A former colleague noticed his posts on Twitter and recommended Mr. Schmid for a freelance position with a Norwegian technology company.
Mr. Schmid landed an interim freelancing position with the firm, which later turned into a longer-term contract. Without Twitter, he said, he probably would not have found the job. ''They weren't looking for me -- they just spotted me online, and it worked out,'' Mr. Schmid said.

HEADLINE: A High-Tech Titan Plagued by Potholes

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
PUNE, India -- Call it India's engineering paradox.
Despite this nation's rise as a technology titan with some of the world's best engineering minds, India's full economic potential is stifled by potholed roadways, collapsing bridges, rickety railroads and a power grid so unreliable that many modern office buildings run their own diesel generators to make sure the lights and computers stay on.
It is not for want of money. The Indian government aims to spend $500 billion on infrastructure by 2012 and twice that amount in the following five years.
The problem is a dearth of engineers -- or at least the civil engineers with the skill and expertise to make sure those ambitious projects are done on time and up to specifications. 
Civil engineering was once an elite occupation in India, not only during the British colonial era of carving roads and laying train tracks, but also long after independence as part of the civil service. These days, though, India's best and brightest know there is more money and prestige in writing software for foreign customers than in building roadways for their nation.
And so it is that 26-year-old Vishal Mandvekar, despite his bachelor's degree in civil engineering, now writes software code for a Japanese automaker.
Mr. Mandvekar works in an air-conditioned building with Silicon Valley amenities here in Pune, a boomtown about 100 miles east of Mumbai. But getting to and from work requires him to spend a vexing hour on his motorcycle, navigating the crowded, cratered roads between home and his office a mere nine miles away.
During the monsoon season, the many potholes ''are filled with water and you can't tell how deep they are until you hit one,'' he said.
Fixing all that, though, will remain some other engineer's problem.
Mr. Mandvekar earns a salary of about $765 a month. That is more than three times what he made during his short stint for a commercial contractor, supervising construction of lodging for a Sikh religious group, after he earned his degree in 2006.
''It was fun doing that,'' he said of the construction job. ''My only dissatisfaction was the pay package.''
Young Indians' preference for software over steel and concrete poses an economic conundrum for India. Its much-envied information technology industry generates tens of thousands of relatively well-paying jobs every year. But that lure also continues the exodus of people qualified to build the infrastructure it desperately needs to improve living conditions for the rest of its one billion people -- and to bolster the sort of industries that require good highways and railroads more than high-speed Internet links to the West.
In 1990, civil engineering programs had the capacity to enroll 13,500 students, while computer science and information technology departments could accept but 12,100. Yet by 2007, after a period of incredible growth in India's software outsourcing business, computer science and other information technology programs ballooned to 193,500; civil engineering climbed to only 22,700. Often, those admitted to civil engineering programs were applicants passed over for highly competitive computer science tracks.
There are various other reasons that India has struggled to build a modern infrastructure, including poor planning, political meddling and outright corruption. But the shortage of civil engineers is an important factor. In 2008, the World Bank estimated that India would need to train three times as many civil engineers as it does now to meet its infrastructure needs.
The government has ''kick-started a massive infrastructure development program without checking on the manpower supply,'' said Atul Bhobe, managing director of S. N. Bhobe & Associates, a civil engineering design company. ''The government is willing to spend $1 trillion,'' he said, ''but you don't have the wherewithal to spend that kind of money.''
Sujay Kalele, an executive with Kolte-Patil, a Pune-based developer of residential and commercial buildings, said the company's projects could be completed as much as three months faster if it could find enough skilled engineers.
''If we need 10 good-quality civil engineers, we may get four or five,'' Mr. Kalele said.
Beyond construction delays and potholes, experts say, the engineering shortfall poses outright dangers. Last year, for example, an elevated span that was part of New Delhi's much-lauded metro rail system collapsed, killing six people and injuring more than a dozen workers. A government report partly blamed faulty design for the accident; metro officials said they would now require an additional review of all designs by independent engineers.
Acknowledging India's chronic shortage of civil engineers and other specialists, the national government is building 30 universities and considering letting foreign institutions set up campuses in the country.
''India has embarked on its largest education expansion program since independence,'' the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, said in a speech last year in Washington.
But the government may have only so much influence on what students study. And while the Indian government runs or finances some of the country's most prestigious universities, like the Indian Institutes of Technology, fast-growing private institutions now train more students. About three-quarters of engineering students study at private colleges.
Moreover, many civil engineers who earn degrees in the discipline never work in the profession or -- like Mr. Mandvekar -- leave it soon after they graduate to take better-paying jobs in information technology, management consulting or financial services.
Industry experts say a big obstacle to attracting more civil engineers is the paltry entry-level pay. The field was considered relatively lucrative until the 1990s, when it was eclipsed by the pay in commercial software engineering.
Ravi Sinha, a civil engineering professor at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, says professionals in his field with five years of experience make about as much as their counterparts at information technology companies. But those starting can make as little as half the pay of their technology peers.
That is partly because of the lead set by government departments, where salaries for civil engineers are often fixed according to nearly immutable civil service formulas.
And in the private sector, developers and construction companies have often been reluctant to pay more and invest in the training of young engineers, because executives believe that new graduates do not contribute enough to merit more money or that they will leave for other jobs anyway.
''If companies take a holistic view,'' Mr. Sinha said, ''they have the opportunity to develop the next generation's leaders.''
In fact, a construction boom in recent years has led to higher salaries in private industry. Kolte-Patil now pays junior engineers $425 a month, nearly twice the level of five years ago.
Larsen & Toubro, a Mumbai-based engineering company that builds airports, power projects and other infrastructure, offers Build India Scholarships for students who want to pursue a master's degree in construction technology and management. The program produces 50 to 60 graduates a year, who are hired by the company.
''You don't get the best quality in civil engineers, because today the first choice for students is other branches'' of engineering, said K. P. Raghavan, an executive vice president in L.& T.'s construction division. ''We are compensating with lots of training.''

 BODY:
Christoph Schlingensief, a filmmaker, theater director and political gadfly who made it his life's work to upset German complacency and the status quo, died on Saturday in Berlin. He was 49.
His death was announced by Oliver Golloch, a spokesman for the Ruhr Triennale festival, where Mr. Schlingensief had been working on the premier of his play ''S.M.A.S.H.: Suffocating in Aid,'' before his declining health forced its cancellation in July. No details on the cause of death were provided, but Mr. Schlingensief had been ill with lung cancer for several years.
Mr. Schlingensief (pronounced SHLIN-gun-zeef), who once described his artistic program as ''total irritation,'' waged a tireless assault on received opinion in the arts and politics for more than two decades. He cast repentant neo-Nazis in a Zurich production of ''Hamlet'' and managed to combine political fable and splatter film in ''The German Chainsaw Massacre'' (1990), a mad vision of German reunification. 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the leader of the conservative Christian Democratic Union, was a favorite target. In 1998 Mr. Schlingensief invited all of Germany's unemployed to swim in the Wolfgangsee lake in Austria, where Mr. Kohl was headed for a holiday. In theory, their combined body weight would cause the lake to flood the resort region of Salzkammergut.
During a performance at the 1997 Documenta art exhibition in Kassel, he nailed up a poster calling for Mr. Kohl's assassination, a provocation that led to his arrest. In 1998 he formed a political party, Chance 2000, which urged Germans to vote for themselves in the 2000 national elections.
''Schlingensief was a hugely influential artist in Germany,'' Tara Forrest, an editor of ''Christoph Schlingensief: Art Without Borders,'' recently published by the University of Chicago Press, wrote in an e-mail message. His work, she said, ''encouraged the audience to think critically and creatively about issues like immigration, unemployment, homelessness, the rights of disabled people and the Nazi legacy in contemporary Germany.''
Christoph Maria Schlingensief was born on Oct. 24, 1960, in Oberhausen, in the industrial Ruhr valley. His father was a pharmacist and his mother a pediatric nurse. As a child he made short films with a hand-held camera, but he twice failed to gain admission to the Munich School of Film and Television. For a time he studied German language and literature, philosophy and art history, but dropped out of school to work as an assistant to the experimental filmmaker Werner Nekes.
After making several low-budget independent films, he came to public attention with his ''Germany Trilogy'' (1989-92), a raucous, absurdist depiction of modern German history, replete with sex and violence, that included ''100 Years of Adolf Hitler: The Last Hours in the Fuhrer's Bunker,'' ''The German Chainsaw Massacre'' and ''Terror 2000 -- Intensive Care Unit Germany.''
Reviewing ''Terror 2000'' for The New York Times, Stephen Holden wrote: ''If a Keystone Kops film were written by William S. Burroughs, peopled with characters from George Grosz by way of Russ Meyer and directed in a style that suggests Jean-Luc Godard on speed, you would have a movie with the style and mood of 'Terror 2000.' ''
In 1993 Mr. Schlingensief was invited to mount a stage version of ''Terror 2000'' at the Volksbuhne Theater in Berlin. The result, ''100 Years of the Christian Democratic Union: A Game With No Limits,'' was a multimedia satire on contemporary Germany that included massacres, simulated orgasms, excrement, vomit and an appearance by the author as a kind of ringmaster in the final act. One German critic summed up the production as ''resolutely juvenile and unspeakably German.''
Delighted at the response -- the words appear on Mr. Schlingensief's official Web site (schlingensief.com) -- Mr. Schlingensief went on to direct several other plays at the theater, including ''Kuhnen 94, Bring Me the Head of Adolf Hitler,'' its title referring to the neo-Nazi leader Michael Kuhnen.
In the late 1990s, Mr. Schlingensief reached a broader audience as the director and unpredictable host of the television interview show ''Talk 2000,'' a high-risk proposition for guests, since Mr. Schlingensief would occasionally turn on them, start talking about his personal problems or simply nod off as the cameras rolled.
In ''U3000,'' a wilder talk-show venture, he moved frantically from car to car on the Berlin metro with camera crew in tow. ''Freakstars 3000,'' his answer to shows like ''American Idol,'' invited Germans with disabilities to display their talents.
His production of Wagner's ''Parsifal'' at the 2004 Bayreuth Festival, despite a dead hare onstage, failed to administer the expected shock treatment. ''Schlingensief was here, but Bayreuth is still standing,'' a critic for the weekly Die Zeit wrote.
Far more contentious were his political street performances, notably ''Please Love Austria,'' a stunt inspired by the reality television series ''Big Brother.'' Shortly after a far-right, anti-immigration party joined Austria's governing coalition in 2000, Mr. Schlingensief arranged for a dozen asylum seekers to live for a week in a shipping container placed next to the Vienna Opera House. As part of the provocation, Austrians were asked to vote two of them out of the country each day.
Much of his later work, like the play ''Atta Atta: Art Has Broken Out,'' an inquiry into art's possibilities in a violent world, and the art and theater project ''Church of Fear,'' dealt with the global political climate after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
After learning he had lung cancer (he was not a smoker), Mr. Schlingensief wrote about his illness and in 2009 published ''Heaven Could Not Be as Beautiful as Here: A Cancer Diary.''
He also began writing his memoirs, which were scheduled to be published next month, and threw his declining energies into creating an opera village in Burkina Faso that was to include an opera house, a theater and film school, and an infirmary.
He is survived by his longtime assistant, the costume designer Aino Laberenz, whom he married last August.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Helping New Parents While Confronting Her Own Fatal Illness

BYLINE: By GLENN RIFKIN

 BODY:
During her first pregnancy, in the mid-1980s, Karen Storek was desperate for information about giving birth and caring for her baby. She decided that there needed to be a place where new parents could gather and disseminate parenting advice, from before conception to the first grade.
Always an activist with dreams of changing the world, Ms. Storek founded New Parents Network in 1988 and began to collect information. She distributed it through packets given to new parents as they left hospitals in and around Tucson.
The packets offered answers to vital questions: where to get immunization shots, where to get help for a child born with a disability and where to find support groups.
In 1991, on a donated computer with a 40-megabyte hard drive and a dial-up modem, Ms. Storek moved New Parents Network to an online community bulletin board. Three years later, she created the New Parents Network Web site and began to reach people not just nationally but internationally. 
Today, the site receives as many as 4,000 page views an hour and an average of 30,000 unique visitors a month. New Parents Network, a nonprofit organization, is supported by foundation grants, individual donations and corporate financing from the likes of Walgreens and Cigna Healthcare.
For 23 years, Ms. Storek has run the organization by herself with the help of volunteers. But early this decade, she noticed that her handwriting was starting to look odd and that walking was becoming difficult. She learned she had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Lou Gehrig's disease. Ms. Storek, now 50, talked recently about coming to grips with her disease and her plans for her organization. A condensed version of the conversation follows.
Q.What were your first thoughts when the disease was diagnosed?
A. I went to the Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale, and I simply did not accept their diagnosis. I ended up living nearly 10 years just pretending that I didn't have it. That actually helped me get through each day. I am fortunate that I have a rare form of the disease where I can walk, I can swim. I'm very active, and I work full time. But that could change at any moment.
Q.Are you still in denial?
A. No. I have accepted that I have this awful disease, and I've seen how it progresses. My speech is slow. I've just begun to experience some respiratory problems. I had a baclofen pump installed in my abdomen in order to deliver an anti-spasticity medicine, which helps me walk. My hope and my doctor's hope is that I could live another 20 years. But it could get much worse in a year, so I force myself to stay active.
Q. How has the illness affected your organization?
A. I feel that this job has given me a reason to live. And that's such a gift. I used to complain about the 60 hours a week I was putting into N.P.N. as a divorced, single mother of two young boys. But now, in retrospect, I am incredibly grateful that I stuck with N.P.N. and that it is my full-time job.
Q.Are there activities you have had to give up?
A. I have problems with walking due to a loss of balance, and I've developed breathing problems, so I can't go to as many meetings as I used to. I make an extreme effort to get out of the house every day so I am not totally isolated.
Q.What is a typical day like for you?
A. I get up at 5 a.m. and practice a form of meditation. I'll then go swimming in our community pool. I've tried to create a regular schedule because having a routine is important. After I swim, I get on the computer and also the phone, raising money, incorporating new tips for the Web site and tweeting tips as well. My next step is to start a blog. I probably still work 45 hours a week.
Q. Has financial support for the site become an issue?
A. A lot of nonprofits are struggling because of the economy, but our funding has remained pretty consistent.
Q.Given all of the information on the Internet, is there still a need for a site like N.P.N.?
A. Of course. Hospitals and health-related companies are seeing more than ever the value of having one place to go to get this kind of information. That's been the concept since the beginning, and it's still working 23 years later.
Q.What are your plans for the organization if you become too ill to keep it going?
A. That is where my board of directors comes in. I only recently told them about my disease, and they are in the midst of creating a strategic plan with me right now that will outline where our funding will come from and what N.P.N. would look like without its founder.
Q.Have you found a successor?
A. I haven't yet. It is something I am actively looking for, not only a successor but someone who can help me with N.P.N. should I live another 20 years.
Q.With all this happening, has N.P.N. been able to expand its reach?
A. My vision for N.P.N., which has really kept me going for the past six years, has been to create a multilingual, culturally sensitive cellphone app that would send parenting tips to people around the world. Even in the third world, people have cellphones, and this could be a free service supported by corporate advertising -- for example, Honda could have a 10-second ad that would precede a safety tip about car seats.
These tips, which I've been collecting by the thousands for 23 years, can save a life. Letting a pregnant woman know, for example, that taking folic acid during pregnancy can prevent diseases such as spina bifida could be a great benefit. I see this as a service that would not only reach new parents but educators and health care professionals as well. If there is a vision that has kept me alive and a project that has fueled me, it has been that.
Q.What are you doing to make the vision happen?
A. I have been working for the last few years with major cellphone providers and wireless companies to get this going. I don't have a formal commitment yet, but I'm very close with one major cellphone company. My hope is that it will be a reality within the next six months.
Q.Have you considered doing a similar Web site for people trying to cope with Lou Gehrig's disease?
A. Yes. I'm thinking more of a blog than a Web site. I'd like to raise awareness about this disease because it is often labeled as a rare affliction, but I read somewhere that there are something like 320 new cases of Lou Gehrig's disease diagnosed every day around the world. It's rare, but not as rare as some people think.
Q.What kind of advice would your blog give?
A. I'd share my journey from being a healthy adult, and how I took jumping out of bed and living my life so much for granted. When something like this happens, you feel very grateful for every moment. I am not religious, and I'm very practical about my relationship with God. I am not angry about my disease. I'm incredibly empathetic to the untold numbers of people who are really suffering. My blog would describe my growth as a human being through this process and how it affected my work and my empathy for others -- how I've realized that walking well is so incredibly underrated.

HEADLINE: Learning Curves On the Career Path

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
''Every day we know less and less about more and more,'' said Ray Caprio, vice president for continuing education at Rutgers University.
That, he said, goes far to explain why so many people, including engineers, teachers, bankers, museum workers and public relations aides, are concluding that they need to return to school, often years after receiving their bachelor's degrees.
With the world growing ever more complex and new technologies being developed every day, it's hardly surprising that millions of Americans have returned to campus. Some return to their alma maters or other colleges, some pursue continuing education at graduate schools and some turn to their local community college. Many experts say continuing education is more important than ever because most college graduates will go through five to seven job changes over their careers.
''To sustain themselves as competitive employees during their career, they're probably going to need the equivalent of several more years of studying, although not necessarily in degree programs,'' Mr. Caprio said. 
To improve their workers' skills, some employers provide in-house courses or underwrite elaborate executive education programs. But most workers are on their own when they want to take courses to increase their skills in the hope of climbing the career ladder.
David Gillbank lost his job at an advertising firm last summer. Unemployed, he debated what would give him a leg up in finding work. The path for him, he concluded, was in green marketing.
So he enrolled in a new program in global sustainability at the University of California, Los Angeles. It involved nine classes, including courses on renewable energy, principles of sustainability and green marketing. As part of the program, he worked with an elementary school in Hollywood to help it develop a program to conserve energy and follow other principles of sustainability.
''I really learned some skills to add to my resume,'' Mr. Gillbank said.
But that was not the only benefit. ''It's a good way to fill the gap in my resume,'' he added. ''Everyone's asking me, what have I done in my past year? Everyone appreciates that I've done something substantial with my time.''
Mr. Gillbank's certificate in sustainability has helped him land interviews, he said, but he has not yet nailed down a job.
Some people have worked at a prosperous company for five years and are eager to move up, or are unemployed and eager to reinvent themselves. Still others are in an industry where successive waves of downsizing have made job security seem shaky. And more of them are concluding that if there is an answer to their problems, it's more education.
At Rutgers, many ambitious 30- and 40-somethings are studying for mini-M.B.A.'s, taking condensed, intense business programs to quickly fortify themselves with new expertise and increase their chances of getting a promotion -- and soon. At U.C.L.A., many who aspire to a career in Hollywood are taking courses in producing, screenwriting, television writing and music production. At Macomb Community College in Michigan, many former white-collar workers from Detroit's automakers are plunging into health care courses and careers.
Anyone who has been out of college for five, 10 or 15 years and is thinking of returning to school has important questions to explore before jumping back in. Many colleges have counselors to advise would-be students, often helping on matters like whether to pursue a degree program like an M.B.A. or go for a certificate program, which sometimes requires four, six or eight courses and attests to attaining a specific expertise, like project management.
''I would go first to an institution that has these kinds of learner representatives to ask these questions, to do the drilling down that helps individuals sort out what is best for them,'' said Mary Nichols, dean of the University of Minnesota's college of continuing education.
Any good continuing education program, Dean Nichols said, takes an individualized approach to its students. ''We're not in the business of steering people toward things,'' she said. ''We're in the business of helping people capitalize on their strengths and put together ways to build on their interests and passions.''
Cathy A. Sandeen, dean of continuing education at U.C.L.A., suggested, ''Look at trends in your field. Look at your current skills and what do you need to augment your skills to make you more relevant and more attractive in your field.''
That's sound advice for someone whose company or industry is going strong. But experts on continuing education say it's important to take an honest, hard look at the state of your company and industry, and at whether your job is safe or whether you may soon become obsolete. The conclusion might be to consider a career change and perhaps to view continuing education as a conduit to a new career.
''Because of today's tough economic times, we're seeing more people considering career changes,'' said Emily Westerman, director of the office of career management at the New York University School of Continuing and Professional Studies. ''Career change is being thrust upon people rather than being a personal choice. A few years ago it was quite the opposite. Back then, it was driven by one's own personal passion to do something else.''
She added, ''The first step is to take a step back and evaluate what it is you want. You want to evaluate your current career situation. Is it that your company doesn't have a bright future? Does your industry not have a bright future? Regardless of the future of your company or industry, do you think something else will be preferable? Does the reality of the industry dictate that you will need to move in a different direction?''
Then, consider what field to pursue. ''You want to ask what are your values, what are your needs, what skills of yours do you really enjoy?'' Ms. Westerman said. ''What are skills you'd like to develop? What are some careers you've thought about during your life?''
Amy Inzanti felt a hankering to increase her skills and spread her wings during her six years in public relations and then business development at the American Museum of Natural History.
''I knew if I was to get a bigger and better job, I had to get a better understanding of the communications landscape,'' said Ms. Inzanti, who graduated in 2000 from Johns Hopkins, where she majored in political science. ''I loved my employer to death, but were they going to teach me marketing or leveraging new social media? I wasn't going to learn that on the job.''
She heard of a program at Columbia University that offered exactly what she wanted, a master of science in strategic communication. It combined marketing with finance and analytical tools, like measurement and evaluation. And Columbia was just a few subway stops from the museum, making it easy for her to rush to class after work.
For three ultra-busy years, Ms. Inzanti did little else but work for the museum and study at Columbia. Her favorite course was Delivering the Strategic Message.
''The program gave me all the tools to do my current job,'' she said. ''They have a lot of networking events, and they also have guest speakers.''
Soon after graduating she landed a job with the Porter Novelli public relations firm, where she is a vice president for strategic planning and research.
An often unappreciated benefit of continuing education is the networking advantages provided by professors and fellow students. Many professors continue to work in their field and have myriad contacts. Those connections often help their students get a foot in the door -- and sometimes a job, too.
At a time when the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that there are five unemployed people for every job opening nationwide, college officials say several fields of continuing education have special promise. U.C.L.A. offers a series of courses in regulatory compliance issues for hospitals and other health care institutions, anticipating that hospitals will be doing lots of hiring because of the huge new regulatory requirements contained in the federal health care overhaul.
With the military involved in Iraq and Afghanistan, Macomb Community College has recommended that former white-collar auto workers study for jobs in supply-chain logistics to help the Army with its tanks and materiel. The Army's tank-automotive command is adding 800 workers in Warren, Mich., and many nearby military contractors are hiring, as well.
Other growing fields include hospital management, real estate management, project management, science teaching, addiction counseling and nonprofit fund-raising, education experts say.
In New Jersey, which has 566 municipalities, Rutgers says there are promising careers in municipal finance. Noting that many municipal finance directors will soon retire, Rutgers recommends this field to bankers, corporate finance workers and accountants who might be worried about their future.
Nancy Haberle, who spent 21 years in corporate finance at Johanna Foods, a dairy company, took that advice. Ms. Haberle, who graduated from Delaware Valley College in 1980 with an accounting degree, obtained her license in municipal finance after taking continuing education courses at Rutgers in budgeting, utilities, capital and trust accounting and principles of financial management. That helped her land a job as chief finance officer and tax collector for the Township of Hillsborough, N.J.
''I can tell you right now that I'm earning $25,000 more than I would in the private sector,'' she said. ''The professors in the program were great. I sometimes still contact them when I face some tough questions on municipal finance.''
Jim Sawyer, the provost of Macomb Community College, says white-collar workers laid off by Detroit's Big Three often have little choice but to consider new careers. Some, he said, follow a surprising and somewhat humbling route when they enroll at his school: they take a full-time eight-week program to become certified nurse's assistants, a job that frequently pays under $26,000 a year, often far less than what those workers once earned.
''Many people see that job as a steppingstone, as a great way to get into a health setting and then other health careers, such as respiratory therapists or occupational therapists,'' Mr. Sawyer said. To become certified in those fields requires more study, but those jobs can pay $50,000, helping put those laid-off white-collar workers back into the middle class.
After working 21 years in the auto industry, Sandra Marrin took a buyout from Chrysler, where she supervised a production line that assembled Jeep Grand Cherokees. She plunged into the nursing assistant's program at Macomb and now earns $12 an hour as a certified nurse's assistant, making one-third what she once earned.
''It's a short program, and you can pretty much find employment right away,'' she said. ''I took the buyout because I wasn't quite sure whether Chrysler would be around. I wanted to go into health care.''
As for her humble new job, she said, ''I absolutely love it. It's a totally different field. I enjoyed my automotive career. But this is a new field where I'm dealing with people, and it's hands-on.'' In January, she plans to begin a crash one-year program at Oakland University in Rochester, Mich., to become a registered nurse.
The State of Michigan will pay her full tuition with Trade Adjustment Assistance Act funds. After becoming a nurse, she says, she plans to pursue a master's in nursing with the aim of becoming a manager, confident that will enable her to earn more than she did at Chrysler.
Colleges with continuing education programs try hard to monitor work force trends to create programs that will lead students to jobs in growing fields. Thus, the Macomb program to work with the Army on tanks and U.C.L.A.'s new programs on hospital regulatory compliance and global sustainability.
''People are smart,'' Dean Sandeen of U.C.L.A. said. ''If they want a job, they're going to focus on something that's very current and practical and employers are currently looking for.''
Many students have a choice of taking courses on campus or online, with many students choosing online courses because they offer flexible scheduling and do not require a commute. Mr. Gillbank, the sustainability student, took one online course and wasn't thrilled. ''For me it was worse than other courses,'' he said. ''It didn't give me the interaction with other people. You have to be your own motivation to learn.''
At Rutgers, Mr. Caprio agreed that online courses were not for everyone. ''Unfortunately, you can only find that out by having gone through one,'' he said, adding, ''It takes a certain degree of discipline. There are some students who need and should be in a face-to-face class.''
Some advisers on continuing education tell anxious or unhappy adults to follow their passion -- to study what they love and hope that this will lead to happiness and a job. But with some programs involving eight or 10 courses, sometimes costing $3,000 each, potential students need to think about not just their passions, but also their pocketbooks.
''I'm not one of the career counselors who say, 'Do whatever your passion says,' '' said Ms. Westerman of N.Y.U. ''We also have our practical needs to consider. If you're interested in pursuing an advanced degree, it makes sense to look at whether there are jobs in that field and how much they pay.''
Some experts recommend that the budget-minded look first at public universities or community colleges. There, courses might cost $250 or $500 each, compared with $3,000 at some private universities.
But some public university programs can be expensive. Raul Torres spent $4,995 for an intensive, weeklong course in digital marketing at Rutgers. The professor brought in several leaders in the field to teach the 30 students, many of them engineers like Mr. Torres, some of the latest ways to analyze marketing data on the Web.
Mr. Torres, who had been laid off from his job as a senior database marketing analyst at Scholastic, said that before taking the course, he had been getting many job interviews.
''They kept asking me whether I had any Web analysis experience, any experience in search engine marketing, search engine optimization or mobile marketing,'' he said. ''I had to say no, and that hurt my chances.''
So when he heard about the Rutgers course, he leapt to take it. ''It gave you what you need to know so you can immediately start using it,'' he said. ''It got rid of the fat and gave you the meat you needed.'' As part of the course, each student was given an iPad with ''a ton of reading material loaded onto it,'' Mr. Torres said.
Soon after the course ended, he had more interviews -- and was delighted that he could at last say yes when asked whether he had experience in search engine optimization or mobile marketing. Earlier this month, he happily began his new job as a mobile marketing analyst at Snackable Media, a digital content company in Manhattan.
''There's not a person out there who can't use some skill enhancement,'' said Mr. Caprio of Rutgers, ''because the state of the art is becoming obsolete so quickly that whatever your profession is, it's important to constantly upgrade your knowledge base.''

HEADLINE: Not A Gardener's Best Friend

BYLINE: By MICHAEL TORTORELLO

 BODY:
DID Bertie Wooster mean to harm Barbara Geltosky in September 2008? The evidence against him is damning. For instance, the hole that Bertie, Ms. Geltosky's 5-year-old Norwegian elkhound, dug in the garden was 12 inches across and 12 inches deep -- the perfect size for a human foot.
''It was a hole I didn't see,'' said Ms. Geltosky, 59, a retired art teacher who lives with her husband in Malvern, Pa., some 20 miles west of Philadelphia. ''I was getting compost when I went down. I twisted my knee badly enough to have rehab.''
Mr. Wooster, who is unemployed, declined to be interviewed for this article. Bertie -- the name the dog answers to at treat time -- is black and silver with tuxedo markings on his fur. This double-layered coat, which would make lustrous skiwear for Cruella De Vil, helps to explain his excavation habit. 
In the dog days of summer, Ms. Geltosky said: ''He likes to lay and be cool. Once it warms up, he'll dig another one.''
Bertie works fast. A hole takes 10 minutes flat. Often, he's chasing ground bees. Or he might be following his life's great passion, vole hunting. ''We've had to put flagstone right next to our patio,'' she said. ''My husband's joke is that someday we're going to have to pave the whole yard.''
This would be a particular sacrifice for Ms. Geltosky, who is a digger herself, and has ringed her house with perennial beds filled with five-foot-tall Tatarian aster and phlox.
Recently, she has been compelled to plant something with absolutely no ornamental value: a four-foot-high wire fence. ''We had it shorter, and that didn't work,'' she said. Bertie ''really wanted to be on the other side where all the plants were.''
Bertie is not alone in his appetite for destruction. If gardening is a battle -- against drought, bug, weed, blight -- the dog is a kind of bumbling fifth column, a saboteur who likes to roll on the grass and have his tummy rubbed.
Ask gardeners to describe their dogs, and you will not often hear the profile of a loyal lieutenant. You will hear instead about uprooted flowers, shrubs and vegetables. And a trail of urine burns -- on turf and tree -- that would put Sherman's march to shame. The dog plunders low-hanging fruit and leaves pathogenic poop behind. And then, not infrequently, manages to poison itself by wolfing down something toxic.
Dogs and gardens. Gardens and dogs. For compassionate owners everywhere, the two are great and often incompatible loves -- like travel and children, or cliff-diving and single-malt Scotch.
Wild dogs ''don't have that much interaction with plants,'' said James Serpell, a professor of animal welfare at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine. For reasons that are not fully understood, he said, they will occasionally nibble grass, a habit that really ought to cross over as a fad diet on the Web site Goop.
''Dogs look at things in the garden, and they have two questions: can I chew it or can I pee on it?'' said Ian Dunbar, an animal behaviorist and veterinarian in Berkeley, Calif. ''That really is the depth of their philosophy. And they're happy with that.''
Linda Kocher, 48, is something less than happy with the damage her two dogs, Carl and Bud, have inflicted on her garden in Olivette, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis. Both dogs came from the Humane Society, and their breeding is indeterminate. Carl seems to be part greyhound, and he's a bolter.
''Bud is a dachshund-Yorkie mix,'' Ms. Kocher said. ''We call him a dorkie.''
It is Bud that has taken up the steady task of murdering the boxwoods. Ms. Kocher planted a few of the evergreen shrubs last year, with the notion that their foliage would brighten the yard in winter.
Yet, under a steady stream of Bud's attention (to use a polite term), the leaves have browned and wilted.
''They're doing what dogs like to do,'' Ms. Kocher said. ''You can't get angry with them. You just have to kind of work around them.''
The nitrogen in dog urine would seem to be a helpful fertilizer. In fact, the concentration of ammonium is often toxic to plants. ''If you get one of these trees that every dog has to pee on, they can actually burn the bark,'' said Nina Bassuk, program leader of the Urban Horticulture Institute at Cornell University.
Exactly how many dogs does it take to kill a tree? ''That's something that hasn't been studied,'' Dr. Bassuk said. ''And I'm not going to do it.''
WHEN Anne Heller moved to a house in Santa Barbara, Calif., three years ago, she discovered a small orchard in the yard. The rolling landscape around her family's 1926 Spanish colonial was home to 12 avocado trees, 3 orange trees, a persimmon, a loquat, a plum, a peach and an apricot.
Her favorite tree might be a ''yellow lime'' that throws off fruit like beads at a Mardi Gras parade. ''I call it the Giving Tree,'' said Ms. Heller, 52, who uses the harvest for margaritas.
Unbeknown to Ms. Heller, her 12-year-old chocolate Lab, Moose, had his own favorite tree. One clue was the large, stony pits that started turning up in the dog's feces. Another clue: he could be found standing upright, on his hind legs, plucking fruit off the lower branches.
Moose was addicted to loquats, a small, super-sweet Chinese import that is a distant cousin to an apple.
Ms. Heller indulges this bit of thievery, as Moose is nearly deaf these days. Or pretending to be nearly deaf. ''I guess I'm a pushover,'' she said. ''I was stricter with my children.''
Given the size of her property -- almost three acres -- Ms. Heller is often less than dutiful about picking up dog poop. Moose generally wanders to the corner of a distant field. But Pebbles, Ms. Heller's adopted Australian shepherd, ''likes to poop right in the garden,'' she said. ''In my mind, it's just fertilizer.''
Fertilizer that might contain the Toxocara canis parasite, according to Sharon Patton, a veterinary parasitologist and a professor at the University of Tennessee College of Veterinary Medicine. (''Worms, bugs, blood and guts are my specialty,'' Dr. Patton said.) Toxocara nematodes, or roundworms, live in the intestines of dogs, particularly puppies. And the eggs pass via dog feces.
These eggs can remain in the soil for years. Or, occasionally, the eggs hatch into larvae inside a human host who has mistakenly ingested them, say, from the strawberry patch.
Toxocara larvae are restless houseguests. They like to migrate into human tissue, where they can cause aches and fevers. Another holiday destination: the retina.
''In people, we refer to it as ocular larval migrans,'' Dr. Patton said. In rare cases, it can lead to blindness.
Last fall, Pebbles came down with giardiasis, a disease caused by giardia, a one-celled parasite that infects the gastrointestinal tract. Ms. Heller suspects her dog picked it up by drinking from a stream during one of their long walks through the Santa Ynez Mountains, north of town.
Then, in January, Ms. Heller herself contracted the disease, which is marked by nausea, fatigue and digestive grief. ''It took a month to kind of feel better,'' she said.
The kinds of giardia that infect dogs are often different from the ones that plague humans, Dr. Patton said. ''But occasionally we do think there is some crossover,'' she said.
For the record, Dr. Patton does not recommend leaving dog feces anywhere in the garden.
OSCAR WILD is a good boy. He does his business where he's told: the side yard of an old stone carriage house in Ridgefield, Conn., by the border of Westchester County. In the daytime, he likes to lounge outside on the thick-cushioned patio chairs. At night, he sleeps in the bed of Julie Cencebaugh, a 44-year-old painter, who once owned a gallery in Chelsea.
By breeding, the dog is a 4-year-old Brussels griffon. By temperament, ''Oscar is part chicken,'' Ms. Cencebaugh said.
Oscar keeps close track of developments in Ms. Cencebaugh's garden. The plantings are formal and English close to the house. Native varieties spill out toward a 350-acre state park that borders the two-and-a-half-acre property.
''You can't slip a new plant in without him realizing,'' Ms. Cencebaugh said. ''He'll sniff the flowers, but he doesn't do any damage.''
Oscar's restraint is a boon not just to Ms. Cencebaugh's garden, but also to his own well-being. The ASPCA maintains an alphabetical compendium of 393 plants that can be harmful when ingested by dogs. It includes apples (the seeds and leaves contain cyanide), baby's breath (gyposinen), chamomile (bisabolol, chamazulene, anthemic acid, tannic acid) and deadly nightshade (which shouldn't be a surprise). If something green is growing in the yard, it's probably on the list.
Given all these ready hazards, it seems flukish that Oscar got into trouble by eating cocoa mulch. With company coming, Ms. Cencebaugh had spread four bags of the fragrant shells on her garden paths.
The smell appealed to Oscar. What did not agree were the stimulants -- caffeine and theobromine -- that he consumed with the mulch.
''He was like Ricochet Rabbit,'' Ms. Cencebaugh said, ''bouncing off the wall.'' First, she called poison control. Then she shut him in the bathroom for his own protection. ''The next day he was fine,'' Ms. Cencebaugh said.
Outside, the mulch disappeared for good. But Oscar Wild never knew it was gone. Oscar was back inside, on the softest part of the bed, where a dog naturally belongs.

HEADLINE: Homemaking as a Metaphor

BYLINE: By PENELOPE GREEN

 BODY:
HANCOCK, N.H.
WHEN Mary Catherine Bateson was a freshman at Radcliffe, she and the man she was dating went to hear her mother, Margaret Mead, lecture on the future of the American family. Afterward, back in her beau's room, Dr. Bateson averred that the future of the American family would surely not include her, because with role models like her parents -- Dr. Bateson likes to say that her mother was thrice divorced while her father, the British anthropologist Gregory Bateson, was thrice married -- she would never, ever marry.
''How could I possibly know how?'' she said.
Yet by the end of that conversation, Dr. Bateson, who went on to have careers as an anthropologist, linguist and author, and J. Barkev Kassarjian, now a professor of management and a business consultant, found themselves engaged. 
Fifty years later, Dr. Bateson and Dr. Kassarjian are still married -- turns out, Dr. Bateson is very good at domesticity -- and still living in the same New Hampshire woods, on the property they bought together as graduate students in 1963. (They also have an apartment in Cambridge, Mass.) The ''spread'' -- an 18th-century farmhouse, a decent barn and a shed on 100 acres -- cost $15,000, a fortune for two young academics who took out a bank loan guaranteed by Dr. Mead to buy it, Dr. Bateson said.
''Golly, it's a lot of years ago,'' she added, shaking her head.
Dr. Bateson, once known as Dr. Spock's first baby and a product of ''the best-documented childhood in the United States,'' as she wrote in a memoir about her parents, is now 70. Yet, as her mother did, she is still hashing out the particulars of what she calls ''homemaking'' with a new book, ''Composing a Further Life: The Age of Active Wisdom,'' out next month from Knopf.
It was lunchtime on a recent misty weekday. Dr. Bateson and a reporter had shimmied themselves into the legless ''chairs'' in Dr. Bateson's kursi room, a glassy space furnished to mimic the seating arrangements in Persian households. (Dr. Bateson and Dr. Kassarjian lived in Iran before the revolution and adopted a few of its customs.) The room is in a corner of the airy, barn-like house Dr. Bateson and her husband built four years ago on the footprint of the old barn. ''It wasn't a very beautiful barn,'' she said. ''We'd always wanted to bulldoze. It just took us 46 years.''
In Dr. Bateson's parlance, homemaking is not so much about decoration and renovation. Rather, it's a metaphor for community, for the design of an environment -- professional or domestic or societal -- that challenges and supports its inhabitants, an ideal closer to the arrangement of a Samoan village than a perfectly appointed living room. ''It's critical that home not just be a place that you use whatever is there, but that it be a place you are truly responsible for,'' she said. ''It's not just your home and you get to mess it up.''
Homemaking, she added, is also a metaphor for longevity, a way of looking at the second stage of adulthood that precedes old age -- what she calls ''adulthood II'' -- which is the subject of her new book.
Yes, it's a sequel to her 1990 meditation on the stop-and-start nature of women's lives, except that this time she has invited men into the conversation.
A bit of background: The first ''Composing a Life'' was not tidy pop psychology, like that offered in the ''Passages'' franchise created by Gail Sheehy. Nor was it a hard-hitting myth-exploder like Susan Faludi's ''Backlash.'' But with its themes of loss, ambivalence and frustration, its vivid portraits of five bright, successful women at midlife (including Dr. Bateson, once a dean at Amherst College, who wrote about being ousted from her job there), it touched a nerve. The book proposed that women's adaptive responses to setbacks and sadness were of enormous value -- that the improvisational nature of some lives is worth emulating and celebrating.
Its reviews were glowing. Younger writers like Peggy Orenstein, author of ''Flux: Women on Sex, Work, Love, Kids and Life in a Half-Changed World,'' were inspired by it. Hillary Rodham Clinton hailed the book as a touchstone.
Also, it was beautifully written. Amid the maelstrom of what came to be known as third-wave feminism -- characterized by the heated academic prose of writers like Naomi Wolf, for example -- ''Composing a Life'' arrived like a cool drink of water.
Dr. Bateson's new book is not as seismic as its precursor because its theme -- that human longevity has given rise to a second stage of ''active'' adulthood, the enormously productive period between the ages of 50 and 75 -- is so familiar.
That's O.K.: Reading a book by Dr. Bateson (this is her 12th) is like being invited to dinner with your smarter friends. You get to be your best self, virtually mingling, as it were, with someone like Richard Goldsby, a biology professor, who really gives it up to Dr. Bateson, revealing how he bullied his first wife and the mother of his children, pushing her down in service to his own, brilliant career. His is a view from the other side; much of Dr. Bateson's writings have dug deep into the ways women's careers take second place to their husbands'.
The big questions are explored: What makes work satisfying and worthwhile? What does it mean to be married? How do you find a spiritual practice?
Dr. Bateson's mother, for example, believed that practice preceded theology, a spiritual version of the old adage ''fake it till you make it.''
Dr. Bateson, a long-lapsed Catholic, writes of entering a hospital in 2006 for surgery to have a cyst removed from her brain, and hoping that check-in would include a question about religious preferences, forcing her to make a choice. Instead, she found herself ''on a conveyor belt to the O.R.,'' stammering ''words of faith and contrition as best I knew how.''
Along with Dr. Goldsby's life story, Dr. Bateson has collected that of the former dean of St. John the Divine, who founded a multifaith center; a gay teacher whose professional life never quite gelled; and Jane Fonda, who at the time of the writing of this book was working on her own book on the same topic.
Dr. Bateson paints a cozy scene of the two women taping each other in Dr. Bateson's house here. A friend worries that Dr. Bateson will give the movie star her best anecdotes, enriching Ms. Fonda's book at the expense of her own, but Dr. Bateson disagrees. Ideas aren't property, she writes, but ''bread to be cast on the waters.''
The other day, Dr. Bateson was tearing pita bread into quarters for the Mediterranean feast she had prepared and laid out in her kursi room. The bread was to accompany an Iranian staple, a plate of feta cheese, mint and tarragon.
''The Iranians cut their bread up with scissors in neat little triangles, but I like the feel of shredding it,'' she said.
There was a Greek salad and an array of hummus, tabbouleh and dolmades (a k a stuffed grape leaves), all served on a tapestry-draped takht, which Dr. Bateson said translates literally as ''platform,'' but can also refer to a low table used for meals. Dr. Bateson found hers backstage at a performance of the Peterborough Players, a local theater group. It was part of a set that had last been used in a production of ''Inherit the Wind.''
''In Persian houses,'' she said, ''there's a brazier in the middle of the takht. We have an electric heater. You can even use a light bulb.''
The idea, she said, is that on cold days you tuck your feet underneath and toast them on the heater.
There were stuffed animals on a few chairs, remnants of her two grandsons' last visit. On the sideboard, a photograph of Dr. Bateson at age 5 with her parents shared space with another of a beloved dog.
Dr. Kassarjian, she said, was in Switzerland (he teaches in Lausanne and at Babson College). ''At least, I think he's in Switzerland,'' she added. ''He might be getting on the plane.''
''We give each other a lot of space,'' she said, describing their marriage as a strong friendship and a collaboration. ''We travel so much for our work, we don't like to travel together. We hang out a lot here. I think we do best when we're working on a project together. Barkev has read all my books in manuscript. We had a lot of fun designing this house, though it took nearly 50 years to do so.''
When she and her husband built the house on the site of the old barn in 2007, they reversed a typical move in ''adulthood II,'' upsizing rather than downsizing. They knocked down the shed on the property and replaced it with a guest house, which they have handed over to their daughter, Sevanne Martin, an actress, who is married and has two young sons. (Sevanne is the name of a lake in Armenia; Dr. Kassarjian is Armenian. ''It's like naming your daughter Loch Lomond,'' Dr. Bateson joked. Martin is a stage name.)
The farmhouse has long been rented to a tenant who acts as caretaker when Dr. Bateson and Dr. Kassarjian are away. ''Both of us think of New Hampshire as home in a way in which Cambridge is not,'' she said, showing off the trails through the woods, the rough-cut stone statues put there by a tenant who rented the place when the family was in the Philippines (''We call them 'the lurkers,' '' Dr. Bateson said) and the rusty farm equipment her son-in-law is fond of bringing home.
''My husband is not convinced these are decorative objects,'' she said, raising an eyebrow.
There are wild blueberries on the path to Norway Pond, where Dr. Bateson takes her afternoon swim.
''Home is a very important metaphor for me,'' she said. ''When I was working on 'Composing a Life,' I referred to it as 'my homemaking book.' How do you make a home when there is discontinuity? You are a single mother, there is a bad marriage, a job change. I started to define the word 'home' as an environment in which one grows and learns, rather than just a refuge. Think about where you started out as a little kid and you learned to walk. Sometimes there were things you tripped over. There were people who loved you but also made demands on you.''
Dr. Bateson's first home life was communal. After her birth in 1939, her parents offered themselves up to the war effort (Dr. Bateson joined the Office of Strategic Services; Dr. Mead worked in Washington). Dr. Mead moved her daughter into a brownstone on Perry Street (''I believe there is a plaque,'' Dr. Bateson said), combining households with the family of the economist and social scientist Lawrence K. Frank, who had seven children.
''We had the bottom two floors and they had the top and there was a backyard, and it was just terrific,'' Dr. Bateson said. ''I got free siblings! My mother created a village, and it was wonderful. We didn't have sofas, we had beds with backs on them so my mother could always offer someone who needed it a place to sleep. So people came and went. It always seemed to me the best arrangement is the joint household instead of a separate house, a separate car, a separate lawnmower that's not always being used.''
Homemaking, she stressed, needs to be less selfish.
''We are living longer, but thinking shorter.''

HEADLINE: Community College Training for Managing Green Jobs

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
BEYOND ''green-collar'' jobs, like retrofitting a home to conserve energy or helping build a wind farm, an energy-conscious economy will need a new generation of environmentally smart managers, and that's where community colleges are stepping up with new courses and degree programs.
The federal government is pouring $500 million into training for green jobs, and the sector devoted to energy efficiency is estimated to grow as much as fourfold in the next decade, to some 1.3 million people, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Its March 2010 report was financed by the Energy Department. 
Green-collar jobs have grabbed the public's attention, and educational institutions are starting programs to train the managers who will oversee the technologies, manufacturing processes and materials that will be used to conserve energy and help safeguard natural resources.
Some community colleges already are offering two-year degrees in environmental management and certificates for managers who want to add green qualifications -- which means learning more about the environmental aspects of a particular field -- to their resumes. These colleges are offering some courses and training on campus as well as online.
Lane Community College, in Eugene, Ore., for example, is offering two-year programs -- for associate degrees in applied sciences -- in energy management, renewable energy or water conservation.
The college, which has an organic garden and changed its faucets and toilets to conserve water, was an early proponent of environmental education, and its degree programs are serving as models for 10 other community colleges, according to Roger Ebbage, director of energy programs at the college's Northwest Energy Education Institute.
''When we first started two decades ago we were focused on community and residential energy efficiency,'' Mr. Ebbage said. ''Now we are preparing people to go into the commercial sector anywhere in the country.''
The graduates are in great demand, said Mr. Ebbage.
''They are working for utilities, on engineering jobs, for school districts, cities and the military,'' he said. ''We're not going to be in areas where there is no job demand,'' he added, noting that some short-term green job training programs have been criticized because they do not always lead to employment in the current economy.
The demand for its managerial graduates prompted Lane Community College to accelerate its two-year program, with help from federal money, starting this month. The college is beginning a trial program that allows students to earn their energy management degrees in fewer academic terms. Their tuition is subsidized as part of the federal stimulus funds for green courses and training, including a $2,500 tuition tax credit.
Matthew Heflin, 49, decided to get his energy management degree after spending 18 years working at a Hewlett-Packard lab that researched new products. Mr. Heflin, a military veteran who does not have a college degree, wanted to be prepared for the green economy.
''I was first interested in wind or solar, but then I heard about the energy management program,'' said Mr. Heflin, whose previous job had been eliminated. ''Now I'm taking math, physics and three energy management classes, including sustainability.''
Mr. Heflin is among the program's 25 students, most 25 to 55 years old and many displaced from industries like computers and aerospace. Math and sciences are part of the program, so applicants have to have at least an algebra background.
The students can also take the college's other continuing education courses, including sustainable landscaping, and cross-disciplinary courses like natural resource economics, environmental politics and global ecology.
Last year, the college won a $890,000 grant from the federal government -- not stimulus money -- for its accelerated program. An additional grant is being used to help 10 other community colleges across the country begin or enhance their programs in energy management over a three-year period, said Mr. Ebbage.
Those colleges include American River College in Sacramento; Northeast Wisconsin Technical College in Green Bay; Delaware Technical and Community College; and West Virginia University, in Parkersburg.
Delaware Technical and Community College, which has campuses in Dover, Georgetown and Wilmington, will be offering an applied energy program to train energy managers and ''green power'' technicians starting in September, said Stephanie Smith, the college's academic vice president.
''Lane is the national leader in this program, and we are modeling our program on them,'' she said. The college plans to offer a two-year associate's degree in applied science, first in energy management and then, starting in the 2011 academic year, in solar energy management.
The program, which opened student enrollment this month, will have 30 students, both entering freshmen and older people trying to retool their skills, said Ms. Smith.
Such training is also being offered in rural areas, with online environmental degrees and certificates, according to a survey of 321 community colleges by researchers at the University of Louisville's National Research Center for Career and Technical Education.
Rod P. Githens, one of the authors and assistant professor of work force education at the University of Louisville, said many of the green learning programs were for workers in transition and required education beyond a high school diploma but less than a four-year degree.
A few, like the College of Southern Maryland, in La Plata, offer management programs, including one in environmental planning, and a separate program in environmental management. These programs provide a letter of recognition, and not a degree.
For those seeking a four-year degree, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study found that about two dozen four-year colleges and universities across the country offer degree programs with courses that are directly relevant to the energy efficiency sector.

HEADLINE: The Humanities for Love, Not Money

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN

 BODY:
WHEN the renowned educators Mortimer J. Adler and Robert Maynard Hutchins first decided to expand their Great Books course beyond the University of Chicago's walls, they recruited some of Chicago's most prominent businessmen. In what was called the Fat Men's Great Books Course, the executives and their wives started meeting every other Friday evening in the fall of 1943 to discuss Plato, Shakespeare and Goethe.
The course eventually evolved into the Basic Program in Liberal Education and is now run out of the Graham School of General Studies, the university's continuing education arm. And despite the recent recession, enrollment has increased in recent years, said Daniel Shannon, dean of the school. 
Other continuing education programs around the nation have noticed a similarly strong interest in their arts and humanities courses. This growth comes amid a vigorous debate in the broader world of education about whether courses and material should be tied more tightly to the job market. Training more engineers and technicians is a constant refrain.
Some educators worry that the single-minded focus on economic benefits comes at the expense of the arts and humanities, however. The number of undergraduates who major in these areas tends to dip during recessions, as practical concerns about postgraduation employment loom larger.
A result has been that the humanities, once the centerpiece of the college experience, have been increasingly pushed to justify their existence.
Robust enrollments aside, the same conversation about the role of the arts and humanities preoccupies the world of continuing education.
Generalizations about continuing education can be tricky, however. Continuing education is a multiheaded beast that embraces leisurely retirees and anxious laid-off workers hoping to get a start on a new career, those seeking credit or certification and those indifferent to further credentials.
The School of Continuing Education at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, attracts a lot of older retirees, said Kim C. Beck, the director of arts, humanities and sciences. ''We haven't seen a real downturn in older adults' participation,'' he said, but the recession did dampen interest in business training.
Mr. Shannon said he believed a deep appreciation of the humanities was connected to age. ''The humanities become more important as you grow older,'' he said. ''Some of them, I think, come back because they yearn to capture what they didn't have in their undergraduate experience, particularly those who went through professional programs like business or nursing.'' Others return, he added, because they suddenly realize ''that at 18, they didn't have the capacity to read critically Socrates, Thucydides and Nietzsche.''
Robert Lapiner, the dean of the School of Continuing and Professional Studies at New York University, agrees that maturity makes a difference: ''People in their 40s and 50s have a hunger for understanding this more comprehensively and fully.''
Terry Shtob, the director of liberal arts at N.Y.U.'s continuing education school, said enrollment in arts and humanities programs for this fall grew 5 percent from last fall.
Many of those enrolled turned out to be laid-off Wall Street workers who were eligible for emergency retraining grants from the government. Ms. Shtob said her impression, after speaking to a few students, was that they had originally chosen careers in fields like business and law primarily because they felt those were financially secure. When that turned out not to be case, she said, they decided, ''I might as well do what I love.''
These students are still career-focused and are working toward a certificate in art appraisal, for instance, or theater administration, Ms. Shtob said.
At the Extended Studies and Public Programs at the University of California, San Diego, two of the most popular certificate programs -- copy editing, and translation and interpretation -- are in the humanities, said Mary Walshok, the associate vice chancellor. Of the 54,000 enrollments in the school's postbaccalaureate program each year, about 9,500, or 17 percent, are in the arts and humanities. ''We expect, because of demographic trends, for enrollments in these courses to continue to grow at a lively pace,'' she said.
Indeed, the baby boom generation, the first to attend college in great numbers, is just starting to reach retirement age. Already, this group has proved to have a strong interest in continuing education.
Ms. Walshok, like some of her counterparts at other continuing education institutions, does not necessarily draw a line between the focused job-seekers and those seeking more general enrichment.
''From where we sit, the humanities are more critical than ever because of their role in helping to understand the political and cultural context of the world we live in today,'' Ms. Walshok said. ''They contribute to Americans' capacity to be good citizens, as well as enrich many areas of professional practice, given the effects of the global economy on so many spheres of work.''

HEADLINE: Foreign Language Courses, Brushing Up or Immersion

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS KORKKI

 BODY:
THEY may be preparing for a vacation in Europe, trying to communicate with colleagues abroad or immigrant clients at home or unlocking the skills, learned in college, that have retreated to an inaccessible part of the brain. For those aiming to learn a foreign language, continuing education courses can lead people toward fluency -- or at least help them get by.
These days, online programs and CDs like Rosetta Stone and Pimsleur are grabbing the interest of people attracted by their convenience and relatively low cost. But more schools are offering their own online-only language courses as part of extension programs. 
At the University of California, Los Angeles, traditional, three-month language classes cost $480, and online classes cost $550. The online courses include video lectures, readings, exercises and assignments, which the instructors can correct and return to the student via e-mail. Students can practice with one another via chatrooms, and instructors and students can also talk on the phone to work on pronunciation, said Krista K. Loretto, program manager for U.C.L.A. Extension.
The biggest weakness of the online courses is the conversational element, Ms. Loretto said, although online students may soon be able to have real-time conversations thanks to technological advances.
The school also started offering combination online and classroom classes, which are especially helpful for those who have trouble making time for a class or live a long way from U.C.L.A., Ms. Loretto said.
Rosetta Stone, too, has gotten in on the classroom act. It does not consider itself a competitor, but rather a supplement to traditional language classes, said Cathy Quenzer, the company's education director. It provides online courses for college instructors who want to augment their classroom lessons, she said. Students can learn through the program's image-based format at their own pace at home, ''and then come together to share and practice in the classroom,'' she said.
There is no substitute for the traditional language class, with its emphasis on conversation and human interaction, said Florence Leclerc-Dickler, chairwoman of the foreign language department at the New School in New York and an assistant French professor.
Online-only courses are ''good for people who are extremely self-disciplined,'' Ms. Leclerc-Dickler said, comparing them to having a treadmill at home, whereas attending a class is like going to a gym.
The New School offers continuing education courses in 17 languages, with placement exams available for those not sure how far their rusty college skills will take them. French is by far the most popular language, which may reflect its cultural appeal as well as France's popularity as a travel destination, Ms. Leclerc-Dickler said.
Spanish is second in popularity, with Arabic, German, Italian and Portuguese coming next in roughly similar numbers, she said. While the Tibetan course is offered less frequently, the one to be offered this fall is full, she said, as was the class in Nepali last spring.
Many classes meet once a week for an hour and 50 minutes and last 13 weeks, at a cost of $590. But Ms. Leclerc-Dickler recognizes that it can be hard for busy professionals to commit to a set time every week. That is why she also organizes weekend language immersion courses. These start on Friday evening and run through Sunday for a total of 14 hours, at a cost of $350.
Ellen Golub, a mortgage broker in Manhattan, took the weekend French class last spring a few weeks before her vacation in Paris. She called it ''a crash course where you learn the basics.''
Though she did not come near to mastering French, she said the class, with its heavy emphasis on conversation, helped her feel more comfortable doing things like ordering food and navigating the Metro in Paris.
Professionals often take foreign language classes for personal reasons and enjoyment, Ms. Leclerc-Dickler said. But the needs of a global economy are also causing more people to learn languages for work-related purposes, Ms. Loretto said.
Being able to make a presentation in a foreign language, whether in person or through a teleconference, can give an English-speaking employee a serious edge, she said. Foreign languages are also very useful for workers who interact with immigrants, she said.
Ms. Loretto said Spanish had long been the most popular language at U.C.L.A. Extension, but she said that demand for Mandarin had been growing every year, ''and I wouldn't be surprised if it ends up being neck and neck with Spanish in popularity.''
Extension offerings often reflect the needs of the surrounding community. Los Angeles has a large Korean population, and court officials have found Korean classes valuable in helping them to communicate with those who pass through the court system, Ms. Loretto said.
Valentina Zaitseva, who teaches at the University of Washington, has had among her students medical professionals who treat Seattle's large Russian community.
In addition to traditional classes, she teaches a summer course that packs a year's worth of Russian language study into two intensive months. Now she is teaching a summer interdisciplinary class in Sochi, site of the 2014 Winter Olympics, in partnership with Sochi State University.
Although many of her summer intensive students take her class to obtain credits toward a degree, some are professionals who may want to develop and maintain business contacts in Russia, she says -- forming a contrast to others who mainly want to read authors like Dostoyevsky in the original Russian.

HEADLINE: Stockholders Win Power in Picking Directors

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday approved changes that make it easier for shareholders to nominate directors of public companies.
The 3-2 vote allows groups that own at least 3 percent of a company's stock to put their nominees for board seats on the annual proxy ballot sent to shareholders. The financial overhaul law enacted last month gave the S.E.C. the authority to make the change. 
Under the current system, investors must appeal to shareholders at their own expense if they seek new directors on a company's board or a bylaw change.
The new policy was long sought by investor advocates. But business groups, including the United States Chamber of Commerce, opposed it. The board's two Republican commissioners -- Kathleen L. Casey and Troy A. Paredes -- voted no.
The change comes at a time when many investors are angry about risks corporations are taking for short-term profit gains and extravagant compensation packages for executives. Getting candidates on the board gives supporters a better shot at influencing company policy. The policy change will be in place in time for next spring's corporate elections season.
The S.E.C.'s chairman, Mary L. Schapiro, has said the vote was one of the most contentious ever taken by the agency. The change is ''a matter of fairness and accountability,'' she said.
But one commissioner, Ms. Casey, called it ''so fundamentally and fatally flawed that it will have great difficulty surviving judicial scrutiny.'' The new rules favor big institutional shareholders over individuals, she said.
Supporters say the change was necessary, especially in light of the risks taken that led to the financial crisis.

HEADLINE: Making Career Development Pay

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
IN shaky economic times, going back to school needs to be treated like any other investment: you need to weigh the potential returns while closely managing the costs.
So before you enroll in a program, you should ask the same sorts of questions that a portfolio manager might ask when analyzing conventional investments, like stocks: Am I buying a reputable credential? What is demand like in the field I'm interested in? What is the earnings potential? What are the long-term prospects? And how can I minimize my expenses?
The more radical the shift in careers you contemplate, the more research you should do. You might, for example, visit O*Net OnLine, a Web site maintained by the Labor Department, to check out salaries or estimates of employment opportunities for different professions.
Or you might test the waters in a field you are interested in. See if you can find an employee to shadow, making sure to ask questions about the job, the satisfactions, the downsides and industry trends. 
''They will tell you the truth in your area before you put any money down on schools,'' said Beverly Baskin, executive director of BBCS Counseling Services, a career counseling firm in Marlboro, N.J.
Even better, see if you can find a job, even part time, or an internship in the field you plan to pursue. If no paid positions are available, considering volunteering, if that is permitted.
The costs of schooling -- and even the types of loans or financial aid available -- will vary, depending on what and where you are studying. At a private university, a certificate in Arabic-to-English translation might cost about $4,000, while a graduate certificate in human resource management or information technologies could cost more than $25,000. At a public college, meanwhile, a certificate in business Mandarin Chinese might cost less than $2,000, while advanced certificates in human resources could run about $3,000 each.
''The larger the expense, the more sure you need to be of the investment,'' said Paula Hogan, a financial planner in Milwaukee who focuses on her clients' earnings potential.
Besides trying to work out the upside of an educational investment, see what you can do to hold down costs -- or, even better -- find someone else to pay them. Financial planners, tax experts and career counselors offer these tips:
SEEK EMPLOYER AID If you have a job, ask your employer if a tuition-assistance program is available; employers can provide up to $5,250 in tax-free tuition reimbursement. A 2010 survey conducted by the School of Continuing and Professional Studies at New York University found, for instance, that 78 percent of New York City employers who offered tuition reimbursement would pay for noncredit courses and certificates.
GOVERNMENT HELP Normally, people collecting unemployment insurance need to be looking for work full time. But most states have made exceptions, making it possible to collect benefits while in degree or certificate programs, said Andrew Stettner, deputy director for the National Employment Law Project, a worker advocacy group. Check your employment benefit handbook or your state unemployment insurance program's Web site for details on how to get a waiver.
You can find more information about retraining and other types of education-related aid and programs through the CareerOneStop centers and Web site (CareerOneStop.org) financed by the Labor Department, said Kermit Kaleba, senior policy analyst at the National Skills Coalition, an advocacy group that aims to help workers improve their skills. You can also visit Opportunity.gov, a site about educational and training initiatives for the unemployed.
LOANS AND GRANTS Before you borrow, do a thorough search for grants and scholarships. FinAid.org, a comprehensive college planning site, has a page dedicated to scholarship databases, including its own, FastWeb.com. CareerOneStop also lists scholarship search engines.
If you need to borrow, first look at federal financial aid or loans. To be eligible for these, you must enroll at least half time in a program that culminates in a degree or an eligible certificate.
''Continuing education that is not degree-seeking or certificate-seeking is usually not eligible,'' said Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of FinAid.org.
If your program qualifies, submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid, known as a Fafsa, to fafsa.gov, to see if you are eligible for subsidized loans or other aid. If you recently lost your job or are earning less this year, ask the financial aid administrators at your target college for a ''professional judgment adjustment,'' because aid is based on income from the previous year.
Start by calling the college's financial aid office to ask about the procedure -- some colleges will require that you fill out a form. Then, send a brief letter politely requesting the review. Be sure to describe your situation and the effect it has had on your finances, and include supporting documentation. The administrators can adjust the figures that will determine whether you qualify for aid.
Private student loans are another option, though they are more expensive and usually carry a variable interest rate. Make sure, too, to ask about fees, rates and terms before signing up. Also see how those terms compare with tapping a home equity line of credit, if available, or using personal loans from your bank or credit union.
TAX BREAKS The Lifetime Learning Credit, specifically geared for continuing education, can be used for an unlimited number of years and for a wide range of schooling, including undergraduate and graduate studies, vocational programs and courses to learn or improve job skills, said Mark Luscombe, principal analyst at CCH, a tax and accounting information service.
It provides a maximum credit of $2,000 -- that's 20 percent of the first $10,000 of tuition and qualifying expenses at a postsecondary institution. It phases out, however, for single taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income of $50,000 to $60,000, and for married joint filers with income of $100,000 to $120,000.
Alternatively, people who itemize deductions on their federal returns may be able to deduct education expenses -- and possibly travel-related costs -- related to maintaining or improving skills for their current jobs. These expenses would go into the category of miscellaneous deductions, along with tax-preparation fees, union dues or job-search expenses, which can be deducted only if they exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income.
A couple of other tax breaks for education-related expenses are available, though their futures are unclear. The American Opportunity Credit, which replaced the less generous Hope Scholarship Credit, is available only for people pursuing an undergraduate degree.
The maximum credit is $2,500, which can be used for the first four years of postsecondary education and covers qualifying tuition and related expenses. It phases out for married people filing joint returns who earn $160,000 to $180,000 and for singles earning $80,000 to $90,000. Forty percent of the credit is refundable, which means you will receive money back even if you have no federal tax liability.
But the credit runs only through 2010; in 2011, it will revert to the less flexible Hope Credit, for up to $1,800, which can be used for only the first two years of undergraduate study. ''The American Opportunity tax credit is likely to get extended again, but technically it is still not available for 2011,'' said Mr. Luscombe, the CCH analyst.
The so-called above-the-line deduction for qualified higher-education expenses -- subtracted from your gross income and taken even if you did not itemize other deductions -- expired in 2009. The deduction was included in the tax extender legislation expected to be taken up again by the Senate later this year. But it is unclear whether the broader package will gain approval (taxpayers had been able to deduct a maximum of $4,000, though it phased out for people with higher income).
Remember that many of these tax breaks are mutually exclusive: you cannot take a credit and a deduction for the same expenses.
CASH YOUR BONDS If you have Series I or EE bonds (issued after 1989) and redeem them in the same year in which you have qualified education expenses, you do not have to pay taxes on the interest income that you collect at redemption. But the bond's owner must be at least 24 years old on the bond issue date. In 2010, the benefits phase out for joint filers with adjusted gross income of $105,100 to $135,100, and for single taxpayers with income of $70,100 to $85,100.
RETIREMENT MONEY It is generally not a good idea to raid retirement accounts. But you are permitted to withdraw money from a traditional or Roth individual retirement account for qualified higher-education expenses -- tuition, books, fees, supplies and equipment -- and avoid the 10 percent penalty levied on people under the age of 59 1/2. If you are enrolled at least half time in a degree program, the money withdrawn can also be used to pay for room and board, said Mr. Kantrowitz of FinAid.org.
You are still required to pay any income taxes normally owed on a withdrawal. With a traditional I.R.A., that means you will owe income taxes on all distributions (unless you made some nondeductible contributions, which are not taxable). With a Roth, if you are under the age of 59 1/2, you need to pay income tax on the portion of your distribution that comes from earnings, but not the portion that comes from your contributions.
''It might be easier to pull it out of a Roth, but because of what you are forgoing in terms of loss of tax-free earnings in the future,'' Mr. Luscombe said, it might not be the best decision.
Remember that if you have a child in college, withdrawing money from a plan will artificially increase your income, which could affect the child's eligibility for financial aid.
Some employers may also allow you to borrow against your 401(k). ''But if you leave the employer before the loan is paid back -- and you couldn't pay it off -- it might be treated as an early withdrawal and subject to a penalty,'' Mr. Luscombe said.

HEADLINE: For the King of the Skyline, a Tall and Unwelcome New Neighbor

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI; Colin Moynihan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
New York City approved plans on Wednesday for a skyscraper near Pennsylvania Station that will rise to within 34 feet in height of the nearby Empire State Building, inserting a glassy challenger almost next door to what has been a defining element of the city's skyline.
The 47-to-1 City Council vote came after a fierce weeklong public relations and lobbying campaign by the owners of the Empire State Building to stop the rival tower, contending that its bulky profile would scar the skyline and diminish the Empire State Building's iconic status.
They went so far as to propose a one-third-mile zone around the Empire State Building, at 34th Street and Fifth Avenue, where developers would not be allowed to erect a comparable skyscraper.
But the Council gave those arguments scant attention on Wednesday as it approved the planned tower, known as 15 Penn Plaza, on Seventh Avenue, opposite Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. Some Council members found the prospect of a new building and the developer's agreement to spend more than $100 million on improvements to subway entrances and tunnels at Penn Station far more compelling, especially during a citywide slowdown in construction. 
Christine C. Quinn, the Council speaker, said the project was about jobs and signaled that ''New York City is moving forward and moving out of this recession.''
''This project and this zoning vote today are going to help make sure New York City has a new and important 21st-century office tower in Midtown Manhattan,'' she said.
The project also had the backing of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, whose administration has long favored high-density development near major transit points like Penn Station, the busiest commuter hub in North America, with more than 450,000 passengers passing through its portals daily.
In part because of the proximity to transit, the developer of 15 Penn Plaza, the Vornado Realty Trust, earned zoning bonuses that will let it construct a building 56 percent larger than what would ordinarily be allowed.
''People don't come to New York to visit caves,'' said Mitchell L. Moss, a New York University urban policy professor and an informal adviser to the mayor. ''They want the views, the height, the experience of tall buildings. Skyscrapers allow us to make the best use of a limited amount of land.''
Bud Perrone, a spokesman for Vornado, said the company was pleased with the outcome and believed its 68-story, 1,216-foot-tall building would be ''an outstanding addition to New York's iconic skyline.''
Anthony E. Malkin, an owner of the Empire State Building, said he favored development in the surrounding area but felt that the proposed tower should be shrunk so as not to obscure the view of his building, which has stood alone since it opened 79 years ago. ''We thought that 15 Penn Plaza was too close to the 1,250-foot-tall Empire State Building for its height and design,'' Mr. Malkin said.
The Empire State Building, which reaches 1,454 feet when its lightning rod is included, was the tallest in the world for more than 30 years and remained the tallest in the city until construction of the first World Trade Center. After Sept. 11, 2001, it regained that status, but will fall back to second place behind the new 1 World Trade Center, which will top out at 1,776 feet.
Beyond bragging rights and skyline positioning, the new tower will be an unmissable presence for sightseers looking toward the west from the Empire State Building's famous 86th-floor observation deck.
Despite the vote Wednesday, construction of the new tower is unlikely to start for at least several years. Vornado has said it will not go forward with the $3 billion tower without a major corporate tenant. The project also requires demolishing another landmark of sorts that currently occupies the site: the Hotel Pennsylvania. The fraying 25-story hotel, built in 1919, still has the phone number memorialized in a 1940 hit song by Glenn Miller, PEnnsylvania 6-5000.
Mr. Malkin said that the Vornado project would economically enhance, rather than compete, with the Empire State Building, if only because rents in his building would be substantially lower than at 15 Penn Plaza and more attractive to tenants.
Even so, he began a furious public relations campaign leading up to the vote, including advertisements and a poll he commissioned that, he said, showed New Yorkers disapproved of the new building. He also corralled support from local figures like George Kaufman, another real estate owner, who submitted a letter calling 15 Penn Plaza ''an assault on the Empire State Building and the New York City skyline,'' and Henry Stern, the former parks commissioner, who testified at a hearing this week that the proposed tower ''could do irreparable harm'' to the city.
At that hearing, Mr. Malkin said that building a tall tower so close to the Empire State Building was akin to allowing an oil rig next to the Statue of Liberty or a skyscraper next to the Eiffel Tower or Big Ben. One Council member, Leroy G. Comrie of Queens, pointed out that none of those buildings were commercial properties like the Empire State.
Some Council members expressed misgivings about the size and the challenge to the Empire State Building; the lone dissenter, the Brooklyn Council member Charles Barron, believed that the developer's commitment to hire at least 15 percent female or minority contractors was too small.
Councilwoman Gale A. Brewer of Manhattan, citing concerns that the new building would obstruct views, said, ''I am persuaded that views are important and history is important, but this is a building worth supporting.''
The Council also gave customary deference to the member whose district includes the property. That is the speaker, Ms. Quinn, who has received at least $15,000 in campaign donations in recent years from Vornado and its employees, as well as roughly $3,500 from the Malkins. ''It wasn't a particularly significant amount,'' Ms. Quinn said about the Vornado donations at a news conference. ''It has no impact whatsoever.''
At least one Council member, Peter F. Vallone Jr. of Queens, seemed to take a small joy in voting for 15 Penn Plaza. He criticized the Empire State Building for refusing to turn on blue and white lights on Thursday night in honor of what would have been Mother Teresa's 100th birthday, and said he would think of the Vornado building as ''Mother Teresa Tower.''
''I'm going to be voting on this matter solely on the merits,'' he said. ''I just happen to be particularly happy that the merits are not on the side of the Empire State Building.''

HEADLINE: Riverside Park Plans Composting Restroom

BYLINE: By THOMAS LIN

 BODY:
A tennis date on New York City's only public red-clay courts on a midsummer weekend can mean a two- to three-hour wait. With the soft grass and courtside gardens in this part of Riverside Park overlooking the Hudson River, it is not a bad place to kill time.
Until nature calls. 
The choices: brave one of the two portable toilets next to the courts or risk valuable court time to hike back under the highway and up the slope to the Hippo Playground bathrooms -- if they are in service -- or all the way to a McDonald's or Starbucks on Broadway.
The Riverside Clay Tennis Association hopes to ease the pain for all parkgoers. It has proposed a carbon-neutral complex that would be the first public bathroom of its kind in a New York City park, said John Herrold, the Riverside Park administrator. (The Bronx Zoo and the Queens Botanical Garden already have ones.)
The bathroom, which would compost sewage to fertilize park greenery and use solar panels to power the complex, is being designed to operate without causing carbon dioxide emissions, which contribute to global warming. In addition to producing fertilizer instead of sewage, composting toilets typically use little or no water (about three ounces) compared with three and a half gallons per conventional toilet flush.
The green design was a matter of necessity, because of the high water table and proximity to the river (which ruled out installing a septic tank and leach field) and the lack of a connection to the city's sewage system (sewage lines stop on the other side of the Henry Hudson Highway). Mark McIntyre, the tennis association's executive director, said the only option was to go green.
''It's very exciting,'' Mr. McIntyre said. ''If this is a model for the future and there are more public bathrooms that use this technology, it would be terrific if this was the first one.''
The planned bathroom complex would replace the two portable toilets, a small brick shack and repurposed shipping containers currently being used for equipment storage. It would be built on a defunct parking lot at the southeast corner of the courts.
Besides having dozens of tennis players waiting for a court at any given time on weekends, this section of the park, between 91st and 103rd Streets, also teems with joggers, cyclists, sunbathers, strollers and tourists. The completion of the $15 million Riverwalk project in the spring has increased traffic.
''It has to happen,'' said Mr. McIntyre, who called the portable toilets ''totally inadequate.''
The association, which raised $40,000 last fall to pay for a feasibility study, is now working to raise $600,000 more to design the building. Community Board 7 responded favorably to the proposal, and the city's Parks and Recreation Department has approved the concept and is endorsing it for a planning grant from the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.
Raising the estimated $5.5 million needed for construction will be a challenge given tight state and city budgets and the effects of a slow economy on private donations. But the association, which maintains the courts through the parks department and with volunteers, hopes to break ground by the end of next year and to have the facility built by the summer of 2012.

HEADLINE: KEY KARZAI AIDE IN GRAFT INQUIRY IS LINKED TO C.I.A.

BYLINE: By DEXTER FILKINS and MARK MAZZETTI; Dexter Filkins reported from Kabul, and Mark Mazzetti from Washington. Helene Cooper contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- The aide to President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan at the center of a politically sensitive corruption investigation is being paid by the Central Intelligence Agency, according to Afghan and American officials.
Mohammed Zia Salehi, the chief of administration for the National Security Council, appears to have been on the payroll for many years, according to officials in Kabul and Washington. It is unclear exactly what Mr. Salehi does in exchange for his money, whether providing information to the spy agency, advancing American views inside the presidential palace, or both.
Mr. Salehi's relationship with the C.I.A. underscores deep contradictions at the heart of the Obama administration's policy in Afghanistan, with American officials simultaneously demanding that Mr. Karzai root out the corruption that pervades his government while sometimes subsidizing the very people suspected of perpetrating it.
Mr. Salehi was arrested in July and released after Mr. Karzai intervened. There has been no suggestion that Mr. Salehi's ties to the C.I.A. played a role in his release; rather, officials say, it is the fear that Mr. Salehi knows about corrupt dealings inside the Karzai administration. 
The ties underscore doubts about how seriously the Obama administration intends to fight corruption here. The anticorruption drive, though strongly backed by the United States, is still vigorously debated inside the administration. Some argue it should be a centerpiece of American strategy, and others say that attacking corrupt officials who are crucial to the war effort could destabilize the Karzai government.
The Obama administration is also racing to show progress in Afghanistan by December, when the White House will evaluate its mission there. Some administration officials argue that any comprehensive campaign to fight corruption inside Afghanistan is overly ambitious, with less than a year to go before the American military is set to begin withdrawing troops.
''Fighting corruption is the very definition of mission creep,'' one Obama administration official said.
Others in the administration view public corruption as the single greatest threat to the Afghan government and the American mission; it is the corrupt nature of the Karzai government, these officials say, that drives ordinary Afghans into the arms of the Taliban. Other prominent Afghans who American officials have said were on the C.I.A.'s payroll include the president's half brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai, suspected by investigators of playing a role in Afghanistan's booming opium trade. Earlier this year, American officials did not press Mr. Karzai to remove his brother from his post as the chairman of the Kandahar provincial council. Mr. Karzai denies any monetary relationship with the C.I.A. and any links to the drug trade.
Mr. Salehi was arrested by the Afghan police after, investigators say, they wiretapped him soliciting a bribe -- in the form of a car for his son -- in exchange for impeding an American-backed investigation into a company suspected of shipping billions of dollars out of the country for Afghan officials, drug smugglers and insurgents.
Mr. Salehi was released seven hours later, after telephoning Mr. Karzai from his jail cell to demand help, officials said, and after Mr. Karzai forcefully intervened on his behalf.
The president sent aides to get him and has since threatened to limit the power of the anticorruption unit that carried out the arrest. Mr. Salehi could not be reached for comment on Wednesday. A spokesman for President Karzai did not respond to a list of questions sent to his office, including whether Mr. Karzai knew that Mr. Salehi was a C.I.A. informant.
A spokesman for the C.I.A. declined to comment on any relationship with Mr. Salehi.
''The C.I.A. works hard to advance the full range of U.S. policy objectives in Afghanistan,'' said Paul Gimigliano, a spokesman for the agency. ''Reckless allegations from anonymous sources don't change that reality in the slightest.''
An American official said the practice of paying government officials was sensible, even if they turn out to be corrupt or unsavory.
''If we decide as a country that we'll never deal with anyone in Afghanistan who might down the road -- and certainly not at our behest -- put his hand in the till, we can all come home right now,'' the American official said. ''If you want intelligence in a war zone, you're not going to get it from Mother Teresa or Mary Poppins.''
Last week, Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat, flew to Kabul in part to discuss the Salehi case with Mr. Karzai. In an interview afterward, Mr. Kerry expressed concern about Mr. Salehi's ties to the American government. Mr. Kerry appeared to allude to the C.I.A., though he did not mention it.
''We are going to have to examine that relationship,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''We are going to have to look at that very carefully.''
Mr. Kerry said he pressed Mr. Karzai to allow the anticorruption unit pursuing Mr. Salehi and others to move forward unhindered, and said he believed he had secured a commitment from him to do so.
''Corruption matters to us,'' a senior Obama administration official said. ''The fact that Salehi may have been on our payroll does not necessarily change any of the basic issues here.''
Mr. Salehi is a political survivor, who, like many Afghans, navigated shifting alliances through 31 years of war. He is a former interpreter for Abdul Rashid Dostum, the ethnic Uzbek with perhaps the most ruthless reputation among all Afghan warlords.
Mr. Dostum, a Karzai ally, was one of the C.I.A.'s leading allies on the ground in Afghanistan in the weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The agency employed his militia to help rout the Taliban from northern Afghanistan.
Over the course of the nine-year-old war, the C.I.A. has enmeshed itself in the inner workings of Afghanistan's national security establishment. From 2002 until just last year, the C.I.A. paid the entire budget of Afghanistan's spy service, the National Directorate of Security.
Mr. Salehi often acts as a courier of money to other Afghans, according to an Afghan politician who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he feared retaliation.
Among the targets of the continuing Afghan anticorruption investigation is a secret fund of cash from which payments were made to various individuals, officials here said.
Despite Mr. Salehi's status as a low-level functionary, the Afghan politician predicted that Mr. Karzai would never allow his prosecution to go forward, whatever the pressure from the United States. Mr. Salehi knows too much about the inner workings of the palace, he said.
''Karzai will protect him,'' the politician said, ''because by going after him, you are opening the gates.''
Mr. Salehi is a confidant of some of the most powerful people in the Afghan government, including Engineer Ibrahim, who until recently was the deputy chief of the Afghan intelligence service. Earlier this year, Mr. Salehi accompanied Mr. Ibrahim to Dubai to meet leaders of the Taliban to explore prospects for peace, according to a prominent Afghan with knowledge of the meeting.
Mr. Salehi was arrested last month in the course of a sprawling investigation into New Ansari, a money transfer firm that relies on couriers and other rudimentary means to move cash in and out of Afghanistan.
New Ansari was founded in the 1990s when the Taliban ruled most of Afghanistan. In the years since 2001, New Ansari grew into one of the most important financial hubs in Afghanistan, transferring billions of dollars in cash for prominent Afghans out of the country, most of it to Dubai.
New Ansari's offices were raided by Afghan agents, with American backing, in January. An American official familiar with the investigation said New Ansari appeared to have been transferring money for wealthy Afghans of every sort, including politicians, insurgents and drug traffickers.
''They were moving money for everybody,'' the American official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The flow of capital out of Afghanistan is so large that it makes up a substantial portion of Afghanistan's gross domestic product. In an interview, a United Arab Emirates customs official said it received about $1 billion from Afghanistan in 2009. But the American official said the amount might be closer to $2.5 billion -- about a quarter of Afghanistan's gross domestic product.
Much of the New Ansari cash was carried by couriers flying from Kabul and Kandahar, usually to Dubai, where many Afghan officials maintain second homes and live in splendorous wealth.
An American official familiar with the investigation said the examination of New Ansari's books was providing rich insights into the culture of Afghan corruption.
''It's a gold mine,'' the official said.
Following the arrest, Mr. Salehi called Mr. Karzai directly from his cell to demand that he be freed. Mr. Karzai twice sent delegations to the detention center where Mr. Salehi was held. After seven hours, Mr. Salehi was let go.
Afterward, Gen. Nazar Mohammed Nikzad, the head of the Afghan unit investigating Mr. Salehi, was summoned to the Presidential Palace and asked by Mr. Karzai to explain his actions.
''Everything is lawful and by the book,'' a Western official said of the Afghan anticorruption investigators. ''They gather the evidence, they get the warrant signed off -- and then the plug gets pulled every time.''
This is not the first time that Afghan prosecutors have run into resistance when they have tried to pursue an Afghan official on corruption charges related to New Ansari.
Sediq Chekari, the minister for Hajj and Religious Affairs, was allowed to flee the country as investigators prepared to charge him with accepting bribes in exchange for steering business to tour operators who ferry people to Saudi Arabia each year. Mr. Chekari fled to Britain, officials said. Afghanistan's attorney general issued an arrest warrant through Interpol.
American officials say a key player in the scandal is Hajji Rafi Azimi, the vice chairman of Afghan United Bank. The bank's chairman, Hajji Mohammed Jan, is a founder of New Ansari. According to American officials, Afghan prosecutors would like to arrest Mr. Azimi but so far have run into political interference they did not specify. He has not been formally charged.
In the past, some Western officials have expressed frustration at the political resistance that Afghan prosecutors have encountered when they have tried to investigate Afghan officials. Earlier this year, the American official said that the Obama administration was considering extraordinary measures to bring corrupt Afghan officials to justice, including extradition.
''We are pushing some high-level public corruption cases right now, and they are just constantly stalling and stalling and stalling,'' the American official said of the Karzai administration.
Another Western official said he was growing increasingly concerned about the morale -- and safety -- of the Afghan anticorruption prosecutors.
So far, the Afghan prosecutors have not folded. The Salehi case is likely to resurface -- and very soon. Under Afghan law, prosecutors have a maximum of 33 days to indict a person after his arrest. Mr. Salehi was arrested in late July.
That means Afghan prosecutors may soon come before the Afghan attorney general, Mohammed Ishaq Aloko, to seek an indictment. It will be up to Mr. Aloko, who owes his job to Mr. Karzai, to sign it.
''They are all just doing their jobs,'' the Western official said. ''They are scared for their lives. They are scared for their families. If it continues, they will eventually give up the fight.''

HEADLINE: The Wrong Kind of Enthusiasm

 BODY:
Republican insurgents from the far right did well in Tuesday's primaries. What their campaigns lack in logic, compassion and sensible policy seems to be counterbalanced by a fiercely committed voter base that is nowhere to be seen on the Democratic side. 
In Alaska, Joe Miller, a little-known lawyer from Fairbanks, has a lead for the G.O.P. Senate nomination over Lisa Murkowski, the incumbent. The race is too close to call, but Mr. Miller's possible victory shows the power of his mentor, Sarah Palin, and the misguided popularity of his anti-immigrant, pro-gun message. Among other dubious positions, he has questioned the constitutionality of unemployment benefits.
In Florida, far more Republicans turned out to vote than Democrats, even though the Democrats have a large registration advantage. In the G.O.P. governor's race, those voters chose Rick Scott, a former health care executive, who used his personal fortune and hard-right rhetoric on immigration to beat Bill McCollum, the attorney general, who is no centrist.
Party voters clearly did not care that Mr. Scott's trumpeted business skills were honed as chief executive of Columbia/HCA, which paid $1.7 billion in federal fines after bilking Medicaid with phony reimbursement claims. Mr. Scott said he knew nothing of the fraud and left with a substantial severance payment.
The good news is that the anti-immigrant message may not play as well in Florida in the general election. The Democratic nominee for governor, Alex Sink, who opposes the Arizona immigration law, polled more votes on Tuesday than did Mr. Scott. In the state's Republican Senate primary, Marco Rubio, a Tea Party candidate who is backed by Ms. Palin but who has been less shrill on immigration, won more than a million votes after Gov. Charlie Crist dropped out to run as an independent.
Insurgents did not triumph everywhere. In Arizona, Senator John McCain easily fended off a challenge by a former congressman, J. D. Hayworth. But he did so by throwing his principles overboard. Gone was the stalwart voice for campaign finance reform and a humane, bipartisan overhaul of immigration laws. In his place was a man calling himself ''Arizona's last line of defense,'' strutting along the Mexican border in a campaign ad, telling a county sheriff that all we had to do to fix immigration was ''complete the danged fence.''
Much of the G.O.P's fervid populist energy has been churned up by playing on some people's fears of Hispanics and Muslims, by painting the president as a dangerous radical, by distorting the truth about the causes of the recession. Far too many Republican leaders have eagerly fed that destructive anger.
And where are the Democrats in all of this? Last time we checked, they were fleeing solid accomplishments on health care, financial reform and the economy. President Obama and his party have little time left to gin up enthusiasm and a lot more committed voters.

HEADLINE: Obama, Mindful of Elections and Weak Reports, Holds Economic Talks

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
VINEYARD HAVEN, Mass. -- Amid the latest signs of a faltering recovery, President Obama held a lengthy conference call with economic advisers on Wednesday to discuss a course of action in a partisan election season that leaves them little room to maneuver.
The call, which the president held from his vacation retreat, was with his Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner; Christina D. Romer, the soon-departing chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers; and Lawrence H. Summers, director of the White House National Economic Council. The discussion came as the second report in two days pointed to a weaker-than-expected housing sector -- a weakness that acts as a drag on the broader economy. 
''The discussion focused on recent data reports, global markets and economic growth,'' said a White House statement afterward. ''The economic team provided an update on the next steps to keep the economy growing, including assistance to small businesses and the extension of tax cuts to the middle class.''
The president also is considering an initiative that would match public and private investments in transportation infrastructure projects. He hinted at the idea repeatedly, without details, during a multicity trip last week before he left on vacation.
''We need 21st-century infrastructure -- not just roads and bridges, but faster Internet access and high-speed rail -- projects that can lead to hundreds of thousands of new, private sector jobs,'' Mr. Obama said in Seattle.
Yet when Congress returns from its summer break in September, all such efforts will hit a wall of Republican opposition. In part, the White House statement about the vacationing president's conference call was intended to signal to voters his continued engagement on economic matters, even as his options are limited.
The call came on a day when the government reported that sales of new homes fell unexpectedly in July, the first month in which buyers no longer could get a tax credit that was part of a federal stimulus program. That news followed an industry report on Tuesday that sales of existing homes in July slid to the lowest level in a decade.
Together, the reports stoked fears among more pessimistic forecasters of another recession, though most economists still expect the economy to recover -- if more slowly than previously thought.
Also this week, on Tuesday, the House Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, delivered a blistering attack on the administration's stimulus policies to set the opposition's tone for the final campaign stretch. But on the same day, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported that the policies had lifted growth in the second quarter by up to 4.5 percent.
Some private forecasters have reduced their growth projections partly because the administration's stimulus plan is winding down and a polarized Congress shows little sign of doing more.
Mr. Obama and Congress's Democratic leaders have only a short time for action between lawmakers' return and their departure again in October to campaign for re-election. And Republicans are emboldened in their opposition, as polls attesting to the public's frustration with persistent high unemployment make the party increasingly hopeful of winning control of Congress in November. In any case, nothing the White House and Congress do would show results before the elections.
Even so, the pressure to act could well intensify next week when Mr. Obama is back in Washington. His week will be dominated by foreign policy -- Mr. Obama gives a prime-time address on the end of combat operations in Iraq on Tuesday and then hosts two days of Middle East peace talks -- yet it will end that Friday with the release of unemployment data for August, which has Democrats braced for disappointing news.
The administration's main initiative now, which the president proposed at the start of the year, would provide additional tax cuts to small businesses and create a government-backed body to increase lending to them. It has been stalled by Republicans in the Senate.
Also, Congress must act by the end of this year if the Bush-era income tax cuts are to be extended beyond their Dec. 31 expiration. Mr. Obama wants to extend the tax cuts for 98 percent of Americans, but the Republicans are insisting on extending all the tax cuts given the economy's continued weakness.
The fight over tax cuts for the wealthy is likely to dominate discussion in coming weeks, and the president and his economic and political teams have only begun to focus on their strategy.
Republicans say Democrats want to impose a big tax increase on successful small businesses by letting the tax rates for the wealthiest Americans expire, while Democrats counter that Republicans are fighting for the wealthiest 2 percent, who do not need the money and would not spend it to stimulate the economy.
While data show that fewer than 3 percent of small businesses would pay higher taxes if the top rates revert to their pre-2001 level, enough Democratic lawmakers feel vulnerable to Republicans' arguments about small businesses that the White House and Congressional leaders could end up postponing the issue until after the elections, in a lame-duck session.
With the president on vacation, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been the administration's public face. At a forum in a pizza restaurant in Washington on Wednesday, he said, ''To extend those tax cuts costs $700 billion over 10 years at a time when we are worried about the economy, when long term, we have to be worried about deficits.''

HEADLINE: Surprise Victor In a Packed Race: Dan Quayle's Son

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY; Dan Frosch contributed reporting from Denver.

 BODY:
PHOENIX -- Those who want to stop Ben Quayle from going to Congress had better start studying his old lacrosse game films.
Mr. Quayle, who managed a slim win in a crowded field for the Republican nomination for Congress on Tuesday in a district that encompasses northern Phoenix and the upscale Scottsdale and Paradise Valley suburbs, played high school lacrosse while his father, Dan Quayle, was vice president. He went on to play for Duke.
Old coaches and teammates said he was often considered a lightweight because of his lean, unassuming physique. But as rivals rolled their eyes, Mr. Quayle would scoot past them. 
''I was definitely not a star player but I worked hard,'' Mr. Quayle said in an interview.
That is what happened this week when Mr. Quayle, 33, a political neophyte, defeated nine Republican challengers, some of them veteran politicians, to win the nomination for the Third Congressional District. Some of those rival camps were still staring in disbelief at the results on Wednesday.
Democrats, meanwhile, said they eagerly anticipated a crack at another Quayle, hinting that they might pour money into the Republican-leaning race to neutralize the son of the gaffe-prone former vice president.
Mr. Quayle, who seemed to be surprised by the victory himself, acknowledged that he had his work cut out for him, having won just 22 percent of Republican voters on Tuesday.
''For those who voted for someone else, I know I have to earn your trust,'' he said on Wednesday, with supporters and relatives, including his wife and father, gathered around.
Those who have known Mr. Quayle recalled him as well-grounded, for someone who grew up with government bodyguards.
''He was a good player, a good kid, worked hard,'' said Peter Bahor, Mr. Quayle's lacrosse coach at Gonzaga College High School, a Roman Catholic prep school in Washington.
As a boy, he was a Congressional page, and when his mother, Marilyn, made disaster preparedness her cause, Ben and his older brother, Tucker, participated in a mock disaster in California, acting wounded while soldiers scampered around to respond.
Mr. Quayle performed some charitable work as a child, once volunteering at a Washington homeless shelter with President George Bush's grandson George, a son of Jeb and Columba Bush. To avoid creating a stir, the boys used their mothers' maiden names at the shelter, becoming George Garnica and Ben Tucker.
It is another pseudonym, however, that may have a greater effect on Mr. Quayle's chances of following his father into politics. He was hammered in the primary when the owner of a local risque Web site said that Mr. Quayle had been an occasional contributor, commenting on the physical attributes of women and using the name Brock Landers, a porn star character in the movie ''Boogie Nights.''
Mr. Quayle's Democratic challenger, a lawyer and businessman named Jon Hulburd, was quick to pounce on Wednesday, issuing a statement saying, ''This election is now between Jon Hulburd and Brock Landers.''
Mr. Quayle brushed off the attacks. ''You build thick skin being a Quayle,'' he said, noting that his father had been giving him this advice: ''Don't let the sideshow get you down.''
In this Republican-leaning district, the race is considered Mr. Quayle's to lose. ''It will take a near miracle for a Democratic candidate to win in that district in this environment,'' said Kurt Davis, a Republican strategist in Phoenix.
Dan Quayle came to his son's aid when the campaign was floundering, criticizing the attacks on his son in an 11th-hour e-mail to supporters. He offered no comment on Wednesday, but simply stuck his thumb in the air when asked what he thought of his son's win.
The younger Mr. Quayle used his father's connections well, raising more than $1.3 million.
Mr. Hulburd said that he had raised more than Mr. Quayle within the state of Arizona and that he intended to take his rival seriously. ''I'm a Democrat running in the state of Arizona in 2010,'' he said. ''I consider myself nothing if not the underdog.''
Mr. Quayle, who bears a striking resemblance to his mother, has shown some of his father's propensity for verbal gymnastics, denying, for instance, any connection to that racy Web site but later acknowledging that he may have written a few postings.
An online quotation attributed to him, which will no doubt find its way into Democratic campaign advertisements, is, ''My moral compass is so broken I can barely find the parking lot.''
And his campaign sent out a mailer of Mr. Quayle with two young girls, leaving the impression they were his children. But the newly married Mr. Quayle has no children and opponents accused him of ''renting'' a family for the campaign. The girls were his nieces. The episode won him a jab from Jay Leno, a milestone for a little known Congressional candidate.
Mr. Quayle runs an investment firm with his brother and has made restoring the economy his prime campaign theme. (In one attention-getting ad, he called President Obama the ''worst president in history'' for his economic stewardship and said he planned to go to Washington ''to knock the hell out of the place.'')
Even before Mr. Quayle won, one Arizona business he has already helped is that of thedirty.com, the successor to the Web site for which he once wrote, which says traffic is higher than ever.

HEADLINE: The Trends Of August

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Since this is possibly the most depressing August in the history of summer, I feel compelled to point out a brighter side of the news.
In Arizona on Tuesday, Republican voters totally rejected the Congressional candidacy of State Senator Pamela Gorman (''conservative Christian and a pretty fair shot''), whose TV ad showed her firing a machine gun at an undisclosed target. Only about 5,000 people in the district thought sending Pamela Gorman to Washington would be a good plan. And it was 110 degrees that day, so a number of those might have been hallucinating.
The winner of this primary was Ben Quayle, son of Dan and Marilyn, whose campaign was flagging until his parents each sent out e-mail blasts urging people to vote for their son. That put him over the top with a whopping 14,266 votes. 
Quayle may have been the beneficiary of a notable trend in this week's elections: victories by people whose mothers helped them campaign. Rick Scott, the rich-guy gubernatorial candidate in Florida, won a surprise upset after he sent his mother to represent him in the final debate. Clearly, the voters were thinking that being forced to listen to another debate would be bad, that mothers were good, and therefore Scott deserved to be the Republican nominee for governor.
We do not pay much attention to races for governor in any state other than our own. But it's going to be hard to resist watching to see if Florida wants to put its fate in the hands of a guy who looks like Lex Luthor and once ran a company that admitted defrauding the government of $1.7 billion. It's right up there with the machine-gun woman.
The big trend among Republicans is voting out the incumbent, even if said incumbent is a Republican. In their primaries, the Democrats tend to go for the status quo. This makes sense, since the Republicans are looking for a way to show they're angry, angry, angry while the Democrats are too terrified of the Republicans to do anything but hunker down.
In response, the Republican establishment is in identity denial. John Boehner is vowing that if his party wins a majority in the House, he will run things differently than either Nancy Pelosi or her Republican predecessor, the evil dictator John Boehner. And of course, Senator John McCain just notched up a triumph in Arizona, running against Senator John McCain.
The Democrats aren't much better -- unless you think it's a good plan for Robin Carnahan, the Democratic candidate for Senate in Missouri, to be calling her opponent ''the very worst of Washington'' for supporting the same financial services bailout that President Obama and most of the Democrats in Congress backed. Really, the way these people are fleeing their parties, you'd almost think neither side has any clue of what to do to resuscitate the economy.
Instead of running as part of a group with a shared ideology and agenda, candidates run biography ads that stress their sterling character. A deprived childhood is always good. Kendrick Meek, the Democratic nominee for Senate in Florida, ran as the son of a struggling single mother even though his particular single mother was also the local congresswoman. And did you know John Boehner used to mop the floor of his dad's bar when he was 11?
This stuff is completely useless for the voters, since party affiliation is actually the only reliable indicator of how a candidate will behave in office. TV ads about prior achievements and moral integrity will tell you virtually nothing about what someone will do once they're elected. I speak from experience, as a person who voted for Eliot Spitzer for governor.
And of course we have the general nasty-tone trend, as evidenced by the way Republicans desperate for an applause line grab onto the ''mosque at ground zero.'' This kind of thing gets worst in August when, absent a good hurricane, the media has very little to talk about. I blame the failure of celebrities to melt down when we need them most. If only Al and Tipper Gore were getting divorced because Tipper fell in love with Tiger Woods. Or if the woman who got caught putting a cat in a garbage can had been American. Really, anything about cats is good.
Maybe the citizenry should demand a Voter Bill of Rights.
Article One: Freedom from being forced to choose between two dreadful candidates when the temperature is higher than 90 degrees.
Article Two: Candidates cannot talk about their childhood beyond attesting that they had one.
Article Three: Candidates are required to list all the really serious issue disagreements they have with their party. If they reach six, they should find a different ticket.
Article Four: Less talking about mosques.
Article Five: More cat stories.

HEADLINE: Despite Reform, Banks Have Room For Risky Deals

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and ERIC DASH

 BODY:
When Congress passed a new financial regulation bill last month, it sought to prevent federally insured banks from making speculative bets using their own money. But that will not stop banks from making bets that some critics deem risky, even as the rules go into effect over the next few years.
That is because many such bets -- on the direction of the stock market or the price of coal, for example -- are done on behalf of clients. So, the banks say, they will continue to be allowable despite the new restrictions. 
Indeed, several trades that were made on behalf of clients went bad for the banks even as the new rules were being debated in Washington this year. JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, for example, each lost more than $100 million on transactions handled for customers in the period from April to July.
Blowups like these, only larger, contributed to the financial crisis and forced the federal government to spend billions of dollars to bail out financial institutions. Yet analysts are quick to point out that many of those transactions were handled by the banks, ostensibly to serve clients.
''You can use client activity as a cover for basically anything you are doing,'' said Janet Tavakoli, who runs her own structured finance consulting firm. ''It's very problematic that losses like this are showing up. It's a prime example of what the financial reform bill doesn't address.''
That ambiguity could have broad consequences for the future of trading on Wall Street.
Given the size of the banks, these recent losses were relatively small. But they highlight how banks will continue to be able to make bets where their own money is at risk -- a practice that has yielded huge profits on Wall Street in recent years.
Though these trades were made on behalf of clients, they subjected the banks to the kind of risk that Congress sought to curtail when it devised the Volcker Rule, which banned banks from speculating with their own money. That practice is known as proprietary trading.
Even before the new rules were passed, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan began dismantling their stand-alone ''prop desks'' and shifting those traders into client-related businesses. Goldman is considering changes that could turn some of its star proprietary traders into asset managers who rely on capital from outside investors.
But for all the talk of shutting down trading desks and reassigning employees to prepare for the Volcker Rule, proprietary-style trading will probably survive, if under a different name.
This year, for example, several large insurance companies approached Goldman Sachs, looking to bet that the markets would not stay quiet. Goldman gladly took the other side of the trades, but when the markets turned choppy in May, the firm was caught short and quickly lost $250 million.
Goldman, through a spokesman, declined to comment on its losses on that investment. But in a conference call with analysts last month, the bank's chief financial officer, David Viniar, explained: ''We didn't hedge it fast enough. Things spiked really dramatically, really fast.''
Months before that trade, though, Goldman Sachs's research department named a bet against volatility as one its top 10 trading strategies for 2010. Goldman followed its own advice and put its own money in play by failing to adequately hedge the trade with the client who wanted to bet on volatility, which would have given Goldman a neutral position. In this way, a client-oriented trade can effectively become a proprietary bet.
To be sure, in some cases it is necessary for a bank to take a financial risk in order to execute trades quickly and preserve market liquidity.
What is more, it can be difficult even for Wall Streeters to draw the line between holding securities as inventory for clients and owning them with a view toward where the market is going.
Goldman Sachs, for example, derived about $37.3 billion from trading activities in 2009, according to a Citigroup research report. Perhaps $1.5 billion, or about 4 percent of that revenue, came from dedicated proprietary trading desks. Were other Goldman traders essentially making proprietary bets in the process of serving clients? Likely, analysts and traders say -- though it is very hard to tell.
''Goldman tends to have businesses that have a customer focus with a proprietary overlay,'' said one hedge fund manager and Goldman alumnus who insisted on anonymity. ''That overlay can effectively allow them to make directional bets by using the customer flow to get them there.''
But Goldman is hardly unique when it comes to walking the fine line between serving clients and taking positions.
Late last year, with clients eager to bet that coal prices would rise, JPMorgan took the other side of the trade and amassed contracts on hundreds of millions of dollars on coal -- enough to dominate the European market.
Initially the trade went JPMorgan's way and yielded profits, but in April the Morgan traders were caught off guard when European coal futures abruptly started rising. In fact, the wrong-sided bets erased all of the previous gains, and by the middle of June, it had turned into one of the commodities unit's biggest losses -- nearly $130 million.
JPMorgan would not disclose the names of the clients and would not comment for this article. But in an internal conference call, Blythe Masters, who oversees the commodities unit, said that the bank made an error in judgment taking a risk on its own behalf.
''We made a bit of a rookie error,'' she said, according to parts of a recording first published by Bloomberg News. ''We got overexposed in the market and made ourselves vulnerable to a squeeze.''
Over the years, banks have shifted from being intermediaries who match buyer and seller to middlemen who put their own capital at risk.
When a trade request comes in from a customer, traders have the option of handing it off to a second party that wants to take the other side.
But if a second investor cannot be found, or if the trading desk has a market outlook that aligns with the bet, the trader can take the opposing position using the bank's own account. The bank can then either hold on to that risk or hedge the investment so that its position is effectively neutral.
In the case of Goldman's bet on volatility, the investment soured before the bank could sell it or reduce the risk.

HEADLINE: Ex-President Carter Arrives in North Korea on Mission to Free Imprisoned American

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN; Peter Baker contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- Former President Jimmy Carter arrived in North Korea on Wednesday to seek the release of an American held by the North, its state-run media reported.
Analysts in Seoul said Mr. Carter, who helped defuse a Korean nuclear crisis more than 16 years ago, could also try to help end the two countries' impasse.
The man Mr. Carter is seeking to free is Aijalon Mahli Gomes, a 30-year-old Christian from Boston who was arrested in January for crossing into North Korea and sentenced in April to eight years of hard labor and fined $700,000. Last month, North Korea said he tried to kill himself out of ''frustration with the U.S. government's failure to free him.'' 
The visit by Mr. Carter, an evangelical Christian, is the second to North Korea by a former American president in a year on what the United States described as a private humanitarian missions. Last August, Bill Clinton flew there and met with the reclusive North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, to secure the release of two American journalists held for five months for illegal entry.
The Obama administration kept its distance, emphasizing that Mr. Carter not an envoy. ''I'll just say that President Carter is on a private humanitarian mission and I'm not going to comment more beyond that,'' said Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman.
But as with Mr. Clinton's visit, Mr. Carter's has deeper diplomatic undercurrents. The North Koreans have used the captive Americans as bargaining chips, promising to release them in exchange for visits from specific high-profile Americans. North Korea can portray the meetings domestically as evidence of its international importance, while the United States has a high-level direct encounter that it cannot officially engage in.
But Mr. Carter has a long history as an independent agent, and some administration officials worried that he might undercut their policy in some way and make it harder to keep up the pressure on Pyongyang to give up its nuclear program.
It was not immediately clear who among the North Koreans would meet with Mr. Carter. The North Korean media reports said that he was greeted at the airport in Pyongyang, the capital, by Kim Kye-gwan, a senior diplomat who has been the North's main envoy to the six-nation talks on its nuclear weapons program. The talks have been stalled for more than two years, but the North recently said it was willing to return to the discussions.
Higher-level meetings would appear to be likely, since Mr. Carter's visit comes at a fraught time for North Korea. Its economy remains deeply troubled, and its ravaged agricultural sector has been further damaged by recent flooding. A March torpedo attack that sank one of the South's warships, killing 46 sailors, drove inter-Korean relations to their lowest point in years and added to tensions with the United States. In addition, there may be a struggle over succession within the government of Kim Jong-il, who has had serious health problems.
The case of Mr. Gomes also touches on efforts of Christians in South Korea and the United States on behalf of North Koreans. His illegal entry was made in support of Robert Park, a fellow Christian from the United States who crossed from China in December to call attention to the dismal conditions in the North's prison camps. Mr. Park was expelled after about 40 days.
Mr. Carter has been a contentious figure among South Korean conservatives. ''Carter is idealistic, not realistic when it comes to North Korea,'' said Hong Kwan-hee, director of the Institute for Security Strategy in Seoul. ''North Korea always has tried to use prominent Americans, preferably Democrats, as a medium to engage the United States and drive a wedge between Seoul and Washington.
In another development, the South Korean authorities on Thursday morning were looking into indications that Mr. Kim, the North Korean leader, might be visiting China, an official in the presidential office of South Korea said. News media in South Korea, including the national news agency, Yonhap, and the mass-circulation daily, Chosun, reported the same on their Web sites.
''We have signs that Kim Jong-il is visiting China,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the matter. ''It's unclear whether he has arrived or is still on the move.''
If true, this would be Mr. Kim's sixth trip to China and his second in three months. North Korea and China usually do not confirm a trip by Mr. Kim until after it is over. His previous trips were often preceded by weeks of media speculation. Many journalists waited on the Chinese side of the border to wait for his train to cross. This time, there was no such activity.

HEADLINE: BHP Doing Fine Without Potash

BYLINE: By UNA GALANI and CHRISTOPHER SWANN

 BODY:
BHP Billiton, the Australian mining company, has shown it doesn't actually need to buy the Potash Corporation. BHP's impressive annual results on Wednesday are a reminder of the financial firepower behind its $39 billion hostile bid for Potash, the world's largest fertilizer group. But they also show that BHP is not broken -- and that its chief executive, Marius Kloppers, does not need to bet a strong balance sheet on further diversification.
It's clear BHP can afford to pay more than the $130-a-share offer that it has now taken directly to Potash's shareholders. In the year that ended June 30, BHP generated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $24.5 billion, up 10 percent, driven by record production in oil and iron ore. And at midyear, its ratio of net debt to net assets plus net debt stood at just 6 percent. 
Still, BHP has yet to make a compelling strategic case for the deal. It is already sufficiently diversified to have delivered its sixth consecutive year of operating margins of 40 percent or more, despite the global financial crisis. Buying Potash would deprive BHP's shareholders of a significant potential cash return, too.
With an increasing correlation between commodities and associated equity plays over the last two years, it is hard to see great benefits to BHP from adding a 10th division. Citigroup estimates that owning the fertilizer group would have increased, not decreased, the volatility of BHP's earnings on a historic basis.
BHP's current bid doesn't look overpriced and it has said it won't overpay. One constraint is that an offer at $150 a share, near where Potash's shares are now trading in New York, would activate a requirement for shareholder approval.
Even so, Mr. Kloppers may be tempted to let discipline slip. But BHP's strength means he can also afford to walk away. If he wants to avoid turning BHP's premium rating into a discount, he needs to be ready to do so.
A Golden Parachute
Half a billion dollars would color the decisions of most mortals. That's roughly the payday awaiting William J. Doyle, Potash's chief executive, if BHP Billiton is successful in buying the company he runs.
But Mr. Doyle has sat on larger sums before and held tight. With a deal-related golden parachute accounting for only a small fraction of the total, he has no obvious incentive to short-change shareholders with a quick flip of the company.
True, even if Potash's shareholders go for the $130-a-share BHP deal on offer Mr. Doyle, who is 60, would collect $445 million for his stock and options. And Wednesday's Potash market price of $145.50 suggests shareholders -- and Mr. Doyle -- will end up getting more.
Still, it is difficult to feel much outrage when a $100 investment in the firm made when he took over in July 1999 would now be worth $1,746. Not only has the stock's performance outrun the TSX 60 index in Canada, it has also dwarfed returns for fertilizer rivals Mosaic and Agrium.
In any event, Mr. Doyle's holdings were already worth around $380 million before BHP came along. And he has reason to be confident this value would not disappear if BHP's bid failed.
At the height of the food crisis two years ago, the Potash stock price topped $230. Many of the trends that powered that surge -- notably shifts in eating habits in fast-growing developing economies -- remain in place.
There's an extra fillip for Mr. Doyle in selling, of course. He'd get $28 million in severance and accelerated stock options from a change of control. But at just 6 percent of the current value of his stock and options, it's hard to see that as a big motivation, not least because he would eventually receive much of the money anyway, according to compensation experts at the Corporate Library.
Chief executives regularly play down personal motives that could conflict with shareholder interests. And Mr. Doyle's assertion that he doesn't care about the money strains credulity. Even so, his incentives seem in line with those of other shareholders. BHP, as a result, can't rely on Mr. Doyle's eagerness to help it get Potash at a bargain price.

HEADLINE: What Do Girls Want?

BYLINE: By CATHY HORYN

 BODY:
ONE morning early this month, Kate Ciepluch, the fashion director of the online retailer Shopbop, assembled members of her buying team in a conference room in the company's offices on Broadway in SoHo.
Everyone in attendance was in her 20s or early 30s; Ms. Ciepluch, blonde and tomboyish and dressed in chinos and a denim jacket with the sleeves cut off, is 28. She was a freshman at the University of Wisconsin in Madison when she started at the company, in its original Bop store, then moved to New York to become a buyer after it went online, in 2000.
Back then, the bulk of Shopbop's business was in 7 For All Mankind jeans and Juicy Couture tracksuits. Today, the site is a leading purveyor of contemporary fashion -- and its power baffles people in the industry. ''We sell a lot of stuff on Shopbop, and we're not exactly sure why,'' said Leslie Rubisch, the press director at Alexander Wang. Next to its worldly big sister Net-a-Porter, Shopbop feels stubbornly attuned to its core audience, as though the site has been talking to them since college. 
''They have tremendous credibility with these girls,'' Paula Sutter, the president of Diane von Furstenberg, said, referring to Ms. Ciepluch and the buyers. In fact, on many items Shopbop will outsell DVF's own site by three to one. As a company, Ms. Sutter said, ''you're crazy not to pay attention to what they do.''
If the buying habits of women in their 20s receive a disproportionate amount of attention -- the big spenders, after all, are older people with both the means and the responsibilities -- they also influence fashion, and have since the '60s. So Alexa Chung has supplanted Kate Moss and Sienna Miller in influence. And it doesn't seem to matter that Ms. Chung's style of mixing her mom's blazer with a frilly Topshop dress is just another micro-generation of the Kate-Sienna story. ''It's that juxtaposition that the Alexa Chungs of the world are loving right now,'' said Sasha Sarokin, a buyer at Net-a-Porter.
There is plenty of research about the so-called Millennials -- people ages 18 to 29 -- to suggest you can't lump them all together. Not only is this group likely to become the most educated generation in American history, according to a Pew Research Center survey this year, it is also the most racially and ethnically diverse. At the same time, this generation's 37 percent unemployment rate is certain to affect taste. It may explain an underlying conservatism in fall fashion -- penny loafers, camel coats, longer hemlines -- that goes beyond ''Mad Men'' hype.
Lately, Hannah Byun, the founder of Hansel from Basel, a hosiery company in Los Angeles, has been wearing a below-the-knee skirt with woven sandals and a button-down shirt, in spite of her boyfriend's comment that she looks like a Mennonite. That's O.K. with Ms. Byun, 30, but actually she was thinking of Audrey Hepburn.
''Honestly, I feel very 'Roman Holiday,''' said Ms. Byun, whose fall wish list includes LD Tuttle boots and an Acne military jacket.
What does unite this generation is the Internet, in particular online shopping and blogs like that of the street photographer Garance Dore and sites like Polyvore.com, where users play editor-slash-stylist and can see what's for sale on the top sites.
Women like Ms. Byun, or Lauren Wynns, a 27-year-old law student in Washington, who works for a business consulting firm, or Nicky Deam, a 25-year-old publicist in New York, do much of their shopping online. Ms. Wynns, for one, said she now gets most of her fashion information from online retailers like Lagarconne.com, Revolveclothing.com and Shopbop, and from blogs rather than magazines. And because a lot of high-end apparel is hard to find online -- compared with the amount shown on runways -- it's not surprising that young women now seem to gauge their interest in a brand not in terms of its prestige or craft but rather in terms of its accessibility. Even if Ms. Wynns could afford their products, she said, ''their Web sites aren't really tailored to a great shopping experience.''
You can understand why brands like Chanel want to limit their Web exposure, but what happens to interest if the immediate outlet is blocked? ''This is not a generation that will wait to get a number for admission,'' said Candace Corlett, a partner at WSL Strategic Retail in New York, a retail consultant. ''They'll find another way to get what they want.''
That's what shopping sites are banking on. And it's why their buying chiefs, like Holli Rogers of Net-a-Porter or Kris Kim, the founder of La Garconne, have increased their clout with fashion designers, like David Neville, a founder of Rag & Bone, which has seen sales on Shopbop soar in recent seasons. Maybe these sites haven't kicked the traditional store buyer out of the front row -- yet -- but they certainly have changed the game very quickly.
Based on interviews with design executives, like Shirley Cook, the chief executive of Proenza Schouler, three sites stand out: Shopbop, La Garconne and Net-a-Porter, which has added more contemporary labels, including Isabel Marant, Rag & Bone and J. Crew, to its roster of high-end brands. La Garconne is perhaps the most narrowly focused, with a boyish persona, as its name implies, while Shopbop is like your self-assured Midwestern cousin who always gets the guy. I sat down with members of each site to ask what's on young women's lists for fall.
From a rack of clothes in La Garconne's SoHo office, Ms. Kim and her buying assistant Mia Kim (no relation) ticked off their top trends, starting with a shaggy fake fur Proenza Schouler coat, about $3,100. ''It's a statement but not too much in-your-face,'' as Mia Kim put it. ''I would wear it more low key -- just throw it on over trousers.'' There were other rough fur pieces, in creamy lamb or fox from Vanessa Bruno and Charles Anastase, and shearling-topped Margiela booties that prompted Kris Kim to observe: ''We've been seeing grunge, but a refined grunge. It's a little nerdish and bookish.''
That could also be La Garconne's interpretation of chunky knits (styles by Zucca and Viktor & Rolf have been selling well) and pointy kitten-heel shoes worn with ankle socks, though that look has already been widely documented. The buyers also think their customers want a change from short skirts; they ordered a long tulip-shaped skirt from Rick Owens Lilies (around $500) and an at-the-knee '70s style in clay-colored Ultrasuede from Le Mont St. Michel (about $300).
''We used to do a ton of business in charcoal gray,'' said Kris Kim, who started La Garconne five years ago. ''Now the girls have moved on. They want colors -- sophisticated greens and peaches.''
''Wearable color,'' the other Ms. Kim added. ''Nothing too bright or shocking.''
Net-a-Porter is based in London, but I met Ms. Rogers and Ms. Sarokin in a Greenwich Village restaurant -- with their iPad. Both women are American, so that gives them a broad perspective on style. ''I think the London girl does look better than anyone else,'' said Ms. Sarokin, who is from California. ''But are the hipsters going to be as good in London as they are here?''
She favors Burberry's shearling aviator jackets (variations appear to be on many fall hit lists), tailored dark-rinse denim trousers, wedge booties and clogs and Stella McCartney's clean sportswear lines.
Earlier this summer, Ms. Rogers was in New York. ''I wasn't here an evening before I realized, my God, everyone's wearing these really short, high-waist shorts,'' she said. ''So I e-mailed the team, 'Make sure we've got that covered.' '' They got leather shorts from Theory that sold out in days. Ms. Rogers also sees, along with British heritage pieces like tweeds, a wave of Americana, like polos and dark, rolled-up denim. Nicky Deam, who works for the fashion publicity firm KCD, said she plans to extend her shorts into fall, wearing tights and booties. ''I'll make it demure on top so it doesn't look like I'm working a street corner,'' said Ms. Deam, whose main fashion expense is a couple of pairs of shoes every few months, or about $600. Also on her list is a camel coat and leopard-print shoes. ''I'm definitely very guilty of going on a blog on Thursday night, finding something new and seeing if I can find the knockoff'' at Zara or Topshop, she said. ''I think, 'Well, it's only $20. I could spend that on an appetizer.' ''
On the wall of the conference room at Shopbop, a collage of fall runway images had been mounted: military, Fair Isle sweaters, blush shades of pink. Yet the Shopbop team, which included Darcy Penick, the divisional merchandise manager, and the apparel buyers Alana Brown and Jane Albiter, had not merely represented the trends; they had also found ways to make them distinctive.
For instance, they asked Rag & Bone to make special camouflage-print trousers for them. As Ms. Brown said, ''We sell these exaggerated harem pants so well, and we showcase them in a way that's wearable for a girl in her 20s. Rag & Bone had this great camo print in their outerwear. We kind of suggested it for the pants.''
The designer Nanette Lapore had shown an olive wool dress with knit ribbing and cargo pockets that had been layered over a camel top. But she didn't get enough orders for the dress and decided not to produce it. The Shopbop buyers asked her to make the $398 dress exclusively for the site. ''It's one of our favorite pieces,'' Ms. Ciepluch said.
Many stores have trouble selling beige or blush tones, said Ms. Penick, a former Saks buyer. ''We tend to sell it better than black,'' she said. ''We've seen a huge response to that shade in blouses.''
Winter shorts? ''We're showing them with thigh-high socks,'' Ms. Ciepluch said. And she isn't down on the mini. ''I think it's going to be around, especially how Proenza did it with the cool schoolgirl look. We also loved DKNY, Alexander Wang.'' She added: ''It's a great dress alternative, especially for work. It kind of looks like you put some thought into it.'' She summed up the fall look as ''a smart mountain town styled with city chic.''
Jane Son, a 26-year-old publicist in New York, has seen things she likes from several labels, including Proenza, Chloe and Reed Krakoff. She just bought a pair of Acne wedge boots. So she is not stuck on a single label. That shift to a wider focus, brought about by women searching Web sites, ought to tell designers a great deal.
''It's actually forcing the designers to be the leaders in fashion again,'' said Ms. Cook of Proenza Schouler. They have to create products that are distinctive, that correlate to a purpose, and that are worth the price being asked, apparently like Proenza's $375 striped T-shirts, which sell out every season.
''The Internet has brought a wealth of information and also boredom,'' Ms. Cook said. ''All those blogs and new ways to dress and shop. For me, it means we have to be much more on our game.''

HEADLINE: Politics, Wrestling And Death

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

 BODY:
When Dave Meltzer heard that Linda E. McMahon, the former chief executive of World Wrestling Entertainment, was running for the Senate from Connecticut, one of his first thoughts was this: How would the news media cover the deaths?
Mr. Meltzer, who has written about professional wrestling since 1971 and edits the Wrestling Observer Newsletter, wasn't thinking of the rare accidents in the ring like the one that killed Owen Hart in 1999 when he fell 78 feet from a harness in Kansas City, Mo.
Instead, he was assuming that during Ms. McMahon's run, relatively young former or current professional wrestlers would continue to die in disproportionate numbers. A few had made news, like the death in 2007 of Chris Benoit, 40, who strangled his wife and son before committing suicide. (Steroids were found in his body, and an autopsy showed severe brain damage, apparently from years of blows to the head.) Most have died in relative obscurity. 
As it turns out, two others have died over the past few months. Edward Fatu, who wrestled as Umaga, died of a heart attack at 36 in December. Chris Klucsarits, known as Chris Kanyon, committed suicide at 40 in April. But when Ms. McMahon found herself at odds with a former wrestler, Chris Nowinski, over the death of Lance McNaught, 29, known as Lance Cade, on Aug. 13, apparently of heart failure, the harshest side of the W.W.E. popped into view.
Ms. McMahon told Connecticut reporters that the company could no more be held accountable for the death of Cade, who left the company in April, ''than a studio could have prevented Heath Ledger's death.'' She added, ''Who knows what causes people to have addictions and do what they do?''
Mr. Nowinski, who left the W.W.E. after a concussion and now serves as an advocate and as a consultant on head injuries, accused her of ''kicking dirt on the guy's grave.'' He said it was ''garbage'' to compare an actor's bad choices to a death in an industry in which rampant steroid and prescription drug abuse has often been viewed as part of the job.
Reporters rarely cover the W.W.E., Mr. Nowinski said, so its excesses have mostly been left unexplored. But the deaths of professional wrestlers, not just in the W.W.E., have received sporadic attention. In 2004, USA Today cited a report from a Dallas medical examiner who calculated that wrestlers had a death rate seven times as high as that of the general population and were 12 times as likely to die of heart disease as other people of the same age. The newspaper's own study showed that professional wrestlers were 20 times as likely as professional football players to die before the age of 45.
''If it happened in baseball, well, it couldn't; people would have stopped it long ago,'' said Mr. Meltzer, whose newsletter says roughly a third of the wrestlers at the organization's SummerSlam in 1990 and 1991 have since died. ''It's like since people think wrestling is fake, they give this a weird mental pass, like they're somehow not real people.''
W.W.E. officials say that five wrestlers have died while under contract since the company was formed, in 1982, and that the company's wellness programs have become models. And fans say the wrestlers' pumped-up physiques of the '90s are no longer mandatory today.
''We are the only entertainment company to ever institute a comprehensive drug, cardio and head-trauma testing program to ensure the safety of its performers,'' said Robert Zimmerman, the company spokesman. He added that prescription drug abuse mixed with alcohol was a likely factor in many of the deaths, W.W.E. veterans' and others'. ''At some juncture, entertainers such as Heath Ledger and former W.W.E. talent need to be held accountable for their own actions, not W.W.E,'' he said.
Ed Patru, a spokesman for Ms. McMahon, said that whatever the culture of wrestling 20 or 30 years ago, the W.W.E. had done more to change it than anyone else. ''I think the public knows it's the media that keep writing about this,'' he said. ''The public is concerned about jobs and the economy.''
You can say the guys made bad choices. You can say it has always been Ms. McMahon's husband, Vince, who was running the show. You could say we're concerned about jobs and the economy. But you could also say that if the W.W.E. accounts for the millions of dollars fueling her race and her feel-good entrepreneurial story, it's not really so irrelevant to want to know more about what kept the circus running and what the costs were to those pumped-up behemoths who kept millions entertained.

HEADLINE: Behind the Florida Primary Surprises, Turnout Tells a Tale

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE

 BODY:
MIAMI -- Beyond the win-loss results of Tuesday's Florida primary -- with Rick Scott seizing the Republican mantle for governor, and Kendrick Meek winning the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate -- there lie more subtle signals of what to look for in November.
Turnout tells one potential story: Republicans, despite a 750,000-voter disadvantage in registration compared to Democrats, brought far more people to the polls. 
In all, 1.25 million Republicans cast ballots in the Republican Governor's race, while fewer than 909,000 Democrats voted in the Democratic Senate primary -- even though both races were heated and close in the final weeks. Marco Rubio alone, in beating two unknown challengers for the Republican nomination to the Senate, collected more votes than all the Democrats on the other side combined, suggesting that the party of Obama -- without Obama on the ticket -- faces an uphill battle when it comes to motivation.
''It's formidable, it's very formidable on the right of the Republican party,'' said Daniel Smith, director of the political campaigning program at the University of Florida.
The Republicans in Florida now have candidates who appeal to an angry, frustrated electorate in a swing state that is still bouncing along the bottom economically. Both Mr. Rubio and Mr. Scott can cast themselves as outsiders; both have focused their campaigns on fiscal issues and jobs; both have name recognition that their opponents crave.
Democrats, on the other hand, face a complicated set of circumstances. Mr. Meek, a congressman from Miami, and Alex Sink, the Democratic nominee for governor, are already a part of government, which in a year of anti-incumbency makes them vulnerable to attack as ''career politicians.''
Their paths to potential victory in November also differ. Mr. Meek is in a competitive three-way race with Mr. Rubio and Gov. Charlie Crist, who abandoned the Republican party in April and who is now hoping to siphon off the votes of moderate Democrats. If the race stays close, the Senate seat could be won with just over one-third of the total vote. But in her two-way race for governor, Ms. Sink needs to appeal to a wider swatch of the electorate.
So when President Barack Obama visited in the final days of the campaign to raise money for the party, Mr. Meek eagerly joined with him, while Ms. Sink publicly ignored the visit and avoided being in any photos that might link her visually with the president.
Steven Schale, a Democratic strategist who managed the Obama campaign two years ago, said Ms. Sink now faces a classic Florida fight, where independents and moderates in the I-4 corridor between Orlando and Tampa are likely to play a deciding role. But while he acknowledges that Democratic turnout was low for the primary, he said that the party's registration advantage was still likely to make up for the increased enthusiasm among Republicans.
''They have to wipe out a 7-point advantage to get to parity,'' he said. ''Even if they wipe out 5 percent, Democrats still have a 2-point advantage. It's still the quintessential Florida model -- it comes down to swing Democrats and independents.''
He said that Democrats had two other reasons for optimism: Mr. Scott's past as the chief executive of a hospital chain that paid large fines for defrauding the federal government will continue to be a major issue, he said, and the once powerful and unified Florida Republican party is now bitterly divided.
Spending scandals have tarnished many Republican leaders in the state, and Rick Scott's surprising victory will inevitably lead to quite a few awkward conversations. He was scathing even in his victory speech on Tuesday -- ''In Tallahassee tonight, the deal makers are crying in their cocktails,'' he said -- while a downtrodden cast of lobbyists, lawmakers and party officials tried to discern how their favored candidate, Bill McCollum, lost despite their money and support.
The results, Mr. Schale said, also include a few hidden surprises. ''Alex Sink got 70,000 more votes than Rick Scott last night,'' he said. ''Scott also lost critical I-4 counties like Hillsborough, Orange and Pinellas counties. These are counties you have to win in a general to win Florida.''
Mr. Smith added that Mr. Meek may also help bring out loyal African-American Democrats, helping Ms. Sink and other Democrats down the ballot.
And yet, Tuesday's surprising results place the most pressing questions mainly on the Republican side of the ledger: Can Mr. Scott and Mr. Rubio sustain the faithful's enthusiasm? Will they move to the center, and will it help?
Mr. Rubio has already begun to veer from the Tea Party outsider script, but Mr. Scott won with overwhelming support from conservatives in North Florida who welcomed his demand for tougher policies against illegal immigrants. His loss in heavily Hispanic Miami-Dade County was so great that it nearly kept Mr. McCollum from conceding defeat, because he thought it might tip the close statewide race in his favor.
The economy will probably be the top issue for voters in November, according to analysts and strategists. But with both parties seeking to increase turnout, could immigration -- one of the first issues Mr. Scott embraced, and one that has tied Mr. Rubio in knots -- be the spark that sets off a race to the polls?

HEADLINE: Bernanke Expected to Sketch New Fed Action on Economy

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With fresh signs that the housing market is weakening, the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, on Friday will offer his outlook on the economy, explain the Fed's recent modest move to halt the slide and possibly outline other actions.
Mr. Bernanke's speech, at an annual Fed symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., will be his first public comments since the Fed announced it would invest proceeds from its holdings of mortgage bonds to buy more long-term Treasury securities to prop up the recovery.
It is not known what Mr. Bernanke will say, but some insight may come from an episode in his past: his concern, soon after he became a Fed governor, that the economy was at risk of deflation as the nation gradually recovered from the dot-com bust a decade ago.
Mr. Bernanke's worry then is similar to what troubles the Fed now, and his views will have no small bearing on the Fed's course of action. These days the Fed confronts the combination of persistently high unemployment and an inflation rate so low that it worries economists. 
Whether policy makers should take big steps to tackle the economic doldrums -- by printing even more money and buying even more assets -- will be the dominant question at the symposium and at the Fed's next meeting on Sept. 21.
Within the central bank, several officials are alarmed at the threat of the economy falling into a dangerous cycle of declining demand, wages and prices not experienced since the Depression. They say that a deflationary, double-dip recession is unlikely, but want to formulate concrete steps to ward it off.
Other officials contend the economic indicators, while dismaying, do not represent an immediate threat, and worry that additional monetary stimulus by the Fed could erode the already shaky confidence of the markets, or even backfire by eventually spurring uncontrolled inflation.
The Fed has not confronted the risk of deflation since 2003. An examination of transcripts from the deliberations of the Fed's policy-making group, the Federal Open Market Committee, during that spring sheds some light on the challenges Mr. Bernanke faces in maintaining a consensus in the committee as it approaches the problem today.
In a confidential briefing before the committee's meeting on May 6, 2003, Fed economists estimated that there was a 35 percent chance that the fragile economy, still recovering from the 2001 recession, would face deflation by the end of 2004.
Mr. Bernanke, who had joined the Fed's board of governors just nine months earlier, warned about the potential danger of deflation, according to the 2003 transcripts, which were made public last year. He said that ''for the first time in many decades'' the Fed faced greater danger from the risk of its inflation estimates being too high, rather than too low.
He wanted the Fed to draft ''a plan for how we might proceed seamlessly from standard rate-cutting to more nonstandard operations should such operations become necessary.''
It would be five more years -- and one boom-and-bust cycle later -- before the Fed would have to apply that advice.
In the meantime, Mr. Bernanke's perspective appeared to influence that of Alan Greenspan, then the Fed chairman.
''In my view we cannot avoid the fact, as Governor Bernanke pointed out, that we face an asymmetry,'' Mr. Greenspan said at the May 2003 meeting. ''We know what to do with inflation when it rises. The committee has taken action to counter it many times and has succeeded in doing so many times. We haven't confronted the problem of potential deflation in a very long time.''
That view was echoed by several other committee members, even among those who pointed out that disinflation, a slowing of the rate of inflation, was not the same as deflation.
Robert T. Parry, then president of the San Francisco Fed, said, ''It's best to move sooner rather than later when the economy is within range of deflation and the zero bound.'' He was referring to the challenge the Fed would face if it had to reduce short-term rates to nearly zero and could no longer cut them any further -- a situation the Fed has faced since 2008.
Others were skeptical. George C. Guynn, then president of the Atlanta Fed, said the situation was not comparable to the Depression. ''We clearly have experienced significant external shocks,'' he said. ''But the real economy is recovering, albeit slowly. It is not contracting.''
To prop up the economy after the dot-com boom's collapse, the Fed lowered its benchmark short-term rate -- the federal funds rate, at which banks lend to each other overnight -- to 1.25 percent in November 2002, from 6.5 percent in January 2001.
On June 25, 2003, it reduced the rate even further, to 1 percent, the lowest level in decades. In the meeting where that decision was reached, Mr. Bernanke wondered ''whether or not it would make sense tactically to say publicly that we are willing to lower the federal funds rate to zero if necessary.'' He said it would help expectations because ''there would no longer be a feeling in the market that we had reached the end of our rope.''
The threat of deflation did not come to pass, and a year later, the Fed began to raise interest rates and tighten monetary policy, a process that would continue until 2006 as housing prices soared across most of the country. Some critics have said the Greenspan Fed helped abet the housing bubble by leaving rates too low for too long, an interpretation Mr. Bernanke has rejected.
Mark W. Olson, who was a Fed governor from 2001 to 2006, said the Fed's worry about deflation in 2003 was appropriate in hindsight. The committee had only two historical episodes to look to -- the Depression of the 1930s and the Japanese deflation that began in the 1990s -- and was determined to avoid either outcome, he said.
''It would have been irresponsible for us not to take it into consideration,'' Mr. Olson said. ''It wasn't much ado about nothing.''
Of the Fed committee members who weighed the threat of inflation in 2003, four are still on the committee today: Mr. Bernanke; Donald L. Kohn, a Fed governor; Thomas M. Hoenig of the Kansas City Fed; and Sandra Pianalto of the Cleveland Fed. There is little doubt that the Fed's last deflation debate has been on their minds as they confront an even more perilous economic outlook today.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 27, 2010

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about the possibility of additional economic actions by the Federal Reserve referred incorrectly in some editions to the Fed's lowering of the federal funds rate following the dot-com collapse. The rate was lowered to 1.25 percent in November 2002, from 6.5 percent in January 2001 -- not January 2003. Because of an editing error, the article also gave an outdated title for Donald L. Kohn in some editions. While he is still a Fed governor, he is no longer the board's vice chairman -- a post he stepped down from in late June.

HEADLINE: American Flight Uses a Firm's Satellite-Based Landing System

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE NEGRONI

 BODY:
Portable global positioning system devices that let travelers know precisely where they are and, more important, direct them to where they want to go, have been around for years. But airline pilots in the United States often must still rely on antiquated ground-based radio and radar equipment to land at airports.
So when American Airlines Flight 1916 followed a satellite-based approach to Bradley International Airport near Hartford on Thursday afternoon, it was a momentous occasion, at least according to the pilot. 
''This is really good stuff,'' Capt. Brian Will told a small group gathered at the terminal to celebrate the flight, which originated in Dallas.
Before departing, Captain Will was so excited about flying the approach, he briefed his passengers on the technology even while doubting they would understand it.
''It's a little bit like trying to explain a painting by saying, 'Close your eyes and picture this,' '' he said.
But Captain Will need not have worried about Caitlin Hardee, a passenger from Seattle. Ms. Hardee understood the technology just fine.
''It seems up until now they've had to route the flights along the ground in the track of physical stations, and now they're using GPS with satellites,'' she explained, while wondering why ''they weren't doing it sooner.''
That gets to the heart of the matter.
Airliners have been able to plan and execute GPS approach routes for about 15 years. Since 2005, the Federal Aviation Administration has authorized satellite-based approaches -- called R.N.P., or required navigation performance -- at more than 100 airports under its plan to modernize United States airspace by 2025.
The fact that the American air traffic infrastructure is so well established is one reason progress is slow.
''We're in transition from ground-based to aircraft-based systems,'' said Steve Fulton, an executive with the aviation navigation company Naverus.
''You have to continue to operate the airspace while you're improving it, while you are upgrading it,'' Mr. Fulton said. ''We don't have the luxury of flipping a switch overnight and all of a sudden we've got a new one.''
But airline officials say progress has been too slow. American, Southwest, Alaska Airlines and others have trained their pilots to fly R.N.P. procedures, and about 80 percent of United States airliners have the equipment to do so, the F.A.A. says. Still, the approaches are in use at only a small fraction of American airports. Their use abroad varies from country to country.
Because R.N.P. landings are so precise, they are considered safer, and because they can cut miles from the approach route, they are more economical, too.
The users ''are demanding these procedures because it saves them money,'' said Dale Wright, director of safety and technology at the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.
Four years ago, Naverus, which has been setting up satellite-based systems for airlines and airports worldwide, offered to create an R.N.P. approach at Bradley Airport and give it to the F.A.A. for use by any airline that wanted it. It was a two-track plan to demonstrate the company's skill at air navigation while navigating a federal bureaucracy in pursuit of more business.
''We would talk to people at the top of the F.A.A., and they were completely 100 percent on board with what we need to do,'' Mr. Fulton said. ''But they had to communicate that to a complex bureaucracy so everyone had the same vision.''
Mr. Fulton's expertise with the technology is undisputed. As a pilot at Alaska Airlines in 1994, he helped create the first R.N.P. routes, then formed Naverus, which GE Aviation bought last year. Airlines and aviation authorities in Australia, China and Canada have used Naverus to install air traffic systems. Mr. Fulton says he hopes to win that kind of business from the F.A.A.
''There's a real skill to designing these procedures and routes, and Naverus is a real subject matter expert by a really good margin,'' said John Gadzinski, an airline pilot and aviation safety consultant.
Whether the Bradley Airport gamble will pay off with an F.A.A. contract to do more approaches is unclear. But after four years of planning, and an evening in the American Airlines simulator practicing the approach the night before the flight, Captain Will could not set the Boeing 737 down on Runway 15 as planned. Tail winds of 20 miles an hour required that he land from a different direction.
He dismissed the last-minute change with a shrug. ''From flying a very scripted GPS high-navigation-accuracy approach to this runway, we turned around and I hand-flew,'' he said. ''There was no magic, no computers, me hand-flying and looking out the window to fly the other way.''
It could have been an allegory for the flip side of technology. ''There's always going to be things like weather,'' Mr. Gadzinski said. ''You get big thunderstorms and you're back to Square 1.''

HEADLINE: The Parent Model

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
During the first half of this year, German and American political leaders engaged in an epic debate. American leaders argued that the economic crisis was so bad, governments should borrow billions to stimulate growth. German leaders argued that a little short-term stimulus was sensible, but anything more was near-sighted. What was needed was not more debt, but measures to balance budgets and restore confidence.
The debate got pointed. American economists accused German policy makers of risking a long depression. The German finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, countered, ''Governments should not become addicted to borrowing as a quick fix to stimulate demand.'' 
The two countries followed different policy paths. According to Gary Becker of the University of Chicago, the Americans borrowed an amount equal to 6 percent of G.D.P. in an attempt to stimulate growth. The Germans spent about 1.5 percent of G.D.P. on their stimulus.
This divergence created a natural experiment. Who was right?
The early returns suggest the Germans were. The American stimulus package was supposed to create a ''summer of recovery,'' according to Obama administration officials. Job growth was supposed to be surging at up to 500,000 a month. Instead, the U.S. economy is scuffling along.
The German economy, on the other hand, is growing at a sizzling (and obviously unsustainable) 9 percent annual rate. Unemployment in Germany has come down to pre-crisis levels.
Results from one quarter do not settle the stimulus/austerity debate. Many other factors are in play. For example, Germany is surging, in part, because America is borrowing. Essentially, we Americans borrowed from our kids, spent some of that money on German machinery, and ended up employing German workers.
But the results do underline one essential truth: Stimulus size is not the key factor in determining how quickly a country emerges from recession. The U.S. tried big, but is emerging slowly. The Germans tried small, and are recovering nicely.
The economy can't be played like a piano -- press a fiscal key here and the right job creation notes come out over there. Instead, economic management is more like parenting. If you instill good values and create a secure climate then, through some mysterious process you will never understand, things will probably end well.
The crucial issue is getting the fundamentals right. The Germans are doing better because during the past decade, they took care of their fundamentals and the Americans didn't.
The situation can be expressed this way: German policy makers inherited a certain consensus-based economic model. That model has advantages. It fosters gradual innovation (of the sort useful in metallurgy). It also has disadvantages. It sometimes leads to rigidity and high unemployment.
Over the past few years, the Germans have built on their advantages. They effectively support basic research and worker training. They have also taken brave measures to minimize their disadvantages. As an editorial from the superb online think tank e21 reminds us, the Germans have recently reduced labor market regulation, increased wage flexibility and taken strong measures to balance budgets.
In the U.S., policy makers inherited a different economic model, one that also has certain advantages. It fosters disruptive innovation (of the sort useful in Silicon Valley). It also has certain disadvantages -- a penchant for over-consumption and short term thinking.
In the past decade, American policy makers have done little to maximize their model's natural advantages or address its problems. Indeed, they've only made the short-term thinking problem worse, with monetary, fiscal and home-ownership policies encouraging even more borrowing and consumption.
Nations rise and fall on the intertwined strength of their cultures and governing institutions. Despite all the normal shortcomings, German governing institutions have functioned reasonably well, ushering in painful but necessary reforms. The U.S. has a phenomenally creative culture, but right now it's an institutional weakling.
If you look around the world today, you see that a two-class system is coming into being. Some countries are undertaking fundamental reforms. In those places, weaknesses have been exposed. Orthodoxies have been shattered. New coalitions have formed.
This is happening in Britain, where a center-right government is reining in a government that had spun out of control. It's also true in Sweden and other consensus-based countries, where there is so much emphasis on consistent, long-range thinking.
In other countries, political division frustrates long-range thinking. The emphasis is on fixing things for next month or next quarter. The U.S., unfortunately, is struggling to get out of Group 2.

HEADLINE: Young Love, Back When It Was Sweet and Innocent

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
Suburban America in the late 1950s and early '60s as depicted in ''Flipped,''Rob Reiner's sentimental ode to puppy love in that innocent era, might as well be another world, for all its resemblance to the one we live in today. Mind you, it isn't paradise. But as the movie's soundtrack of golden oldies unwinds in the background, you can't help being struck by the romantic optimism and modesty of early rock 'n' roll ditties cranked out in the years before the term high-tech entered the vocabulary.
As Mr. Reiner showed in his 1986 film, ''Stand by Me,'' he has a feel for the era. (He was born in 1947.) In ''Flipped,'' adapted from a young-adult novel by Wendelin Van Draanen, with a screenplay by Mr. Reiner and Andrew Scheinman, the period is visualized with an almost surreal fixation on detail and atmosphere. Even the songs are chronologically synced to the six years during which its two main characters, Juli Baker (Madeline Carroll) and Bryce Loski (Callan McAuliffe), proceed from grade school to junior high. 
This wisp of a movie observes the evolving relationship of Juli and Bryce, who live across the street from each other. The two take turns narrating the story in a she-said, he-said format, as they recall the same incidents. Juli, the more willful of the two, remembers the moment she ''flipped'' for Bryce on the day her family moved into the house across the street from his.
''It was something in those dazzling eyes,'' she says. From their very first contact, Bryce shuns her to pursue a policy he calls ''strategic avoidance,'' but Juli makes a beeline for him at every opportunity.
That ''Flipped'' isn't insufferably cute is a measure of its integrity. But it still strains to view the world through the eyes of children without a filter of grown-up cynicism. It is plodding and awkwardly paced. And the dual perspectives aren't different enough to justify showing the same scenes from opposite points of view.
Of the two children, Juli is the spunkier. To prevent a sycamore from being cut down by the local authorities, she climbs to the top of it and refuses to come down. When Bryce remarks about the scruffy condition of the Bakers' front yard, Juli embarks on a landscaping makeover. She raises chickens and sells eggs, and her school science project about hatching chicks wins a prize.
Bryce, by comparison, is a cipher prone to telling little white lies, although Mr. McAuliffe infuses him with enough charm, sincerity and introspection to make him likable.
Neither household comes close to ''Leave It to Beaver'' perfection. The Loskis are a notch above the Bakers on the economic ladder but a notch below in character. Bryce's insecure, disappointed father, Steven (Anthony Edwards), takes an unseemly pleasure in looking down on his neighbors. In a scene fraught with tension, Steven's outgoing wife, Patsy (Rebecca De Mornay), insists on having the Bakers to dinner, and trouble erupts. The movie's moral grounding wire is Patsy's father, Chet (John Mahoney), a twinkling font of grandfatherly wisdom, who befriends Juli.
Juli's parents, Richard (Aidan Quinn) and Trina (Penelope Ann Miller), are short of funds because Richard is paying for the institutionalization of his mentally disabled brother, Daniel (Kevin Weisman).
If the movie's cozy ending leaves you feeling warm and gooey as Juli and Bryce finally achieve detente, it obscures the probability that these puppy lovers are a mismatch. What is the expression? ''Handsome is as handsome does.'' And the dazzling eyes that drew Juli to Bryce don't do much besides sparkle.
''Flipped'' is rated PG (Parental Guidance suggested). It has parental shouting matches that could frighten young children.

PERSON: C. Joseph Genster 

HEADLINE: C. Joseph Genster, 92, Marketer of Metrecal, Is Dead

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
C. Joseph Genster, who masterminded the marketing of Metrecal, the meal in a can for dieters that swept America like the Hula-Hoop at the beginning of the 1960s, died Aug. 17 at his home in Princeton, N.J. He was 92.
His daughter Jane Emily Genster confirmed his death. Decades ago, she, like her five siblings, was a guinea pig for each successive Metrecal invention, including Metrecal milkshakes, Metrecal cookies, Metrecal clam chowder (New England style) and Metrecal tuna and noodles. 
The Metrecal concept was brilliant in its way: by limiting one's daily ingestion of the product to 900 total calories, as recommended, the normal adult was virtually guaranteed to lose weight.
Originally a vanilla-flavored powder that was mixed with water, Metrecal was soon introduced in liquid form and in chocolate and butterscotch flavors. Each can contained about 225 calories and was marketed as nutritional, with gobs of vitamins and minerals. Life magazine said in 1960 that one weight-reduction product had never combined so much.
Hunger pangs usually subsided after a day or two, the company said, and many people agreed. Some attributed this benefit to Metrecal's less than scintillating taste -- be it vanilla, chocolate or the nine or so ''improved'' flavors that came after.
Still, Americans lapped it up. ''No diet fad has ever taken the U.S. so overwhelmingly as the craze for the food supplement Metrecal,'' Time magazine said in 1960.
Such a phenomenon is almost always the brainchild of a team, and so it was with Metrecal. Mead Johnson & Company in Evansville, Ind., had a history of making nutritional products for babies (it created Pablum), and it was a natural progression to make a supplement for invalids. That worked so well that somebody made another mental leap, suggesting a product for weight reduction.
Mr. Genster was group director for nutritional specialties, but neither he nor anyone else could remember who exactly had the original idea. In his book ''The Overweight Society'' (1965), Peter Wyden quoted Mr. Genster as saying, ''It would be a damned lie to say we knew what we had.''
An I.B.M. syllable-scrambling machine came up with the name Metrecal, alluding to metered or measured calories.
Metrecal was not the first weight-loss product, but its distinction was that it added proportionately more protein than its predecessors. The first shipments left Evansville in September 1959, and sales took off.
''The American consumer made clear that Joe Genster and his teammates had won a hallowed place in the hearts of their countrymen,'' Mr. Wyden wrote.
Metrecal became popular in the White House mess and at drugstore lunch counters. The University of Alabama used it to trim down the large young men it recruited to play football. The king of Greece and a prince of Saudi Arabia placed orders.
When Bergdorf Goodman advertised an elegant little purse flask for the socialite in need of the occasional holiday nip, it pointed out that it ''could be the solution for every secret Metrecal drinker.''
Betty Friedan, in her book ''The Feminine Mystique,'' said women were so desperate to conform to impossible ideals that they ''ate a chalk called Metrecal.''
Within a year of its rollout, Metrecal was available as a liquid in a can as well as in powder form. Mr. Genster successfully pushed Mead to venture beyond pharmacies into supermarkets and employ direct-mail advertising to reach consumers. When imitators cut prices, he lowered the price of Metrecal -- a controversial move for a dominant brand.
Mr. Genster became president of a new division, the Edward Dalton Company, devoted exclusively to Metrecal. He changed the advertising pitch to ''figure enhancement'' from ''weight control'' and won several advertising industry awards. He made strenuous efforts to improve the taste of Metrecal -- Time had called it ''vile'' -- adding flavors in the hope that they might do the trick.
''What happened is that Metrecal moved out of the medicine cabinet toward the kitchen, the patio, the pool,'' Forbes magazine reported.
Charles Joseph Genster was born Sept. 5, 1917, in Sheffield, Ill., where his parents owned a dry-goods store. He graduated from high school at 16, worked a year on a farm, then went to the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana, where he majored in economics.
He interrupted his studies to join the Army in 1940 as a second lieutenant. In World War II, he fought in North Africa, Sicily and Italy, won a Silver Star for bravery and emerged a captain. He finished at Illinois, then graduated with high distinction from Harvard Business School. He was recalled to serve in the Army during the Korean War and worked for companies in Cleveland and Chicago before joining Mead in 1957.
Mr. Genster's wife of 64 years, the former Barbara Anna Burke, died in 2006. Their son David died in 1964.
In addition to his daughter Jane, Mr. Genster is survived by his daughters Margaret Mary Genster, Julia Ann Genster and Sara Genster Robling; his son, Joseph; his brother, John; and 10 grandchildren.
Sales of Metrecal began to slip in the mid-1960s as competition from other crash-diet products intensified. In response, Mr. Genster added products, including soups, cookies and solid foods. That helped, but the slide continued, and despite periodic efforts to revive the Metrecal brand, Slim-Fast became the industry giant. ''Even reasonably steadfast diners simply grew tired'' of Metrecal, Mr. Wyden wrote. ''The monotony was deadening.''
For the most dedicated consumer, however, Metrecal seemed to work. When Mr. Genster himself was using the product religiously, his weight dropped to 180 pounds. When he relaxed the regimen, it bounced back to 200.

HEADLINE: Already Under Fire, Lawyers for 9/11 Workers Are Ordered to Justify Some Fees

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
The lawyers representing most of the ground zero workers who sued the city over health issues will be appearing in court in a new role: defending themselves.
The federal judge overseeing the cases has summoned the law partnership of two firms, Worby Groner Edelman and Napoli Bern Ripka, to a hearing on Friday to justify $6.1 million in legal expenses that they are charging their clients.
Next week, the lawyers are due back in federal court to respond to accusations of overcharging made by the other leading law firm representing workers. That firm, Sullivan Papain Block McGrath & Cannavo, alleges that its co-counsel is trying to inflate its fees by inappropriately charging clients more than $400,000 for publicists, lobbyists and legal and medical experts as case-related costs.
The Napoli firm, as the partnership is called in court papers, which represents about 9,400 of the more than 10,000 plaintiffs, already faced criticism from clients for a settlement that many plaintiffs said did not give them enough money and compensated less for some illnesses like cancer. 
Several dozen workers have also discovered that they were taken on as clients even though they were never eligible for the settlement because they had taken money from a federal victims compensation fund that prohibited pursuing lawsuits.
''It seems like everyone is profiting off of the sick 9/11 workers except the sick who need it,'' said Ernest Vallebuona, 45, a retired New York police detective whose settlement offer of $313,200 to $382,000 for lymphoma would be reduced by $12,750 for legal expenses and by tens of thousands more for a 25 percent contingency fee for the lawyers.
''We want this to be over, but we want a fair settlement,'' Mr. Vallebuona said.
Maneuvering over who pays for what is common at the end of protracted litigation, but in the case of the rescue and recovery workers it comes in the emotionally charged atmosphere in which plaintiffs are still deciding whether to accept the settlement.
It offers them as a group $625 million to $712.5 million, depending on how many plaintiffs beyond the 95 percent required to approve it accept the proposal. Over all, lawyers in the case stand to receive 25 percent of the final settlement after expenses.
On Wednesday, the city's insurer, the WTC Captive Insurance Company, cited the pending court hearings, which could result in adjustments to individual settlement amounts, as one reason for extending by two months, to Nov. 8, the deadline for plaintiffs to make their decisions.
Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein of the United States District Court in Manhattan, who is overseeing the litigation, has ordered the lawyers to justify a category of expenses labeled ''interest on funds borrowed by law firm'' that amounts to $6.1 million. The expense comes from loans at interest rates of 14 to 18 percent that the lawyers say they took out to help finance more than $30 million in expenses over seven years of litigation.
Paul J. Napoli, one of the lead plaintiffs' lawyers, argued in court papers filed this week that it was common and appropriate to charge loan interest to clients and that ''no unethical conduct by the law firm has occurred in connection with these expenses.''
But while legal experts say borrowing is relatively common in mass tort cases like this, there is some criticism of the practice because it may add to the economic pressures on lawyers to settle cases.
''At best, this is ethically dubious and raises a lot of questions about the law firm's ability to handle this case,'' said Stephen French, managing partner of Legalbill, a consulting firm based in Nashville that helps corporate legal departments and others analyze and track their legal costs. ''If the law firm can't carry the upfront costs, then they need not to agree to a contingency fee.''
The interest charges also figure in the dispute between the Napoli firm and lawyers from Sullivan Papain, who represent 689 clients, most of them firefighters. Sullivan Papain argues that the expenses should not be passed on to clients because the retainer agreements did not ask them to accept such charges.
In court papers filed this week, Sullivan Papain also questioned other expenses being charged to clients by the Napoli firm, including $220,000 for medical and legal experts, $93,000 for public relations and $35,000 for lobbying in Washington for the health care bill for those with 9/11-related injuries.
The experts hired by the Napoli firm include Steven Wilkins, a doctor whose license was revoked for ''gross negligence'' in 2000 and who is identified on the firm's Web site as a consulting attorney. He received $13,000.
In an interview, Mr. Napoli said that his firm bore a very large share of expenses given its number of clients and that Sullivan Papain ''could sit back and ride our coattails.'' He said his firm therefore intended to lay claim to half of Sullivan Papain's attorneys' fees in the cases.
Mr. Napoli said the high profile of the litigation demanded significant spending for news conferences, lobbying and other needs to keep up with the lawyers defending the city and its contractors. Those lawyers, who are paid from the federally financed $1.1 billion Captive Insurance fund, had incurred about $210 million in legal fees and expenses, officials with the insurance company said.
The squabbling over money by the lawyers is infuriating already angry clients.
''What started out as an intention to help the Sept. 11 community has now become a feeding frenzy with the lawyers,'' said Kenny Specht, a plaintiff who leads a firefighters group.
Mr. Specht said he had already rejected his settlement offer of $127,000 to $158,000 before legal fees and expenses are taken out as ''less than what I would have made in one year as a New York City firefighter.''
About 60 workers who sued despite having taken money from the federal September 11th Victim Compensation Fund before it closed in 2003 are coming out empty-handed from the settlement. Some of the plaintiffs say they feel misled and used by the Napoli lawyers to increase their client numbers. But Mr. Napoli said his firm took the cases in the belief that the workers were eligible because the lawsuits involved injuries that developed later and had not been compensated.
He said he was now advising the clients to opt out of the settlement and continue to pursue their cases.
''I can't for the life of me understand why would we have been only told at the 11th hour that we in fact would be disqualified from this settlement,'' said Vincent Forras, a volunteer firefighter who came to ground zero from Westchester County and is now among the ineligible plaintiffs. ''I feel very let down.''

HEADLINE: Struggling Cities Shut Firehouses in Budget Crisis

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
SAN DIEGO -- Fire departments around the nation are cutting jobs, closing firehouses and increasingly resorting to ''rolling brownouts'' in which they shut different fire companies on different days as the economic downturn forces many cities and towns to make deep cuts that are slowing their responses to fires and other emergencies.
Philadelphia began rolling brownouts this month, joining cities from Baltimore to Sacramento that now shut some units every day. San Jose, Calif., laid off 49 firefighters last month. And Lawrence, Mass., north of Boston, has laid off firefighters and shut down half of its six firehouses, forcing the city to rely on help from neighboring departments each time a fire goes to a second alarm.
Fire chiefs and union officials alike say it is the first time they have seen such deep cuts in so many parts of the country. ''I've never seen it so widespread,'' said Harold A. Schaitberger, the general president of the International Association of Fire Fighters. 
The risks of cutting fire service were driven home here last month when Bentley Do, a 2-year-old boy who was visiting relatives, somehow got his hands on a gum ball, put it in his mouth, started laughing and then began choking.
''It blocked the air hole,'' said his uncle, Brian Do, who called 911 while other relatives frantically tried to dislodge the gum ball. ''No air could flow in and out.''
It is only 600 steps from the front door of the neatly kept stucco home where the boy was staying to the nearest fire station, just down the block. But the station was empty that evening: its engine was in another part of town, on a call in an area usually covered by an engine that had been taken out of service as part of a brownout plan.
The police came to the home within five minutes and began performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation, officials said. But it took nine and a half minutes -- almost twice the national goal of arriving within five minutes -- for the fire engine, with a paramedic and more medical equipment, to get there. An ambulance came moments later and took Bentley to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
The San Diego Fire-Rescue chief, Javier Mainar, said it was impossible to say whether the delay contributed to Bentley's death on July 20. But he said there was no doubt that the city's brownouts, which take 13 percent of firefighters off the streets each day to save $11.5 million annually, led to the delay.
''You can just lock everything down and look at it sequentially, chronologically, as to what occurred,'' Chief Mainar said in an interview. ''There is no question that the brownout of Engine 44 resulted in Engine 38 having to take a response in that community, and because of that, Engine 38 was now out of position to respond to something that happened just down the street from their fire station.''
Fire service was once a sacred cow at budget time. But the downturn has lingered so long that many cities, which have already made deep cuts in other agencies, are now turning to their fire departments.
Some are trying to wrest concessions from unions, which over the years have won generous pension plans that allow many firefighters to retire in their 40s and 50s -- plans that many cities say are unaffordable. Others want to reduce minimum-staffing requirements, which often force them to resort to costly overtime to fill shifts. Others are simply cutting service.
Analysts worry that some of the cuts could be putting people and property in danger. As the downturn has worn on, ISO, an organization that evaluates cities' fire protection capabilities for the insurance industry, has downgraded more cities, said Michael R. Waters, ISO's vice president of risk-detection services.
''This is generally due to a reduction in firefighting personnel available for responding to calls, a reduction in the number of responding fire apparatus, and gaps in the optimal deployment of apparatus or deficiencies in firefighter training programs,'' Mr. Waters said in a statement.
Several fire chiefs said in interviews that the cuts were making them nervous.
''It's roulette,'' said Chief James S. Clack of the Baltimore City Fire Department, which recently reduced the number of fire units closed each day to three from six. Officials saw that the closings in the 55-unit department were in some cases leading to longer response times. ''I'm always worried that something's going to happen where one of these companies is closed.''
Early in his mayoralty, Michael R. Bloomberg of New York closed six fire companies to save money. This year, a threat to close 20 more -- a 6 percent reduction in New York's fire companies -- was averted when the city found savings elsewhere.
Several cities -- including Lawrence -- have said that they were forced to cut service because the unions failed to make concessions. Mr. Schaitberger, the union president, who was here for a union convention, said that protecting the pensions his members have won over the years was a top priority this year.
The pension issue has an added resonance in San Diego. The city was forced to consider a bankruptcy filing even before the Great Recession, and was barred from raising money by selling bonds to the public after officials disclosed that they had shortchanged the pension fund for city workers for years, even as they improved pension benefits. San Diego's pension fund has only two-thirds of the money it needs to pay the benefits promised to retirees, according to an updated calculation made by the city in the spring, and faces a shortfall of $2.1 billion.
So even before the recession and the brownouts, fire service in San Diego was stretched thin. A previous San Diego fire chief, Jeff Bowman, was hired in 2002 with a mandate to build up the department, but he resigned in 2006, after the pension-fueled fiscal crisis surfaced and it became clear that he would not get the money to build and staff the extra fire stations he believed were needed. ''The question is whether fire protection is adequate, and in my opinion it's not,'' he said in an interview.
After Bentley Do died, the City Council agreed to put a question on the ballot in November asking voters to approve a sales tax increase, which could be put in place only if the city adopts certain budget and pension reforms. The money could restore the fire service and help close a deep budget gap projected for next year.
But it would come too late for the Do family. Bentley, whose father, Nam Do, an American, was working in Vietnam as an architect, was just visiting San Diego with his mother, Mien Nguyen. Ms. Nguyen, who was six months pregnant, was here to take the oath of United States citizenship. She was sworn in the day after Bentley died, Brian Do, the uncle, said, but she fainted when she got her certificate and was taken to the hospital. Nam Do left his job in Vietnam to come here to grieve for his son, and goes to a temple every day, Brian Do said.
He said that the family had no plans to sue the city. ''We're not blaming the city or blaming the Fire Department,'' he said, ''but the reason I speak out is because I want them to do a better job for other people.''

HEADLINE: Taking a Long, Cool Look At Both Sides of the Law

BYLINE: By A. O. SCOTT

 BODY:
If there were such a thing as GQ Jr. or Esquire for Kids -- a young-dude analogue for magazines like Seventeen or Teen Vogue -- it might be something like ''Takers,'' a primer in juvenile, aspirational cool for guys who might not be able to handle the suavity of the ''Oceans 11'' franchise or the leathery angst of ''The Expendables.''
Not that everyone involved in the movie is young, by any means. Matt Dillon, once among the prettiest faces in Hollywood, has long since grown into a lean, haggard maturity, and could play a weary, stressed-out Los Angeles detective in his sleep. He gives ''Takers'' a measure of gravity, just as Idris Elba, playing Mr. Dillon's smooth-but-beleaguered bad-guy counterpart -- the De Niro to his Pacino, to the extent that comparisons to ''Heat'' are warranted -- gives it a shot of low-key, no-nonsense professionalism. 
As for the rest, there is plenty of nonsense, a great deal of stylish posturing and clothes-horsing, and a few action sequences that manage to be both gripping and preposterous. The story is a basic heist plot, with a few complications thrown in for texture and filigree. A group of well-dressed, ruthless and highly polished robbers knocks over a bank. Led by Gordon Cozier (Mr. Elba), they favor fine clothes and watches, single-malt Scotch and a luxury lifestyle that blends fashion-magazine gloss with hip-hop bravado.
None of them is especially interesting. Or rather, the actors have more cachet than the guys they are playing. The almost talented Chris Brown and the brooding Michael Ealy play black brothers, while Paul Walker is the white man with the furrowed brow, and Hayden Christensen is the other white guy, who wears a silly skinny-brimmed hat and an annoying smirk. They seem to enjoy their work, which is more than can be said for Detective Jack Welles (Mr. Dillon) and his partner, Eddie Hatcher (Jay Hernandez), who manfully shoulder the burden of cop-movie cliches. Welles has a young daughter who he loves desperately but neglects in favor of this job (which also obviously destroyed his marriage), while Hatcher is a family man with a sick child and growing economic worries.
The cops and robbers are set on a collision course when Ghost (Tip Harris, better known to rap fans as T.I.) a former member of Cozier's crew, is released from prison and cajoles his erstwhile confederates into one more big job. They trust him even though he seems smarter and more ruthless than any of them -- Mr. Harris, with his slow, Southern speech patterns and his menacing, reptilian charisma, dominates every scene he is in -- and even though Ghost is clearly jealous that one of his colleagues has taken up with his former girlfriend, Lily (Zoe Saldana, reduced to slinky decoration). Meanwhile Cozier has a sister (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) just out of rehab, Welles has some trouble with internal affairs, and the clock is ticking toward a big showdown.
''Takers,'' directed in what has become the usual fast-cutting, run-and-gun style by John Luessenhop (who is also one of four credited screenwriters), was conceived and executed with just enough skill and flair to make you wish it were better. It views both sides of the law with a detached curiosity and a measure of respect, which gives it some of the amoral, analytical feel of a Hong Kong policier. (The slow-motion shoot-outs and tilted frames also give a nod to the violent pre-Hollywood prime of the Hong Kong maestro John Woo).
For its first hour or so this picture even displays some restraint, keeping the body count low and showing some deference to physical laws and sociological realities. But then a familiar anxiety seems to take over, as if the filmmakers suddenly became aware of the danger of making things too subtle and psychologically complex. And so a potentially above-average crime thriller (along the lines of Spike Lee's ''Inside Man'' or Tony Scott's underrated remake of ''The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3'') reverts to the mean, with a clattering climax of double-crosses, endless gunfire and chases that go on too long. ''Takers'' is kind of cool, but not nearly as cool as it wants to be or thinks it is.
''Takers'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Surprisingly little swearing, sex or blood.

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims Fall First Time In a Month

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- New requests for unemployment benefits fell sharply last week, the first decline in a month and a hopeful sign for the economy after a spate of negative reports. 
New claims for unemployment benefits dropped by 31,000 to a seasonally adjusted 473,000, the Labor Department said Thursday. Still, claims remain higher than they would be in a healthy economy.
Employers are reluctant to hire as economic growth appears to be slowing.
The decline occurred after a steep rise in the previous three weeks that sent claims to their highest level in nine months. Those increases raised fears that businesses were starting to lay off more workers.
Even with last week's decline, the four-week average, a less volatile measure, rose to 486,750, the greatest amount since November 2009.
The unemployment benefits report is ''mildly encouraging'' but should be treated with caution, said Douglas Porter, an economist at BMO Capital Markets, because the weekly claims report is volatile.
The Labor Department, meanwhile, also said the total unemployment benefit rolls climbed steeply, as more people joined extended unemployment benefit programs that were renewed last month by Congress.
During the recession, Congress added up to 73 weeks of emergency jobless aid in addition to the 26 weeks typically provided by the states.
All told, about 10.1 million people were receiving unemployment checks in the week that ended Aug. 7, the latest figures available. That number is up about 260,000 from the previous week.
The extended program lapsed in June, throwing nearly two million people off the rolls. But since Congress renewed the program, the total benefit rolls have increased by 2.2 million, according to Dan Greenhaus, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak.
That suggests ''that there is little if any meaningful hiring throughout the economy,'' Mr. Greenhaus wrote in a note to clients.

HEADLINE: Islamic Center Also Challenges A Young Builder

BYLINE: By ANNE BARNARD and CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY; Nicholas Confessore and Jack Begg contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Sharif el-Gamal is a relative newcomer to the New York City real estate business. He got his broker's license in 2002. He is developing two condominium projects: turning a building in TriBeCa into six lofts, and planning apartments on what is now a West Side parking lot. He comes from the well-off family of a bank executive, but not from real estate billions.
With a career marked by drive and ambition but still in its early stages, Mr. Gamal, 37, has taken on a colossal challenge. He is the developer planning a Muslim community center on property he owns near ground zero -- a $100 million project, he estimates, at the center of the most contentious national debate over Islam, America and freedom of religion in the nine years since 9/11.
It is the kind of project -- a 15-story building, open to all, with a theater, educational programs, a swimming pool, a restaurant, a mosque and a 9/11 memorial -- that people with experience in Manhattan development say needs years of groundwork, even without controversy. 
But although he has cleared the legal hurdles and won approval from the local community board, Mr. Gamal has yet to secure financing, hire an architect, incorporate the nonprofit entity that will run the center, start its fund-raising, recruit its board members, or present formal feasibility studies and business plans to community meetings.
Putting aside sweeping debates over the project's propriety and meaning, many ask a simpler question: Can Mr. Gamal pull it off?
''I have always marveled at the romantic notion that the average New Yorker has toward development,'' said Josh Guberman, who in developing 28 properties in the city has dealt with financing, plumbing, transportation, unions and more. ''To be frank, successful development in New York City is not an arena for the novice or inexperienced player.''
Building anything anywhere in recession-era New York is tough; Lower Manhattan is tougher; Mr. Gamal's project, called Park51, is still more complex.
Mr. Gamal hopes to raise $70 million through tax-exempt bonds, which religiously affiliated nonprofit groups can obtain -- but only if they prove that the facilities will benefit the general public, with religious functions separately financed.
He wants to recruit a board of business and civic leaders -- Christians, Jews and Muslims -- to raise an additional $30 million to $40 million for the nonprofit's stake in the building. Russell Simmons, the hip-hop mogul, has signed on. But controversy complicates recruiting, and donations will be squeezed by the economy and scrutinized by opponents who wonder if money will come from radical Islamist groups or hostile governments.
Mr. Gamal has told supporters that he will take no money linked to ''un-American'' values and that donations will be vetted by federal and state authorities and separate boards for the center and the mosque.
Comparable projects like the Jewish Community Center of Manhattan, on the Upper West Side -- Mr. Gamal is a member; his daughters learned to swim there -- have planned their programming before financing the construction, to show they will have revenue from, say, gym memberships or day care. But Mr. Gamal's plans are just beginning, and must focus enough on Muslim needs to attract national Muslim support while stressing multifaith outreach to win other donors.
The downtown market is especially tricky, said Julie Menin, chairwoman of the local community board, with commuters during the day and residents at night. Then, too, some New York Muslims feel that $100 million would be better spent on facilities in more heavily Muslim neighborhoods, Aisha al-Adawiya, of the Harlem group Women in Islam, said.
Debby Hirshman, who was the founding executive director of the J.C.C. and is a consultant on a community center to open next year in Battery Park City, said those projects spent 5 to 10 years on community meetings. Ms. Hirshman added, however, that organizations ''start in all different ways.''
Mr. Gamal, a stocky man with a faint New York accent and the brash speech of a fraternity brother or a bond trader, says he can do it.
''We are very confident that we will be able to arrange the right mix of borrowing and private investment,'' he said in a statement, noting that he has the support of city officials and others involved in downtown redevelopment. ''Several financial institutions have expressed interest'' in financing the project, he said.
In recent days, Mr. Gamal has reasserted control over the project's image, stressing that he, not the imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, is in charge, and hiring a new public relations adviser, Lawrence Kopp.
That places new focus on Mr. Gamal. His father, an Egyptian, was a managing director at Chemical Bank. His parents divorced; he lived in Brooklyn until age 9, when his mother, a Polish Catholic, died. He then followed his father to Liberia and to Egypt, where he attended the Schutz American School.
Mr. Gamal returned to the United States for college, studying architecture and economics before dropping out. He was not raised in a religious household, but Islam helped Mr. Gamal out of a troubled youth, Mr. Kopp said. A younger brother, Sammy, is a partner in his company, SoHo Properties; a sister is a Lebanon analyst for the Pentagon.
After a stint waiting tables, Mr. Gamal entered the close-knit New York real estate world, where he is better known as a broker than as a developer. He began buying buildings three years ago.
Mr. Gamal has traveled to the Middle East, as have many New York developers. Gulf oil money is one of their few financing sources in the current market. But Mr. Gamal says his only current investors are from the United States and Israel.
As a broker, Mr. Gamal reliably delivers deals, said Michael Betancourt, an investor whom Mr. Gamal helped buy and rent out two SoHo buildings. ''The kid keeps his head down, and he's a grinder,'' Mr. Betancourt said.
As an owner and developer, though, he is just getting started, by New York standards. Public filings show Mr. Gamal bought, starting in 2007, a half-dozen apartment buildings in Harlem and Washington Heights for $1.075 million to $2.8 million. Two have outstanding building violations and owe the city money. He also manages properties in Chelsea and Harlem. He bought his first major office building, 31 West 27th Street, in 2009, for $45.7 million.
Brokers said Mr. Gamal bid on other properties without success. One real estate executive involved in a purchase with Mr. Gamal said he took weeks to get financial documents that buyers typically assemble within hours.
Daniel Parker, who interned on commission at SoHo Properties in 2006, left for a firm that offered a steadier paycheck. But he was impressed with Mr. Gamal's religious tolerance. Mr. Parker, who is Mormon, said the two talked about their religions and abstinence from drinking. He admired how Mr. Gamal and his brother left work to pray every Friday.
Mr. Gamal attended two Lower Manhattan mosques that were overflowing, and decided to build a mosque and community center, a Muslim version of the J.C.C. In July 2009, Mr. Gamal paid $4.85 million, a bargain price, for the property on Park Place, two blocks from ground zero.
''You could tell,'' Mr. Parker said, ''he was going to figure out a way to do something big.''

HEADLINE: Heart of Iowa As Fault Line Of Egg Recall

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY; William Neuman contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
CLARION, Iowa -- The scrambled eggs, as always, were hissing in a skillet on a recent morning at a coffee shop here, in an egg-producing county that has suddenly found itself at the center of the nation's egg recall over salmonella. But the conversation at the weekly gathering of local ladies turned uncharacteristically tense.
One woman suggested that the company at the focus of the recall of hundreds of millions of eggs, with huge facilities here, had done more harm than good locally. A second resident jumped in to defend the operation and the DeCoster family, which runs it, sternly announcing that any troubles ought not be discussed aloud.
Federal authorities announced Thursday that they had found samples of salmonella matching the strain of the recent outbreak in the feed and barns of Wright County Egg, the DeCosters' operation. 
The authorities said nearly 1,500 illnesses since May might be tied to tainted eggs, making this the largest outbreak associated with this type of bacteria, Salmonella enteritidis, since the federal government began closely tracking foodborne disease in 1973.
The intense scrutiny that the DeCosters and another producer, Hillandale Farms, have come under has reopened a fault line in central Iowa, with its endless fields of corn and soybeans and row after row of identical low-slung buildings full of egg-laying hens: on one side, those who detest enormous industrial-size farms and say the risk of a widespread salmonella outbreak is one more reason to fear them; on the other, those who see such farming as the economic savior of these wide open spaces.
The DeCosters produce 2.3 million dozen eggs a week in Iowa. Over the years, many here have objected to the growing operations of Austin J. DeCoster. Neighbors sued the DeCosters' farms for what they said were noxious gases, millions of gallons of uncovered manure and putrid animal carcasses left on roadways.
The Iowa Department of Natural Resources declared Mr. DeCoster a ''habitual violator,'' making his the only operation ever to be deemed such in Iowa, for its handling of hog waste. And Mr. DeCoster paid more than $1.5 million as part of a settlement with 11 female workers, most of them Mexican, at his egg facilities over sexual harassment and assault charges, including rapes by supervisors.
But this is also a place where the DeCosters' operations have, in two decades, become braided into life. An annual ''Appreciation Supper'' by the DeCosters at the local park means free food for everyone. A local restaurant owner said he was paid to provide tacos and quesadillas for workers at the facilities. Local farmers said they were ensured a decent price for corn that went to feed the DeCosters' poultry. And the DeCosters, defenders here say, have given money for the local hospital, the library fund, the concession stand at the football stadium, and on and on.
''It's all hush-hush now -- like everybody's supposed to be positive because they got stuff,'' said Bill Drury, a farmer, who groaned that even his local banker kept an egg figurine on his desk, a gift from the DeCosters. ''I get blacklisted all over the place for saying it, but DeCoster goes to the lowest degree of compliance for everything. That's the problem. He's a bad actor.''
Mr. DeCoster, who is known as Jack and is in his 70s, and his son, Peter, who many here say now largely oversees the Iowa operation, declined through a spokeswoman to be interviewed for this article. The spokeswoman, Hinda Mitchell, also declined to answer questions about earlier environmental and labor complaints against the DeCoster operation or about the DeCosters themselves. Of this Iowa region's relations with the DeCosters, Ms. Mitchell said, ''The farms have been longtime, active members of our local community.''
The precise cause of the salmonella infections has not been pinpointed, but Thursday's revelations by federal authorities suggested they were moving closer.
Sherri McGarry, a Food and Drug Administration official, said salmonella was found in feed given to young birds, known as pullets, that were raised by a DeCoster facility for use at both its own farms and at Hillandale Farms. The bacteria was also found in bone meal, an ingredient used by the DeCoster operation to make its feed. In a statement, Wright County Egg suggested the contaminated ingredients could have come from a supplier.
The DeCosters have five large egg-laying facilities and eight sites for pullets.
Federal officials said the discovery was significant but that it did not mean that the contamination of the eggs -- which occurs when they form inside infected hens -- began with bad feed. Instead the salmonella could have been spread to the feed by rodents, workers or in other ways.
Mr. DeCoster came here from Turner, Me., a tiny town where he began with a paltry 125 hens and built an empire -- crossing some people along the way. Robert B. Reich, then the labor secretary, once publicly denounced the DeCoster Egg Farms in Maine as an ''agricultural sweatshop'' where the workers were treated like ''animals.''
But Larry Olson, who was a Wright County, Iowa, supervisor for 32 years, said he believed that the DeCosters had improved their practices in recent years. State environmental officials noted that Mr. DeCoster's ''habitual violator'' status had expired, and that the Department of Natural Resources had not cited it for serious infractions in years.
''When Jack came, he wasn't a good neighbor, but that's changed,'' said Mr. Olson, who added that he had ''caught a lot of hell'' as a supervisor when he first pressed to allow the farming business in about two decades ago. ''He's brought jobs and increased the tax base, and if you look, where other counties have been hurting, we haven't as much,'' Mr. Olson said.
Change here has been jarring for some. While farmers here could still recall the small egg operations of their parents and grandparents (a henhouse with 500 chickens once seemed like a lot), Iowa's large-scale egg production was booming. The state is the largest egg producer now, by far. Fifteen billion eggs are expected to come from Iowa this year from 60 million hens.
''People see this as economic development, but look at the social implications of this, look at the environment,'' said Jim Yungclas, who is 75 and a Wright County farmer. As he drove past two enormous egg facilities still under construction amid farm fields, he shook his head. ''They're building these things on top of someone's garden,'' he said. ''They could build these things somewhere where the land isn't so valuable.''
Drive down the roads here, and Wright County Egg facilities pop up out of nowhere -- long, squat celery-colored buildings in perfect rows. Inside, workers said, cages of chickens are stacked high and eggs plop forth onto a conveyor belt, which leads to a production building, where the eggs are washed, sanitized, surveyed, then fed into cartons.
Watching news of the egg recall on Spanish-language television inside the Mexican restaurant here, workers refused to discuss their jobs -- fearful, they said, that they might be fired. One former worker defended the facilities, which over the years have been the target of several raids by immigration officials. He said they were clean, safe and included devices meant to ward off rodents. ''People don't even touch the eggs,'' he said, before insisting that he, too, not be identified. ''You have to understand, this is a small town.''

HEADLINE: Dean From Northwestern Picked to Lead New School

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
The trustees of the New School, an eclectic university in downtown Manhattan, selected David E. Van Zandt, dean of the Northwestern Law School, on Thursday to be its eighth president.
Dr. Van Zandt, 57, will replace Bob Kerrey, a former Nebraska senator and presidential candidate, whose nine-year tenure was characterized by a huge expansion of the university, but also by student sit-ins and criticism from the faculty over what his detractors said was an autocratic leadership style.
Mr. Kerrey, who will be 67 on Friday, announced in May 2009 that he would step down when his contract expired in July 2011. He will instead stay on through the end of December 2010. 
The contrasts between the two leaders are immediately apparent. Dr. Van Zandt is an academic, not a politician, and has a reputation for driving change through low-key, data-driven discussion and consensus. Mr. Kerrey is the first to admit he loves controversy and welcomes passionate debate.
Dr. Van Zandt will be charged with further integrating the disparate pieces of the New School, which has eight academic divisions, including the well-known Parsons the New School for Design and the less-known Eugene Lang College the New School for Liberal Arts. (Among the things Mr. Kerrey was criticized for were those awkward names, part of a branding effort in 2005 that aimed to improve cohesion. Indeed, Dr. Van Zandt said that when he was contacted about the job, he did not know Parsons was part of the New School.)
Mr. Kerrey centralized much of the university's administrative and operational functions, but said there was still work to be done to integrate the academic divisions. ''It is no longer is a confederation, though there are people who think it should be,'' Mr. Kerrey said Thursday.
Michael J. Johnston, the chairman of the board of trustees, said the search committee and board were attracted to Dr. Van Zandt's record of change at Northwestern. ''He stood out as a person of balance -- not only an academic and someone who loves order and process, and not only a teacher with a passion for learning, but someone who spent 15 years as a really good agent of change at Northwestern.'' Mr. Johnston said.
He said the search committee was originally concerned that Dr. Van Zandt's leadership experience -- at a law school -- was too narrow, but as the interviews progressed, it was clear he had the breadth they sought.
''He's very thoughtful and knowledgeable about higher education,'' said Laura Frost, an associate professor of literary studies at the New School, who was on the search committee. ''He's institutionally creative in terms of what he's done, but he's realistic and careful about changes he makes.''
Dr. Van Zandt has a wide-ranging background. He holds a Ph.D. in sociology from the London School of Economics and wrote a book on the Children of God, a religious cult in England he lived with for three months while doing research on the group.
''I learned that despite the oddest beliefs, people have a lot in common,'' Dr. Van Zandt said Thursday of the experience.
Dr. Van Zandt graduated from Princeton and attended Yale Law School, where he was editor of the law review. He clerked with a Supreme Court justice, Harry A. Blackmun, before working as an associate at Davis Polk & Wardwell in New York. He then joined the faculty at Northwestern and in 1995 became dean of its law school.
He said that during his tenure there, he looked at trends in the market for law students and sought to change certain admissions and curriculum policies to respond to those changes.
In admissions, Dr. Van Zandt initiated a requirement that the majority of applicants be interviewed. ''Not a lot of schools do that, which is kind of shocking,'' he said, adding that he wanted to make sure candidates had good people skills and could communicate effectively. He placed more emphasis on the LSAT, and required that incoming students have more experience.
He more closely integrated the law school with the Kellogg School of Management, creating a three-year J.D./M.B.A degree.
''Law schools sometimes think they are Quaker meetings, and everyone has a say and everyone talks a lot,'' said Henry S. Bienen, a former president of Northwestern. ''David brought extraordinary leadership and change.''
Colleagues say Dr. Van Zandt uses subtle persuasion to push new ideas. ''He persuaded people with the accumulation of data,'' said Stephen B. Presser, a professor of legal history at the Northwestern University School of Law.
Dr. Van Zandt concurs. ''People want to know what the facts are, and through a lot of discussion, people can understand why change may be good,'' he said, noting that ''academics tend to be the most liberal politically and the most conservative when it comes to changing their own organization.''
Dr. Van Zandt will have to harness some of that diplomacy when trying to effect change, a lesson Mr. Kerrey learned during his tenure. In 2008, when the provost, the university's fourth in seven years, left, Mr. Kerrey appointed himself as the interim provost, infuriating the faculty and igniting student protests.
Mr. Kerrey said the experience was ''upsetting at the time,'' but reflected the amount of change that needed to take place. He said the characterization of him as autocratic was ''inaccurate.''
''Some people interpret my liking to argue -- I like a good debate -- as dictatorial, but I've never turned away anyone who wanted to participate in a decision,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Conservatives' Focus on Fiscal Matters Means Few Care About a Gay Republican

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
Had a former chairman of the Republican National Committee announced in 2004 that he was gay, it would have been a bombshell. In that hard-fought election year, Republicans and Democrats were rushing to condemn a court for establishing the right to same-sex marriage in Massachusetts.
Six years later, in a midterm election cycle that is otherwise fierce, campaigns are largely silent on the issue of same-sex marriage -- even as two federal courts have issued similar decisions in recent months upholding the rights of gay people to wed. And when Ken Mehlman, who ran President George W. Bush's re-election campaign in 2004 and then became the party's chairman, said in an interview in The Atlantic this week that he is gay and is working to support a campaign for same-sex marriage, it was met with little controversy. 
Even the commentary accusing him of hypocrisy seemed outweighed by people who wished him well, or merely shrugged.
The muted reaction reflects not only changing values in the country generally, but also, more notably, among many Republicans and conservatives.
The center of gravity of the conservative movement in this election season is with fiscal conservatives. The Tea Party is infusing the Republican Party with new energy, and Tea Party leaders and supporters say they do not want to talk about social issues: even if they do not personally support same-sex marriage or abortion, they think the Republican Party spent too much time talking about them and not enough time trying to rein in spending.
As head of the Republican National Committee, Mr. Mehlman advocated the Bush administration's push for a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, which Republicans had hoped would galvanize the party's conservative base in 2006.
Now he joins several other members of the Bush inner circle who have publicly stated their support for same-sex marriage. Former Vice President Dick Cheney, who has a daughter who is gay, has said he supports the right of gay people to marry, as has the former first lady Laura Bush.
''There are now more and more Republicans, and conservative Republicans, who have talked about this issue through the prism of being an equal rights issue, and being an issue that should not define the conservative movement and the party,'' said Steve Schmidt, who was part of that inner circle as a spokesman and strategist for Mr. Bush's 2004 campaign.
Mr. Schmidt spoke of his support for same-sex marriage in 2008 to the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay rights group, when he was chief strategist for John McCain's presidential run. Like Mr. Cheney, he spoke in personal terms, telling the group that his sister is gay and that she and her partner are an important part of his and his children's lives.
Matthew Dowd, another top strategist for Mr. Bush who broke with him after the re-election campaign, said that same-sex marriage had ceased to be a big issue for many voters -- including conservatives and religious ones -- even in 2004. In polling and focus groups before that election, he said, Republicans and conservatives cited terrorism, taxes and the war in Iraq as the issues that would move them to the polls.
And even as many commentators declared that ballot initiatives on same-sex marriage that year drove conservatives to the polls for Mr. Bush, Mr. Dowd said that analyses showed that the initiatives stirred no statistical increase in turnout among conservatives or religious voters.
Mr. Mehlman told The Atlantic, ''It's taken me 43 years to get comfortable with this part of my life.'' His announcement -- and the relatively passive reaction to it -- reflects how the country has shifted.
''It's just not politics, it's Hollywood folks who struggle with this, people in the news media struggle with it, athletes struggle with it, this question of whether or not they should be open,'' Mr. Dowd said. ''What we're seeing is more and more people deciding that staying quiet for the rest of their lives is no longer an option.''
Still, voters may not want to institute same-sex marriage -- recent campaigns failed in Northeastern states like New York, New Jersey and Maine, which are usually considered the province of liberalism.
And not all conservatives are willing to concede the fight on social issues.
Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, said Mr. Mehlman's announcement helped explain ''the scandalous failure'' of the Republican establishment to fight same-sex marriage. ''It is important for the conservative movement that the Republican Party remains committed to its longtime stance on core social issues,'' he said.
But polls show acceptance of gays growing among Americans, on a variety of measures. In a Gallup poll in May, 52 percent of Americans said that gay and lesbian relations were ''morally acceptable'' -- the first time that support had crossed what the polling group called the ''symbolic threshold'' of 50 percent.
Among conservatives, 33 percent agreed, up five percentage points since May 2006. Another Gallup poll in May found that 70 percent of Americans -- and 53 percent of conservatives -- favored allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly in the military.
The shift is being driven largely by demographics, as a younger generation grows up with more discussion and acceptance of gay rights.
In a New York Times/CBS News poll conducted in March 2004, a plurality of Americans under 45 -- 35 percent -- said there should be no legal recognition of gay and lesbian relationships. Forty-five percent of Americans 45 and older said the same. By April 2010, just 24 percent of Americans ages 18 to 44 surveyed said that there should be no legal recognition, and 35 percent of Americans 45 and older said the same.
''People want to make sure that government is not intrusive in our lives,'' Mr. Dowd said. ''Whether it's the economy or our social lives.''

HEADLINE: In a Summer of Austerity, a Parade of Super Cars From the Gulf Turns Heads

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS

 BODY:
LONDON -- With his canary yellow Ferrari at rest in the forecourt of one of the most expensive hotels in London's upscale West End, its eight-cylinder, race-bred engine burbling, a young Arab man who gave his name as Khalefa spoke with whimsical regret about the array of even faster, more expensive super cars parked nearby that belonged to other young men like himself from the Persian Gulf oil states.
''Me, I only have the Ferrari,'' he said. ''I am a poor man.''
With Britain still struggling to climb out of recession, and the new governing coalition embarked on a historic campaign of budget austerity, wealthy young men like Khalefa -- who declined to give his full name, or his nationality -- encounter a conflicted reception when they flee the conservative social mores and the 130-degree heat of the Middle East in high summer to enjoy the cool breezes of millionaires' row districts of London like Belgravia, Mayfair and Knightsbridge. 
On one hand, the young men and their families get an eager welcome in the hotels, department stores, and jewelry and fashion boutiques that rely heavily on the visitors' wealth in otherwise lean economic times. Many local people, too, at least in London, enjoy the excitement and panache that come with a parade of exotic cars with Arabic license plates from gulf oil states like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and, especially, the United Arab Emirates.
But a display of vehicles that rival anything to be seen at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance or Monaco's Casino Square at Grand Prix time has its downside, too, with residents complaining that some visitors have exploited the easygoing atmosphere of the West End in summer to flout parking regulations and stage what have amounted to races of their own in the deserted streets after midnight, in what one of Britain's tabloids called the Knightsbridge Grand Prix.
Arab visitors to Britain -- more than five million last year, according to official figures -- have increased since the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States, which some Arab commentators say made Arab visitors feel less comfortable in New York.
''Arab people are scared, in a way, of becoming figures in an exhibition, of being associated in some way with what happened in those attacks,'' said Abdel Bari Atwan, editor in chief of Al Quds Al Arabi, a London-based Arabic-language newspaper distributed widely in the Middle East. ''They feel the people of London are more tolerant.''
But this year, the display of wealth has been more conspicuous than ever, especially the cars, and it has drawn mixed reviews. The cars are flown and shipped in from the Middle East for a few weeks, then returned home as the end of the European summer approaches, with costs many times what the owners might pay if they leased luxury cars in London. One carrier, the Gulf Agency Company, said it had flown 15 cars to London this summer, at an average cost of about $15,000 one way.
Enthusiasts gather wherever the Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Mercedes-Benz SLRs and Rolls-Royces are parked. Their gulf origins are evident from their license plates; that discretion is not the favored mode is suggested by the customized paint jobs, of silver plate and gold lame and black matte, and, for Rolls-Royces, bright red or yellow or other arresting color schemes barely imagined when Charles Rolls and Henry Royce began selling their cars to Britain's aristocratic elite in 1906.
These cars have included several examples of the Mercedes SLR McLaren; a number of French-made Bugatti Veyrons, with 1,000-horsepower engines said to be capable of nearly 270 miles per hour, and a $1.3 million sticker price; and the Italian-made Pagani Zonda Cinque, base price $1 million, that the manufacturers say is so rare that only half a dozen have been sold.
But perhaps the rarest of all is the Swedish-built Koenigsegg CCXR, retailing at $1.9 million and said by its manufacturers to be the world's first ''green'' super car, capable of achieving speeds of 250 miles an hour on biofuel. A powder-blue Koenigsegg became an inadvertent icon for the super car invasion when, together with a similarly painted Lamborghini Murcielago, it was ''clamped'' by parking wardens -- in American terms, immobilized by having a steel ''boot'' locked to one of its front wheels -- outside Harrods department store last month.
The cars' owners, members of the royal family of Qatar, bought the store in May for $2.2 billion from Mohamed al-Fayed, the 77-year-old Egyptian-born entrepreneur whose son, Dodi, died in a Paris car crash in 1997 with Diana, Princess of Wales. Perhaps they believed that a parking space should have come along with the purchase.
For many gulf visitors, clamping has become a hazard of the summer, only partly because of what the wardens have described as their carelessness about parking restrictions. Traffic cameras and handheld computers used by the traffic police cannot handle Arabic script, so a clamp sometimes becomes the only way to enforce a parking penalty or to assure that violators are brought to justice.
With the arrival of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, many of the super cars began disappearing last week. But the end-of-season mood was punctured by a spectacular crash last month in the heart of Knightsbridge.
Two wealthy young men from Abu Dhabi were arrested after a Lamborghini spun out of control on a dash around a square shortly before 2 a.m., wrecking four other expensive vehicles, one of them a BMW that was flipped over by the impact. Witnesses were quoted in The Evening Standard as saying that one of the men called out as he walked away from the impact, saying, ''It's all right, we'll pay for the damage.''
It is not only the British who have cringed at the flamboyant excesses of some of the visitors. Mr. Atwan, the newspaper editor, described the ''show off'' behavior of the young super car owners as ''very annoying and very provoking, and not only to the British, but other Arabs.''
Nevertheless, he said, it would be a mistake to condemn all the young Arab men for the actions of a few. He said he was sitting at a Knightsbridge traffic light in his middle-market family sedan recently when a yellow Ferrari pulled up alongside him with its engine growling.
''I rolled down my window to say something to him before the light changed, expecting him to rev his engine and zoom away,'' Mr. Atwan said. ''But then I decided to be polite, and said, 'What a nice car! Good luck!' and do you know what? He pulled away very quietly, waving his hand to say goodbye. He couldn't have been more polite.''

HEADLINE: Much of Pakistan's Progress Is Lost in Its Floodwaters

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL

 BODY:
SUKKUR, Pakistan -- Men waded waist deep all week wedging stones with their bare hands into an embankment to hold back Pakistan's surging floodwaters. It was a rudimentary and ultimately vain effort to save their town. On Thursday, the waters breached the levee, a demoralizing show of how fragile Pakistan's infrastructure remains, and how overwhelming the task is to save it.
Even as Pakistani and international relief officials scrambled to save people and property, they despaired that the nation's worst natural calamity had ruined just about every physical strand that knit this country together -- roads, bridges, schools, health clinics, electricity and communications.
The destruction could set Pakistan back many years, if not decades, further weaken its feeble civilian administration and add to the burdens on its military. It seems certain to distract from American requests for Pakistan to battle Taliban insurgents, who threatened foreign aid workers delivering flood relief on Thursday. It is already disrupting vital supply lines to American forces in Afghanistan. 
The flooding, which began with the arrival of the annual monsoons late last month, has by now affected about one-fifth of the country -- nearly 62,000 square miles -- or an area larger than England, according to the United Nations.
At the worst points, the inundation extends for scores of miles beyond the banks of the overflowing Indus River and its tributaries, said Cmdr. Iqbal Zahid, a Pakistani Navy battalion commander in charge of rescue operations in Sindh Province.
''You have to highlight that the infrastructure all the way from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa to Sindh is ruined,'' Commander Zahid said, referring to Pakistan's northernmost and southernmost provinces. ''It will take years to rebuild.''
Nearly 20 million people have been significantly affected, about the population of New York State, the United Nations said. The number in urgent need is now about eight million and expected to rise. More than half of them are without shelter.
The government's estimates of the damage are equally grim. More than 5,000 miles of roads and railways have been washed away, along with some 7,000 schools and more than 400 health facilities.
Just to build about 500 miles of road in war-ravaged Afghanistan, the United States spent $500 million and several years, according to the Web site of the United States Agency for International Development.
And the agency has spent $200 million to rebuild just 56 schools, 19 health facilities and other services since the momentous earthquake in the Pakistani-controlled portion of Kashmir in 2005.
One estimate, in a joint study from Ball State University and the University of Tennessee, put the total cost of the flood damage at $7.1 billion. That is nearly a fifth of Pakistan's budget, and it exceeds the total cost of last year's five-year aid package to Pakistan passed by Congress.
Standing on the edges of the floods, the scale of the damage is evident. The water has torn mile-long breaches atop two of the main canals in Sindh Province, where tens of thousands of people were evacuated Thursday. Until the gaps can be repaired, water will continue flooding districts along the right bank of the Indus, officials said.
Floodwaters have ripped up the road from here to Jacobabad, cutting off the main highway that reaches both Baluchistan Province, Pakistan's poorest, and into Afghanistan, one of the main supply routes used by United States forces.
What the waters have not destroyed, rescue workers have been forced to, in some cases. In the southern provinces, Pakistani government workers pointed out places where they had to blow up roads, embankments and even the railway line to steer the flow of water away from the larger towns.
The velocity of the floods was greatest in northern Pakistan, home to steep mountain valleys, and the infrastructure damage there was the worst.
The mountainous Swat Valley, which was still struggling to rebuild from the army's campaign against Taliban insurgents, has lost every bridge and whole sections of its roads. An entire neighborhood of the town of Madyan, along with the hospital compound and an electricity station, were swept away, leaving sand and stones in their place.
Great chunks of the famed Karakoram Highway -- a celebrated feat of high-altitude engineering built by the Chinese over two decades -- have disappeared as cliffs fell away in the torrent. The route, which winds hundreds of miles from the Chinese border in the Himalayas to the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, may now be impassable for years, officials said.
A number of hydroelectric dams in the north, which are being built by China, have also been damaged. Five workers, including two Chinese engineers and three Pakistanis, drowned when floods swept through one construction camp earlier this month, the government reported.
The United States has agreed to help the World Bank and the Asia Development Bank conduct a damage and needs assessment for the Pakistani government. The figure is bound to be big.
The recovery cost will have to be met by a mixture of domestic money, international donations and loans from development banks, the administrator of A.I.D., Dr. Rajiv Shah, said after a tour of flooded regions on Wednesday.
The lack of electricity, especially through the infernally hot summer months, is a constant problem for the government and a reason for repeated strikes and public protests throughout Pakistan, even in ordinary times. The damage to the electricity and power sector alone could run to $125 million, according to a government report shown to The New York Times.
Water and energy were a prime focus of the five-year $7.5 billion American aid package for Pakistan passed by Congress last year. The Obama administration had hoped to use the legislation as the centerpiece of a lasting strategic partnership with Pakistan and to help buttress the economy and Pakistan's weak government institutions.
Now, American officials fear that money will end up being spent just to get Pakistan back to where it was before the ''super flood.'' The United States has already redirected $50 million of the aid package to help with the flood recovery, and the disaster will force a review of all projects that had been planned, Dr. Shah said.
''Priorities will necessarily have to shift and shift so that there is more of a recovery and reconstruction approach than people were thinking just a few months ago,'' he told reporters during a trip to Sukkur.
He and other American officials are insisting that the disaster be treated as an opportunity for Pakistan to ''leapfrog'' ahead and help it build water and energy systems better than what was destroyed.
They point to successes that grew out of the 2005 earthquake in Pakistan, namely the creation of the National Disaster Management Administration, which is now spearheading the government response to the floods. But diplomats said government accountability and reforms in the rule of law would have to accompany the effort and the aid money.
''This is going to be very, very difficult, this is a huge scale disaster,'' Dr. Shah said. ''But we have to continue to be optimistic and look for those opportunities to help Pakistan to use this to build back better.''

HEADLINE: Pursuing an Asian Health Network

BYLINE: By WAYNE ARNOLD

 BODY:
SINGAPORE -- No matter how healthy or rich Asian economies are, one thing is certain: Asians will never stop getting sick.
That helps explain why Malvinder Singh left his home in New Delhi this year to move to Singapore. He first made a fortune in 2008 selling the generic-drug giant that his family built, Ranbaxy Laboratories. Now, Mr. Singh, 37, is trying to expand Fortis Healthcare, another of the family companies, from a string of hospitals around the Indian subcontinent into a pan-Asian health care network.
''There is a huge opportunity for growth in Asia for health care,'' Mr. Singh said in a recent interview. ''There are multiple markets which need investment that we would want to be a part of.''
Fortis suffered a major setback in July when its bid to acquire Parkway Holdings, a regional hospital operator based in Singapore, lost out to a higher bid from Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund. But Mr. Singh, who has a master's degree in business administration from Duke in North Carolina, said he was undeterred. 
Having spent almost $1 billion in the last two years buying up assets in health care and other sectors around the world, he said he was already scouting for new targets.
The attraction is clear: with a population of more than 1.1 billion, most with no access to formal health care, India represents one of the fastest-growing health care markets. And the country's relatively low costs are increasingly attracting medical tourism patients from abroad.
''There's a good amount of opportunity for the business to be transferred from patients migrating from other countries to India for treatment,'' said Ranjit Kapadia, an analyst at HDFC Securities in Mumbai.
But Mr. Singh is after much more: not only a slice of China's 1.3 billion people and Indonesia's 227 million, but also the emerging class of affluent Asian medical tourists, many of whom flock to Singapore for quality private care. By building a regional network of hospitals, moreover, he hopes to bring better care to the poorest parts of India.
''The challenge for the country and for us as health care providers is to see how to create a model where you're able to create infrastructure and investment in health care and bring it closer to the people, so it's more accessible,'' said Mr. Singh, the Fortis chairman.
Many in India still wonder why Mr. Singh and his younger brother, Shivinder, decided to walk away from their pharmaceutical company, which has deep ties in their family.
Two of Mr. Singh's great-uncles, Ranbir and Gurbax Singh, started Ranbaxy in 1937 as a distributor for the Japanese drug maker Shionogi. When the brothers ran into financial trouble, they turned to Mr. Singh's grandfather for a loan. In 1952, when they could not repay him, they made him a partner.
Malvinder's father, Parvinder, returned to India from the United States in 1967 with a master's degree in pharmacy from Washington State University and a doctorate from the University of Michigan, and went to work at Ranbaxy, eventually taking it over and changing it into a generic-drug maker from a drug distributor.
When Parvinder Singh died in 1999, his two sons inherited his 33.5 percent stake in Ranbaxy. Malvinder Singh climbed the ladder onto the company's board in 2003, and in 2006 he became managing director and chief executive.
Along with another Indian drug company, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Ranbaxy became known globally for overturning big drug companies' patents in court fights and then churning out lower-cost versions of their best-selling products.
By the middle of the decade, though, competition from cheap generics was proving as tough on generic-drug makers as it was on big pharmaceutical companies. In 2005, Ranbaxy's profit fell by two-thirds and its share price by nearly a half.
So in 2008, the Singhs sought a solution by marrying Ranbaxy to the Japanese drug maker Daiichi Sankyo. For Daiichi Sankyo, Ranbaxy offered low-cost manufacturing and access to 60 new markets, including crucial emerging markets like India, to offset falling sales at home.
''We had what they wanted,'' Mr. Singh said.
Selling their stake in the company to the Japanese earned the Singhs $2.3 billion, vaulting them to No. 13 on Forbes magazine's ranking of the richest Indians. Mr. Singh retained his position as head of the company.
In September 2008, however, the Food and Drug Administration in the United States banned 30 Ranbaxy drugs made at two of the company's Indian plants, citing manufacturing problems uncovered that year. Ranbaxy's stock dropped by two-thirds, and in May 2009, the company replaced Mr. Singh as chief executive and paid him a severance of 480 million rupees, or $9.6 million.
Mr. Singh declined to discuss the F.D.A. case or his departure from Ranbaxy. ''Once I left Ranbaxy, I've not spoken on what they're doing or what we've done,'' he said. He added, however, that the company's fortunes and its shares, had largely recovered.
Mr. Singh turned to another family company, Fortis Healthcare. Founded in 1996 and named after the Greek word for strength, Fortis has grown from a single hospital in northwest India into a network of 48 hospitals and clinics.
Last year, the Indian health care market was estimated at $38 billion, and given the country's fast-growing, increasingly affluent population, more and more Indians are suffering from lifestyle diseases common to developed countries. India already has the largest number of diabetics in the world after China, for example, yet Indians, on average, spend only $55 a year on health care.
''There's a huge gap in India,'' Mr. Singh said. ''The health care market in India is very fragmented. The corporatization of health care is still emerging.''
While 70 percent of the country's hospitals are government-run, private hospitals treat 70 percent of all patients, he said. And most private hospitals are small, with fewer than 30 beds, providing a big opportunity for larger operators like Fortis to use economies of scale to lower prices and increase profits. By introducing more advanced treatment methods, Fortis also aims to lower the average patient stay, allowing it to increase volume.
To achieve the advantages of size, Fortis embarked on an acquisition spree, acquiring three hospital chains in India from 2005 to 2009. The company now has 10 more hospitals under construction.
In March, Fortis leaped overseas, buying 24 percent of Parkway from the private equity firm TPG for $685.3 million. With hospitals in Malaysia, China and India, Parkway gave Fortis a foothold across Asia. The chain is also popular with medical tourists; a third of its patients in Singapore come from abroad, mainly from Indonesia.
Some analysts expressed doubt about whether Fortis could benefit from an international network. Unlike the managers and engineers who follow manufacturing investments overseas, doctors and nurses often cannot work in countries where they are not licensed. ''I don't know who can add more value to whom,'' Lynette Tan, an analyst at the Singapore brokerage DMG & Partners, said of the Fortis-Parkway link.
But Mr. Kapadia at HDFC said the economies of scale came not from personnel but from purchasing. With more hospitals, Fortis stands to get lower prices for drugs, supplies and equipment, he said, adding: ''A hospital is not only its doctors.''
Losing out on its bid to take over the rest of Parkway, therefore, was a blow to Fortis's strategy. The Malaysian investment fund Khazanah Nasional Berhad won Parkway with a higher bid than Fortis's. ''We were not keen to get into a bidding war,'' Mr. Singh said.
Fortis instead reaped a profit of 116.7 million Singapore dollars, or about $86 million, by selling its share of Parkway to Khazanah. The problem for Fortis now is that there are few pan-Asian players as big as Parkway for it to buy. ''There isn't any other very obvious candidate,'' said Anni Kum, an analyst at Kim Eng Securities in Singapore.
As a result, Mr. Singh said, Fortis is now considering moving into hospital management as an alternative.
''An acquisition to get kick-started might be the way to start,'' he said. ''But that doesn't mean it's the only way.''

HEADLINE: Japan's Leader Faces a Battle For Control Of His Party

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- After just three months in office, Prime Minister Naoto Kan of Japan faces a challenge from a scandal-tainted power broker within his own party in a leadership race that could hamper the government's response to a debilitating economic slowdown. 
The power broker, Ichiro Ozawa, 68, said Thursday that he planned to run against Mr. Kan for the presidency of the Democratic Party on Sept. 14, a position that would ensure his appointment as prime minister. Mr. Ozawa, who is credited with the Democrats' rise to power last year, has been increasingly critical of Mr. Kan since the party lost ground in elections last month.
Mr. Ozawa's challenge could bring upheaval to the Democrats just as Japan's recovery from a painful recession shows signs of sputtering. Growth slowed to just 0.1 percent in the most recent quarter, and the strength of the yen has threatened to erode earnings at Japan's exporters because it makes their products more expensive abroad and therefore less competitive.
''Although I am unworthy, I have decided to run in the leadership election,'' Mr. Ozawa said.
In a thinly veiled censure of Mr. Ozawa's old-school politics, Mr. Kan said Thursday, ''We must first break down Japan's political structure, then construct a new one together.''
A divisive figure, Mr. Ozawa could also bring more political uncertainty to a country that has had five prime ministers in three years.
The Democrats ousted the Liberal Democratic Party last August after a string of unpopular prime ministers finally compelled voters to reject the L.D.P., a party that had governed Japan for most of the past half-century. Yukio Hatoyama of the Democrats took office as prime minister in September, only to resign nine months later over a broken campaign promise to move a United States Marine base from Okinawa.
His successor, Mr. Kan, first appeared to be winning back popular support for the party, but he has seen his ratings nosedive after suggesting that Japan may raise its consumption tax to tackle its mounting public debt.
Mr. Ozawa, the leader of the Democrats from 2006 to 2009, was forced to step down over a political financing scandal just months before his party's rise to power. The scandal still clouds his future. He remains under criminal investigation, and a citizens' judicial panel is expected to rule on whether he will be indicted after the Sept. 14 vote.

HEADLINE: This Is Not A Recovery

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
What will Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, say in his big speech Friday in Jackson Hole, Wyo.? Will he hint at new steps to boost the economy? Stay tuned.
But we can safely predict what he and other officials will say about where we are right now: that the economy is continuing to recover, albeit more slowly than they would like. Unfortunately, that's not true: this isn't a recovery, in any sense that matters. And policy makers should be doing everything they can to change that fact.
The small sliver of truth in claims of continuing recovery is the fact that G.D.P. is still rising: we're not in a classic recession, in which everything goes down. But so what? 
The important question is whether growth is fast enough to bring down sky-high unemployment. We need about 2.5 percent growth just to keep unemployment from rising, and much faster growth to bring it significantly down. Yet growth is currently running somewhere between 1 and 2 percent, with a good chance that it will slow even further in the months ahead. Will the economy actually enter a double dip, with G.D.P. shrinking? Who cares? If unemployment rises for the rest of this year, which seems likely, it won't matter whether the G.D.P. numbers are slightly positive or slightly negative.
All of this is obvious. Yet policy makers are in denial.
After its last monetary policy meeting, the Fed released a statement declaring that it ''anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization'' -- Fedspeak for falling unemployment. Nothing in the data supports that kind of optimism. Meanwhile, Tim Geithner, the Treasury secretary, says that ''we're on the road to recovery.'' No, we aren't.
Why are people who know better sugar-coating economic reality? The answer, I'm sorry to say, is that it's all about evading responsibility.
In the case of the Fed, admitting that the economy isn't recovering would put the institution under pressure to do more. And so far, at least, the Fed seems more afraid of the possible loss of face if it tries to help the economy and fails than it is of the costs to the American people if it does nothing, and settles for a recovery that isn't.
In the case of the Obama administration, officials seem loath to admit that the original stimulus was too small. True, it was enough to limit the depth of the slump -- a recent analysis by the Congressional Budget Office says unemployment would probably be well into double digits now without the stimulus -- but it wasn't big enough to bring unemployment down significantly.
Now, it's arguable that even in early 2009, when President Obama was at the peak of his popularity, he couldn't have gotten a bigger plan through the Senate. And he certainly couldn't pass a supplemental stimulus now. So officials could, with considerable justification, place the onus for the non-recovery on Republican obstructionism. But they've chosen, instead, to draw smiley faces on a grim picture, convincing nobody. And the likely result in November -- big gains for the obstructionists -- will paralyze policy for years to come.
So what should officials be doing, aside from telling the truth about the economy?
The Fed has a number of options. It can buy more long-term and private debt; it can push down long-term interest rates by announcing its intention to keep short-term rates low; it can raise its medium-term target for inflation, making it less attractive for businesses to simply sit on their cash. Nobody can be sure how well these measures would work, but it's better to try something that might not work than to make excuses while workers suffer.
The administration has less freedom of action, since it can't get legislation past the Republican blockade. But it still has options. It can revamp its deeply unsuccessful attempt to aid troubled homeowners. It can use Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored lenders, to engineer mortgage refinancing that puts money in the hands of American families -- yes, Republicans will howl, but they're doing that anyway. It can finally get serious about confronting China over its currency manipulation: how many times do the Chinese have to promise to change their policies, then renege, before the administration decides that it's time to act?
Which of these options should policy makers pursue? If I had my way, all of them.
I know what some players both at the Fed and in the administration will say: they'll warn about the risks of doing anything unconventional. But we've already seen the consequences of playing it safe, and waiting for recovery to happen all by itself: it's landed us in what looks increasingly like a permanent state of stagnation and high unemployment. It's time to admit that what we have now isn't a recovery, and do whatever we can to change that situation.

 BODY:
The University of California has appointed an official to manage spending and operations at President Mark G. Yudof's new private residence, after Mr. Yudof ran up nearly $700,000 in expenses and involved senior university officials in time-consuming personal matters over a rented mansion in the Oakland Hills. 
University officials said the action was necessary because of a lack of oversight and accountability during Mr. Yudof's two-year stay at the Oakland property.
The announcement came after The Bay Citizen disclosed the costly housing ordeal last week, provoking criticism at a time when the 10-campus U.C. system is facing one of the worst financial crises in its history.
''Here you literally have wasted hundreds of thousands of dollars that could have gone into student scholarships, reduction of fees -- whatever -- to educate more students in California,'' said Leland Yee, a Democratic state senator from San Francisco who has been critical of Mr. Yudof's management of the U.C.
Mr. Yudof moved into a smaller house in Lafayette last month after failing to obtain a last-minute lease extension in Oakland. His hurried exit left behind tens of thousands of dollars in damage to the house, according to the owner, who is seeking payment from the university.
U.C. officials said Karren Jamaca had been assigned to handle the university's relationship with the new landlord and to pay vendors, in addition to other matters. Ms. Jamaca's role overseeing Mr. Yudof's residence will be similar to her management of three other university facilities.
''The biggest thing is to establish a clear line of authority, clear up confusion and provide more accountability on the house,'' said Nathan Brostrom, executive vice president for business operations at the university.
After being hired in 2008 from the University of Texas, where he served as chancellor for six years, Mr. Yudof opted not to live at Blake House, the university's traditional presidential residence, which is in need of repairs. Instead, he and his wife moved into the 16-room Oakland house. The U.C. paid the $13,365 monthly rent out of a private endowment, officials said.
In one expense, the university spent nearly $20,000 -- including $530.04 an hour in overtime -- to fix an indoor elevator that the landlord said was under warranty and could have been repaired at no charge.
Lynn Tierney, a university spokeswoman, said she had been advised by the U.C. general counsel not to discuss specific actions taken at the house because of possible mediation or litigation with the landlord, Brennan Mulligan, who has kept the university's $32,100 security deposit.
The university reached a tentative settlement with Mr. Mulligan that would have allowed him to keep the security deposit and receive an additional $19,759.05, but Mr. Yudof killed that deal because he said the terms were ''outrageous and ridiculous.''
The university is now disputing some of the charges, including the cost to repair the elevator.

HEADLINE: A Big Surprise: Troubled Assets Garner Rewards

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
American taxpayers are already poised to make unexpected billions from rescuing the nation's banks. Now, they could reap another sizable profit from a government program devised to purge troubled real estate assets from the financial system.
The Obama administration made the so-called Public-Private Investment Program a centerpiece of its plan to help unlock the frozen credit markets in the spring of 2009, when a lack of buyers for complex mortgage securities threatened the health of the nation's banks and put a drag on lending.
Under the program, the government provided matching funds and ultracheap loans to investment firms like AllianceBernstein and Oaktree Capital that agreed to buy mortgage securities from banks and other financial institutions.
Taxpayers stood to share in any of the profits, though the prospects of such a windfall were seen as secondary to the goal of unclogging the markets. 
Nine months into the program, the eight investment funds chosen by the Treasury Department have generated an estimated return of about 15.5 percent for taxpayers, according to an analysis of their results through the end of June by Linus Wilson, an assistant professor of finance at the University of Louisiana, Lafayette.
Two of the investment funds -- one operated by an Angelo, Gordon-GE Capital consortium and another by BlackRock -- have gotten off to even stronger starts, posting returns of more than 20 percent.
That translates into a paper profit of roughly $657 million for taxpayers. Some Wall Street analysts project that taxpayers could earn as much as $6.2 billion on these investments over the next nine years, from an investment of about $22 billion.
To be sure, the funds' standout performance can be attributed to a rally in the mortgage bond market that began late last year and may be hard to repeat.
Still, it is a remarkable turnabout. When the administration announced the Public-Private Investment Program, critics lambasted it as yet another giveaway to private equity firms and other Wall Street money managers -- a program so ill-conceived that one prominent economist, the Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, characterized it at the time as a ''robbery of the American people.''
But the strong start of the funds has pushed aside many of those concerns.
''We feel very good about the performance to date,'' said David N. Miller, the Treasury Department's chief investment officer who oversees its bailout-related holdings.
The administration has not yet provided its own profit projections, and all proceeds will be used to pay down the nation's ballooning debt. But any windfall, Mr. Miller suggested, would be icing on the cake for taxpayers.
The program's main benefit, he said, has been to help revive the market for complex mortgage bonds, whose trading ground to a halt a year and a half ago. That helped break the downward spiral of asset prices and paved the way for a wave of new bond deals, which lenders rely on to finance new mortgages.
''We view that as accomplishing the mission,'' Mr. Miller said.
The scope of the government's action was scaled back before it got started. In fact, the original purpose of the $700 billion federal bailout program, authorized by Congress during the tenure of Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., was to buy mortgage assets much more aggressively. Instead, that money was used to make direct investments in troubled banks.
So, to restart the trading of mortgage assets, the incoming Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, announced the creation of a smaller Public-Private Investment Program. The administration hoped to establish market prices for the assets so that banks would not have to sell them at fire-sale prices, which would have threatened their solvency.
As a side effect, though, the extraordinary government interventions in the banking system made necessary by the financial crisis have turned the United States government into one of the world's biggest vulture investors.
In addition to the $22 billion the Treasury Department has invested in the public-private program, the Federal Reserve has amassed about $69 billion of distressed loans and bonds from the 11th-hour rescues of Bear Stearns and the American International Group. That program appears poised to turn its own multibillion-dollar profit for taxpayers.
Together the Treasury and Fed have allocated more than twice as much taxpayer money toward distressed real estate assets as the combined total the 10 largest private real estate investment funds have raised for such assets over the last decade, according to Prequin, a financial information provider.
In normal market conditions, these funds are the lifeblood of real estate financing.
All that money invested by the government is still tiny compared with the estimated $1.8 trillion worth of distressed residential and commercial mortgage-related securities that were eligible for sale when the investment funds drafted by the Public-Private Investment Program began their purchases last fall, according to a Barclays Capital research report. Those assets remain on the books of many Wall Street investment houses, insurers and banks.
What the program has provided, though, is a big dose of confidence in the markets, assuring investors that there would be a steady stream of buyers for distressed securities.
More than 100 investment firms applied to participate in the program and raised money from private investors. Even though only eight funds were chosen to receive government money, many of the others have nonetheless been dabbling in the market, helping to bid up prices.
''That literally changed supply and demand,'' said Wilbur L. Ross Jr., the veteran vulture investor who helps manage Invesco's public-private fund.
The Public-Private Investment Program has run into its share of problems. For example, a second component of the program -- to be run by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and intended to encourage the purchase of real estate loans rather than bonds -- never got off the ground.
Also, some of the early promises that ordinary investors would be able to ''profit from the bailout'' by owning stakes in public-private investment funds have failed to materialize. BlackRock, for example, failed to win regulatory approval to create a mutual fund for ordinary investors that would have largely invested in the firm's public-private fund.
Legg Mason and Nuveen Investments have offered consumers the chance to own smaller slivers of the program's investments through the Mortgage Opportunity mutual funds they sell -- although they have only modestly outperformed their peers.
Government watchdogs have also raised concerns about the program. Neil M. Barofsky, the special inspector general assigned to monitor the use of bailout funds, faulted the Treasury Department by saying it had failed to establish ''appropriate metrics and internal controls.''
Fund managers brief federal officials at least monthly on their performance, but Mr. Barofsky concluded that expecting private firms to develop detailed policies and procedures ''is not appropriate in light of the risk of conflicts of interest inherent'' in the public-private investment program. His follow-up audit of the public-private fund managers is expected to be completed in September.
Meanwhile skeptics like Professor Wilson question whether the government's favorable financing terms were actually encouraging the fund managers in the program to make risky wagers without giving taxpayers a big enough piece of the upside.
''The U.S. Treasury has given the asset managers incentives to swing for the fences,'' Professor Wilson said. ''The asset managers have hit some early home runs, yet we are still in the first inning of these investments.''
Although the program's eight investment funds have posted solid results so far, they have invested only about $16.2 billion, or just over 55 percent of the $29.2 billion of the total money they have raised, according to government data through June.
The Treasury Department has put up roughly three-quarters of that total, matching dollar-for-dollar money put up by private investors while also providing an even bigger helping of debt financing at about 1.3 percent, well below normal interest rates.

HEADLINE: A Green Idea That Sounded Good Until the Trees Went to Work

BYLINE: By SCOTT JAMES. 
Scott James is an Emmy-winning television journalist and novelist who lives in San Francisco. sjames@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Scott James is a columnist for The Bay Citizen.
The 1980s had their share of ill-fated ideas -- parachute pants, Betamax and New Coke, to name a few -- but for San Francisco property owners, the cursed relic of that decade is the Metrosideros excelsus.
More commonly known as the New Zealand Christmas tree, it is distinctive for its crimson flowers, its ability to thrive almost anywhere and roots that can grow to nine inches in diameter -- destroying sewer lines and sidewalks. 
That destruction of infrastructure is happening across the city as the trees planted during the 1980s have matured. A 2003 survey by the University of California, Davis, counted 4,873 of the species in San Francisco.
Despite widespread recognition that choosing the trees was a mistake -- in fact, the species is no longer planted except in certain areas -- the city is fighting those who must deal with its ruinous effects. Property owners who ask to replace or remove the trees face a lengthy and expensive battle.
Consider the ordeal of Dr. Elizabeth Kantor, a physician who treats elderly patients in the city's impoverished Tenderloin neighborhood. She owns a home at 835 Wisconsin Street on Potrero Hill, and in 1984 she was excited to have a fledgling New Zealand Christmas tree planted in front of her house.
But this past February the Department of Public Works cited Dr. Kantor because the tree's roots had buckled the sidewalk. Under city ordinances, property owners are responsible for adjacent sidewalks, and the department estimated that 25 concrete squares plus curbing needed replacing -- at a cost of about $2,500.
Dr. Kantor said the roots had also invaded sewer lines, causing blockages that had required 17 plumber visits since 2000, and PG&E has had to prune the tree's top repeatedly to keep it from damaging power lines.
Enough was enough. Dr. Kantor paid $300 and applied with the Department of Urban Forestry, a unit of the Department of Public Works, to replace the tree with a more benign species.
That request was rejected.
Dr. Kantor asked for a hearing and on April 26 went to ''tree trial'' where Carla Short, from the Department of Urban Forestry, mounted a vigorous defense of the tree, which included a PowerPoint presentation on the environmental benefits of mature foliage.
Once again, the bid to replace the tree was denied.
Undeterred, Dr. Kantor paid another $300 to take her case to the city's Board of Appeals, and on July 21 she faced a contentious, 10-person, hourlong public interrogation.
Ms. Short revived her role as city tree defender (sans PowerPoint) and repeated her overall praise of trees, but she also confirmed what is well known about Metrosideros excelsus. ''They do cause infrastructure damage,'' she testified.
Knowing that, why fight for such a malevolent tree?
''We would be at a 26-year deficit if this tree were removed and another smaller tree planted in its place,'' Ms. Short said.
San Francisco has few indigenous species of trees -- the hills were mostly grass and brush when settlers first arrived -- so each of the estimated 108,000 trees that line the city's streets, and thousands more in parks, are precious.
Twenty-six years might not seem old, but tree planting here did not begin in earnest until the 1980s, according to Heather Ellison of Friends of the Urban Forest, a nonprofit group responsible for the bulk of the city's tree plantings. ''Everyone was just figuring it out,'' Ms. Ellison said of the group's beginnings, noting that there were experiments to see which trees could survive the city's unique climate.
Hence the selection of the hardy New Zealand Christmas tree. But Laurence R. Costello, an urban forestry adviser to the County of San Francisco, said the tree's aggressive nature was now apparent. ''In retrospect it was a mistake,'' Dr. Costello said, ''and we should acknowledge that.''
But it is difficult for some to let go. Despite 30 years of planting various kinds of trees -- about 1,200 trees will be added this year -- San Francisco continues to have one of the lowest levels of ''canopy cover'' of any major American city, Ms. Short said, which explains her zeal to save each tree.
In the end, because of the destruction, the board overruled the Department of Urban Forestry and voted to allow Dr. Kantor to replace her tree. But she is incredulous at what she sees as a questionable use of city resources during tough economic times, and her six-month journey through the city's green bureaucratic jungle has left her bruised.
''I will never plant a street tree again,'' she said.
There are nearly 5,000 Metrosideros excelsus trees still out there. The penalty for removing one without fighting the city for permission is $1,641. Merry Christmas, indeed.

HEADLINE: H.P. Raises Its 3Par Bid, Leapfrogging Dell Again

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
In a rapidly escalating bidding war, Hewlett-Packardraised its offer for the data storage company 3Par to $1.8 billion after the close of regular trading on Thursday, topping a $1.6 billion bid by Dell that came just hours earlier. 
Shares of 3Par, considered a crucial strategic asset by both companies as they look to shore up their corporate solutions businesses, jumped 6 percent in after-hours trading. They had fallen 2.7 percent during the regular session on disappointment that Dell's revised offer, announced on Thursday morning, came in just a sliver above H.P.'s first bid.
Hewlett-Packard, which analysts say has the upper hand because of its much larger revenue and cash position, is now offering $27 a share in cash, trumping Dell's latest of $24.30 a share.
Dell's new offer was just 30 cents a share above H.P.'s opening bid. Some analysts had said that the meager difference suggested Dell might give up if H.P. were to retaliate with a much higher price.
H.P. reported $115 billion of annual revenue last year compared with $53 billion at Dell.
''Even though Dell has the balance sheet to step up the offer, they're probably reaching the upper limits of what they can offer,'' said Ashok Kumar, an analyst at Rodman & Renshaw. ''At the end of the day, Hewlett-Packard is in a better position to close the deal.''
On Thursday morning, 3Par accepted Dell's revised offer and said that the two companies had raised their termination fee to $72 million from $53.5 million.
The pursuit of 3Par comes as Hewlett-Packard and Dell, as well as other large technology vendors like I.B.M. and Cisco Systems, are trying to expand into new products and services.
3Par specializes in high-end data storage, a crucial part of ''cloud computing'' -- an increasingly popular technology that enables computer users to access data and software over the Internet, allowing companies to save costs.
The company competes with EMC as well as I.B.M. and other data storage companies, and 3Par's expertise in the high end has made it attractive.
August has been an unusually active month for deals, after Intel's $7.7 billion bid for McAfee, the maker of security software.
On Thursday alone, Cisco announced it would buy the online video software company ExtendMedia, while Hewlett-Packard said it would buy Stratavia, a software company involved in cloud computing.
Many analysts say the bidding war has driven up valuations to unreasonable heights. 3Par now trades at around 135 times forward earnings, according to the research firm StarMine's SmartEstimates forecast, compared with less than 15 times for EMC and other competitors.
H.P.'s latest, sharply higher offer appeared to dash speculation that it might decide to back off given increasing concerns about the global economy. The lack of a chief executive after Mark V. Hurd's sudden resignation may also be a factor.
A survey by Reuters of nine fund managers and analysts found that most expected another bid or two, and a final price of about $29 a share. Dell shares closed at $11.75, but dipped to $11.70 after H.P.'s revised offer was announced. H.P. shares were little changed at $38.22.

HEADLINE: Rebuilding Our Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Return of the Killer Trade Deficit'' (editorial, Aug. 16): 
Tinker with trade imbalances all you like, but as long as we identify ourselves as a market economy, we will continue to leak dollars at an alarming rate. Markets make nothing. Just look around and ask yourself a simple question: What products do Americans make that you really want to buy or own? See if you can list five.
Once we admit that our market economy has failed us, maybe we can address our trade deficits. Sound fiscal policies can encourage certain industries and commercial sectors to grow by using a progressive tax system, and it's far more productive than imposing tariffs and sanctions.
If we are to survive without the bread lines and the mass migrations of the 1930s, we will need a government willing to spend deficit monies to encourage job creation, new cottage industries and entrepreneurs who hunger for new opportunities. We need the resolve to face the hard choices and long hours it will take to rebuild our economy.

HEADLINE: Travel Plans, But Frugality Comes Along For the Ride

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Vacations have become a luxury for many Americans trying to make ends meet in this economic downturn, but there are signs that people are slowly, even timidly, on the move again.
Families who postponed trips last year are making modest vacation plans, travel agents say. And business owners or executives who felt it was insensitive to travel as they cut costs and laid off workers are again making plans to get away, leisure industry experts added.
Stacy H. Small, president of Elite Travel International, said at least half of her clients who were business owners cut back last year. ''I had a lot of clients say 'I just don't feel right,' '' she said. This year, nearly all have returned.
The pent-up demand is starting to filter through, though it is more a trickle than a flood. With it, analysts said, comes a new level of austerity as vacationers search for frugal ways to get away by juggling their finances, taking shorter trips and even staying with relatives. 
The auto group AAA says it expects 34.4 million people to travel at least 50 miles from home this Labor Day weekend, up nearly 10 percent from 2009, a forecast based on an improved economy and lower gasoline prices.
People are traveling with ''one hand firmly clasped to their wallets,'' said Henry Harteveldt, a market researcher for Forrester Research. ''The comments I get are that generally business is better, but no one is popping Champagne corks,'' he said.
In response, hotels, cruise lines and other travel-related businesses are discounting rooms, advertising reward programs and adding incentives, like the Cape Cod innkeepers who threw in a whale-watching excursion with a four-night stay, or the Las Vegas hotel that included a spa treatment with a room reservation.
Lawrence J. Kordasiewicz, a 59-year-old retired teacher, and his wife found ways to cut costs on their trip to Cap Cod. They shared the driving with another couple and stayed fewer nights at the Honeysuckle Hill Bed and Breakfast, where he said a generous breakfast meant they did not have to eat again until dinner.
The cost of vacation travel can vary greatly -- a vacation can be anything from a car trip to a campground to a condo rental to a lengthy stay in a luxury hotel.
One industry organization, the U.S. Travel Association, forecasts that spending on leisure travel will increase to $519.6 billion this year in the United States, from around $489 billion in 2009.
With couples like the Kordasiewiczs taking advantage of incentives like free breakfast, restaurants and shopkeepers selling items like T-shirts, taffy and jewelry say travelers seem to be thinking twice before opening their wallets, if they do at all.
''They are coming in the door more,'' said Belinda Schmitt, the manager of Guertin Brothers Jewelers on Main Street in Hyannis on Cape Cod. ''But I am finding that tourists are not interested in buying jewelry as much. We have started carrying jewelry that can maybe more meet the needs of people on a tighter budget.''
For some, worries about tighter finances can lead to last-minute changes in travel plans.
Jacqueline Kimbrell, a former bank employee in Phoenix who has been unemployed since 2009, had planned a family vacation to Sea World in San Diego and even picked out an airline and a hotel.
''I thought O.K., what if one of the kids gets sick and we get a doctor bill?'' said Mrs. Kimbrell, who has a daughter with a nut allergy.
So instead of spending $1,000 on a short trip to San Diego, she, her husband, Keith, who is a landscaper, and their children bought supplies, packed up a tent and went camping. The cost: about $300. ''You find a spot, you put up your gear, and you go,'' Mrs. Kimbrell said.
The National Park Service expects about 285 million visitors this year, and visitor numbers at parks like Yellowstone, Yosemite and Death Valley are running above levels a year ago.
''We usually see an uptick in visitation when times are tough,'' a spokesman for the park service, Jeffrey Olson, said.
Analysts said hotel revenue and occupancy were rising, albeit slowly. Smith Travel Research said hotel revenue this year through July was $58 billion, up from $55 billion in the same period of 2009. About 592 million rooms were booked through July, compared with 552 million a year ago, the research firm said.
Hotels are luring travelers with free offers -- like an extra night, a meal or a gift -- instead of cutting prices. The additional night's stay can help increase ancillary spending.
Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., offered two nights free for five nights booked in 2009 in response to the downturn, but this year did not need to continue the promotions. Taylor Cole, a spokeswoman for Hotels.com, said some packages of four nights even included a free camera.
Hotels in Las Vegas have added incentives like spa treatments and tickets to shows to attract visitors. The city's convention and visitors bureau said visitor numbers were up 4.3 percent in June, to 3.1 million. Still occupancy rates declined 2.4 percent that month on an annual basis as room inventory grew
Matthew Jacob, a senior analyst for Majestic Research, said an important hotel indicator that measured revenue per available room was on track to post an increase of at least 5 percent this year after a 16 percent decline in 2009.
Another shift, analysts said, is that many vacationers are avoiding airlines because of the higher costs. One beneficiary has been Amtrak, which said that third-quarter sales for its vacation packages were up 51 percent from a year ago.
And cruise lines are reporting stronger bookings for the second half of the year after introducing special fares and other incentives, according to the Cruise Lines International Association.
Jill Rosenberg, manager of executive and group travel services for AAA, said more people were inquiring about last-minute discounts on cruise ships. ''They didn't go away last summer because everything was doom and gloom,'' Ms. Rosenberg said. Now, she added, ''as much as things are bad, they are not getting worse.''
On Cape Cod, Freddy Riley, who runs the Honeysuckle Hill Bed and Breakfast with his wife, Ruth, has noticed that guests have changed their habits.
More are requesting shorter stays, he said, and are eating picnic-style on the porch or using the inn's barbecue to grill their own meals.
And then there is the free alcohol. Mr. Riley has watched the whiskey, aperitifs and wines that he sets aside for guests drain away more quickly.
''Obviously it cuts into the bottom line,'' he said. ''But I would rather have all of my bedrooms full and people having a glass or three of wine, than the rooms not full.''

HEADLINE: Group Is Accused on Tax Exemption

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Democrats are charging that commercials financed by an increasingly prominent conservative foundation with ties to the Tea Party violate the foundation's tax-exempt status. 
In a complaint filed this week with the Internal Revenue Service, lawyers for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee charged that the group, the Americans for Prosperity Foundation, has been running advertisements in Kansas, Missouri and Michigan that are inherently ''political in nature,'' contravening a ban under federal tax law. A copy of the complaint was provided to The New York Times.
The foundation, which has just begun a $1.4 million ad campaign criticizing the economic policies in Washington as ''wasteful spending,'' has become a vocal critic of Democratic policies and drew a rebuke this month from President Obama.
Nonprofit groups like the foundation, which falls under section 501(c)3 of the tax code, are forbidden from participating in ''any political campaign on behalf of or in opposition to a candidate.'' They may, however, seek to educate voters or conduct broader get-out-the-vote drives ''if conducted in a nonpartisan manner,'' the I.R.S. says.
The group's tax-exempt status is crucial because it allows donors to take an income-tax deduction. Americans for Prosperity, which called the complaint without merit, said it had raised money from 70,000 individual donors.
The Democrats' complaint cites four political advertisements that the group has been running. The ads do not name specific politicians, but they mount a broad attack on federal policies and initiatives like the ''pork barrel'' spending in the $862 billion stimulus plan and the new health care law, which the group says has imposed unfair burdens on small business owners.
Congress divided along sharp partisan lines in passing those bills, and across the nation, Republicans are framing their campaigns around their party's opposition to both measures. That makes the advertisements attacking the bills political in nature, Democrats argue.
Urging that the foundation be stripped of its tax-exempt status, the Democrats also argued that the spots piggyback on commercials paid for by a sister group, the Americans for Prosperity, which directly attack Democratic candidates in four districts by name. The Democrats charge that the foundation's advertisements, particularly in coordination with the other ads, have made the Americans for Prosperity Foundation a de facto political action group in violation of the federal tax code.
Complaints from political parties that their rivals are violating the tax code are not uncommon, and the line between overt political campaigning and ''voter education'' under the law is notoriously fuzzy.
Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, said the Democrats were going to the I.R.S. because they ''are scared of the impact A.F.P. is making.''
''Americans for Prosperity's TV ads are protected by the First Amendment,'' he added. ''While we have not even seen a copy of the complaint, we are confident that it is without merit.''
The I.R.S. declined to comment.

HEADLINE: How Bond Funds Can Swing

BYLINE: By CARL RICHARDS

 BODY:
Carl Richards is a certified financial planner and the founder of Prasada Capital.
Most of us invest in bonds or bond mutual funds to keep our principal safe and to earn a bit of income. People think bonds are safe because when you buy an individual bond, like a U.S. government bond, you have a stated interest rate and a known maturity. In other words, you know exactly what income you will earn and exactly when you will get your principal back, much like a certificate of deposit at a bank that is backed by the F.D.I.C.
(I know bonds are ultimately much more complex than that, but for the sake of making a very narrow point, I am going to limit the discussion to U.S. government bonds and assume zero default risk.) 
In search of safety, investors have poured money into bond funds, and bond funds are a different animal than an individual bond. Because the fund owns hundreds of individual bonds, as a shareholder in the fund you don't have a known interest rate or a known maturity date. What you do have is an average interest rate and average maturity for all the bonds in the fund.
It seems like a subtle difference, but it becomes very important when interest rates change.
When interest rates go up, the value of a bond will go down. If you own an individual bond you will see that difference in the value of the bond on your monthly statement, but you will keep getting the promised interest and know that all you have to do is hold the bond until it matures to get your principal back.
But if you own a bond fund and interest rates go up, it's another story entirely. Just like the individual bond, you still see a decline on your monthly statement. This time, however, you don't know exactly what interest rate you will receive and you don't know when you will get your principal back.
It is this potential to see your bond fund go down in value, sometimes dramatically, that I think people have forgotten. The key to understanding the impact a change in interest will have on your bond fund is in finding out the duration of the bonds the fund tends to buy. In simple terms, duration turns out to be a measure of the fund's (or an individual bond's) sensitivity to a change in interest rates. For every 1 percentage point change in interest rates, the value of the fund will change by the amount of the duration. So if your fund holds bonds with an average duration of eight years, and interest rates go up by 1 percentage point, the value of your fund will drop by 8 percent.
Watching your monthly statement decline by 5, 10 or 15 percent is not what most people have in mind when investing in bond funds for safety. But it is a real possibility.
With money market funds paying almost nothing, C.D. rates in the toilet and everyone scared of the stock market, people are looking for higher yields (and safety too). The issue is that one of the ways to get more yield is to hold longer-term bonds. A longer-term bond means longer average duration. And longer duration means huge risk if interest rates go up.
While this is not a prediction that interest rates are going up (although it is hard to imagine them going much lower), it is a warning that you need at least to understand the risk you might be taking when you are trying to be safe. Take a look at the duration of the funds you own and recognize that the yield you are getting won't mean much if you find yourself with 10 or 15 percent less money.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Birthrate Is Lowest In a Century

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The United States birthrate has fallen to its lowest level in at least a century as many people apparently decided they could not afford more mouths to feed.
The birthrate dropped for the second year in a row since the recession began in 2007. Births fell 2.6 percent last year even as the population grew, numbers released Friday by the National Center for Health Statistics show. 
''It's a good-sized decline for one year,'' said Stephanie Ventura, the demographer who oversaw the report. ''Every month is showing a decline from the year before.''
The birthrate, which takes into account changes in the population, fell to 13.5 births for every 1,000 people last year. That is down from 14.3 in 2007 and way down from 30 in 1909, when it was common to have big families.
The situation is a striking turnabout from 2007, when more babies were born in the United States than in any other year in the nation's history. The recession began that fall, dragging down stocks, jobs and births.
''When the economy is bad and people are uncomfortable about their financial future, they tend to postpone having children,'' said Andrew Cherlin, a sociology professor at Johns Hopkins University. ''We saw that in the Great Depression the 1930s, and we're seeing that in the Great Recession today.''
''It could take a few years to turn this around,'' he added.
The birthrate dipped below 20 per 1,000 people in 1932 and did not rise above that level until the early 1940s. Recent recessions, in 1981-82, 1990-91 and 2001, all were followed by small dips in the birthrate, according to the agency's figures.
The Great Recession ''is definitely a deterrent'' to people having more children, said Dr. Michael Cabbad, chief of maternal health at the Brooklyn Hospital Center, where births declined to about 2,500 last year from about 2,800 in 2008.
Even Dr. Cabbad's son said he would like to have more children ''if his business plan works out.''
Nearly half of low- and middle-income women surveyed a year ago by the Guttmacher Institute said they wanted to delay pregnancy or limit the number of children they have because of money concerns. Half of those women also said the recession made them more focused on contraceptive use. Guttmacher researches reproductive health issues.
Besides finances, experts said a decline in immigration to the United States might also be pushing births down.
The new United States report is a rough count of births from states. It estimates there were 4,136,000 births in 2009, down from a year ago's estimate of 4,247,000 in 2008 and more than 4.3 million in 2007.

PERSON: Daniel P. Davison 

HEADLINE: Daniel Davison, 85, Banker Who Revitalized U.S. Trust

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Daniel P. Davison, a self-described patrician banker and avid yachtsman who took the helm of the august, but slipping, United States Trust Company in 1979 and revived it by riveting its attention on the very rich, died on Wednesday at his family's home, Peacock Point, on Long Island in Locust Valley. He was 85.
The cause was pancreatic cancer, his wife, Katusha, said. 
In later years Mr. Davison had prominent positions at Christie's, the Burlington Northern Railroad and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. But it was at United States Trust, the oldest trust company in the United States, that he made his deepest mark.
Mr. Davison's expressed willingness to walk the dogs of his wealthiest clients was underlined by a statue he commissioned for the company's headquarters in Manhattan depicting him doing exactly that. He meanwhile jettisoned corporate and overseas businesses and slashed costs, including those for tea carts and the company's famously elaborate sprays of flowers.
''We spent between $15,000 and $20,000 a year on flowers,'' he said in an interview with The New York Times in 1980 as he was initiating his economizing. ''That's half a cent a share.''
Mr. Davison divided the firm's clients into three groups: those with assets of more than $2 million, whom he termed first class; those with assets of $300,000 to $2 million, the middle class; and those with assets of less than $300,000, the ''poor.'' Only those in the top tier could hope for a banker to walk their pet poodles.
In a magazine advertisement, United States Trust went so far as to call its richest customers, with tongue in cheek, ''underprivileged.'' These included Whitneys and Pratts, whose forebears had been partners of John D. Rockefeller.
''They are asked to fit themselves to the bank's personal services,'' the ad said. ''Instead of the right way around.''
It all worked. When Mr. Davison took over United States Trust, it had a market capitalization of about $40 million. Charles Schwab, the discount brokerage, bought the company in 2000 for $2.7 billion. In 2006, Bank of America bought it for $3.3 billion. It is now called U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management.
The United States Trust Company was founded in 1853, but the financial lineage of Mr. Davison's family goes back even further. A distant relative, George Peabody, founded a banking firm in the 1830s that later merged with the firm of Junius Spencer Morgan, the father of J. P. Morgan.
Mr. Davison went to work at J. P. Morgan & Company in 1955, making him the fifth generation of his family to work at the Morgan bank. His grandfather, Henry, had been a senior partner, one of J. P. Morgan's closest confidants.
Daniel Davison joked to The Times that his family had ''been wage slaves for the Morgans for years.'' Several news reports said Mr. Davison joined United States Trust only after being passed over for the top job at Morgan, where he was executive vice president. He rose to president and then chairman before leaving the company in 1990 at the mandatory retirement age of 65.
Afterward, Mr. Davison went on to be chairman of the American unit of Christie's, the British auction house. His most dramatic moment came when the company was being investigated for colluding with Sotheby's to fix prices in the early 1990s.
Mr. Davison, a lawyer, flew to London and addressed the board on the meaning of antitrust violations in the United States. He then requested that all the board members sign a statement saying they understood what Mr. Davison was saying. Christie's ended up escaping criminal prosecution, but paid civil fines.
Mr. Davison was next chairman of the Burlington Northern Railroad at the time of its merger with the Santa Fe. He helped revise labor practices to eliminate firemen from diesel locomotives where they were not needed but still required under union contracts.
Daniel Pomeroy Davison was born in Manhattan on Jan. 30, 1925, into a family with deep roots in the American establishment. He was grandson of the Rev. Dr. Endicott Peabody, founder of the Groton School and its headmaster for 56 years. His father, F. Trubee Davison, was an assistant secretary of war in the Coolidge and Hoover administrations and president of the American Museum of Natural History for 18 years.
Mr. Davison attended Groton and flew a B-17 bomber in World War II for the Army Air Forces. He graduated in 1949 from Yale, where he was a member of Skull and Bones, the secret society. After graduating from Harvard Law School in 1952, he worked for three years as an associate at the law firm White & Case.
He joined J. P. Morgan and became secretary of the bank in 1957. In 1959, he worked on the legal aspects of its merger with the Guaranty Trust Company. He left the combined firm after 23 years, and said he had more fun afterward. His many charitable activities included 15 years as vice chairman of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where he was a leader in installing the popular Temple of Dendur.
Mr. Davison, whose passions were quail hunting and sailing, is survived by his wife of 57 years, the former Katusha Cheremeteff, whose father was a Russian count; his sons, Daniel Jr., George and Henry II; and seven grandchildren.
The statue of the dog walker came about in 1982 when the board of United States Trust decided to commission Edwina Sandys, Churchill's granddaughter, to create a sculpture somehow showing the eagerness of the firm's bankers to serve clients. Mr. Davison suggested walking the dog.
He added, ''You might as well make it me.''

HEADLINE: On Fifth Anniversary of Katrina, Signs of Healing in New Orleans

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

 BODY:
NEW ORLEANS -- This city, not that long ago, appeared to be lost. Only five years have passed since corpses were floating through the streets, since hundreds of thousands of survivors sat in hotel rooms and shelters and the homes of relatives, learning from news footage that they were among the ranks of the homeless.
For most of the last year, in many parts of the city, the waters finally seemed to be receding.
In November, a federal judge ruled that much of the flooding after Hurricane Katrina was a result of the negligence of the Army Corps of Engineers, vindicating New Orleanians, who had hammered this gospel for four years. In January, the federal government cleared the way for nearly half a billion dollars in reimbursement for the city's main public hospital, an acceleration of funds that led to the announcement this week that nearly $2 billion more would be coming in a lump-sum settlement for city schools. 
The end of Mayor C. Ray Nagin's second term in May marked the departure of the last member of the Katrina triumvirate, following former Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco and former President George W. Bush. Mr. Nagin's successor, Mitch Landrieu, won election by a convincing margin, and immediately requested a federal overhaul of the city's deeply troubled Police Department.
And of course the Saints. It is nearly impossible to overstate the impact of those delirious few weeks around Super Bowl Sunday. The victory in February was, as many here say, the ''anti-Katrina.''
Then came the summer of the spill, a new jolt of anxiety and fear, and a discovery, for many New Orleanians, of just how draining the last five years had been.
''I don't think the reservoir had been filled yet and now you're hit again,'' said the Rev. Vien Nguyen, an energetic leader in the city's Vietnamese community who was reassigned from his parish this summer for a quieter job in the church tribunal at the office of the archdiocese. ''You can run on fumes, but after a while they run out.''
It has been a week of special television retrospectives, official visits and expert panels, optimistic pronouncements and skeptical caveats. President Obama is scheduled to be in town on Sunday, and a host of cabinet officials are coming throughout the week. The city itself has announced a subdued ceremony on Sunday night, including a tolling of the bells of St. Louis Cathedral and a candlelight vigil for the dead.
All of this has prompted mixed feelings among residents, who are both tired of the yearly ritual of the national news media and concerned that the rest of the country has moved on. Besides, there is work to be done.
The city is largely optimistic, and with good reason. A master plan has finally been adopted, and the mayor recently announced a list of long-stalled recovery projects. The city's large-scale experiment in urban education is progressing -- nearly two-thirds of the public school students attend charter schools, the highest percentage in the country -- and federal, state and local officials have found a way to keep financing a widely praised network of community health clinics. But much of the news depends on where you are standing.
Entrepreneurs are starting businesses here at a rate far higher than the national average, and more restaurants are open now than before the storm. Meanwhile, large areas of the city still lack a supermarket.
A Balancing Act
Of all the indicators, two numbers, which are directly related, stand out. According to the Greater New Orleans Community Data Center, a nonprofit research group, more than 50,000 of the city's houses -- about 27 percent -- remain vacant, the highest proportion of any city in the country. And there are roughly 100,000 people who have not returned since the storm.
From the first year, the city has had to navigate a natural tension between the rights of the returned and the rights of the displaced. Those who have come back to streets of decaying houses and overgrown lawns want to see their neighborhoods thrive again. Those who have not come back -- and plan to -- often say they need more time and resources to repair their homes. That balance is only growing more complicated as the years pass and the federal rebuilding money dwindles.
The city's current population remains a matter of debate, though the most commonly used estimate is 355,000, around three-fourths of the population before the storm, as of July of last year. There is little reliable information about the displaced, who inhabit a sort of shadow city; it is not even known how many want to return. They are staying in Las Vegas or Atlanta or Baton Rouge, staying at a sister's or a brother's, staying in abandoned houses in town. They have settled down elsewhere, attracted by easier lives, or they have been stranded by New Orleans' drastically higher post-storm rents, the dearth of subsidized housing or the still-broken support networks of extended family.
Rebuilding Neighborhoods
Those who returned found a void of local leadership and set out to rebuild the city from the ground up. The rebound has not been citywide but piecemeal, neighborhood by neighborhood, from Lakeview to Broadmoor to Holy Cross, fueled by newly formed associations and old social clubs, energized residents and out-of-state volunteers, idealists and handymen. Many have become staunch advocates for their corners of the city, collecting local data, organizing committees and even, in the case of the Vietnamese community, drawing up their own local master plan.
A study by the Brookings Institution and the Community Data Center found that New Orleanians have become much more likely than other Americans to attend a public meeting. It also found that they are much less likely to feel that most people can be trusted.
Much of the city's organic recovery took place in defiance of an engineered, top-down rebuilding plan that was proposed in those first few months after the storm, prompting a dispute that has never been resolved. Those who proposed a smaller city to match a smaller population, and one concentrated on higher ground, view that period as a missed opportunity, looking at the current problems as reminders of the virtues of consolidation.
''That you would end up with a major blight problem was absolutely predictable,'' said Janet R. Howard, executive director of the Bureau of Governmental Research, a nonprofit advisory group here. ''You come to a point where you have to get beyond the political question to the actual question.''
She attributed the failure of such a plan, in part, to Washington's unwillingness to finance a major redesign with enough money to buy out homeowners in large sections of the city.
But the disillusionment goes both ways. Residents in neighborhoods outside of the center, like Gentilly, New Orleans East and the Lower Ninth Ward, still remember in anger that decisions were being made about the future of the city by those who had been able to return quickly -- white people, for the most part -- without the participation of the citizens whose neighborhoods would be most drastically affected, if not eliminated altogether. They remember learning, while still scattered around the country, that they would have four months under the proposal to defend the very existence of their neighborhoods. For many, the anger of that period is what led to the robust civic engagement that the city now celebrates. And it has not gone away.
''When you're sleeping thinking everything's O.K., they're up and they're planning,'' said Pearl Cantrell, 62, a resident of New Orleans East. ''We've got to sleep in shifts.''
This month, Mr. Landrieu arranged a meeting in the eastern part of the city, a relatively new area of ranch house subdivisions that was home to much of the city's black middle class and was deluged after Katrina. The east has felt neglected since the storm -- ''economic sanctions,'' Ms. Cantrell said -- and residents arrived by the hundreds to express their concerns.
Some Hard Truths
Among the immediate demands was a solution to the area's widespread blight, the abandoned houses and untamed lawns on block after block. It has been five years, people at the meeting said. It is past time to starting repossessing vacant houses, so these neighborhoods can move on.
''You can't feel sorry no more,'' said Aaron Broussard, who has become a dedicated evangelist for his subdivision in a far eastern section of the city. ''That attitude is what's keeping this city in a blight situation.''
Mr. Broussard, 47, rebuilt a few days at a time, raiding his savings, rolling over his and his wife's 401(k)s and taking out a loan. He understands the hardships people are facing in returning, he said. He faced them, too. But ''it's time to say: 'All right. You had your time.' ''
That is legally the case for many. Road Home, the state-run, federally financed program that gave out grants to those whose homes had been damaged or destroyed, is based on a contract. A homeowner who chose to use the grant to rebuild in the city had three years to do so (many others sold their homes to the state, which is charged with keeping them in shape or handing them to the city for redevelopment). Those covenants began expiring this year, yet, to the frustration of residents across the city, thousands of properties have not shown any sign of rebuilding progress.
Many of these homeowners are not planning to return, their decaying properties left to hold back neighborhoods that are struggling to recover.
This week the mayor's office announced an aggressive series of measures, including fines and demolition, intended to tackle the city's widespread blight.
But there are countless others who received a sum from the Road Home program that fell far short of their rebuilding estimates, who were bilked of tens of thousands of dollars by smooth-talking contractors or who had an experience like that of 59-year-old Michael Dupont. Mr. Dupont could not prove that his family owned the house in which he grew up and in which his mother spent her 49 years of marriage, a house that his great-grandfather bought in the 1920s.
''We ain't never been nobody sticking out our hand for government assistance,'' said Mr. Dupont, a former truck driver. ''But now that we need a little help, they're slapping us down.''
The Duponts, who were planning to demolish the house and rebuild in its place, received no Road Home money at all because of the title problem. This year, they discovered, to their surprise, that the city had demolished the house. Mr. Dupont, whose mother is living in a nursing home in a nearby city and waiting to return, was sent a $30,000 bill for the work.
Nonprofit groups like the Greater New Orleans Fair Housing Action Center, which is helping Mr. Dupont, tick off long lists of Katrina evacuees who have faced similar problems. The center has sued the state and federal agencies, claiming the entire Road Home grant-calculating formula was discriminatory against blacks.
A judge ruled this summer that the case likely had merit. But he said that he did not have jurisdiction to order retroactive relief, especially after nearly $9 billion had already been handed out. Only 3,000 potential grant recipients remain out of roughly 130,000, and now they are in limbo as the litigation proceeds.
Last year, the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development created a $20 million program in which nonprofit organizations are enlisted to work with those who have had a difficult time returning, a way of providing additional resources without duplicating benefits. The state began handing out additional compensation grants to poor homeowners as well. But officials acknowledge the money is not infinite.
''The program was never designed to make people whole,'' said Robin Keegan, the director of Louisiana's office of community development, which oversees the Road Home program. ''That would have taken a lot more money. Hard decisions had to be made. It's very hard to hear that message now.''
In the office in his newly refurbished home in the Lower Ninth Ward, Charles Brimmer, a 61-year-old building contractor, considered the hard truths. There are many who want to return and they should be able to come back, he said. But it is difficult at this point to see how they will be able to make it.
Mr. Brimmer now mows the empty lots around his house for free. He is not sure how long he will keep doing that.
He leaned back in his chair and recalled the morning after the storm, five years ago, when he and a dozen family members stayed at the house of his father-in-law, a neighborhood man by the name of Fats Domino.
''Everything you ever owned was washed away in two hours,'' Mr. Brimmer said. ''Everything tangible is gone. All you have left is a vivid memory. And over time that goes away, too.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Has Potent Ally On Wall St.

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU

 BODY:
At a black-tie dinner in April, a politically influential hedge fund manager named Paul Singer offered a blistering critique of the ''terrible path'' he said Washington politicians were charting on economic issues.
Mr. Singer, professorial and soft-spoken, used a gathering of business and government leaders at the conservative Manhattan Institute to lash out at ''indiscriminate attacks by political leaders against anything that moves in the world of finance.'' Government efforts to ''take over and run'' the economy through more regulations, he warned, threatened to ruin the United States' standing as the world leader in finance.
As the head of a $17 billion hedge fund, Mr. Singer, a self-described Barry Goldwater conservative who is 66, is using his financial might to try to change those policies. He has become one of the biggest bankrollers of Republican causes, giving more than $4 million of his money and raising millions more through fund-raisers he hosts for like-minded candidates who often share his distaste for what they view as governmental over-meddling in the financial industry. 
The same day in June that the House gave final approval to the sweeping overhaul of financial regulations, Mr. Singer had a fund-raiser at his Central Park West apartment, netting more than $1 million for seven Republican Senate candidates who had opposed the bill. Mr. Singer and others affiliated with his firm, Elliott Management, are collectively the top source of contributions to the National Republican Senatorial Committee, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which collates campaign finance data.
With economic problems weighing heavily as the November elections approach, the divide between Republicans and Democrats in their attitudes toward Wall Street and the economy promises to be a recurring point of attack for both parties, and Mr. Singer is using his money to push conservative causes.
He is not new to fund-raising -- he raised money for George W. Bush, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth and, surprisingly, gay rights initiatives -- but his prominence has risen lately with his donations as he and other conservatives tap into a rising tide of anger on Wall Street toward Washington. His largess reflects a recent surge in Wall Street money to Republicans.
Generally Democrats have been favored by Wall Street, getting 70 percent of donations from the securities and investment sector just 18 months ago. But by the time Congress took up the financial regulations legislation this June, Republicans were getting 68 percent of the donations, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group.
In the 2010 election cycle, financial industry donors, from brokers to real estate interests, have contributed $180 million to both Republican and Democratic Congressional candidates, the analysis showed.
Dave Levinthal, a spokesman for the center, said: ''What this says is that Wall Street is awfully angry with Democrats and sees Republicans as a better bet. They're making an investment in the prospect of a Republican-controlled Congress that they perceive to be more favorable toward their bottom line.''
For Democrats, the November elections will test their ability to focus public attention away from the country's poor economy and toward the eye-popping sums that Wall Street is raising for Republicans. Already, Democrats are using the issue in a handful of hotly contested races because they believe many voters are even angrier with Wall Street than they are with Washington.
In Washington State, for instance, a spot broadcast this month by Senator Patty Murray, a Democrat seeking re-election, attacks her Republican opponent, Dino Rossi, as ''the best friend Wall Street and big banks can buy.''
Ms. Murray -- who has taken significant sums from the financial sector herself -- is seeking to tie her opponent's Wall Street contributions to his call for repealing the toughened financial regulations. Her commercial cites two fund-raisers in particular, including a June 30 event hosted by Mr. Singer that earned the Rossi campaign nearly $135,000, with many executives at his Elliott Management fund contributing personal checks.
Republicans maintain that the strategy has fallen flat.
''The Democrats have tried to make this anti-business rhetoric an attack point, but I haven't seen any evidence that it's resonated at all,'' said Brian Walsh, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
In the meantime, Mr. Singer has continued writing checks.
In April, he gave $500,000 to the Republican Governors Association, along with smaller donations this election cycle to more than two dozen other conservative campaigns.
At his June fund-raiser, Mr. Singer voiced frustration not only over financial policies in Washington, but also on national security and foreign policy, particularly what he saw as the Obama administration's inadequate support for Israel, according to a friend at the fund-raiser who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not comfortable speaking publicly about his guarded associate.
But very quietly, Mr. Singer has also given significant sums to personal causes that run counter to the agenda of many conservatives.
With no public disclosure, Mr. Singer has given more than $4.2 million to groups supporting gay rights and same-sex marriage, like the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Action Fund, associates said.
''Several of Paul's family and friends are gay activists, and he has learned a lot from their work over the years,'' said Myron Kaplan, a longtime friend and lawyer for Mr. Singer. ''He supports the work of these groups. He also believes the Republican Party is a big tent, and he respects the different perspectives within the party on this issue.''
Mr. Singer plans to hold a fund-raiser next month at his Manhattan apartment in support of the California lawsuit opposing Proposition 8, which banned gay marriage. Ken Mehlman, a former top Republican official who said this week that he was gay, will be one of the co-hosts.
Mr. Singer is guarded about his political and business dealings. He declined requests for an interview for this article, as he rarely gives interviews, and he has turned down several invitations to be honored for his philanthropy. He made news this week for trying to keep secret the internal positions of his hedge fund, going to court to try to identify the source of a leak of the firm's investment newsletter.
Still, his visibility has grown, beginning in 2007 as a fund-raiser for Mr. Giuliani's presidential campaign. Mr. Singer, who lent the former New York City mayor his jet for the campaign, was drawn into controversy when he was identified as the donor who indirectly contributed $175,000 to a California ballot initiative that Democrats saw as a way of tilting the state's electoral votes toward Republicans in 2008.
His role at the Manhattan Institute -- he became its chairman in 2008 -- has also given him more visibility.
The April black-tie event that Mr. Singer hosted netted a record $1.4 million for the institute.
But Mr. Singer, ever the fund-raiser, could not resist another pitch for more money even as dinner was about to be served. ''Have no fear,'' he told his guests. ''We will accept checks or credit cards at the door, jewelry, brightly colored bits of glass.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about the political donations of Paul Singer, a hedge fund manager, described imprecisely the source of significant contributions to the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Mr. Singer and others affiliated with his firm, Elliott Management, are collectively the top source of contributions to the committee, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which collates campaign finance data. The hedge fund itself is not the committee's biggest source of money. (Under campaign finance rules, the firm cannot make such contributions.)

HEADLINE: Drought Cuts Yields, but Rising Prices Help Russia's Corporate Farms

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Early reports from Russia's harvest indicate that yields of wheat and barley are down sharply, as predicted after a major drought here this summer that has helped send global wheat prices up sharply since June.
Despite the implications for Russian consumers and the global market, the crop failures may translate to a relatively minimal financial effect on the country's agricultural companies, which before the drought were just catching their stride after an overhaul of Soviet-era collective farms. The higher prices, in fact, made one company profitable, according to an earnings report released Friday.
Nationally, the harvest has been diminished by more than 30 percent, according to the ministry of agriculture. Russia will certainly produce less grain than it consumes for the first time since 2004, and may import wheat for the first time in a decade. Last year it was the world's third-largest wheat exporter, behind the United States and Canada.
On Friday, wheat for delivery in December was trading on the Chicago Board of Trade for $6.95 a bushel -- up more than 40 percent from its low in June before the drought but down from its high of $8.68 on Aug. 6 after Russian announced an export ban. On Russia's domestic market it is now selling at about $6.20 a bushel. 
Expressing anger over the higher bread prices in Russia that have accompanied the rise in grain, Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin said Friday, ''Someone is simply cashing in on the circumstances.'' Prosecutors have recently raided bakeries in Moscow on accusations of price gouging.
A bad harvest used to mean heads would roll in the Communist Party. But the spread of corporate farming in Russia in recent years now means investment portfolios are on the line, instead.
The drought ''has been a watershed event for the industry,'' Michael Schneyderman, chief financial officer for Black Earth Farming, an operator of fields in central Russia that is listed on the Stockholm stock exchange, said in a telephone interview Friday, after the company released second-quarter earnings showing a profit of $1.4 million.
That profit, coming amid the drought, was in contrast to the company's persistent losses of the last few years. ''It's a silver lining,'' Mr. Schneyderman said.
With the harvest about half over, most investor-financed farming operations that took over from the collective farms over the last decade appear to be poised to lose some money. Mikhail V. Krasnoperov, an analyst at Troika Dialog bank, said Russian farmers would collectively earn about $1 billion less than they expected in the spring, according to a calculation based on the lower harvest forecast and factoring in current wheat prices.
Yet, of perhaps longer-term importance for Russian agriculture, several of the largest private companies, including Black Earth, are saying that rising prices will more than make up for their yield losses from the drought.
Black Earth Farming reported Friday that yields of winter wheat, usually the most bountiful crop, fell to 1.9 metric tons per hectare, compared with 3.5 tons last year. But other crops, including sunflowers and soybeans, fared better.
Over all, Black Earth Farming says wheat prices are up 71 percent since spring, while yields are on average down 30 to 40 percent from forecasts before the drought.
''Whatever we've lost in the yield, we sincerely hope to compensate by way of rising price,'' Mr. Schneyderman, the chief financial officer, said.
In fact, shares of Razgulay, a grain producer listed on the Micex stock exchange in Moscow, rose by 23 percent in July. Shares in another Russian producer, Pava, rose 28 percent. Shares in Black Earth did not fare as well, rising 1.8 percent over the month ending Aug. 16, the height of the drought, as the company's fields are in the hardest-hit regions.
The stock activity, analysts say, shows that the market mechanisms that lured investors into the sector are for the most part working, despite efforts at price controls that included a ban on wheat exports announced by Mr. Putin in early August. Analysts say the ban, to remain in effect through Dec. 31, has been largely ineffectual in reducing domestic wheat prices -- pleasing farmers but driving angry officials, including Mr. Putin, to pursue other efforts to control potentially destabilizing food inflation.
Bread prices rose 16 percent from the beginning of July through mid-August, according to the Russian business newspaper Vedomosti. For Russians, particularly the poor or the elderly who recall the privations of the Soviet era, the price of bread is a deeply emotional issue. But analysts say the high domestic grain prices -- a root cause of the higher food prices -- will have the virtue of keeping the Russian grain producers afloat, and able to invest in next year's sowing.
Black Earth said in its filing Friday that it expected to fetch prices of $176 to $208 a metric ton from wheat from the 2010 harvest. By comparison, Russian domestic wheat prices had been languishing around $116 a metric ton before the drought.
Policies pursued here ripple far beyond Russia's borders, to countries in the Middle East that rely on wheat imports, now more expensive, as well as to American breadbasket states where rising prices are elevating the incomes of farmers. (In the United States and other developed countries, the price of grain is a relatively small cost component of processed foods.)
Russia is something of a wild card in global agriculture as it possesses the world's largest reserves of fertile but fallow fields, with vast potential to raise production.
After a series of downgrades this year, the Russian harvest is now forecast at 60 million to 63 million tons, compared with 97 million tons in 2009, according to the ministry of agriculture. So, it is already clear the harvest will fall short of internal demand for food and fodder of 73 million to 75 million tons of grain.
What remains uncertain is whether the government will disburse its roughly 9.6 million tons from state grain reserves this year, to largely cover the shortfall and dampen domestic prices, or hold onto some in the event of another bad harvest next year. If state reserves are withheld, Russian millers and livestock farmers would be compelled to import large quantities of grain for the first time since the late 1990s.
If the country becomes an importer, domestic grain prices will certainly remain roughly in the range of global prices, despite Mr. Putin's ban on exports, according to Ulyana O. Lenvalskaya, a consumer sector analyst at Renaissance Capital bank. Domestic producers like Black Earth will be able to match the prices charged by international grain traders.
The decision on the reserves, like so much else, is expected to rest on whether enough rain falls in the next few weeks to moisten the soil for winter-wheat sowing in central Russia. Rain would improve chances of a better harvest next year, and allow the government to release reserves over the winter.

HEADLINE: A Filibuster Fix

BYLINE: By NORMAN ORNSTEIN. 
Norman Ornstein is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a co-author of ''The Broken Branch: How Congress Is Failing America and How to Get It Back on Track.''

 BODY:
Washington
AFTER months of debate, Senate Democrats this summer broke a Republican filibuster against a bill to extend unemployment benefits. But the Republicans insisted on applying a technicality in the Senate rules that allowed for 30 more hours of floor time after a successful vote to end debate. As a result, the bill -- with its desperately needed and overdue benefits for more than 2 million unemployed Americans -- was pointlessly delayed a few days more.
The Senate, once the place for slow and careful deliberation, has been overtaken by a culture of obstructionism. The filibuster, once rare, is now so common that it has inverted majority rule, allowing the minority party to block, or at least delay, whatever legislation it wants to oppose. Without reform, the filibuster threatens to bring the Senate to a halt. 
It is easy to forget that the widespread use of the filibuster is a recent development. From the 1920s to the 1950s, the average was about one vote to end debate, also known as a cloture motion, a year; even in the 1960s, at the height of the civil rights debates, there were only about three a year.
The number of cloture motions jumped to three a month during the partisan battles of the 1990s. But it is the last decade that has seen the filibuster become a regular part of Senate life: there was about one cloture motion a week between 2000 and 2008, and in the current Congress there have been 117 -- more than two a week.
Even though there might be several motions for cloture for each filibuster, there clearly has been a remarkable increase in the use of what is meant to be the Congressional equivalent of a nuclear weapon.
Filibusters aren't just more numerous; they're more mundane, too. Consider an earlier bill to extend unemployment benefits, passed in late 2009. It faced two filibusters -- despite bipartisan backing and its eventual passage by a 98-0 margin. A bill that should have zipped through in a few days took four weeks, including seven days of floor debate. Or take the nomination of Judge Barbara Milano Keenan to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit: she, too, faced a filibuster, even though she was later confirmed 99 to 0.
Part of the problem lies with today's partisan culture, in which blocking the other party takes priority over passing legislation or confirming candidates to key positions. And part of the problem lies with changes in Senate practices during the 1970s, which allowed the minority to filibuster a piece of legislation without holding up other items of business.
But the biggest factor is the nature of the filibuster itself. Senate rules put the onus on the majority for ending a debate, regardless of how frivolous the filibuster might be.
If the majority leader wants to end a debate, he or she first calls for unanimous consent for cloture, basically a voice vote from all the senators present in the chamber. But if even one member of the filibustering minority is present to object to the motion, the majority leader has to hold a roll call vote. If the majority leader can't round up the necessary 60 votes, the debate continues.
Getting at least 60 senators on the floor several times a week is no mean feat given travel schedules, illnesses and campaign obligations. The most recent debate over extending unemployment benefits, for example, took so long in part because the death of Senator Robert Byrd, a Democrat from West Virginia, left the majority with only 59 votes for cloture. The filibuster was brought to an end only after West Virginia's governor appointed a replacement.
True, the filibuster has its benefits: it gives the minority party the power to block hasty legislation and force a debate on what it considers matters of national significance. So how can the Senate reform the filibuster to preserve its usefulness but prevent its abuse?
For starters, the Senate could replace the majority's responsibility to end debate with the minority's responsibility to keep it going. It would work like this: for the first four weeks of debate, the Senate would operate under the old rules, in which the majority has to find enough senators to vote for cloture. Once that time has elapsed, the debate would automatically end unless the minority could assemble 40 senators to continue it.
An even better step would be to return to the old ''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' model -- in which a filibuster means that the Senate has to stop everything and debate around the clock -- by allowing a motion requiring 40 votes to continue debate every three hours while the chamber is in continuous session. That way it is the minority that has to grab cots and mattresses and be prepared to take to the floor night and day to keep their filibuster alive.
Under such a rule, a sufficiently passionate minority could still preserve the Senate's traditions and force an extended debate on legislation. But frivolous and obstructionist misuse of the filibuster would be a thing of the past.

HEADLINE: Sluggish Economy Leads Intel To Cut 3rd-Quarter Guidance

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The chip maker Intel said Friday that it was cutting its sales forecast for the third quarter, evidence that a sluggish economy was putting a damper on the back-to-school shopping season. 
Intel is the world's biggest provider of microprocessors for PCs and a bellwether for the broader technology industry.
In a statement Friday, Intel said it was seeing ''weaker-than-expected demand for consumer PCs in mature markets,'' like the United States and Europe.
The warning comes a little more than a month after Intel reported its biggest quarterly profit in a decade. But those results were fueled by a rebound in technology spending at corporations, many of which held off replacing older computers during the recession.
Home computer purchases are another matter. Uncertainty about jobs is keeping consumer spending in check.
Intel said it now expected revenue of $10.8 billion to $11.2 billion in the third quarter, compared with a previous forecast of $11.2 billion to $12 billion.
Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected $11.5 billion.
Intel is scheduled to report results on Oct. 12 and plans to update its fourth-quarter and full-year outlook then.
Intel's downgrade of its guidance was not entirely a surprise. Many investors simply did not believe that Intel would be able to hit the higher numbers because of signals from other PC industry suppliers that PC sales were collapsing.
Those concerns were the main reason Intel's stock had fallen about 13 percent since Intel issued its original guidance on July 13.
After the company released its revised outlook, its shares rose 19 cents, or 1.05 percent, to $18.35.
Last week, the PC makers Dell and Hewlett-Packard also raised red flags about what was normally a robust season for sales.
Brian T. Gladden, Dell's chief financial officer, said that the back-to-school shopping season had been ''a little weaker than we would have expected.''

HEADLINE: Christie Fires Schools Chief For Grant Slip

BYLINE: By SHARON OTTERMAN

 BODY:
Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey fired his education commissioner on Friday, just days after the governor said a clerical error had cost the state a $400 million federal education grant.
The mistake in the grant application caused the state to forfeit almost five points in the competition, known as Race to the Top; the state lost out on any money by three points out of a possible 500. On Wednesday Mr. Christie defended his administration's actions, insisting that his education secretary, Bret D. Schundler, had provided the correct information to federal reviewers in an interview two weeks ago. The governor then went on to criticize the Obama administration for not accepting the revision.
But federal officials on Thursday released a video of the interview showing that Mr. Schundler and his staff had failed to produce the information when a reviewer requested it. Mr. Christie, asked in a radio interview on Thursday evening about the video, said he would be ''seriously disappointed'' if it turned out he had been misled. 
That evening, the governor's chief of staff, Richard H. Bagger, called Mr. Schundler to ask for his resignation, Mr. Schundler said in an interview on Friday afternoon. ''I said I know that I serve at the will of the governor, so if he would like me to leave I would leave.''
But Mr. Schundler said that on Friday morning he had asked Mr. Bagger if he could instead be fired, so he could collect unemployment benefits. He had been paid $141,000 a year in the job.
The firing shook a department that has been at the core of Mr. Christie's aggressive approach toward the state's bureaucracy since he took office in January. Among his early showdowns was a loud fight with the state's teachers' union over reductions in school financing, part of large, across-the-board cuts to balance the state budget. The appointment of Mr. Schundler, a former Jersey City mayor and a staunch supporter of charter schools and vouchers for private schooling, was itself a message from the governor.
But Mr. Schundler found himself at odds with the governor in May, when Mr. Christie overruled a compromise Mr. Schundler had negotiated with the teachers' union over matters related to the Race to the Top application. The governor ordered a quick rewriting of the application over the Memorial Day weekend, and the lack of union support for that final version actually cost the state more points than the clerical mistake that went unnoticed.
But it was the mistake -- the state submitted budget information for 2010 and 2011, rather than 2008 and 2009 -- that caught the spotlight, since it caused New Jersey to finish 11th in the competition, which had 10 winners.
In a televised news conference on Wednesday, Mr. Christie said he accepted blame for the error and no one would be fired for it. He asked for an apology from President Obama and his education secretary, Arne Duncan, because the reviewers had not been more flexible.
''Commissioner Schundler gave them, in the interview, the numbers for '08-'09,'' Mr. Christie said. ''But they still didn't give us the credit for the points.''
But the video, made available on the federal Education Department's Web site, shows Mr. Schundler and his team caught off guard by a request for the correct data. After 30 minutes of tense searching through paperwork, an assistant commissioner acknowledged the team could not produce it.
In a statement on Friday, the governor said he had ''ordered an end to Bret Schundler's service as New Jersey's education commissioner'' because he was ''extremely disappointed to learn that the videotape of the Race to the Top presentation was not consistent with the information provided to me by the New Jersey Department of Education and which I then conveyed to the people of New Jersey.''
Mr. Schundler said he had been upfront with the governor's office. ''Consistently, from before and after the press conference, I did not mislead the governor at all, I tried to correct an error,'' he said Friday night. ''The bottom line is rather than say 'I erred in my comments to the press,' he's firing me saying I gave him bad information. I gave him good information.''
But Mr. Christie's office disputed that, pointing to a letter Mr. Schundler wrote that day to Mr. Duncan in which he said he had ''confirmed verbally'' the missing information in the interview.
The governor's office said in a statement, ''We regret that Mr. Schundler continues to sully his own image by engaging in revisionist history.''
Mr. Schundler said earlier Friday that the administration had agreed to his request to be fired, because if he resigned, he would be ineligible for unemployment benefits. ''I do have mortgage payments, I do have a daughter who has just begun in college, I do have bills to pay,'' he said.
The governor's office depicted a slightly different version of events. ''Mr. Schundler indicated Thursday he would resign in the morning; this morning, he refused to sign the resignation letter and was subsequently terminated,'' Michael Drewniak, the governor's press secretary, said.
The firing comes at a time of shrinking budgets, teacher layoffs and a reduction of services and electives in many districts across the state, as well as a legal battle over the state's financing formula for low-income and minority students, said Patrick McGuinn, a political science professor at Drew University.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's decision to fire his education commissioner, Bret D. Schundler, after the governor said a clerical error cost the state a $400 million federal education grant misspelled the surname of Mr. Christie's press secretary. He is Michael Drewniak, not Drewnick.

HEADLINE: Where Dr. King Once Stood, Tea Party Claims His Mantle

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- It seems the ultimate thumb in the eye: that Glenn Beck would summon the Tea Party faithful to a rally on the anniversary of the March on Washington, and address them from the very place where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his ''I have a dream'' speech 47 years ago. After all, the Tea Party and its critics have been facing off for months over accusations of racism.
But many of the busloads of Tea Party activists expected in Washington this weekend do not see any irony or offense. In fact, they have come to see the Tea Party as the aggrieved -- its loosely affiliated members unfairly characterized, even persecuted, as extremists.
Eighteen months ago, many were moved to the streets by a belief that they had been not listened to by their representatives in Washington. (''How dare they ignore us?'' reads a sign often seen at Tea Party rallies.) Now, encouraged by Tea Party leaders and people like Mr. Beck and Andrew Breitbart, whose BigGovernment.com is a source of news for many Tea Party supporters, they have adopted the language of the civil rights movement to describe their cause. Their sense of persecution has become a galvanizing force. 
Consider the response last month when the N.A.A.C.P., the nation's oldest civil rights organization, called on Tea Party leaders to denounce racist elements in their ranks -- citing signs with racist slogans at Tea Party rallies.
Tea Party Patriots, the largest umbrella organization for thousands of local groups across the country, posted a petition on its Web site calling for the N.A.A.C.P. to revoke its resolution ''condemning the Tea Party movement as 'racist.' ''
''It is nothing less than 'hate speech' for the N.A.A.C.P. to be smearing us as 'racists' and 'bigots,' '' the petition declared. ''We believe, like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., in a colorblind, postracial society. And we believe that when an organization lies and resorts to desperate tactics of racial division and hatred, they should be publicly called on it.''
On his radio show, Mr. Beck said he had not intended to choose the anniversary for his ''Restoring Honor'' rally on Saturday but had since decided it was ''divine providence.''
Dr. King's dream, he told listeners, ''has been so corrupted.''
''Judge a man by the content of his character?'' he said. ''Character doesn't even matter in this country. It's time we picked back up the job.''
He later added: ''We are the people of the civil rights movement. We are the ones that must stand for civil and equal rights, justice, equal justice. Not special justice, not social justice. We are the inheritors and protectors of the civil rights movement. They are perverting it.''
It has become an article of faith among Tea Party groups that any racist signs at rallies -- ''Go back to Kenya,'' directed at President Obama, is just one example -- are carried by Democratic plants sent in to make the Tea Party look bad.
In March, when members of the Congressional Black Caucus accused protesters at a Tea Party rally against health care of spitting on them and shouting racist epithets, Tea Party leaders suggested that those episodes had not occurred, saying there was no video proof.
At a rally in Searchlight, Nev., a week later, Mr. Breitbart argued that black Democratic lawmakers had set out to provoke the protesters. When they did not make racist comments, Mr. Breitbart said, the Democrats simply accused them of doing so.
He looked into the crowd and said it proved that the Tea Party was not racist. ''I see black faces, Hispanic faces. I'm Jewish,'' he said. ''Shalom, Nevada!''
In response to the N.A.A.C.P. resolution last month, Mr. Breitbart claimed reverse racism. He publicized a video of an Agriculture Department official, Shirley Sherrod, saying that she had discriminated against a white farmer. The video turned out to be heavily edited -- in fact, Ms. Sherrod had helped the farmer and had actually been telling a longer story to make a point about the need for racial understanding.
Still, Tea Party leaders say they are outraged, as anyone would be, by accusations of racism: they do not see themselves that way.
FreedomWorks, a Washington advocacy group that has encouraged the growth of the Tea Party, is planning to take out full-page newspaper advertisements highlighting black, Hispanic and Jewish Tea Party members to make the point that the movement is diverse. It is also sponsoring a new documentary about black involvement in the cause.
Tea Party supporters argue that it is progressives who are fomenting racial division.
In a rally in April here at the National Mall, Deneen Borelli, a black conservative, told the crowd that Tea Party supporters were in an impossible position: ''If you are white they call you racist or a redneck. If you are black, they call you a token, a traitor, an Uncle Tom.''
Polls show that the movement has not attracted blacks proportionate to their representation in the larger population. And some Tea Party leaders acknowledge that.
FreedomWorks advises Tea Party leaders to put Hispanics and blacks on stage at rallies to show that the movement is not racist.
Alveda King, a niece of Dr. King, is scheduled to speak at Mr. Beck's rally, and many Tea Party supporters say this is evidence that they hold no racial animus.
Lloyd Marcus, a black singer who has performed on the cross-country tours of the Tea Party Express, often introduces himself by saying, ''I am not an African-American, I am a Lloyd Marcus American!''
In a letter posted Friday on the social networking Web site Tea Party Nation, Mr. Marcus wrote, ''Glenn Beck's values and principles are far more consistent with M.L.K.'s values than the black civil rights leaders who have sold their souls to the anti-God, anti-family and anti-America progressives for political power.'' He signed it, ''Lloyd Marcus, unhyphenated American.''
In the Tea Party's talk of states' rights, critics say they hear an echo of slavery, Jim Crow and George Wallace. Tea Party activists call that ridiculous: they do not want to take the country back to the discrimination of the past, they say, they just want the states to be able to block the federal mandate on health insurance.
Still, the government programs that many Tea Party supporters call unconstitutional are the ones that have helped many black people emerge from poverty and discrimination. It is not just that Rand Paul, the Republican nominee for Senate in Kentucky, said that he disagreed on principle with the provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that required business owners to serve blacks. It is that many Tea Party activists believe that laws establishing a minimum wage or the federal safety net are an improper expansion of federal power.
Critics rightly note that Dr. King spoke over and over of the need for this country to acknowledge its ''debt to the poor,'' calling for an ''economic bill of rights'' that would ''guarantee a job to all people who want to work and are able to work.'' In Mr. Beck's taxonomy, this would make him a Marxist.
Even if Tea Party members are right that any racist signs are those of mischief-makers, even if Glenn Beck had chosen any other Saturday to hold his rally, it would be hard to quiet the argument about the Tea Party and race.

HEADLINE: Thinking About Buying a Home? That's Not Such a Bad Thought

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
It's hard to read the headlines and not conclude that becoming a homeowner is a terrible idea.
This week, the National Association of Realtorsannounced that existing-home sales in July had fallen an astounding 25.5 percent from the previous year. Sure, there was a federal tax credit in place last summer. But with single-family home sales at their lowest level since 1995 and unemployment still stubbornly high, home prices may fall further.
In the meantime, millions of homeowners are still far underwater, and government programs to help them have fallen well short of their goals. More foreclosures are coming, casting a deeper shadow over home prices. So it's hardly surprising that the conventional wisdom says that home values will never again rise faster than inflation.
But as with stocks and the weather, it is dangerous to assume any certainty in the housing market. And by wallowing too much in the misery of others, people looking for a new place to live run the risk of thinking every home purchase will end in regret, at least financially. 
Many still could, if they buy in hard-hit areas where prices could fall further.
But a mortgage is still a form of long-term forced savings, after all. This is more important than ever, since fewer people have access to generous pensions than they did during the last big housing slump. A 401(k) or similar plan is no bargain, either, with its erratic returns and employer matches that come and go as the economic winds shift. Social Security is also likely to be less generous, and Medicare will probably cost more.
Besides, owning a home isn't just about what shows up on a net worth statement -- something that bears repeating after all the ''investing'' that people thought they were doing when buying homes over the last 10 or 15 years. Many of these more qualitative factors, from living free of a landlord's whim to having access to a good school district or retirement community, haven't changed and probably never will.
It is possible, as a homeowner, to make very little money but still buy plenty of happiness. So before you swear off real estate, reconsider a few of the basics.
WORST CASES Some buyers may rue the day in 2010 they bought their homes. They may end up like those who bought in 2006 and have lost their jobs. Now those people face the difficulty of moving to pursue employment elsewhere because they owe much more than their homes are worth.
Marke Hallowell and Allison Firmat, who are getting married next month, are well aware of the history. Yet they plan to put 5 percent or less down, using a fixed-rate mortgage backed by the Federal Housing Administration, once they find a condominium in southern Orange County, Calif. (They've already been outbid a few times.)
Ms. Firmat is not working, and Mr. Hallowell is a Web developer. Does he worry about mobility problems or making the payments in the event of a job loss, given that he's the sole breadwinner? ''We're getting such a good deal on interest rates that we could rent our place out,'' he said.
Mr. Hallowell and Ms. Firmat say they believe their approach is conservative, at least compared to what they might have done five years ago.
''Nothing is going to change the rate we will have,'' Mr. Hallowell said. ''Condos like the ones we're looking at now were unobtainable in the past, unless we went into something with a total balloon payment. There were times I was tempted, but never seriously.''
Indeed, many people who are buying at the moment are locking in mortgage rates of about 4.5 percent. A year ago, they might have paid 5.25 percent on a $300,000 loan for a monthly payment of about $1,657. Today, you could lock in a lower monthly payment of around $1,520 on a mortgage that size, or you might not need to borrow that much, given that prices have fallen in many areas.
FORCED SAVINGS You may make nothing at all beyond inflation over time on a home, but the part of your mortgage payment that goes toward principal is a form of forced savings.
Sure, you might do better by renting and investing the difference between the rent and the total costs of ownership. But at least three things need to go right.
First, you need to actually save the money. Americans have trouble with that sort of plan. Then, you need an after-tax return that's better than whatever a home would deliver. That's a task that might not have gone so well over the last 10 or 12 years, and it involves its own future risk, given how little safer investments are returning now. Finally, you must not raid the savings along the way.
DIFFICULT LANDLORDS A bank can kick you out only if you don't pay your mortgage. But landlords can drive you away in any number of ways.
Laura Mapp and her husband, Carl Berg, rented from a relative, but it didn't go particularly well. They found another landlord they liked, but came back from a holiday trip one year to a note saying he wanted to move in himself. They had a month to scram. (The note came with a bottle of wine, at least.)
In yet another rental, they let their landlord know they were looking to buy and inquired about a month-to-month lease. No problem, their landlord said, as long as they used his boyfriend as their real estate agent.
Earlier this year, the couple gave up on landlords and bought a house in the Highland Park neighborhood in Seattle.
THE NICE PART OF TOWN No matter how pretty the neighborhood, prices may still fall further in places like greater Detroit, Cleveland and Las Vegas; outlying areas of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Phoenix; and much of Florida. If you're looking elsewhere, consult The Times's rent-versus-buy calculator, halfway down the page at nytimes.com/yourmoney.
But if you want to live in the Fox Hill Farm development in Glen Mills, Pa., you'll have to buy because renters are not allowed, said Bob Kuhn, who lives there. The same may be true of other communities for older people.
And there may not be many family-size rentals -- or at least any financial edge to be gained by renting -- in suburbs or urban neighborhoods with excellent public schools.
After many years of building their down-payment fund and a couple of years of watching the listings in the Eagle Rock and Mount Washington areas of Los Angeles, Garret and Alison Williams realized that prices simply were not falling much there.
By the time they were ready to pounce this year, they had a big enough down payment and interest rates had fallen so far that renting didn't make much financial sense, even if they could have found a rental big enough for them and their two small children.
''Had we rented, we would be paying more than we're paying for a mortgage,'' said Ms. Williams, who had lived in the same two-bedroom rental for 12 years before she and her family moved into their new house in Eagle Rock earlier this month. ''I don't see how we could really regret having made the move when it's so much better for us on so many levels.''

HEADLINE: Mr. Simpson Has A Cow

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
What are we to make of Alan Simpson, the co-chairman of President Obama's deficit reduction commission, who recently referred to Social Security as ''a milk cow with 310 million tits''?
Personally, I would love for us to have a national cow with that sort of milk-giving capacity. But Simpson, who gets very impatient with people who want to preserve current Social Security benefits, did not mean it as a compliment. Now, his remark is getting a lot of attention, and that is only partly because the rest of the news has been so depressing that Bristol Palin's rumored agreement to compete on ''Dancing With the Stars'' was a high point of the week.
Simpson, 78, is a former Republican senator known for his outspokenness -- he once called the American Association of Retired Persons ''the greedy geezers of America.'' In appointing him co-chairman of the president's National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, the White House broke an important political rule, which is to keep away from anyone who considers himself a colorful old codger. 
Colorful codgers can be a welcome diversion in mediocre situation comedies, but you do not want one to be the public face of your deficit reduction commission. He might do something crazy, like e-mailing an activist for older American women, to accuse her of ''babbling into the vapors,'' then make disparaging remarks about well-endowed dairy animals and conclude with: ''Call when you get honest work!''
Simpson was responding to a Huffington Post article by Ashley Carson, the executive director of the Older Women's League. In it, Carson criticized Simpson's support for reducing Social Security benefits. She also slammed his ''record of sexism'' and ''his constant bashing of seniors.''
Carson's post had been published in April. So besides writing an e-mail that confirmed all of her worst charges, Simpson was also choosing to get involved in a fight whose expiration date had long since kicked in. Perhaps he was in a bad mood because his son had just lost a gubernatorial primary to the grandson of another former United States senator. To make matters worse, the younger Simpson came in fourth, behind people who were not even direct descendants of major state politicians.
After his e-mail rant was made public, Simpson apologized in his colorful old codger way. (''Over the last 40 years I have had my size 15 feet in my mouth a time or two.'') But that did not stop the demands that he resign or be fired.
So far, Obama is sticking with his deficit-reduction co-chairman. He picked Simpson for the job because he is a Republican willing to talk about Social Security tax increases, a breed rarer than the ivory-billed woodpecker. The administration was obviously hoping that the commission would come up with a bipartisan plan that would combine a rise in payroll taxes with a modest reduction in benefits. The system is supposed to run out of money in 2037, and if we could fix it now, the pain would be much more modest than if Congress waited until, say, January of 2038.
This is so totally contrary to the current culture of Washington that it seems sort of touching that anybody might imagine it can happen. However, there is too much negativity in the world these days. I hereby offer a two-part proposal for fixing Social Security:
MORE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS Immigration in general is a Social Security plus, since new arrivals tend to be young, and likely to contribute to the retirement system through payroll taxes for a long time before they start collecting. But illegal immigrants never get to collect at all. Their money only goes one way, toward benefits for the rest of us. Arizona retirees, tear down your walls.
TAX LONGER LIVES Some experts, including people in the administration, believe that Congress should raise the age at which people can retire on full Social Security benefits, which is currently 66 and will rise to 67 for younger workers. Personally, I will be happy to rally around this idea the very second that the White House announces there is a large pool of job opportunities for unemployed 60-year-olds that are going begging.
The theory behind raising the retirement age is that people are living longer these days. However, the Americans who do all this extra living tend to be wealthier than the ones who expire before they can cash their first pension check. Right now, only the first $106,800 in annual income is taxed for Social Security. Get rid of the cap, and you will be making the folks who are causing most of the problem pay for the solution.
Finally, we could make a rule that it is unacceptable for people who are collecting large government pensions to make fun of retirees who want to keep Social Security benefits the way they are. Particularly if they try to be colorful about it.

HEADLINE: Trying to Stand Out as a Liberal in a Democratic Primary

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
Bracing for what is expected to be a strong anti-Albany surge this fall, many Democratic candidates in New York have adopted the mantra of the middle, talking up pocketbook issues like jobs and taxes and focusing intently on moderate voters.
Then there is Eric T. Schneiderman, a state senator from the Upper West Side of Manhattan who is running for attorney general. Seeking to distinguish himself in a crowded field with slightly more than two weeks to go before the Democratic primary, Mr. Schneiderman is running a proudly liberal campaign that appears aimed at charging the race with a more ideological flavor.
He has emphasized his backing from public employees' unions, even as some other leading Democrats shun them. His advertisements sell his support for gun control and for reduced sentences for nonviolent drug offenders.
And he has wrapped himself in endorsements from other city Democrats, notably the Rev. Al Sharpton, a power broker in black politics but a controversial figure to many New Yorkers. 
In a line likely to echo in Republican attacks this fall, Mr. Schneiderman promised that if he is elected attorney general, Mr. Sharpton's civil rights group, based in a Harlem storefront called the House of Justice, ''will have an annex in Albany for the first time in the history of this state.''
The strategy aligns with Mr. Schneiderman's previous advocacy on issues like same-sex marriage and reproductive rights. But it is also an effort to promote himself as a progressive alternative to the primary's perceived front-runner, Kathleen M. Rice, the Nassau County district attorney.
''It's been really hard for these A.G. candidates to break through to the point where most people are even aware of the campaign,'' said David S. Birdsell, dean of the School of Public Affairs at Baruch College. ''He's saying, 'If you're looking for a traditional crusading Democrat out of New York City, you can look for me this campaign season.' ''
The approach has risks. Whoever prevails in the primary will face Daniel K. Donovan Jr., the Republican district attorney of Staten Island, who is expected to run a competitive race and look for openings to paint the Democratic nominee as too liberal for the job.
Speaking of Mr. Schneiderman, Michael McKeon, a Republican political consultant (though one who is supporting the current attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, in his bid for governor this year), said: ''Of the front-runners, he is by far the preferred choice for the Republicans because he has staked out so far left a position. And given that he is running for a law enforcement job, it helps Republicans even more.''
Such concerns do not deter Mr. Schneiderman, a 55-year-old former public interest lawyer and mass-transit advocate.
To him, the logic is simple. In what is expected to be a low-turnout primary featuring five white candidates, the winner will be whoever knits together the unions, liberals and African-American voters who dominate politics in the five boroughs. To a large extent, Mr. Schneiderman is following the playbook of Bill de Blasio and John C. Liu, who mustered the same coalition last year to win races for New York City public advocate and comptroller.
''The reason nearly every progressive leader in New York and organizations like Naral Pro-Choice and Citizens Union are all supporting Eric Schneiderman is because no one in this race has fought harder for social justice, reproductive rights and cracking down on gun violence,'' said James Freedland, a Schneiderman campaign spokesman.
''It's one thing to say you'll take on powerful interests and champion progressive causes on behalf of the people; it's another thing to have actually done it.''
Ms. Rice did not register as a Democrat until her first run for office, in 2005; Mr. Schneiderman seldom issues a news release without noting that he is a ''lifelong Democrat.''
And much of his early campaign was based on relentlessly criticizing Ms. Rice for her opposition to some provisions of the overhaul of the drug-sentencing laws last year, an issue that has little to do with the attorney general's office but was a top priority of black leaders.
By contrast, other candidates, like Eric R. Dinallo, a former state insurance superintendent, and Sean Coffey, a trial lawyer, have placed more emphasis lately on expanding the attorney general's jurisdiction over public corruption, banking on voters' disgust with state officials.
They have also campaigned among Democrats outside New York City, who by some estimates make up roughly 45 percent of the electorate in a Democratic primary. Mr. Schneiderman's focus on city turnout, Mr. Coffey said in a recent interview with an Albany newspaper, made his bid seem like ''a Manhattan borough president campaign.''
Ms. Rice's campaign has been a mirror image of Mr. Schneiderman's. She spent much of the spring courting party organizations in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, winning numerous endorsements and defending herself against accusations that she was too conservative. Her recent television advertisements emphasize Ms. Rice's plans to crack down on Albany corruption and her lengthy experience as a prosecutor -- a resume item Mr. Schneiderman lacks.
Of late, Ms. Rice, perhaps sensing a threat from Mr. Schneiderman, has taken jabs at him, suggesting that he exaggerated his law enforcement experience as a deputy sheriff in Massachusetts in the late 1970s.
All told, the campaign contrasts sharply with the equally crowded Democratic primary four years ago, a far less ideological race and one dominated from the start by the battle between two outsize personalities: Mr. Cuomo and Mark Green, the brash former public advocate.
Advisers to Mr. Schneiderman said they did not believe that his emphasis on core liberal issues would come back to haunt him in a general election. Because so few New Yorkers are paying attention to the primary, they said, Mr. Schneiderman would have ample opportunity, should he win next month, to reach out to middle-of-the-road-voters on economic issues, like his proposals to combat mortgage fraud and abusive debt collectors.
They are also counting on the fact that while Republicans appear poised for victory elsewhere in the country, the Republican Party remains in disarray in New York, where no Republican has won statewide office since 2002.
Before getting to the fall campaign, Mr. Schneiderman will have to beat his four Democratic rivals. Ms. Rice, who is highly popular in Nassau, has the broadest geographic base, the most money and the most name recognition, according to polls of the race so far. But the vast majority of voters say they are undecided.
''For progressives and liberals, for black and Hispanic voters, it's great,'' Joseph Mercurio, a Democratic consultant, said of Mr. Schneiderman's strategy. But against Ms. Rice, he suggested, it might not be enough.
''Nassau County is a very big place,'' Mr. Mercurio said. ''And it's full of angry people.''

HEADLINE: Europe Veers From U.S. In Approach To Recovery

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. The diverging paths of the American and European economies could be discerned Friday in the speeches of Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, and Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank.
While Mr. Bernanke tried to reassure Americans that the Fed was not impotent to prevent economic recovery from grinding to a halt, Mr. Trichet gave a stern lecture to European governments about the need to change their spendthrift habits of the last few decades.
And while Mr. Bernanke has retreated for the moment from any talk of returning to normal monetary policy, Mr. Trichet is moving out of crisis mode and talking openly of ''reabsorbing excessive liquidity.'' 
High debt -- across households, companies and countries -- poses the greatest threat to economic recovery, Mr. Trichet said at an annual Fed policy symposium here, before a gathering of about 100 economists and government officials, including Mr. Bernanke, who had addressed the gathering a few hours earlier.
Buoyed by unexpectedly strong growth in Germany and a calming of the sovereign-debt crisis that roiled the continent in the spring, European leaders have turned their attention to what economists call fiscal consolidation paring spending and reducing government deficits.
''The primary macroeconomic challenge for the next 10 years is to ensure that they do not turn into another 'lost decade','' Mr. Trichet said.
Permanent reductions in public debts are needed to reduce borrowing costs and stimulate private demand, Mr. Trichet said. He said he was ''skeptical'' about the view that the economy ''is at present too fragile and thus consolidation efforts should be postponed or even new fiscal stimulus measures added.''
Mr. Trichet said the financial crisis of 2008 was merely a symptom of ''the excesses and imbalances accumulated over the previous decades'' namely, ''the expansion of debt, the build-up of risk and the increase in leverage.''
At their June summit meeting in Toronto, leaders of the Group of 20 economies agreed to cut their public deficits in half by 2013 and to stabilize the growth of their public indebtedness, as a proportion of economic output, by 2016.
Mr. Trichet broadly endorsed those targets. ''Just as we showed courage in facing the pressing demands of the crisis itself, now policy-makers must be equally courageous in dealing with these longer-term threats to stability and growth,'' he said.
In some respects, Mr. Trichet's arguments resembled those of conservative Republicans in the United States, who have argued against additional fiscal measures even in the face of high unemployment.
''Firms and households know that ultimately they will have to bear the consequences of the painful measures needed to reduce debt,'' Mr. Trichet said. ''As long as it is unclear when the adjustment will occur and who will bear what fraction of the costs of adjustment, firms and households may delay their investment and consumption decision, slowing down the economic recovery.''
Aides to Mr. Trichet said his remarks were in no way intended to apply to the American economy, which faces different challenges than Europe does. Even so, the distinction between Mr. Trichet's tone and that of Mr. Bernanke who scarcely mentioned fiscal policy in a half-hour speech that focused on additional steps the Fed could take to bolster the lagging recovery was noted by several economists here.
''The Europeans are feeling more upbeat, given Germany's growth and export performance, and the seeming though perhaps temporary -- calm in the sovereign debt markets,'' said Maurice Obstfeld, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, and an authority on international finance.
But Mr. Obstfeld noted that Axel Weber, president of the German Bundesbank and a member of the European Central Bank's governing council, has been pushing that central bank to maintain accommodative monetary policies like low interest rates and bond purchases.
''It's interesting that Bernanke didn't mention fiscal policy much,'' said Professor Obstfeld, a friend of Mr. Bernanke since they were fellow graduate students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1970s. ''The European Central Bank has always felt more confident commenting on fiscal issues and lecturing the national treasuries on the need for more restraint.''
He added: ''Of course, Europe has more of a history of fiscal excess leading to high inflation. And with elections in the United States coming up, for the Fed to mention fiscal matters would only serve to politicize it.''

HEADLINE: Fed Ready to Dig Deeper To Aid Growth, Chief Says

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN; Jackie Calmes contributed reporting from Vineyard Haven, Mass., and Motoko Rich from New York.

 BODY:
JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, signaled once again on Friday that the central bank was prepared to act if the economy continued to weaken, as yet another economic report confirmed that the recovery had slowed to a crawl.
Mr. Bernanke made clear that while the Fed could take various steps, including large purchases of government debt, ''central bankers alone cannot solve the world's economic problems.'' Speaking at the Fed's annual symposium here, he hinted broadly that political leaders had to take steps to tackle the deficit and the trade imbalance.
Hours before Mr. Bernanke spoke, the Commerce Department lowered its estimate of economic growth in the second quarter to an annual rate of 1.6 percent, after originally reporting last month that growth from April through June was 2.4 percent. Economists had been predicting a steeper decline, and stock prices rose after the markets opened.
While Mr. Bernanke announced no new steps that the Fed would take immediately, he said the central bank was determined to prevent the economy from slipping into a cycle of falling wages and prices, a situation he said he did not think was likely. Instead he predicted that growth would continue modestly in the second half of the year and pick up in 2011. 
Mr. Bernanke said the Fed, having kept short-term interest rates at nearly zero since 2008, had essentially four options:
It can purchase more government debt and long-term securities. It can try to coax down long-term interest rates by announcing its intention to keep short-term rates extremely low for even longer than the markets currently expect. It can lower the interest rate it pays on the funds banks hold at the Fed. And it can raise its medium-term target for inflation, which would discourage banks from sitting on their cash.
Mr. Bernanke suggested that the first of those options was the most likely, and all but ruled out the last two.
While the Fed committee that sets monetary policy was prepared to take new steps ''if the outlook were to deteriorate significantly,'' he said, it ''has not agreed on specific criteria or triggers for further action.''
As Mr. Bernanke's remarks were released publicly, stock prices immediately fell, a sign that investors were hoping for some concrete signs that the Fed would step in to try to bolster the economy. But as the market digested the chairman's full remarks, prices rebounded and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 164.84 points, or 1.65 percent, to 10,150.65. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.64 percent, from 2.48 percent. The revised second-quarter growth data came after a week that showed that the economic retrenchment that began in the second quarter had spilled into the summer, with a sharp slowdown in new-home sales and a drop in sales of factory goods.
Consumer spending rose 2 percent in the second quarter -- slightly better than the Commerce Department had initially projected. And a closely watched survey by the University of Michigan and Thomson Reuters showed that consumer sentiment ticked up marginally in August, while remaining well below levels seen during the previous six months.
In his first public remarks since the Fed took a modest step on Aug. 10 to lift the economy -- a decision to invest proceeds from its huge mortgage-bond portfolio in long-term Treasury securities -- Mr. Bernanke tried in some respects to dampen expectations that the Fed could make significant headway against the economic sluggishness.
Alan S. Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman and a Princeton professor, noted that Mr. Bernanke focused his remarks on the costs as well as the benefits of additional action to help the economy.
''The Fed has run out of the strong tools, and is turning to the weak ones,'' Mr. Blinder said in an interview here. ''When you're fighting in a foxhole and you've used up the machine guns and hand grenades, then you pull out the swords and start throwing rocks.''
Mr. Blinder said that the economy seemed ''substantially worse'' than it did three months ago -- and that Mr. Bernanke had acknowledged the deterioration, cautiously.
The Obama administration is looking to the Fed to do more to spur the recovery, since its own options are few, given the political paralysis in Congress as midterm elections approach. President Obama, vacationing on Martha's Vineyard, discussed the economy for about 15 minutes with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York before the two men played golf.
Mr. Bernanke avoided wading into the rancorous political debates over fiscal policy, instead focusing on the two objectives that form the Fed's legal mandate: price stability and maximum employment.
Inflation has been running well below the Fed's unofficial target rate of 1.5 to 2 percent. While conceding that inflation had fallen ''slightly below'' the desirable level, Mr. Bernanke said deflation was ''not a significant risk'' right now. He said the Fed would ''strongly resist deviations from price stability in the downward direction.''
Mr. Bernanke predicted the economy would continue to grow the rest of this year, ''albeit at a relatively modest pace.'' He said the ''preconditions for a pickup of growth in 2011 appear to remain in place,'' as banks increase lending, worries over the European sovereign debt crisis abate and consumers save more.
Strikingly, Mr. Bernanke acknowledged that the traditional tradeoff between inflation and employment had become all but obsolete, at least for now. ''There is little or no potential conflict between the goals of supporting growth and employment and of maintaining price stability,'' he said.
Mr. Bernanke explained in detail the Fed's decision to use money from its mortgage bonds to buy government debt. The Fed has gobbled up $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities and $175 billion in debts owed by Fannie Mae and other government entities -- a major reason mortgage rates are at historic lows.
So far, the Fed has received about $140 billion through repayments of the principal on its holdings of those debts. An additional $400 billion or so could be repaid by the end of 2011. If the Fed had not taken the step it did, the central bank's balance sheet would have gradually shrunk, which would amount to a passive tightening of monetary policy -- what Mr. Bernanke called ''a perverse outcome.''
He said the Fed's purchases of longer-term securities had helped bring down long-term interest rates and lower the cost of borrowing, contributing to the modest recovery that began in the spring of 2009.
However, such purchases seemed to be most effective in times of financial stress, and additional purchases would further complicate the Fed's future ''exit strategy'' when the time came to return to normal monetary policy, he said.
The Fed has said since March 2009 that ''exceptionally low'' levels of the fed funds rate, the benchmark short-term interest rate, would be warranted for ''an extended period.'' The Fed could try to lengthen those expectations, as central banks in Canada and Japan have tried. But Mr. Bernanke cautioned that the Fed might find it ''difficult to convey the committee's policy intentions with sufficient precision and conditionality.''
The Fed currently pays 0.25 percent interest on excess reserves that banks keep at the Fed. But Mr. Bernanke said that slashing that rate even to zero might do no more than lower the fed funds rate by another 0.10 to 0.15 percentage points. He said doing so would harm the liquidity of short-term money markets.
Mr. Bernanke said he saw ''no support'' on the committee for setting a higher inflation target, as some economists have suggested. He called the strategy ''inappropriate for the United States in current circumstances.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Considers Possibility Of Engaging North Korea

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The last time a former American president traveled to North Korea on a rescue mission -- Bill Clinton, a year ago -- he was feted by its leader, Kim Jong-il, who seized on the visit to reach out to the Obama administration. This week, Mr. Kim chose to go to China during a visit by former President Jimmy Carter to free another jailed American.
Whatever the motivation for Mr. Kim's snub, analysts said it underscored the deep freeze between North Korea and the United States. The State Department greeted the news on Friday that Mr. Carter had secured the release of Aijalon Mahli Gomes by warning other Americans not to go to North Korea, saying they risked ''heavy fines and long prison sentences with hard labor.'' 
Even as it keeps up its tough tone, however, the United States has begun weighing a fresh effort at engagement with Mr. Kim's government, officials and analysts briefed on the deliberations say.
Such an overture would come ''several moves down the chessboard,'' a senior official said, and would be preceded by additional pressure tactics. But it suggests that the administration has concluded that pressure alone will not be enough to move North Korea's ailing, reclusive dictator.
At a high-level meeting last week on North Korea, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton solicited ideas from outside experts and former officials about the next steps in policy toward the North. The consensus, even among the hawks, was that the United States needed to resume some form of contact with Mr. Kim, according to several people who took part.
Mrs. Clinton, these people said, expressed impatience with the current policy, which is based on ever more stringent economic sanctions and joint American-South Korean naval exercises -- both in response to the sinking in March of a South Korean warship, for which South Korea blamed the North.
Among those advocating a fresh overture is Stephen W. Bosworth, the special envoy for North Korea. He visited Pyongyang, the North's capital, in December to explore the prospect of talks, but the administration could not decide whether to schedule a follow-up meeting, and then the warship was torpedoed.
''The question is, what are we going to do now?'' said Joel S. Wit, a former State Department negotiator with North Korea who founded a Web site, 38 North, which follows North Korean politics. ''The answer is re-engagement. There aren't any other tools in the toolbox.''
Far from abandoning pressure tactics, officials said, the United States is likely to increase them. In July, it announced new measures aimed at choking off sources of hard currency for the government and its allies. Mrs. Clinton sent a senior adviser, Robert J. Einhorn, to Asia to drum up support for the sanctions. The military, defying threats from North Korea and anger from China, has held several days of joint drills with South Korea in the Yellow Sea.
''We don't want to go down the old road and repeat the experiences of the past,'' said Jeffrey A. Bader, senior director for Asian affairs at the National Security Council. ''We are looking for behavior change by the North Koreans.''
Still, there is growing concern, even among hawkish analysts, that pressure, without any dialogue, raises the risk of war. Some critics also contend that there is little evidence the sanctions have forced the North to retreat from its nuclear program or its belligerence toward South Korea.
Mr. Kim's deteriorating health, and the succession struggle it has set off, have increased the pressure on the administration to reach out, in the view of some analysts. While some officials argue that the United States can wait out the political transition, others fear that heightening the confrontation with North Korea could foreclose future opportunities for contact.
As Victor Cha, a former Bush administration official who was responsible for North Korea, put it, ''If they look like they're preparing for war, there's no opportunity to talk to the new leadership.''
The administration, analysts said, is also losing confidence in China's willingness to press the North. During a visit to Beijing in May, Mrs. Clinton invested a lot of energy in trying to persuade Chinese officials to accept the South Korean government's finding that the North had sunk its ship. Her efforts were futile: Beijing never accepted the North's culpability and it blunted Seoul's drive for a United Nations statement condemning the attack.
Symbolically, analysts said, Mr. Kim's choice of a trip to China over a meeting with Mr. Carter highlighted North Korea's economic and political dependence on Beijing. China has long pushed for the United States to talk to the North, and reopening a dialogue could help ease the tension between Beijing and Washington. One problem for the administration is the form and content of talks. Few analysts have much enthusiasm for the six-party format, under which North Korea has negotiated over its nuclear program with the United States, South Korea, China, Japan and Russia. But the talks are probably necessary to retain support of allies like South Korea and Japan.
Another problem is that the administration has been uncompromising in its demands. Officials have repeatedly said that the United States will not negotiate until North Korea agrees to dismantle its nuclear weapons. Their fear is that the North will extract concessions, as it did during the Bush and Clinton administrations, only to test another nuclear bomb.
An option, experts said, would be to engage North Korea on issues other than the nuclear program. But others said the issue was unavoidable. For now, the administration offers a more pragmatic strategy. ''Americans should heed our travel warning and avoid North Korea,'' said the State Department's spokesman, Philip J. Crowley. ''We only have a handful of former presidents.''

HEADLINE: Scandal Takes Surprising Turn in Louisiana's Republican Senate Primary

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

 BODY:
NEW ORLEANS -- Louisiana Democrats were elated.
In early July, on the final day to qualify for the fall elections, a former State Supreme Court justice named Chet D. Traylor announced he was running for the United States Senate as a Republican. Mr. Traylor, a 12-year veteran of the court from the conservative northern part of the state, seemed to present a real challenge in the Republican primary, which is Saturday, to the man who has bedeviled Democrats and oddsmakers for the past three years: the state's junior senator, David Vitter.
Ever since 2007, after his name appeared on the client list of a Washington prostitution ring, Mr. Vitter was assumed to be a defeated man walking. This assumption was only strengthened in June when ABC News reported that Brent Furer, one of Mr. Vitter's longtime aides, had a history of run-ins with the law, including arrests for drunken driving, cocaine possession and an episode in 2008 in which Mr. Furer allegedly attacked his girlfriend with a knife. (Mr. Furer pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges at the time, including threatening harm, but resigned only after the news report this summer.) 
Democrats still think they have a chance to beat Mr. Vitter, but they considered the real hope a primary challenge from the right, a Republican candidate who would remind voters of the scandals and leave Mr. Vitter, 49, bruised for the general election. After a roster of rumored contenders, Mr. Traylor, 64, appeared to be that man.
Things did not go entirely as planned.
Mr. Traylor's campaign was built around the case that the scandals jeopardized Republican control of the seat. ''Hey Vitter,'' ran one ad. ''What's next?''
But by the time the ad ran, this had become a tricky case for Mr. Traylor to make.
In late July, a state representative told The News-Star of Monroe, La., that Mr. Traylor had been a significant factor in his divorce. While Mr. Traylor did eventually marry the representative's former wife, who died last year, he flatly denied that they were involved before the divorce.
But Mr. Traylor did acknowledge that he is now involved with someone else, the estranged wife of the state representative's son -- who is also Mr. Traylor's stepson.
None of this is illegal and it is all in the open, Mr. Traylor pointed out. But it has made it difficult to run a campaign on character issues.
''It's not as bad as what Vitter did,'' said Billy Wayne Montgomery, a former legislator from northern Louisiana who started out as a Democrat but switched parties. ''But it's not too good.''
In any event, Mr. Traylor's fund-raising has come in well short of $100,000 and Mr. Vitter is going into the primary ahead by vast margins in the polls, and in a comfortable position for the general election.
Mr. Traylor's familial drama is not the only lucky break for Mr. Vitter in this election. For decades, Louisiana had an open primary, a free-for-all race in which party affiliation did not matter. But in 2007 the state decided to hold federal elections under the closed party-primary system. Then this year legislators changed their minds again, and voted to return to open primaries in 2012. Political observers in the state say that brief window helped Mr. Vitter, keeping him from having to fend off challenges from all sides at once.
With primaries seeming little more than formalities, the general election has already begun.
Representative Charlie Melancon, Mr. Vitter's Democratic opponent, has not shied from raising the scandals surrounding Mr. Vitter, trying to link them with Mr. Vitter's voting record on women's issues (for instance, his vote against the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act) and testing the theory, held by some of the state's political observers, that Mr. Vitter's weakness lies in the skepticism of women voters. Mr. Melancon's campaign has even started a Web site called serioussins.com, a reference to Mr. Vitter's admission of ''a very serious sin'' after the prostitution scandal.
The effectiveness of such a strategy remains to be seen, as Mr. Vitter's base is broad, and seems to relish his take-no-prisoners style of conservative politics. ''I guarantee you, the family-values people, he's still their poster boy,'' Mr. Montgomery said. ''In this area up here, Vitter could murder somebody and they'd forgive him.''
With a healthy lead over Mr. Melancon in polls and in fund-raising, Mr. Vitter's strategy has been to depict Mr. Melancon as a wasteful spender, drawing particular attention to his vote for the federal bank bailout.
But so far, this has not been much of a campaign season in Louisiana. Attention around the state has been focused on the BP oil spill and the anxieties about its effects on the state's economy.
The spill, however, has had its political side. In particular, the offshore drilling moratorium, which is almost universally opposed here, has not helped the Obama administration in a state where the president is already deeply unpopular. And anything that hurts the Obama administration helps Mr. Vitter.
''It's frankly the darndest thing I've ever seen,'' said Roy Fletcher, a political consultant in Louisiana who works for Mr. Traylor's campaign. The Senate race, he said in rather colorful language, is pitting antipathy toward President Obama against antipathy toward prostitution. And, he added, it is pretty clear which side is winning.

HEADLINE: President's Panel, Short on Specifics, Makes Suggestions for Changing Tax Code

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker offered President Obama a menu of options on Friday for revamping the tax code, including simplifying the system and overhauling how corporate taxes are assessed. 
The president's Economic Recovery Advisory Board, headed by Mr. Volcker, issued a 118-page report that presents choices for the administration and Congress to consider, while avoiding specifics on the path to take.
Amid election-year fights over individual tax rates and the deficit, the report is not likely to stir any immediate action to change the tax code, said William G. Gale, co-director of the Tax Policy Center, a Washington research organization. It may guide the debate later if momentum gathers for an overhaul, he said.
''This is more like a warm-up drill, not the game itself,'' Mr. Gale said. ''Congress has to actually want to take these issues seriously rather than use them as sound bites and campaign material. And I don't see any interest right now in doing the hard work.''
The options presented by Mr. Volcker's panel raise the prospect of a White House effort to revamp the business-tax structure, including broadening the corporate tax base.
''The corporate tax system is deeply flawed and deeply in need of reform,'' Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a board member and a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, and a former economic adviser to President Bill Clinton, said during a session of the panel Friday to vote on the report.
Options also include simplifying personal income taxes, retirement incentives and treatment of capital gains as well as cracking down on tax evaders to close the tax gap, or the difference between the amount of taxes owed and the amount collected.
The board also suggested consideration of a ''simple return'' in which the Internal Revenue Service would mail a pre-filled return to as many as 60 million taxpayers who do not itemize deductions and receive all their income from wages or other third-party payers. Taxpayers would then simply sign and return the form or amend it if they chose.

HEADLINE: U.S. Economy Slowed to 1.6% Pace in 2nd Quarter

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
Economic statistics released Friday offered the clearest sign yet that the recovery, already acknowledged to be sauntering, had slowed to a crawl.
The government lowered its estimate of economic growth in the second quarter to an annual rate of 1.6 percent, after originally reporting last month that growth in the April-June period was 2.4 percent.
The revision is a significant slowdown from the annual rate of 3.7 percent in the first quarter and 5 percent in the last three months of 2009. 
The news came at the end of a week that showed the economic retrenchment that began in the second quarter has spilled over into the summer. Existing home sales in July were down to their lowest level in a decade, and sales of new homes last month were at their lowest level since the government began tracking such data in 1963. Orders for large factory goods, excluding the volatile transportation sector, dropped in July, indicating that recovery in the manufacturing sector also was stalling.
With such grim reports, economists are now concerned that the outlook for job creation, which has been spluttering all summer, could deteriorate further. Companies and consumers tend to be spooked by bad news, and market analysts and economists worry that faltering confidence could cause employers to hold back on hiring.
''When you get a downshift in growth there is a risk that it will feed on itself,'' the chief economist at MF Global, James F. O'Sullivan, said. ''The question now is to what extent has the improving trend just been temporarily set back or has it really been short-circuited.''
In a speech Friday morning, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, said that he expected the economy to continue on a growth track, ''albeit at a relatively modest pace.''
He also indicated that the Fed would be willing to resume large purchases of longer-term debt if the economy worsened. Such moves could have the effect of lowering mortgage rates. Although rates are already at historic lows, economists suggest that lower rates could eventually spur some home-buying or at least refinancing, which gives households more cash to spend.
Meanwhile, a closely watched survey by the University of Michigan and Thomson Reuters showed that consumer sentiment ticked up marginally in August from July, but remained well below levels seen during the previous six months.
The bulk of the downgrade in the second-quarter G.D.P. was because government analysts had assumed that American companies added more inventory to their warehouse shelves than they actually did. The adjustment also took into account a sharp rise in imports, leading to a wider-than-estimated trade deficit.
Economists polled by Bloomberg News had been expecting the second-quarter growth figure to be revised down to 1.4 percent.
Inventories, originally reported to have grown by $75.7 billion, actually grew by $63.2 billion. Some economists pointed to a silver lining in the figure. Because companies have kept inventories relatively low, ''if demand was to take off, they would have to hire additional workers and ramp up production,'' said Omair Sharif, United States economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland. ''So the fact that businesses did not accumulate enough inventories sets the stage for a much stronger pickup in employment and hours worked in the future, if demand picks up.''
For now, companies are not building up inventories. ''There is some hesitancy out there now about building up any more than they have to,'' said Thomas J. Duesterberg, chief executive of the Manufacturers Alliance-MAPI, a trade association.
Imports, which were first reported to have grown at an annual rate of 28.8 percent, the biggest jump in a quarter-century, grew by 32.4 percent, compared with a much lower gain of 9.1 percent in exports. Mr. Duesterberg said he expected exports to grow further in the second half of the year.
What strength there had been in the original growth number came from business investment in items that included office buildings, equipment and software. The revised number showed that such spending rose at an annual rate of 17.6 percent, not much different from the 17 percent estimated in the initial second-quarter report.
Consumer spending, which economists often look to as a primary indicator of recovery, grew 2 percent. That was a slightly better rate than the Commerce Department originally said last month when it reported that consumption grew at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the second quarter, and just above the 1.9 percent increase in the first quarter.
Optimists pointed to that bump in consumer spending as a sign that the recovery, while weak, still had legs.
Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group, said that he expected the Fed to take action and for companies, now sitting on large cash reserves, to eventually start hiring again, moves that he believed would translate into more robust consumer spending.
But more bearish analysts said there was little evidence that the economy was recovering in anything but name only. With more recent indicators showing a shrinking housing market, dwindling orders for factory goods and rampant discounting among retailers, some economists saw far more clouds than sun.
''Given all the stimulus and all the steroids and all the medication, the economy should be ripping right now,'' said David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist for Gluskin Sheff & Associates. ''The fact that it's not should lead people to believe that this is certainly not a common recession.''
Mr. Rosenberg pointed out that during the Great Depression, the economy experienced several quarters of official growth, despite the presence of bread lines and rampant unemployment. Now, he said, ''it seems the diagnosis is pretty clear, but people don't like to talk about it, because Depression depresses people.''
Economists have been revising their forecasts for growth in the second half, with Goldman Sachs now projecting annual growth of 1.5 percent. Ben Herzon, a senior economist at Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting group, said the firm had taken its estimate for third-quarter growth down to 1.7 percent from 2.5 percent at the beginning of July.
Mr. Herzon said that he was not expecting a double-dip back into recession, however. ''It's difficult to point to a shock that would be bad enough to put the economy back into a recession,'' he said. ''I just think it means that this recovery is going to be slower and more painful than we originally expected.''

HEADLINE: Eating Locally, Thinking Globally

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Math Lessons for Locavores'' (Op-Ed, Aug. 20):
Stephen Budiansky writes that locavores are wrong to worry so much about how far our food travels when the ''real energy hog'' is you and me: ''Home preparation and storage account for 32 percent of all energy use in our food system, the largest component by far.'' This may be true, but the lion's share of the food system's energy use comes from six other elements of the food chain, precisely the sectors locavores are trying to avoid.
A recent Department of Agriculture study reported that 28 percent of food energy use comes from households while much of the rest -- 57.6 percent -- comes from the processing, packaging, transportation, wholesale and retail, and food service energy use that locavores are seeking to avoid. 
A real locavore cares about all of these steps.
A locavore wouldn't go for a Twinkie, even if the Hostess factory were two miles down the road.
I'll grant Mr. Budiansky that whether we stir-fry local organic kale or cook up a sauce of long-distance chemically grown tomatoes makes little difference solely in home-energy use. But I disagree that the entire locavore approach -- avoiding fast food and highly packaged, processed, chemically grown and long-distance food -- makes no difference to the environment, our health or the planet.
With this holistic approach to the plate, locavores are potentially creating a huge energy savings indeed.
Anna Lappe
Brooklyn, Aug. 22, 2010
The writer is the author of ''Diet for a Hot Planet: The Climate Crisis at the End of Your Fork and What You Can Do About It.''
To the Editor:
I agree with Stephen Budiansky that the tenets of eating locally have been oversimplified and that all parts of our food system -- from cultivation to delivery to preparation -- need to be considered to assess the true costs of our meals. I also agree with his argument that food ought to be grown where it grows best, rather than growing locally those foods that, out of their comfort zone, require extensive energy and chemicals.
But the locavore movement nonetheless offers valuable lessons. It recognizes how accustomed we've become to eating foods well outside of their native ranges and seasons, and that to eat truly locally means learning to live without those foods that won't naturally grow in your own backyard, or in your local farmer's fields.
By reacquainting ourselves with regional eating and learning to savor what grows best locally (saving avocados and artichokes for special occasions and skipping hothouse tomatoes altogether), we can both grow foods most efficiently and reduce food miles.
Lisa Romano Lexington, Ky., Aug. 20, 2010
To the Editor:
Locavores eat locally for a variety of reasons, including taste, transportation, safety and community.
To start, local food is fresher and often more nutritious. A tomato picked three weeks ago in California, shipped in a refrigerated car and stacked in the produce section of the grocery store in New York is simply not as tasty as an heirloom tomato picked locally within a few days.
That said, most Americans should not expect to have tomatoes in January. Eating seasonally is part of appreciating the diversity of local food.
But don't mistake local eating for self-abnegation; it's often just common sense. For example, it makes sense for Kentuckians like me to get our oranges from Florida. It does not make sense for us to get our apples from Washington State if we can get them from right across the river in Indiana.
Knowing where your food comes from also has a safety side. If the spinach you got last week made you sick, it's a lot easier to track down the source if you shop at the farmer's market than if you shop at Safeway.
Finally, buying food locally invests people -- emotionally and financially -- in their own agricultural communities, rebuilding connections between farmers and consumers that were broken by the industrialization of agriculture.
Let's not enumerate the potential pitfalls of being a locavore without also explaining the virtues.
Eric Burnette Louisville, Ky., Aug. 20, 2010
To the Editor:
In Stephen Budiansky's insightful essay, he did not stress the most important reason that we should not rely only on local produce: fruits and vegetables in the winter.
Most of us older than about 45 can remember when fruit in winter meant canned pears dripping in oversweet juice. In the absence of other alternatives, it served a purpose, but it was expensive and not the best item nutritionally.
Nowadays you can go to a supermarket almost anywhere in America -- in the coldest months of January and February -- and get citrus fruits, fresh grapes, strawberries, tomatoes, melons and so on. Once seasonal delicacies, they are available year-round.
Steven Grossman Silver Spring, Md., Aug. 20, 2010
To the Editor:
I grow a modest amount of vegetables and fruit. I eat produce that comes from a farm down the road, grown by farmers I know. And I prefer to buy food from local sources whenever I can.
It's not because I adhere to a locavore dogma, or because I'm misinformed about food miles or because I remain ignorant about the benefits of our efficient, industrialized food system in terms of energy calories (and the epidemic of obesity it has spawned).
It's because I'm interested in restoring community through the act of eating, rather than swallowing the cold logic of global economics.

HEADLINE: Japan's Leader Says He'll Move to Rein In Surging Yen

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
TOKYO (Reuters) -- Japan's prime minister, Naoto Kan, said Friday that he would take steps as needed on currencies as the yen surges, and would meet with the Bank of Japan governor, increasing the possibility of the central bank's easing policy soon. 
The yen edged lower after Mr. Kan's remarks as Japanese policy makers struggled over how to put a cap on the currency, which hit a 15-year high against the dollar this week and threatened to derail a recovery led by exports.
The ruling Democratic Party's options on fiscal policy are limited because of the country's large debt burden, so it is leaning on the central bank to ease policy.
''There are investors who are expecting the Japanese authorities to take some measures if the yen appreciates sharply,'' said Mitsuru Sahara, chief manager for currency derivatives trading at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.
''It's possible that the government's stimulus steps and the B.O.J.'s easing measures will be announced together, even before its next meeting,'' he said, referring to the central bank's rate review in early September.
''There's a growing view that Japan could even conduct solo intervention if the yen rises sharply.''
The governor of the Bank of Japan, Masaaki Shirakawa, is scheduled to be in attendance at the Federal Reserve's seminar in Jackson Hole, Wyo., until Monday. Mr. Kan said he would meet Mr. Shirakawa after his return to Japan.
Mr. Kan said the government would outline measures on Tuesday to support the economy and grapple with the strong yen.
''Excessive currency moves can harm the economy and the financial system,'' he told reporters after visiting a small factory in the Tokyo suburbs. ''We will take firm measures when needed.''
The fate of any economic package could be complicated, however, by a ruling Democratic Party leadership vote on Sept. 14, in which a party powerbroker, Ichiro Ozawa, is challenging Mr. Kan.
Debt markets are already pricing in the chance of an easing of rates. With short-term rates already very low, investors are pushing down the longer end of the yield curve -- in other words, anticipating lower interest rates for longer-term debt -- although the yield curve steepened on Friday as banks sold superlong bonds to take profits.
The Bank of Japan is hesitant to return to a full-blown easing of monetary controls since that policy, which involves flooding markets with extra cash under a liquidity target, had little effect in beating deflation when it was in place until March 2006.
Japan has not intervened in the currency market since March 2004, when it ended a 15-month, 35 trillion yen ($315 billion) selling spree aimed at rescuing an economic recovery.

It was the closest I will ever come to ''Star Trek.'' The two Voyager spacecraft, launched in 1977, conducted a grand tour of the outer solar system that lasted more than a decade. They cruised over the skies of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, and checked out weird landscapes carved in methane and black ice on their many moons, mapping hard features like craters, mountains, cracks, rilles, geysers of sodium and water, and the soft geography, as Stephen J. Pyne memorably calls it, of magnetic fields and radiation belts. They are still traveling. Now roughly 10 billion miles from the Sun, Voyagers 1 and 2 are heading for the boundary of the solar system and interstellar space. 
Over those years we journalists periodically assembled at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, where images coming down from Voyager were displayed on television monitors in the pressroom at the same time that scientists huddled in the next building were receiving them. It was like being on the nose of a spaceship. Every morning at 11 o'clock selected members of the Voyager team would assemble in Von Karman Auditorium, nervous and self-conscious, unused to doing science in public, to try to explain what everyone was seeing. Or more often to say that they had no idea.
We were all playing roles with a long tradition, as Pyne, a historian and professor of life sciences at Arizona State University, points out in ''Voyager,'' a meditation on the nature and meaning of exploration itself, disguised as a chronicle of the life and times of a space mission. There are ''moments of exploring that more than any other capture the general imagination, that fuse place, time, discovery and yearning in ways that seem to speak to an era's sense of itself. If they do not inform an age, they do display the vital attributes of an age as nothing else can,'' he writes.
Voyager, he says, is ours.
I've been waiting a long time for a gossipy, intensely reported account of what actually went on in the building next door among the Voyager scientists on their proxy trip to eternity. I wish this were it, but, alas, it's not. Pyne's book, which is based largely on previously published accounts, has deeper concerns. It's a rich mix of history, science and fine writing. Sometimes it seems as if Captain Cook and Prince Henry the Navigator themselves are aboard the busy spacecraft.
This book blooms with such glorious rushes of exalted prose that I was dog-earing almost every page until I gave up. Contrasting the mission with human explorations from earlier eras, for example, Pyne writes that Voyager was ''a modernist machine loosed onto the cosmos. The Voyagers would not be blinded by gold or the mirage of fame. They would not abandon wife or child, or enslave unwary indigenes. They could not despair, could not be crippled by loneliness, could not fight for the cross or suffer for science, would not know epiphanies or endure tropical fevers. They would lay no claims, issue no proclamations of sovereignty, raise no toasts to king or republic, sign no treaties of trade or military alliance, nor send out reconnaissance parties to lay out routes for folk migration. . . . The Voyagers confronted no Other, or even life.''
As Pyne tells it, there have been three times in Western history when the political, military, economic and, yes, scientific stars aligned to produce an age of exploration. The first wave was during the Renaissance. Think of Christopher Columbus or Magellan. The second great wave, commencing with expeditions to measure the transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769, had scientific aspirations. Think of Darwin and the Beagle; Lewis and Clark; or Alexander von Humboldt, the German naturalist who traipsed through South America.
The third wave had its roots in the exploration of Antarctica; the International Geophysical Year (1957-58), which also saw the surprise launching of Sputnik; and the cold war. Voyager owed its existence as well to luck -- a once-every-176-year alignment of the outer planets that made it feasible for a single spacecraft to visit them all on one long excursion through the icy darkness, using the gravity of one planet to slingshot itself to the next, a technique conceived in 1961 by a U.C.L.A. graduate student.
Pyne details the political maneuvering once a grand tour was endorsed by President Richard Nixon. It was canceled when NASA's budget began to crash in the post-Apollo letdown, then resurrected as a pair of spacecraft. Voyager 2 was launched first, on Aug. 20, 1977. Voyager 1, which would beat its sister to Jupiter and Saturn, followed on Sept. 5. ''Because of politics, the expedition almost didn't happen, and because of politics, it finally did,'' Pyne writes.
The Voyagers spent most of the journey simply cruising through the void, with brief intervals of crazy action and discovery. Pyne handles those encounters with aplomb, highlighting the most memorable moments, but he spends most of the book cruising and ruminating on past explorations and drawing connections.
The comparisons to earlier voyages are fun and enlightening. The Portuguese navigators of the 15th century, for example, found that if they wanted to reach southern Africa, they shouldn't just sail down the coast but should go west in an arc, or gran volta, almost to Brazil and then catch the trade winds coming back east. Voyager had its own gran volta, looping past Jupiter in order to get up enough steam to make it to Saturn.
In other ways, the Voyager missions were utterly unlike their predecessors. For one thing, there were no people on board, so nobody was coming back. Thus there was no way to embody the last stage of the journey of the mythological hero as sketched by Joseph Campbell, the figure who must return with the fruits of his adventure to help humankind.
And, of course, there was no one to encounter, a subject on which Pyne waxes eloquent. The whole point of exploring, he says, is to meet somebody and be changed, but ''there was no one to enlist as a guide or impress as an interpreter. There was no one to reflect back a self-image of the explorer or serve as a prism to refract visions of the future. There was no one to stand, simply as himself, for an alternative moral universe. There was no one at all.''
As a result, Voyager's most telling moments, he writes, were when it turned and looked backward, at the Earth and Moon, at Saturn's rings backlighted by the Sun, or at last the whole solar system with Earth as the famous pale blue dot. As of this writing, the Voyagers have each traveled more than 15 billion winding miles to the very edge of the solar system -- and us with them, only to find ourselves metaphorically back home, and, as T. S. Eliot wrote, to know the place for the first time.

PERSON: Robert S. Ingersoll 

HEADLINE: Robert Ingersoll, 96, Dies; Served as Envoy to Japan

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Robert S. Ingersoll, who took his business acumen as head of one of the country's largest manufacturing corporations to the diplomatic table as ambassador to Japan and later deputy secretary of state, died on Aug. 22 at his home in Evanston, Ill. He was 96. 
His daughter Nancy Ingersoll Foster confirmed his death.
Mr. Ingersoll was chairman and chief executive of the Chicago-based Borg-Warner Corporation when President Richard M. Nixon appointed him ambassador to Japan in 1972. He was the first business executive named to the post since World War II; all but one of the others had been career diplomats.
The appointment came at a time of strained relations between Washington and Tokyo, primarily over economic issues. Mr. Ingersoll's company had long had joint ventures and licensing arrangements with major Japanese companies.
With Japan's economy booming, the primary source of tension was its $3.5 billion trade surplus with the United States. In 1972, after negotiations with Mr. Ingersoll, Japan agreed to import $750 million in American manufactured goods and another $390 million in agricultural products.
Mr. Ingersoll was promoted to assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs in 1974 and a year later was named deputy secretary of state, a post he held for two years.
He was the State Department's lead voice in 1976 when foreign governments sought the identities of officials in their countries who were suspected of receiving millions of dollars in bribes from the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation. Mr. Ingersoll said the accusations had done ''grievous damage'' to United States foreign relations and promised to provide information about the payoffs.
The scandal led to the resignations, but not prosecutions, of two top Lockheed officials; the resignation of a Dutch prince from his military and business positions; and the conviction of a Japanese prime minister.
As head of Borg-Warner, Mr. Ingersoll presided over a diversified corporate empire that in 1972 had $1.15 billion in annual sales and 38,000 workers in 22 countries. The company primarily manufactures automotive products, including transmissions. As American automakers turned from Borg-Warner to their own subsidiaries for transmissions, the company expanded its sales to foreign companies, and its transmission business jumped from 42,000 units in 1962 to 487,000 in 1971.
Robert Stephen Ingersoll was born in Galesburg, Ill., on Jan. 28, 1914, one of four children of Roy and Lulu Ingersoll. He graduated from Yale in 1937. In 1939, after working at another company, Mr. Ingersoll joined the Ingersoll Steel and Disc Company, which was owned by his father and later merged with Borg-Warner. He was selected to succeed his father as chairman and chief executive in 1961.
Mr. Ingersoll's wife of 63 years, the former Coralyn Reed, died in 2001. In addition to his daughter Nancy, he is survived by two other daughters, Gail Ingersoll Ransom and Elizabeth Ingersoll Carroll; a brother, James; 11 grandchildren; and 21 great-grandchildren.
Before and after his diplomatic career, Mr. Ingersoll served on the boards of numerous corporations, foundations, and arts and educational institutions. He also taught Sunday school at the Winnetka Congregational Church.

HEADLINE: Life Spins On, But the Midway Still Beckons

BYLINE: By RICK LYMAN. 
Rick Lyman is a deputy national editor at The New York Times.

 BODY:
IN 1932, when the Great Depression was getting its second wind, a New York-based wire editor for the Associated Press published a novel about the agricultural shows he remembered from his childhood in a middle-of-nowhere Iowa town that doesn't even exist anymore.
Phil Stong's ''State Fair'' was a smashing success. Bleaker than the 1945 Rodgers & Hammerstein musical film it inspired, Stong's book connected perfectly with the dark, nostalgic mood of a country struggling through economic calamity. Following those good-hearted bumpkins to the Iowa State Fair and watching them collide with the preening city slickers from Des Moines was like watching a new nation being born.
That was more than three-quarters of a century ago -- and still the state fairs go on. 
It's happening right now, out in some field somewhere in America. Impervious to competition from television, the Web and the shopping mall, state fairs still rumble to life -- from Dallas to the Twin Cities, Phoenix to Tampa, Indianapolis to Syracuse.
Despite urbanization, suburban sprawl, the collapse of family farms and the rise of corporate agriculture, every year, regular as the seasons, the midways light up, the Tilt-a-Whirls clang to life and the judges study the ample rumps of the local livestock.
My plan was to spend a summer week doing a kind of state-fair circuit -- a 2,700-mile road trip hitting three fairs in different parts of the country to see what, if any, echoes remain from Stong's stubborn, sentimental vision.
The season has already proven mixed for some fairs. At the California State Fair in July, for example, attendance rose 10 percent to 741,189, sparked by a ''recession special'' that provided free admission to anyone presenting an unemployment check stub. But then stick-up men got away with $100,000 of the fair's cash.
In general, though, our own era's financial collapse appears to have boosted attendance at fairs across the country, from Delaware to Wisconsin to Minnesota -- a rise fair officials attribute, in part, to the relative affordability of the events, as summer outings go.
It would be a long drive. And along the way there would be deep-fried Oreos, grilled bratwurst and church-sponsored plates of peppery fried chicken.
With luck, and a strong stomach, one might even get a look at whatever new country is being born right now in that place -- perhaps the only place -- where country meets city, suburb and exurb in a shoulder-to-shoulder immersion in half-forgotten American traditions and deep-fried everything.
DELAWARE STATE FAIR
Harrington, Del.
I slipped over the cobalt waters of the Delaware River and headed south onto the Delmarva Peninsula. Strip malls and divided highways slowly gave way to woods and field, tractor sales and horses gamboling behind white fences.
I hadn't actually been much of a fair person until recent years. I was raised in a farm state, Indiana, but it was in an industrial suburb of Chicago. The only farm I knew was Pepperidge. I went to a couple of county fairs as a teenager, just for something to do over the summer, but had never been to a state fair until I started covering politics and had to follow candidates around. I think it was while I was being herded through the amazing Minnesota State Fair in 2004 with Vice President Dick Cheney's entourage that I began to be fascinated with the things.
Huge, maze-like and teeming, they reminded me a bit of Vegas casinos -- chaotic looking at first, but gradually revealing the underlying pattern of food stalls over here, midway rides over there, agricultural barns hugging the periphery. The slapdash and transitory nature of it, the sense of a place that was thrown up over a weekend and could disappear overnight, is part of the pleasure. You can get lost in a state fair; it rewards exploration.
Most state fairs have taken place for decades in or near the state's biggest city or capital. Partly, that's because such sites were most accessible, the place all the highways went. But it was also by design, to give the country folk an exciting taste of city life as they gathered with their stock and traded tips on the latest farming trends -- and to give city folk, many of them only a generation or two off the farm themselves, a whiff of the old life.
The Delaware State Fair is atypical, more than an hour south of Wilmington amid rolling fields and small farming towns. Like all three fairs I visited, it was a labyrinth of temporary (food carts, concession stalls, traveling midway rides) and permanent structures (barns, exhibition halls), and as I wandered up and down the narrow paths between the stalls, I tried to divine the inscrutable calculus that goes into figuring out which booths go where.
Yes, no doubt, state fairs these days are not as connected to the nation's farm life as they once were. But they don't yet feel entirely ersatz, either. You have the sense that there's still something authentic going on: Those are real animals raised by real kids in those straw-covered stalls; that sawdust exuding a faint eucalyptus-like aroma is not just for show.
''I like the rides, but I like the animals, too,'' said Rylee Hurd, 6, as she surveyed a line of Holsteins lying on a bed of straw in the sprawling Dairy and Beef Barn. A fair is different from a carnival, she explained, because there are farm animals at a fair.
I had arrived in the afternoon heat, and within an hour, it was taking its toll; I found myself looping back to the relative cool of the pork barn one too many times, taking in an auction and a showmanship contest just to escape the blaze.
Mostly, I just wandered and enjoyed the organized chaos. Cape Cod Smoothies were sold beside a trailer offering lobster bisque. Leather goods and ''redneck couture'' were on display beside some Maryland Eastern Shore Crab Cakes, and every third or fourth booth offered something deep fried, from funnel cakes to corndogs to more modern concoctions like deep-fried Oreos, Snickers and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
The gut-busting wonder of the fair this year, though, was a delicacy new to Delaware, though already popular elsewhere -- a cheeseburger enclosed not by a bun but by a pair of glazed doughnuts. It had done quite well at the Florida fair last year, but there seemed few takers this afternoon in Delaware. Still, many people mentioned it. A new, ghastly food concoction is big news at state fairs these days.
As the afternoon furnace melted into an evening swelter, I could hear the first dull rumbles of a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert, part of its ''God and Guns Tour,'' and made my slow way toward my $45 seat.
On my way, I paused to admire that afternoon's installment of the state fair parade -- a marching band from the town of Smyrna, a princess with a tiara in a horse-drawn carriage, several tractors and Shetland ponies, a float from the Kent County 4-H and a National Guard Humvee with a loudspeaker playing a song by the Zac Brown Band whose recurring chorus was ''We don't have a lot of money.''
OHIO STATE FAIR
Columbus, Ohio
I had driven over the Chesapeake, threading between Baltimore and Washington on traffic-choked highways before sliding into West Virginia and, finally, Ohio -- about 10 1/2 hours in the car. The ocean light gave way to green hills and murky hollows before I dropped into the Ohio River basin and the plains of the Midwest.
On its face, the Ohio fair was not all that different from the one I'd just left. It was significantly larger, yes (sprawling across 400 acres just north of downtown Columbus), but the look of the place, the mix of food carts and T-shirt stalls, was almost eerily similar; some of the attractions were exactly the same.
But while the crowd at the Delaware fair was predominantly white, with a wide array of gimme caps from John Deere and other farm equipment and fertilizer companies, the mix of fairgoers in Columbus was clearly drawn from the immediate surrounding city; multi-ethnic groups of teenagers in T-shirts and baggy jeans amid the usual cluster of stroller-pushing mothers. It was harder to pick out the real farm families, though they were there. A young man wearing a sleeveless T-shirt that said ''I Love Freakin' Brooklyn'' rested a sinewy hand on the shoulder of his wife, her left arm covered with floral tattoos. From New York? I asked. ''What? Hell, no,'' he said. ''Never been there, don't want to go.'' Some cousin bought him the shirt. He was a pig farmer, working at his uncle's place northwest of Dayton, and hoped to someday have his own small place. In both the 1945 film version of the novel ''State Fair'' and a 1962 remake, the men dress up in ties and jackets to stroll the midway, and the women wear dresses and fancy hats.
I always figured that was a bit of Hollywood license, but Luis Perez, the Ohio fair's assistant general manager, said that people actually did get dolled up to come to the fair when he started working there three decades ago.
''Now it's a more casual thing,'' he said, watching the passing parade of athletic shorts, T-shirts, flip-flops and a variety of tattoos and baseball caps.
I had planned to sample as much as I could stand of the deep-fried oddities that have come to dominate the food courts, and here -- according to Mr. Perez -- last year's headliner was still making waves: deep-fried buckeyes. The crispy-on-the-outside chocolate-and-peanut-butter globs named for the nut that is the state's symbol had people lined up all day and were sold five for $5. There was an initial crunch, as the fried coating cracked, followed by a warm, cocoa ooze and a final blast of peanut butter. Delicious, yes, but five?
Fine for dessert, but what about a main course? ''The new thing this year,'' confided C. LaVon Shook, a former shuttle driver at the fair who has become its official historian, ''is chocolate-covered bacon.''
Skewered on a wooden stick, fried crisp and then dipped in milk chocolate before going into a refrigerator, this delicacy was going for $3. I held to one, but then made the mistake of asking Christina Leeds, the fair's marketing director, if there was anything else new on the menu. ''Hey,'' she called out to a co-worker, ''What's that new pork product?''
It was the Pig Wing -- a rib chop with the bone trimmed to create a kind of handle. The ''wings'' were fried and coated in a spicy sauce to mimic hot chicken wings and were available only in the Taste of Ohio pavilion, featuring separate booths for each of the state's meat products. A single was $3.25; a dinner plate $5.50.
A short walk down the midway, at Pork Chop Downs, a carnival barker assembled a crowd of passers-by to celebrate the provenance of this new dish by watching three especially corpulent pigs (China Doll, Tyrone the Terrible and Shakin' Bacon) waddle around a sun-baked track.
China Doll won by a snout.
BANGOR STATE FAIR
Bangor, Me.
I had taken two days to follow the Lake Erie shoreline to Buffalo, then arc across north-central New York into the Berkshires, inch my way around Boston and finally squeeze into Maine. The deadening heat had finally subsided, replaced by a bracing breeze that shook the pines and rattled the tarp on the back of a truck I followed in stop-and-go traffic over the Piscataqua River and all the way to the outskirts of Augusta.
It was on a Sunday morning that I made my way through a deserted downtown Bangor to the fairgrounds across from a casino on the south side of town. I was a little faired out, frankly -- the essential sameness of the Delaware and Ohio fairs led me to expect simply more of the same. But the Bangor fair turned out to be pleasingly different: smaller, rougher around the edges and, surprisingly, more concerned about the midway and the carnival rides than the agricultural component.
A couple of barns, including an educational exhibit for kids called Old McDonald's Farm, were located on the back side of the fairgrounds, and after making my way over there when the fairgrounds opened, I found myself almost alone with the animals, their minders and Rindy Fogler, the fair's agricultural superintendent.
Ms. Fogler was monitoring the proceedings with a calm, practiced eye. She'd been one of those kids, she said, not so long ago, earning money for college with her fair winnings. ''When I did it, you'd go to one fair and that was it, but nowadays people spend the whole summer and fall going from fair to fair to fair,'' she said.
One by one, the teenagers led their calves in a long arc around the shaded green, guiding them with a flexible rod, presenting each side of the animal to the watchful judge.
Slowly, the families began to trickle over from the midway until there was a thick crowd around a clutch of just-born piglets, and I jumped aboard the shuttle bus in search of some midafternoon cholesterol.
I was girding myself for another blast of arcane deep-fried cuisine, but found only a handful of corndog stands and one selling deep-fried Oreos. ''We don't get that much up here,'' said Mike Dyer, who operates the harness-racing facility for the City of Bangor that becomes the fair's backdrop. ''We only started getting corndogs a few years ago.''
For lunch, I had a lobster roll and a small carton of fried clam bellies, washed down with fresh-brewed iced tea. I felt almost healthy.
By the onset of evening, the new crowds were gathering along the midway, where slowly, as the sun sank from sight, the chaotic splendor of the rides took over the Bangor skyline.
There was a line of nearly 75 people waiting to ride Freak Out, one of those spinning, twisting, high-flying affairs in which the riders are seated in a circle where they can watch one another as the world blurs. I settled, instead, for the huge Ferris wheel, the blaring midway music fading as I -- along with a family of four from Portsmouth, N.H. -- rose in our circular gondola higher and higher above central Maine. A soft, moist breeze blew across the Penobscot River and turned the young mother's cardigan into a superhero's cape.
Something about the Bangor fair, almost a boutique version of the larger fairs in Delaware and Ohio, had revived me after a long, hot week.
Driving home, back to the inescapable city, I thought about the people I'd talked to and the odd purpose these fairs serve. Many people go just for something to do, something that could involve the whole family. But there also seems to be a group that I can only call fair people, those who are drawn to the events, often by memories of fairs they'd attended as children. For these people, the fair is part of the annual calendar, alongside Halloween and fireworks on the Fourth of July. They want to pass along to their children their own early childhood love of the awesome, temporary spectacle.
At the end of Stong's novel, Abel Frake, the protagonist and patriarch, has a small epiphany. During their three days at the fair: ''The Frakes had stepped for a moment into a fantasy; now, unchanged, they were returning to that five hundred acres where only birth and death -- not even marriage -- had been the only changes for four generations.''
And that's what a state fair is. Because they are transitory events and because they mix the familiar pleasures of a carnival with the homespun virtues of America's farms, they seem to occupy a kind of magical space, where even cholesterol can be ignored.
But in the end, Stong said, it's a temporary fantasy. That's part of the appeal. After the fair, you go back home.
IF YOU GO
State fairs are held all year long -- perhaps just to rub it in, Florida holds its fair in February -- but most run from late July through early October, often coinciding with local harvest seasons so people can show off their giant pumpkins and prize tomatoes. Following are some notable current or coming fairs.
The Minnesota State Fair
Aug. 26 to Sept. 6 in St. Paul
Known as the ''Great Minnesota Get-Together,'' the fair drew a record 1.8 million visitors last year and hopes to break the record again this year. One of the largest fairs in the country, it is in a perennial battle with Texas over which state's fair is the greatest.
The Great New York State Fair
Aug. 26 to Sept. 6 in Syracuse
Billing itself as ''New York's largest annual event,'' the fair sprawls across 375 acres at the State Fairgrounds and Empire Expo Center just west of Syracuse, attracting nearly 1 million visitors each year.
Colorado State Fair
Aug. 27 to Sept. 6 in Pueblo
Drawing around a half-million visitors a year, the Colorado fair is not nearly as big as some of the old, established fairs. Its attractions include such Western favorites as rodeos and horsemanship competitions, as well as a small animals exhibition featuring rabbits, pigeons and exotic birds.
State Fair of Texas
Sept. 24 to Oct. 17 in Dallas
The largest state fair in the country, with attendance estimated at more than 3 million, and among the longest, running for 24 days. It is at the cutting edge of the deep-fried food movement, even trademarking the slogan ''Fried Food Capital of Texas.''
Common Ground Country Fair
Sept. 24 to 26 in Unity, Me.
Not actually a state fair, but for those who have little taste for carnival rides or deep-fried candy bars, the Common Ground fair, run by the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association, is a healthy alternative built on the notion of promoting locally grown, organic foods. There are no rides, but there is dancing, singing, livestock demonstrations, presentations on composting and recycling, and a vegetable garden parade in which children dress up as veggies.

HEADLINE: In Haven for Over-55 Set, Age Police Hunt Violators Who Shriek or Toddle

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

 BODY:
SUN CITY, Ariz. -- From behind the wheel of his minivan, Bill Szentmiklosi scours the streets of Sun City in search of zoning violations like unkempt yards and illegal storage sheds. Mostly, though, he is on the lookout for that most egregious of all infractions: children.
With a clipboard of alleged violations to investigate, he peers over fences and ambles into backyards of one of America's pioneer retirement communities, a haven set aside exclusively for adults, where children are allowed to visit but not live.
Mr. Szentmiklosi, 60, a retired police officer who settled here four years ago, has remade himself as the chief of Sun City's age police, the unit charged with ensuring that this age-restricted community of sexagenarians, septuagenarians and even older people does not become a refuge for the pacifier-sucking, ball-playing or pimple-faced.
One recent morning, as he slowly wheeled between ranch homes and palm trees, Mr. Szentmiklosi kept a sharp eye on the driveways and yards, surveying for any obvious signs of youth. It could be a stray ball, a misplaced pint-size flip-flop. In sniffing out children, he said, he relies on his three decades as an officer. 
But it is when he strides up to a home, dressed in shorts, sandals and a polo shirt, and knocks on the door that his detective work really begins. He tells the suspected violator that a neighbor has complained and he asks gentle questions to get to the bottom of things, all the while peering around for signs of youthful activity. His work is helped by a simple reality: children are hard to hide.
They leave tracks and make unique sounds. Newborns bellow, toddlers shriek and teenagers play music that is not typical around Sun City.
Mr. Szentmiklosi and his fellow child-hunters have their work cut out for them. The number of age violations in Sun City, a town of more than 40,000 residents outside Phoenix, has been rising markedly over the years, from 33 in 2007 to 121 in 2008 to 331 last year, a reflection of a trend at many of the hundreds of age-restricted communities nationwide.
This year's figures are expected to be even higher, said Mr. Szentmiklosi, who knows that despite his patrols Sun City is probably harboring more children that have not yet been detected. The economic crisis is aggravating the problem, he said, forcing families to take desperate measures to cut costs, even if it means surreptitiously moving into Grandma and Grandpa's retirement bungalow.
The vigorous search for violators of Sun City's age rules is about more than keeping loud, boisterous, graffiti-scrawling rug rats from spoiling residents' golden years, although that is part of it. If Sun City does not police its population, it could lose its special status and be forced to open the floodgates to those years away from their first gray hair.
The end result would be the introduction of schools to Sun City, then higher taxes and, finally, an end to the Sun City that has drawn retirees here for the last half-century.
At 50, Sun City is not old by the standards of Sun City, where the average resident is in his or her early 70s.
To remain a restricted retirement community, at least 80 percent of Sun City's housing units must have at least one occupant who is 55 or older, allowing for younger spouses or adult children. But the rules are clear on one thing: no one, absolutely no one, who is a teenager, an adolescent, a toddler, a newborn, any form of child, may call Sun City home.
''Visits are O.K. as long as they're limited,'' said Mr. Szentmiklosi, who describes himself as a doting grandfather and insists that he does not have an anti-child bone in his body. ''You can have children visit for 90 days per year. That means if you have 10 grandchildren, each one can visit, but they can only stay nine days each.''
Mr. Szentmiklosi, the compliance manager for the Sun City Homeowners Association, said that although the city was scrupulous, it remained compassionate. For instance, it allowed a young woman with an infant who was renting a home without the association's knowledge a year to move out.
But the association also plays hardball, issuing fines and threatening legal action to pressure youthful violators to leave. One reason Sun City is so vigorous is because of what happened on the other side of 111th Avenue, one of the main roads traversing the neighborhood.
Although Del Webb, who developed Sun City in 1960, gets credit for inventing the idea of a community of active retirees, the concept actually started years before on an adjacent tract in what was called Youngtown. But the developers there were not diligent in drawing up their legal paperwork. A challenge by the family of a teenage boy led the state to strip Youngtown of its age restrictions in 1998.
So on one side of the road, little people can be seen running around. On the other side, many people remember the Great Depression, and not from reading about it in a book.
''It was so much quieter before,'' said Librado Martinez, 80, a retired machine operator who lives on the Youngtown side of the line and has to put up with children playing ball in the park in front of his house. ''You heard no screams before.''
That peace is what Sun City residents want to keep. They rose up last month to block a charter school, which is not governed by the same rules as other public schools, from moving in.
''They were concerned about children roaming the streets and terrorizing things,'' said Marsha Mandurraga, who works for the school's founder.
To prevent future incursions, Sun City's leaders are using their clout to urge state legislators to change the law to keep Sun City school-free.
''I've raised kids,'' said Chris Merlav, 61, breathing through an oxygen tank and resting on the side of a Sun City pool designed for walking, not swimming. ''After a while you get to the point where you don't want to be bothered anymore.''
Mr. Merlav, who moved here from Rochester, had evidence at hand that he was not anti-child. His 20-year-old stepdaughter, Danielle Anastasia, was lounging in the pool with him. She understood the desire of Sun City residents to be with people their own age. ''It's like me hanging with my college friends,'' she said.
Some of Sun City's more hard-line anti-child activists can sound as though they somehow bypassed youth completely.
''There are people here who have never had children, don't care for children and don't particularly want children around,'' said Jan Ek, who runs Sun City's seven recreation centers, eight golf courses, two bowling centers and assorted other entertainment venues, some of which sometimes open up for child visitors.
At Sun City's museum, the resident historian, Bill Pearson, 62, played a videotape used to lure retirees to the development in the 1960s.
The narrator said then what many residents still say now: ''Of course we love them and enjoy their visits, but you deserve a little rest after raising your own.''

HEADLINE: Determined to Learn

 BODY:
I WAS the third of four children in a family in Langroud, an agricultural area in northern Iran near the Caspian Sea. My father owned a trucking company. My mother was a homemaker who did not read or write. Her parents would not allow her to attend school after the government in the 1930s abolished the requirement that women cover their heads.
My father did not subscribe to all of the traditional strictures for women. My sisters had arranged marriages, but he always supported my passion for learning. When I was 4, my parents hired private tutors in reading, writing and math. The next year, I wanted to go to the nearby all-girls public school, but the entry age was 6. The school agreed to let me sit outside the classroom. Eventually, I was allowed inside. 
Within a few years, I knew I wanted to go to the United States for my schooling, but I needed the academic preparation available in Tehran. When I was 12, my parents rented an apartment there, hired a maid to take care of me and sent me to a private all-girls school. I was admitted to the prestigious engineering school in Tehran, but at 19 I left Iran to study electrical engineering at McGill University in Montreal.
While I was there, I married an Iranian student. After I got my degree in electrical engineering in 1971, the Bechtel Corporation hired me and moved us to Edmonton, Alberta, for a mining project. My first child, Sateez, was born there. The following year, Bechtel moved us to its headquarters, San Francisco, where I worked on designing refineries and power plants. Three years later, I had my daughter, Payvand.
In 1976, when my children were 3 years old and 6 months old, Bechtel asked me to return to Alberta to work on Syncrude, a major project extracting oil from sand. My husband -- we later divorced -- stayed in San Francisco to work on his doctorate.
The town, Fort McMurray, was small, and baby-sitting was scarce. So my parents found an Iranian woman from our village, and she traveled to Canada to help me. We lived in a three-bedroom trailer on the construction site, which was a challenge because the temperatures sometimes fell far below zero.
Two years later, I returned to San Francisco and began my management career, supervising 35 electrical engineers. I was later in charge of the company's microelectronics division, which oversaw construction in the pharmaceutical, biotech and semiconductor industries.
As a woman, I never hit a glass ceiling or felt discriminated against, but I did not have many role models or the networks that male engineers have. So I began to mentor others, founding a society for women engineers in San Francisco and traveling to college campuses to talk to women about the field.
After a decade, I wanted to build bigger and faster. So, in 1988, I founded Quasar Services, which provided construction and facilities management services to major companies, including Intel. We gradually shifted to providing software to help companies and government agencies automate the management of data and information so they could spend less time and money on facilities, real estate management and construction projects.
In 2000, I folded the firm into a new company, Skire Inc., and our software is now being used to manage some huge construction projects. Those include the Metropolitan Transit Authority's East Side Access project, which will link the Long Island Rail Road to Grand Central Terminal in New York.
The company has had double-digit sales increases every year, but my biggest challenge is to keep that growth on track during the economic downturn.

HEADLINE: Years Later, No Magic Bullet Against Alzheimer's

BYLINE: By GINA KOLATA

 BODY:
BETHESDA, Md. -- The scene was a kind of science court. On trial was the question ''Can anything -- running on a treadmill, eating more spinach, learning Arabic -- prevent Alzheimer's disease or delay its progression?''
To try to answer that question, the National Institutes of Health sponsored the court, appointing a jury of 15 medical scientists with no vested interests in Alzheimer's research. They would hear the evidence and reach a judgment on what the data showed.
For a day and a half last spring, researchers presented their cases, describing studies and explaining what they had hoped to show. The jury also heard from scientists from Duke University who had been commissioned to look at the body of evidence -- hundreds of research papers -- and weigh it. And the jury members had read the papers themselves, preparing for this day.
The studies included research on nearly everything proposed to prevent the disease: exercise, mental stimulation, healthy diet, social engagement, nutritional supplements, anti-inflammatory drugs or those that lower cholesterol or blood pressure, even the idea that people who marry or stay trim might be saved from dementia. And they included research on traits that might hasten Alzheimer's onset, like not having much of an education or being a loner. 
It is an issue that has taken on intense importance because scientists recently reported compelling evidence that two types of tests, PET scans of Alzheimer's plaque in the brain and tests of spinal fluid, can find signs of the disease years before people have symptoms. That gives rise to the question: What, if anything, can people do to prevent it?
But the jury's verdict was depressing and distressing. So far, nothing has been found to prevent or delay this devastating disease, which ceaselessly kills brain cells, eventually leaving people mute, incontinent, unable to feed themselves, unaware of who they are or who their family and friends are.
''Currently,'' the panel wrote, ''no evidence of even moderate scientific quality exists to support the association of any modifiable factor (such as nutritional supplements, herbal preparations, dietary factors, prescription or nonprescription drugs, social or economic factors, medical conditions, toxins or environmental exposures) with reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease.''
''I was surprised and, at the same time, very sad'' about the lack of evidence, said Dr. Martha L. Daviglus, the panel chairwoman and a professor of preventive medicine and medicine at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University. ''This is something that could happen to any of us, and yet we are at such a primitive state of research.''
She said, ''In the end, we concluded that the evidence is the evidence and we have to say what it is.''
The state of the evidence reflects in part the long time it took before researchers even realized that Alzheimer's was a disease, said Dr. Richard J. Hodes, director of the National Institute on Aging. Until the mid-1980s, many thought dementia was a normal part of aging, and so serious studies of its causes and prevention did not really begin until then. Scientists have spent the years since searching for factors that might affect risk, checking data from other studies to see if, for example, diet or blood pressure or years of education might be associated with the disease.
In the meantime, doctors are in a bind. Should they tell people to do things like walk briskly or eat vegetables -- activities that might someday be shown to protect against Alzheimer's and that certainly cannot hurt? Or should they wait for absolute proof, confirmation that a diet or a drug or an exercise regimen prevents Alzheimer's?
The Alzheimer's Association tells people to exercise, challenge themselves mentally, remain socially engaged and keep their hearts healthy. Such measures can only help, says Dr. Maria C. Carrillo, a senior director of the organization.
But, she said, ''The Alzheimer's Association certainly agrees that there is not enough evidence to say anything definitive about the prevention of Alzheimer's disease and any kind of intervention.''
Of course, Dr. Hodes said, there are many reasons to follow practices to improve general health. But, he said, researchers have to be careful about implying that any measures will protect against this degenerative brain disease.
''We don't know that yet,'' Dr. Hodes said.
Rating the Quality
Dr. John W. Williams Jr., head of the Duke group that evaluated the studies, thought the task would not be too arduous. He expected relatively few studies and clear results.
To its great surprise, the Duke group discovered a vast amount of literature on Alzheimer's prevention. Instead of coming up empty on many topics, Dr. Williams said, ''We came up empty on very few.''
The problem, the group wrote, was that ''the quality of the evidence was typically low.''
Most studies observed people who happened to use or not use a possible preventive measure and then determined whether they got Alzheimer's or not.
Such studies, known as observational ones, are not the gold standard, like those in which people are randomly assigned to take a pill or do something like exercise, or not. Observational studies are useful in generating hypotheses but are not proof. Still, if several well-done studies of this type come to the same conclusion, they can be valuable evidence.
In the case of Alzheimer's prevention, though, the studies tended to have problems, Dr. Williams said.
Often it was not clear precisely what subjects were doing. They might have been using a drug or a supplement at the start of the study but the dose was not specified, nor was it clear whether subjects were taking the same doses, or for how long.
Some studies of drugs to lower blood pressure used self-reports as opposed to, for example, pharmacy data. A 12-year study asked participants about their use of cholesterol-lowering statins at the start of the study but never did again. A nine-year statin study used pharmacy records but included as users those who took the drugs at any time during the study period.
Definitions of conditions, like high blood pressure, tended to vary from study to study.
Descriptions of factors like ''strong social support'' were vague or idiosyncratic. For example, some studies classified married people as having strong social support for that reason alone, with no evaluation of whether the marriage was good or bad.
Often, there were vague assessments of Alzheimer's disease. And often studies did not take into account other differences among subjects, like age or family history of Alzheimer's, that might have independently led some to get the disease and others not.
Looking over the piles of studies, the group rated evidence as high, moderate or low, depending on how confident they were in the findings.
Low confidence did not necessarily mean the measures did not work -- it meant the evidence was so faulty that there was no way of deciding.
In the end, it said it was highly confident in the findings for just one thing, the herb ginkgo biloba. But in that case the evidence pointed in only one direction: it did not prevent Alzheimer's.
Moderate evidence, not totally convincing but not worthless, applied to only four factors studied.
Two were factors that increased risk. They were a particular gene, ApoE4, which, moderate evidence showed, increased risk about threefold, and menopause therapy with a combination of estrogens and progestins, which doubled risk.
The other moderate evidence indicated that certain things that had been hoped to be protective were not. For instance, there was moderate evidence that vitamin E, found in nuts, vegetable oils, green leafy vegetables and fortified cereals, had no effect on risk. There was also moderate evidence that cholinesterase inhibitors, drugs often used to treat Alzheimer's symptoms, had no effect.
Other than that, evidence was poor.
There is only poor evidence, for example, that keeping your brain active, having a high level of education or exercising has a protective effect. There is also only poor evidence that eating a Mediterranean diet -- high in fruits and vegetables, fish and olive oil -- will help stave off Alzheimer's.
There is only poor evidence that having poor social support or smoking increases risk.
In a way, it is not surprising that many thought the evidence was stronger than it was, says Dr. James R. Burke, a member of the Duke group and director of the Memory Disorders Clinic at Duke.
''You remember the positive studies,'' Dr. Burke said. ''The ones that are more marginal, you tend to put them out of your mind.''
And many things thought to protect against Alzheimer's -- a healthy diet, vigorous exercise and an active brain -- just seem to be common sense. The science jury said it was still possible that those measures might be found to help and urged that better quality studies be done.
But that may not be so easy if studies have to follow people until they get the disease. Alzheimer's seems to progress silently in the brain for a decade before the earliest symptoms of memory problems surface. It can take another decade until the distinctive signs of Alzheimer's appear: profound memory loss and an inability to handle the normal activities of daily life like bathing and dressing.
''Once there is even minimal cognitive impairment, the brain is damaged, inflamed, burning like a bonfire,'' said Dr. Caleb Finch, director of the Gerontology Research Institute at the University of Southern California.
As a result, high-quality studies of possible factors like diet and exercise or mental stimulation before the disease's onset might have to last for decades.
In the meantime, patients, like those at Dr. Burke's Memory Disorders Clinic, and their frightened family members want advice about things they can do now.
He tells them to do all they can to stay healthy: keep their heart disease risk factors under control, eat a good diet, exercise. He tells them that even if good health cannot prevent Alzheimer's, it might delay its onset.
''We don't have compelling evidence or proof that this will prevent Alzheimer's disease,'' he says. But those measures, he adds, ''would improve quality of life.''
But Dr. Williams, head of the Duke group, said it was also important to keep an open mind; the measures may or may not affect a person's chances of getting Alzheimer's.
''Unfortunately, in medicine,'' he said, ''things that are logical and make good sense don't necessarily work out.''
The Problem, Personified
Elise Schoux of Washington is facing the prevention problem. She is 53, an age when prevention might make sense -- when Alzheimer's strikes, people usually are in their 70s and 80s -- and she is watching her 70-year-old husband's slow decline into the dread disease.
Bill Schoux's memory had been deteriorating for years, but in July 2009, when he got the diagnosis, Mrs. Schoux was devastated.
''For two weeks, we were at a loss, we would burst into tears,'' she said. ''How could this be?''
Mr. Schoux had been an athlete all his life, he ate a healthy diet, he was friendly and outgoing. He had been an expert on foreign aid, traveling around the world, and had certainly had a mentally stimulating career. Mrs. Schoux is not sure how much more her husband could have done to ward off Alzheimer's. But she wants to do everything she can to protect herself from getting it and to slow the disease in him.
So Mrs. Schoux now unfailingly goes to the gym with her husband several days a week, lifting weights and spending 30 minutes on a treadmill or an elliptical cross trainer.
Her husband always worked crossword puzzles. Now she does them, too. She and her husband have a subscription to a local theater. And they read the newspaper every day.
''It can't hurt to keep the brain cells moving,'' Mrs. Schoux said.
Mrs. Schoux also tries to eat blueberries, salmon, intensely colored fruits and dark leafy vegetables, in case that helps.
She knows that much of what she is trying is unproved but feels that it can, at worst, be harmless.
''I don't know what the answers are,'' Mrs. Schoux said. ''I hope they find something. It is a seriously debilitating disease.''
The Vanishing Mind: Articles in this series are examining the worldwide struggle to find answers about Alzheimer's disease.

HEADLINE: Egg Factory

BYLINE: By VERLYN KLINKENBORG

 BODY:
On Friday, most of the country's major newspapers, including The Times, featured reports from a small town called Clarion, Iowa. Just outside Clarion are the egg operations, owned by the DeCoster family, at the heart of the salmonella outbreak. The factory -- no point calling it a farm -- called Wright County Egg, is the source of 380 million of the more than 500 million recalled eggs. 
I grew up in Clarion. My family lived there from 1954 to 1963 during what now looks like a golden era for American farming. When I was back a couple of years ago, I noted the most evident change, a significant population of Mexican workers. I hoped that they were able to love Clarion as much as I did. It's unlikely, because I also saw where they worked.
When I was young, I thought I grasped the immensity of the Iowa landscape. The immensity of the soybean and corn fields has only grown because so many smaller farms have vanished as a result of government farm policy, which rewards economic concentration. As I turned off Highway 3 east of town, I saw that there was a newer immensity, the egg factories -- an endless row of faceless buildings, as bland as a compound of colossal storage units but with the air of a prison.
It wasn't simply that the operation is out of scale with the Iowa landscape. It is out of scale with any landscape, except perhaps the industrial districts of Los Angeles County. What shocked me most was the thought that this is where the logic of industrial farming gets us. Instead of people on the land, committed to the welfare of the agricultural enterprise and the resources that make it possible, there was this horror -- a place where millions of chickens are crowded in tiny cages and hundreds of laborers work in dire conditions.
It takes only a little investigation to learn how bad things have been inside those buildings. The list of offenses for which the DeCosters and their farms have been fined in Iowa and Maine only begins with hiring children and illegal immigrants.
In 2000, Jack DeCoster, the operations' founder, was named a ''habitual violator'' of Iowa's environmental laws. His egg factories have been cited by OSHA for deplorable working conditions. In 2003, Mr. DeCoster paid more than $1.5 million to settle an employment discrimination suit charging that 11 women working in the Clarion plants had been subject to sexual harassment, including rape and threats of retaliation. There have been nearly 1,500 illnesses as a result of the salmonella outbreak. Every one of the billions of eggs produced this way has been tainted.

HEADLINE: In Hard Times, One New Bank (Double-Wide)

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
LAKE CHARLES, La. -- The only new start-up bank to open in the United States this year operates out of a secondhand double-wide trailer, on a bare lot in front of the cavernous Trinity Baptist Church. A blue awning covers the makeshift drive-through window.
Called Lakeside Bank, it is run by a burly and balding former tackle for Louisiana State's football team named Hartie Spence, who doles out countrified humor along with deposit slips and the occasional loan.
''This is the one place where the cause of death is mildew,'' he quipped, standing outside the trailer in withering heat. 
Asked how his bank in this steaming town of oil refineries and oversize casinos managed to win over federal regulators, Mr. Spence, 70, said, ''I'm still thinking it's my looks that did it.''
The dearth of new banks follows a particularly wrenching period for the industry. As the financial crisis deepened, hundreds of banks and thrifts closed and thousands more were saddled with bad loans and credit card defaults, costing the industry billions of dollars.
As a result, the number of investor groups applying to start a new bank from scratch has dropped precipitously. And for the intrepid few who have tried, regulators -- sharply criticized for lax oversight in recent years -- are being particularly stingy in granting approval.
So far this year, Mr. Spence holds the privilege of opening the only truly new federally insured bank. (In seven other instances, investors received regulatory approval to buy an existing bank, usually one that had failed, and reopen it).
Of course, many of the nation's biggest banks were bailed out by the government, and have since rebounded. But since January 2008, more than 280 smaller banks and thrifts have been closed, and many community banks are struggling to recover from the real estate collapse.
Those bank failures have cost the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's fund roughly $70 billion, and not surprisingly, the agency's regulators are now giving greater scrutiny to new bank applications, according to bankers and industry officials.
Technically, banks obtain charters from their primary regulatory agency, either state banking regulators or, for national banks, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. But the charters are contingent on the applicants' obtaining deposit insurance from the F.D.I.C.
The F.D.I.C. said the reduction in charters simply reflects the effects of the recession on new businesses. ''There was considerable interest in forming banks before the economy deteriorated,'' said an agency spokesman, David Barr. ''In today's climate we are seeing very little interest.''
However, last year the agency toughened its oversight of new banks, saying banks that had been open for fewer than seven years were ''over represented'' among failed banks in 2008 and 2009.
The reason, the agency said in a public release, is that many new banks strayed from their approved business plans and ran into problems because of ''weak risk management practices,'' among other problems.
Ralph F. ''Chip'' MacDonald III, a lawyer in Atlanta who advises banks on regulatory matters, said he believed the F.D.I.C. had imposed an ''unofficial moratorium'' on new bank charters, a charge that the agency denies.
Adam Taylor, president of the Bank Capital Group, an Atlanta company that helps investors set up new banks, said he had several recent clients, whom he declined to name, withdraw applications for new banks after it became clear that the F.D.I.C. would not approve them. He said the agency rarely denies charters -- a fact confirmed by agency records -- but that it places the applications in ''purgatory'' until the applicants give up.
The number of banks and thrifts -- also known as savings and loans -- in the United States has been declining steadily for 25 years, because of consolidation in the industry and deregulation in the 1990s that reduced barriers to interstate banking. There were 6,840 banks and 1,173 thrifts last year, down from 14,507 banks and 3,566 thrifts in 1984.
The number of charters has generally declined too, though there have been periodic swings. The lowest number of bank charters granted in any one year was 15, in 1942.
How, then, did Lakeside Bank win this year's regulatory lottery?
Mr. Spence's looks aside, he said that regulators were not ready to grant approval until Lakeside had raised enough capital, created a sufficiently conservative business plan and hired an experienced management team.
The initial idea for Lakeside Bank came from a local real estate developer, Andrew Vanchiere, who was dissatisfied with his existing bank. In 2007, he rounded up a group of local businessmen who set about raising $13 million in start-up capital and began looking for someone to run the bank.
The initial candidates were deemed too inexperienced by regulators. When the group contacted Mr. Spence in 2008, he was a few months into retirement and coming to the realization that fishing for trout and redfish just wasn't enough to keep him occupied.
''I was bored absolutely stiff,'' said Mr. Spence, who had successfully run several Louisiana banks during his career. ''My response was, 'Let's do it!'
''You can manage a good bank in a bad economy, particularly when you are at the bottom,'' he said. Noting that he has a clean balance sheet and can be selective about making loans, he added, ''I thought it was a perfect time to be starting.''
Lakeside's application was also helped by the surprising vitality of Lake Charles, a city of 72,000 roughly 30 miles from the Texas border. Lake Charles has gotten a boost from casino gambling and the oil and gas industry, as well as an infusion of new businesses, including liquefied natural gas terminals and a new plant that builds parts for nuclear reactors.
Louisiana, meanwhile, has fared better than many states during the economic downturn because of the petroleum industry and the infusion of government and insurance money to pay for damages from Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Ike.
Only one bank has failed in Louisiana since the financial crisis began.
Regulators made it clear that Lakeside would not be approved if other banks in town were struggling to stay afloat, Mr. Spence said. But Lakeside, which opened on July 26, sits on a busy boulevard lined with about a dozen or more banks or credit unions, all of which appear to be thriving.
''There's enough for all of us, and we are no threat to them for many, many years,'' Mr. Spence said of his competitors.
Lakeside Bank is promoting itself as an old-fashioned community bank that focuses on customer service and bread-and-butter banking products, even though it also makes them available online.
Whereas loan decisions for many big banks are made in distant cities, Mr. Spence said that Lakeside will make them right there in the double-wide trailer, at least until the bank moves into a more permanent structure in a year or two.
''That's our motto, 'The Way Banking Should Be,' '' he said, adding later, ''It got rushed enough yesterday that I had to answer the phones and work the switchboard.''

HEADLINE: The State of New Orleans

BYLINE: By AMY LIU and NIGEL HOLMES. 
Amy Liu is a senior fellow and deputy director of the metropolitan policy program at the Brookings Institution. Nigel Holmes is a graphic designer.

 BODY:
IN five years, New Orleans has weathered America's costliest natural disaster, its worst recession since the 1930s and its largest oil spill. Believe it or not, some good news has come out of all this. 
None of it started out good, of course. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina flooded 80 percent of New Orleans and destroyed more than 182,000 homes in the metro area. Two years later, the Great Recession arrived, drying up private capital for redevelopment and blunting the job gains that had been expected from rebuilding. Then, in April, the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded, wreaking havoc on the region's already battered economy and environment. The latest job figures indicate that the hospitality sector has largely held steady since the spill, likely benefiting from the influx of people responding to the emergency, while the oil and gas industry lost jobs. The combined effects of the recession and the oil spill have pushed the area's unemployment rate to 7.5 percent.
Yet, New Orleans is emerging as a model of rebirth and reinvention.
New Orleanians, with government and philanthropic partners, have advanced many reforms meant to make the city ''better than before,'' including a bold charter school experiment, an overhaul of the region's health care delivery system, sweeping changes in criminal justice and a new inspector general's office that is rooting out waste and corruption. Nearly 60 percent of Orleans Parish students now attend a public school that meets state standards, more than twice as many as did before Hurricane Katrina. Community groups are rebuilding the Lower Ninth Ward, Gentilly and other city neighborhoods.
Still, New Orleans remains a work in progress. While the metro area economy is showing signs of improvement, with an increasing number of knowledge-based jobs and entrepreneurs and rising average wages, the area's biggest industries -- tourism, oil and gas, and shipping -- began shedding jobs long before the oil spill. Poverty rates in the city remain high, while the suburban poor now outnumber those in Orleans Parish. The city's lack of affordable housing means that 58 percent of renters pay more than a third of their income for their apartments. Violent crime rates are still higher than they were before the storm. And the wetlands, which sustain thousands of coastal jobs, are rapidly disappearing.
Though it's been half a decade since Katrina made landfall, the storm's effects remain. But if leaders continue the transformation they've begun, they can make New Orleans a model of resilience and metropolitan prosperity.

HEADLINE: Off the Rails

 BODY:
After a week of epic awfulness, Long Island Rail Road riders are getting on with life, but with teeth sore from gritting. A railroad is only as strong as its weakest switching station, and after a small fire Monday at Jamaica Station took out century-old switches, the L.I.R.R., the nation's largest commuter railroad, was crippled. 
Thousands of trains were canceled or delayed; testing and repairs dragged on. ''L-I-R-Argh!'' said the Newsday headline, summing it up perfectly.
The chaos was another reminder that the region's transportation infrastructure is ancient and still suffering from neglect dating to New York City's 1970s financial collapse. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority's successes since then, like the revitalized subways, are built on a shaky foundation, due to years of underfunding from city, state and federal governments and the gross accumulation of debt.
The latest downturn has caused havoc; the M.T.A. is facing an $800 million budget shortfall, which it is likely to close through steep service cuts and fare increases, and more neglect of maintenance and upkeep.
All the Long Island rider cares about, of course, are the past week's delays and cancellations. What no politician dares to say is that this is a result of choice, in a country that has poured most of its grid-building money into highways, while neglecting mass transit.
Some progress is on the way. A new computerized switching system was planned for Jamaica well before the fire; a rail hub is being built in lower Manhattan; we may even see a Second Avenue subway, an L.I.R.R. stop on the East Side, and a new Pennsylvania Station. Many of those improvements have been in the works for decades. And too many parts of the sprawling system will continue crumbling from age.
The days of large-scale, farsighted government investment in mass transit ended early in the last century, when those Jamaica switches were new. It is past time to start again.

HEADLINE: Upstarts Chip Away at Power Of Feudal Pakistani Landlords

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE; Waqar Gillani contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MUZAFFARGARH, Pakistan -- In Pakistan, where politics has long been a matter of pedigree, Jamshed Dasti is a mongrel. The scrappy son of an amateur wrestler, Mr. Dasti has clawed his way into Pakistan's Parliament, beating the wealthy, landed families who have ruled here.
In elite circles, Mr. Dasti is reviled as a thug, a small-time hustler with a fake college degree who represents the worst of Pakistan today. But here, he is hailed as a hero, living proof that in Pakistan, a poor man can get a seat at the rich men's table.
Mr. Dasti's rise is part of a broad shift in political power in Pakistan. For generations, politics took place in the parlors of a handful of rich families, a Westernized elite that owned large tracts of land and sometimes even the people who worked it. But Pakistan is urbanizing fast, and powerful forces of change are chipping away at the landed aristocracy, known in Pakistan as the feudal class.
The result is a changing political landscape more representative of Pakistani society, but far less predictable for the United States. Mr. Dasti, 32, speaks no English. His legislative record includes opposition to a sexual harassment bill. He has 35 criminal cases to his name and is from the country's conservative heartland, where dislike of America runs deep. 
How this plays out is crucial to Pakistan's future. The country's fast-expanding, flood-weary population needs local government as never before, but with political power shifting and institutions stillborn, the state has never been less able to provide it.
''You have scarcity arising everywhere,'' said Ali Cheema, chairman of the economics department at the Lahore University of Management and Science. ''Scarcity creates conflict. Conflict needs mediation. But the state is unable to do it.''
In Mr. Dasti's area, one of the hardest hit by the recent flooding, the state has all but disappeared. Not that it was ever very present. In the British colonial era, before Pakistan became a separate country, the state would show up a few times a month in the form of a representative from the Raj dispensing justice.
Later, the local landowner took over. For years, feudal lords reigned supreme, serving as the police, the judge and the political leader. Plantations had jails, and political seats were practically owned by families.
Instead of midwifing democracy, these aristocrats obstructed it, ignoring the needs of rural Pakistanis, half of whom are still landless and desperately poor more than 60 years after Pakistan became a state.
But changes began to erode the aristocrats' power. Cities sprouted, with jobs in construction and industry. Large-scale farms eclipsed old-fashioned plantations. Vast hereditary lands splintered among generations of sons, and many aristocratic families left the country for cities, living beyond their means off sales of their remaining lands. Mobile labor has also reduced dependence on aristocratic families.
In Punjab, the country's most populous province, and its most economically advanced, the number of national lawmakers from feudal families shrank to 25 percent in 2008 from 42 percent in 1970, according to a count conducted by Mubashir Hassan, a former finance minister, and The New York Times.
''Feudals are a dying breed,'' said S. Akbar Zaidi, a Karachi-based fellow with the Carnegie Foundation. ''They have no power outside the walls of their castles.''
Mr. Dasti, a young, impulsive man with a troubled past, is much like the new Pakistan he represents. He is one of seven siblings born to illiterate parents. Despite his claims of finishing college, he never earned a degree, something his political opponents used against him in court this spring. One of the 35 criminal cases against him is for murder, a charge he said was leveled by his political opponents. Detractors accuse him of blackmailing rich people in a job at a newspaper. He said he was writing exposes.
''I have more enemies than numbers of hairs in my head,'' he said, bouncing down a road in a borrowed truck. ''They don't like my style, and I don't like theirs.''
Whatever the case, he is deeply appealing to Pakistanis, who have chosen him over feudal lords for political seats several times. Local residents call him Rescue One-Five, a reference to an emergency hot line number and his feverish work habits. Constituents clutching dirty plastic bags of documents flock to his small office for help, and he scribbles out notes for them on his Parliament letterhead like a doctor in a field hospital.
''The new faces have to work much harder because their survival depends on it,'' said Sohail Warraich, chief political correspondent for Geo TV. ''If they lose an election, they're finished.''
He wields his lower-class background like a weapon, exhorting local residents to oppose the rich elite and the mafias of landlords, bureaucrats and other petty power brokers who support them.
''This was not an election,'' he shouted at a sweaty crowd, referring to a race he won against an aristocrat in May. ''This was a fight between the poor and the rich, between the public and the powerful classes.''
Graffiti nearby said: ''Give us electricity and we'll give you a vote.''
Lineage alone is no longer a winning strategy. Ahmed Mehmoud, an aristocrat in South Punjab, lost both Parliament seats he contested in 2008 and had to settle for a provincial assembly seat.
''The seats are no longer so safe,'' said Nusrat Javed, a journalist who is an expert on politics in Punjab. ''You can't survive as a mere feudal anymore.''
Mr. Mehmoud, 48, is a wealthy man of leisure, who spends more time relaxing in his house -- a pink replica of a Rajasthani palace with a hand-carved facade -- than on his job as a lawmaker. Sometimes he talks to his constituents, but more often he watches them go by from the window of his speedy, white Hummer.
For years, people voted for him anyway, partly out of habit. His ancestors were considered to be distant relatives of the Prophet Muhammad, which inspires awe and respect. But more important, his constituents were tied to him economically. His family owned the land they worked and often their houses. His carpet has a worn patch where generations of peasants sat in supplication.
But now, said Shama Andleep, a local voter: ''On election day, people are asking questions. People are calculating: how much has he done for us?''
Private television stations, which exploded onto the scene eight years ago, have also had an effect. Khusro Bakhtyar, a landowner in the area, said the women who were baking bread in his house were so affected by the coverage of the 2007 death of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto that they voted for her party, not his.
The changes have steered Pakistan into uncharted territory, and the effect for the United States is unclear. Unlike Mr. Mehmoud, who is unabashedly pro-American, newcomers like Mr. Dasti are more skeptical. Mr. Dasti opposes the American drone program that is used to attack militants in Pakistan, but he is not as virulently anti-American as many in his country.
The changes also leave room for Islamists. In the neighboring district of Dera Ghazi Khan, a hard-line mullah, Hafiz Abdul Karim, came within a few thousand votes in 2008 of unseating Farooq Leghari, a former president of Pakistan. His weapon? Efficient, Islamist campaign workers and free water pumps.
So far, Islamists have not tapped popular frustration in a systematic way at the ballot box, and the military, the country's oldest, strongest institution, would probably put down any broader uprising, analysts say.
But the floods and the misery they have brought have raised the stakes.
''If you don't give the common man justice, there will be more terrorism and even bloody revolution,'' Mr. Dasti said. ''This is the need of the hour.''

HEADLINE: New Business Model: College Games In Pro Stadiums

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON

 BODY:
People who rank such things -- and credit or blame can be given here to Rivals.com -- say the Sept. 6 showdown between Boise State and Virginia Tech is the Super Bowl of the nonconference portion of the college football season. Fittingly, it will be played in a stadium of professional gladiators, FedEx Field in Landover, Md., home of the Washington Redskins.
In accordance with the American need to attach a catchy name to every showdown of championship consequence, let's call it the New Economic Reality Bowl. 
''There's going to be at least 60,000 Hokies fans and hopefully 10,000 Broncos fans so I'm not sure you can actually call this a neutral-site game,'' Gene Bleymaier, the Boise State athletic director, said in a telephone interview.
Boise State, ranked third in the Associated Press preseason poll, has been guaranteed $1.25 million for the opportunity to get a high-quality victory under its belt before continuing its case for a Bowl Championship Series title game by wiping its funky blue field with the comparative weaklings of the Western Athletic Conference.
Virginia Tech, ranked 10th, will earn $2.35 million to make sure its fan base carpools its way east so the ESPN cameras will not reveal too many empty seats for its prime-time showing.
''Our expectations are that the game will be a sellout,'' said Mitch Gershman, the Redskins' chief operating officer, who said that ''creating a year-round relationship'' with the team's season-ticket and suite holders was the primary impetus behind its hunger for college football business. FedEx Field will host a second college game on Nov. 20 when Penn State visits its Big Ten rival Indiana, which has been promised a cool $3 million to deprive its student and community fan base of one Saturday game and tailgate.
''What you're seeing on both ends is how much the sports industry has been impacted by the economic slowdown,'' said Marc Ganis, who runs a Chicago-based sports consulting firm. ''From the pro side, this is an industry that has far less liquidity, falling selling prices and more debt across the board, especially for the teams that have built new stadiums.''
Hence the need to fill buildings that most days of the year resemble scaled-down models of the Grand Canyon. Among other off-campus games this fall, Notre Dame will play Navy at New Meadowlands Stadium on Oct. 23 and Army at Yankee Stadium on Nov. 20; Louisiana State and North Carolina kick off their season Sept. 4 at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta; and Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Tex., will feature Oregon State and Texas Christian on Sept. 4 and Arkansas and Texas A&M on Oct. 9.
''People are going to pay for the games depending on how successful the games are in terms of attendance and television ratings,'' said Larry Scott, who has been aggressively trying to upgrade the Pac-10 Conference's national identity since becoming commissioner in 2009. ''But from the college end, what you're seeing is an increasing sophistication in the way athletic directors and schools are thinking about their brands and their recruiting.''
As an example, Scott said that playing in Cowboys Stadium allowed Oregon State of the Pac-10 to give two key players, Jacquizz and James Rodgers, the opportunity to play in their home state and simultaneously market the university in football-rich Texas.
At the same time, Scott agreed that however lucrative the so-called neutral-site game might become, there is a potential downside to the college game doing too much business with the pros that is both financial and ethical.
''I've got a little hedge in that the concept is still being developed,'' he said. ''The schools have to be mindful of their community fan and small-business base that is hungry for home games. I think that obligation is likely to keep this in check.''
Or perhaps not, said Ganis, acknowledging a recent N.C.A.A. report that just 14 of the 120 Football Bowl Subdivision universities made money from campus athletics in the 2009 fiscal year, down from 25 the year before.
''The schools have got tremendous financial pressures to make money from the revenue-producing sports,'' he said. ''The football costs are exorbitant -- coaching salaries, facility upgrades, higher tuition for scholarship players. So I think this is a trend that will increase.''
The games, he said, are likely to have a distinct look.
''With the Penn State-Indiana game, notice they're not taking a game from Happy Valley, only from a place where they'd get a smaller crowd and less money,'' Ganis said. ''It's likely to be a home game from a weaker team in a major conference, giving that team a better chance to compete.''
Or from a smaller conference power looking to enhance its polling power in big-market territory.
''We would prefer home and home with the good teams, and we've tried, but they won't come here,'' Boise State's Bleymaier said. So the Broncos and their adventurous fans -- they have sold 7,000 tickets -- will come east to face the Hokies and their horde, grateful that at least the playing surface at FedEx Field promises to be level.

HEADLINE: The Holdouts

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
''WHEN,'' announced Luis Davila, glancing at the clock: 11 a.m.
''When,'' repeated his colleague, Oana Marian, confirming the code.
The two grabbed their cigarettes, punched G in the elevator and zipped down 28 floors to one of the last remaining refuges for the New York City smoker: the sidewalk, in this case a concrete canyon separating the two wings of the old MetLife building across Madison Avenue from Madison Square Park.
Parliament, Marlboro, Winston, Benson & Hedges glow throughout the day in this canyon as smoker after smoker dashes down, lights up and vanishes again like a wisp of smoke. Between drags, they gab into their cellphones, soak in the solitude, pace to the curb and back, or chat briefly, most conversations lasting only as long as the ember at the tip of their cigarettes. 
They know one another's faces and throw a quick nod or wave this way and that, but the names and back stories go mostly untold. Ms. Marian, 51, first lighted up in her native country, Romania, where everyone smoked, inhaling her first stream of nicotine along with the mountain air at a summer camp outside of Bucharest. Mr. Davila, 36, who straddled New Jersey and Ecuador as a child, remembers buying two packs a day for his dad. Linda Greene's father bribed her not to smoke; she pocketed the cash and lighted up anyway. Up the canyon, there is a Vietnam War veteran, a pack-a-day man who wakes up every morning determined to quit.
They are the holdout smokers. The ones who have survived the ever-scarier health warnings (and the social stigma that made the Vietnam veteran ask that he not be identified in this article); the ones who have persisted despite legislation banning butts from bars, restaurants and office buildings; the ones who keep paying those rising taxes, the latest of which, starting this summer, raised the typical price in New York City to $11 a pack. The ones who can't, won't or just don't give it up.
The city's health department, in a 2008 study, found that 959,000 adults in New York, or 15.8 percent of that population, smoked. A bit more than half of those are 25 to 44 years old (as are 46 percent of the city's population); 53 percent of them are men (compared with 46 percent of the city); 41 percent are white (39.5 percent). People who live in the Bronx and on Staten Island are more likely to smoke than those in Queens and Manhattan. Unemployed people are much more likely; 23 percent of them smoke, and they account for 15.5 percent of the smokers, compared with 9.3 percent of the overall population. Nineteen percent of New Yorkers born in the United States smoke, compared with 11 percent of immigrants.
They all hope to quit, at some point, and they are even known to celebrate their dwindling numbers. When a woman on Mr. Davila's team at HRG, a travel management company, quit two years ago -- with the help of prescription medication -- colleagues decorated her cubicle with congratulations. Mr. Davila, an operations supervisor at the company, said he would stop if he became a parent. For sure.
''Oh, yeah, I'm going to quit,'' he said. ''Eventually, when I'm ready, I'll quit.''
There was a time, not so long ago, that no one lingered, cigarette in hand, between the MetLife buildings on East 24th Street. They smoked at their desks, or, later, in a smoking lounge. Then in 1995, City Hall started rolling out its restrictions and the herding began: big room to small room, inside to outside, public to private, acceptable to anathema.
Today, the stigma runs deeper than ever. ''They look at you like you just clubbed a baby seal,'' Mr. Davila said.
Once in a while, he and the others point out that their smoke rings are nothing compared with the fumes buses belch out onto city streets. They wonder aloud why the city does not address that hazard. Not that they don't know: People need buses. People don't need smokers.
So they stand in ever-shrinking clusters all over New York, their turf continually circumscribed, or so it seems. A few months ago, a new sign went up at the MetLife buildings: No smoking within 25 feet. The smokers, by now regulated into submission, mostly complied by moving from the front door to the side of the building. When it rains, they crowd under a tiny overhang near the loggia and hope the security guard won't shoo them away like loiterers at a convenience store.
The latest $1.60 cigarette tax, which the state passed in June to help close a $9 billion budget gap, has inspired some of them to roll their own. Others are downgrading to cheaper, harsher brands, including some made in China -- ''One cigarette and you have throat cancer,'' Mr. Davila complained. New Jersey residents make sure to stock up at home, and when Mr. Davila announced he was going on a business trip to North Carolina -- Mecca for smokers -- Ms. Marian was quick to ask for a carton.
''So, are you doing anything this weekend?'' he said to Ms. Marian, his partner in exile. The clock was ticking. Back to work.
''NOBODY knew how bad it was,'' said the Vietnam veteran, a man of 64 with a ruddy face and a slight paunch who prefers short answers to long questions.
Back in ninth grade, maybe 10th, at Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx, he tapped that first Chesterfield out of the pack and put it to his lips. It was the early 1960s, the era of ''Mad Men,'' when cigarettes oozed charm and the only place you really couldn't light up was at church.
He grew up in Yorkville, in Manhattan, and, after school, took the bus to Spanish Harlem to help his father run the family candy store, where newspapers jostled for space on overstuffed racks. Cigarettes were 35 cents a pack, give or take. Unlike many other dads, his smoked only a couple a day; his mom, a homemaker, didn't have a taste for tobacco at all.
But when their son picked up the habit, they didn't blink. A teenager without a cigarette during the Kennedy era was like a young woman out on the town without a set of heels. Not easy to find.
He was a good student, a math whiz who studied chemical engineering at Manhattan College. In 1968 he joined the Air Force and, inevitably, shipped out to Vietnam, where he was a combat photographer for 15 months in the Central Highlands, an area that suffered some of the war's heaviest fighting.
''Basically, they trained me on the aircraft cameras,'' he recalled. ''I said, 'Yeah, sure, why not?' Most of my pictures appeared in Stars and Stripes or were classified.''
Back in the United States, he scrounged around for a job like so many other returning servicemen, and landed at Irving Trust, where he met his wife; they married in 1971. He never left banking or lost his taste for cigarettes. (He would not allow the name of his current company to be published -- that anti-smoking stigma again.)
His wife managed to quit six or seven years ago. ''She was getting emphysema and stuff like that,'' he said. So he smokes outside, on the deck of his Staten Island house, or at the front door. None of his friends smoke; his daughter does, but not his two sons.
These days, he zips down for a Marlboro Light twice in the morning, at lunch, and twice in the afternoon. Sure, he feels winded when he climbs stairs. But it's not as if he was planning on running a marathon. ''My doctor used to smoke in the office with me,'' he noted. ''Now he says, 'You know I have to tell you to stop smoking.' ''
He has tried quitting. Acupuncture worked for a couple of weeks. Cold turkey lasted a day. A prescription pill he took briefly was deemed harmful. The nicotine patch did nothing; he smoked while wearing it. The gum -- ''a waste of time.'' Hypnosis: a disaster.
''Everybody who got hypnotized threw their cigarettes on the back table,'' he said. ''I walked out and grabbed my cigarettes, and all theirs, too.''
''I'VE never been a heavy smoker,'' Mr. Davila explained after putting out his Parliament Ultralight. ''I like it, but not that much. Plus, I know that it's really bad for me.''
This is a common refrain among those who line the canyon. They classify themselves mostly as dabblers -- a few cigarettes a day, no more than half a pack. They don't feel enslaved to their addiction because they don't feel the need to light up right after dinner, on the train, on a plane, in the house, in the car. They comfortably sidestep the word addict.
Like the Vietnam veteran, Mr. Davila started as a teenager, 20 years ago, while attending an American school in Ecuador, where his parents were born. He and his best friend, Chris, were out shopping at a mall. ''Chris said, 'I'm going to light up,' and I said, 'What's that like?' '' he recalled. It was menthol. ''I thought, 'If this is what a cigarette is like, I want one.' ''
After that, Mr. Davila smoked a few when he went out with friends. He kept it hidden from his parents, who wouldn't have approved. The habit followed him to Jersey City, where he went to St. Mary's High School, back when cigarettes cost $4 a pack, and then to Saint Peter's College.
Clubbing was his weakness. Hard not to smoke with a drink in his hand. He doesn't drink much anymore. And now he has rules: he and Ms. Marian go down to the street once in the morning, once at lunch and once more in the afternoon. He seldom smokes on weekends, never in the Montclair, N.J., home he shares with his wife. ''She hates it,'' he said.
His father-in-law is a chef, a skill passed on to his wife, and, tempting as it is to light up after a sumptuous meal, he takes a pass nowadays. That's progress. Before, he said, ''after eating, if I didn't have a cigarette in my hand, I would go berzerko.''
''And I don't smoke in the car, no way,'' he said. ''I don't want to smell like an ashtray.''
Though Mr. Davila long ago made peace with living on the wrong side of acceptable, the latest commandment, ''no smoking within 25 feet of the building,'' unnerved him.
''Where do you draw the line?'' he said. ''What's next? That's the whole thing. You feel like you're a second-class citizen, worse than before.''
''I always thought it would have made me sick or made me cough,'' Ms. Marian said as she recalled her first drag, at 16, at that summer camp in Romania. ''But it was like I had always smoked.''
Her father was a journalist and her mother worked at the National Theater; both smoked. Her father's position brought them privilege -- a nice apartment in the center of Bucharest, the summer camp. Ms. Marian attended a government school that focused on physics.
She smoked off and on, mostly at a cafe over a cup of coffee. But it wasn't until she moved to Haifa, Israel, with her mother, after her father died, that she bought her first pack. She was a student again, studying electromagnetic engineering at Technion, Haifa's polytechnic university. Everyone smoked, so she smoked more.
She met her husband there. He was studying civil engineering. They began as friends in 1981 and romance seeped in. In 1986, they married. In time, she tossed engineering aside to help a friend with corporate accounts at a travel agency.
''I always liked to travel,'' she said. ''All these nice places. It spoke to me.''
Moving to the United States was a key goal. She settled into Jackson Heights, Queens, in 1990 with her husband and had a son, who graduated from Bronx High School of Science two years ago. He is 19 now, a sophomore at the State University at Stony Brook. She worked first as manager of an Israeli restaurant in Queens, then jumped to reservations at a travel agency, and now coordinates travel road shows for clients of HRG, a huge firm specializing in corporate travel.
She became a citizen in 2000 and, like many immigrants, is fiercely loyal and proud of her adopted country. ''If anybody asks what I am, I say American,'' she said.
But, like a parent with a gifted child who doesn't live up to expectations, she has been occasionally disappointed. She expected a meritocracy, where hard work and intelligence rule the day, and found that whom you know and how you present yourself can best the best. The smoking rules, too, bring back a few memories of her childhood.
''Land of the free, I envisioned it that way,'' she added. ''I probably idealized it. Being born and raised in a Communist regime, I was looking for the exact opposite -- capitalism, free market, individual freedoms.''
''I really try to be a courteous smoker,'' Ms. Greene said. ''If I'm smoking a cigarette on the street and run into a friend, I won't have them stand downwind.'' If someone is visiting her apartment who does not like cigarettes, she does not light one. ''I use Febreze all the time,'' she said, ''on the rugs and on the furniture.''
At 62, Ms. Greene is an executive assistant for a large financial services organization whose identity she wants to keep to herself. She stands alone on the sidewalk, which is how she began her smoking life. She was 15 and stole a Pall Mall from her sister's pack -- no filter -- then ran into a cornfield that was shouting distance from her home in Conyngham, Pa.
''I got sick,'' she recalled. ''Nauseous.''
She persevered: ''Everyone was doing it, advertising it, glamorizing it.'' Her father, who owned a heavy-equipment business, had quit before she was born and was determined to keep cigarettes away from his three daughters. He made a bargain: every month, he forked over $100 to each girl as long as she did not smoke. Taking a chapter from ''King Lear,'' the girls smoked anyway, just out of his line of vision.
''After dinner we would all get up, and he would say, 'Where are you going, dollies?' '' Ms. Greene recalled. ''It went on a couple of years. He knew it didn't work. He was just pleased we didn't smoke in front of him.''
In New York, she landed a job at Alcoa and smoked at her desk, at the movies, on a plane, at the dentist's office. ''Even on a plane, I always asked someone next to me if it bothered them,'' she said. ''I did have one nun who said yes. I was furious.''
She doesn't know why she smokes. She likes it. What more is there? Why she doesn't quit is easier to pinpoint. ''I don't want to gain weight.'' Once in a while, when her husband gets fed up with the haze in their one-bedroom apartment a quick walk from Madison Square Park, he'll demand that she put out ''that damn cigarette,'' Ms. Greene said. ''I just say no.''
She does limit it to about 10 per day, or her chest hurts. She knows she has the will power to quit: She lost 40 pounds three years ago and stopped a lifelong habit of cracking her knuckles before that. But it will be on her terms. ''I have to decide I'm going to quit,'' Ms. Greene said. ''It can't be someone else who decides.''

HEADLINE: Taking Stock

BYLINE: By ROGER LOWENSTEIN. 
Roger Lowenstein, an outside director of the Sequoia Fund, is a contributing writer and the author of ''The End of Wall Street.''

 BODY:
It has been three decades since Business Week proclaimed ''The Death of Equities'' on its cover. That 1979 obituary for the stock market, published when the Dow Jones industrial average languished at a mere 875, became a symbol of an age of doubt. So shattered were ordinary Americans by gas lines, recessions and double-digit inflation that they resorted to pulling cash out of equity mutual funds -- for eight straight years.
Investors in the '70s were stunned by an alarming rise in volatility. The comfortable, ordered system of international exchange, in place since the Bretton Woods accord at the end of World War II, had come apart, leading to violent fluctuations in currency values. Grain shortages sent food prices soaring, and memorably, OPEC put the squeeze on oil. The cumulative effect was a loss of faith in money itself. (Doomsayers urged redeploying assets into metals, oils -- anything other than paper.) Inflation, a virulent form of instability, terrified investors, who duly stayed on the sidelines. 
It may seem strange to be drawing parallels to the '70s now -- prices are so stable that the fear is of deflation. Yet there is no mistaking the '70s-ish gloom that has overtaken Wall Street. The trauma of the financial crisis has yet to be dispelled. It is not just Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns that have disappeared but an ethos of confidence in long-term investing.
Though stocks remain well above 2009 lows, investors are withdrawing money from U.S. equity funds for the third straight year. Dispiritingly, investors are shunning attractively priced stocks in favor of bonds (both government and corporate) on which the returns are anemic.
The current crisis was inspired by financial shocks rather than commodity disruptions. But the result is a familiar malaise. The international monetary system, hobbled by imbalances and deficits, seems broken. Another echo is the sense that the sheer number of economic problems precludes a solution to any one of them. In 1979, an investment analyst was heard to despair, ''The future is clouded by many ugly questions.'' Today analysts despair over high unemployment, failing mortgages, government deficits, impotent political responses, a weakening economy and a similar litany abroad. In another echo, Chicken Little has staged a comeback. In the early '80s, an energy consultant forecast -- in this magazine -- a ''high probability'' of an oil shock in which ''the basic legitimacy of our political system might be called into question.'' Today's version is hyping the possibility of a stock-market crash. Albert Edwards, an investment strategist for the French bank Societe Generale, has said he expects a ''bloody, deep recession'' that produces a stock-market collapse of at least 60 percent. He recently drew a crowd of 600.
Of course, any such forecast could prove right. But it is generally more lucrative to sell prophecies of doom than to act on them. What the herd tends to overlook is that stocks are not -- except perhaps in the very short term -- a bet on the odds of an apocalypse, nor are investors in securities rewarded for their prowess as macroeconomists. The real challenge of investing is so prosaic it is often forgot. Stocks are simply a claim on future corporate earnings: if you can buy those claims at a discount, you should do well.
Wise men will disagree on the meaning of ''at a discount.'' But American business is profitable even today. And the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index is trading at only 12 times the expected earnings of the underlying stocks over the next year. Inverting that ratio, stocks have an earnings yield of 8.5 percent. (Each $100 of stocks is backed by $8.50 of expected earnings.)
Compare that with Treasury bonds, on which the yield is a dismal 2.58 percent. Short-term bond rates are well under 1 percent. The gap between 8.5 percent and 2.58 percent represents a striking reversal. For most of the past generation, bonds yielded more, sometimes much more, than stocks. The theory was that since earnings would grow over time, investors in stocks would accept a lesser return at the outset. They would pay for growth.
Now investors are flocking to bond funds; they are paying to avoid uncertainty -- to avoid the prospect of financial Armageddon. Americans whose attitudes toward investing were shaped by bibles like ''Stocks for the Long Run'' seem to have undergone a fundamental rewiring. Perhaps when you are out of a job, the long run doesn't matter. ''People would rather overpay for bonds than underpay for stocks,'' says David Kelly, a strategist for J. P. Morgan Funds. ''It's a function of years of very miserable stock returns. And just a general fog of gloom over the country right now.''
In markets, of course, gloom is no more permanent than boundless optimism. For the previous generation, the turn arrived in 1982 -- three years after ''The Death of Equities.'' It was fueled by corporate raiders, who could not resist seeming bargains on Wall Street and whose takeover bids sent share prices soaring.
There is no telling how long the present funk will last, but there are signs it could end in similar fashion. Corporations in droves have been exploiting low interest rates by borrowing. I.B.M. raised $1.5 billion at a record-low interest rate of 1 percent. It used a chunk of its haul to acquire a software vendor. Borrow cheap and buy low.
So far, ordinary consumers remain too in hock or too frightened to do either. What money they have is going into bond funds. ''The individual investor is saying no mas to equities,'' notes Robert Barbera, the chief economist for Mount Lucas, a private investment firm. It is hardly a stretch to say that the recovery of companies like I.B.M. is being fueled by the willingness of small investors to lend to them on the cheap.
Most of the people buying bond funds do not use a calculator in making investment decisions. They are captives, understandably, of their experience. But gloom and doom also has its price. It would be a sad twist if people were to mirror their recent excessive risk-taking with excessive caution now.

HEADLINE: What Can Be Done?

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

 BODY:
THE American economy is once again tilting toward danger. Despite an aggressive regimen of treatments from the conventional to the exotic -- more than $800 billion in federal spending, and trillions of dollars worth of credit from the Federal Reserve -- fears of a second recession are growing, along with worries that the country may face several more years of lean prospects.
On Friday, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Fed, speaking in the measured tones of a man whose word choices can cause billions of dollars to move, acknowledged that the economy was weaker than hoped, while promising to consider new policies to invigorate it, should conditions worsen.
Yet even as vital signs weaken -- plunging home sales, a bleak job market and, on Friday, confirmation that the quarterly rate of economic growth had slowed, to 1.6 percent -- a sense has taken hold that government policy makers cannot deliver meaningful intervention. That is because nearly any proposed curative could risk adding to the national debt -- a political nonstarter. The situation has left American fortunes pinned to an uncertain remedy: hoping that things somehow get better. 
It increasingly seems as if the policy makers attending like physicians to the American economy are peering into their medical kits and coming up empty, their arsenal of pharmaceuticals largely exhausted and the few that remain deemed too experimental or laden with risky side effects. The patient -- who started in critical care -- was showing signs of improvement in the convalescent ward earlier this year, but has since deteriorated. The doctors cannot agree on a diagnosis, let alone administer an antidote with confidence.
This is where the Great Recession has taken the world's largest economy, to a Great Ambiguity over what lies ahead, and what can be done now. Economists debate the benefits of previous policy prescriptions, but in the political realm a rare consensus has emerged: The future is now so colored in red ink that running up the debt seems politically risky in the months before the Congressional elections, even in the name of creating jobs and generating economic growth. The result is that Democrats and Republicans have foresworn virtually any course that involves spending serious money.
The growing impression of a weakening economy combined with a dearth of policy options has reinvigorated concerns that the United States risks sinking into the sort of economic stagnation that captured Japan during its so-called Lost Decade in the 1990s. Then, as now, trouble began when a speculative real estate frenzy ended, leaving banks awash in debts they preferred not to recognize and hoping that bad loans would turn good (or at least be forgotten). The crisis was deepened by indecisive policy, as the ruling party fruitlessly explored ways around a painful reckoning -- boosting exports, tinkering with accounting standards.
''There are many ways in which you can see us almost surely being in a Japan-style malaise,'' said the Nobel-laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz, who has accused the Obama administration of underestimating the dangers weighing on the economy. ''It's just really hard to see what will bring us out.''
Japan's years of pain were made worse by deflation -- falling prices -- an affliction that assailed the United States during the Great Depression and may be gathering force again. While falling prices can be good news for people in need of cars, housing and other wares, a sustained, broad drop discourages businesses from investing and hiring. Less work and lower wages translates into less spending power, which reinforces a predilection against hiring and investing -- a downward spiral.
Deflation is both symptom and cause of an economy whose basic functioning has stalled. It reflects too many goods and services in the marketplace with not enough people able to buy them.
For more than a decade, the global economy was fueled by monumental spending power underwritten by a pair of investment booms in America -- the Internet explosion in the 1990s, then the exuberance over real estate. As housing prices soared, homeowners borrowed against rising values, distributing their dollars to furniture dealers in suburban malls, and furniture factories in coastal China.
But the collapse of American housing prices severed that artery of finance. Homeowners could not borrow, and they cut spending, shrinking sales for businesses and prompting layoffs.
Early this year, some economists declared that the cycle was finally righting itself. Businesses were restocking inventories, yielding modest job growth in factories. Hopes flowered that these new wages would be spent in ways that led to the hiring of more workers -- a virtuous cycle.
But the hopes failed to account for how extensively spending power had dropped in the American economy, and how uneasy people were made by every snippet of data showing that houses were not selling, employers were not hiring, and stock prices were foundering.
Now, a new cause for concern is growing: the flat trajectory of prices, which might metastasize into a full-blown case of deflation.
The primary way to attack deflation is to inject credit into the economy, giving reluctant consumers the wherewithal to spend. The chief deflation fighter is the Federal Reserve, which traditionally adjusts a benchmark overnight rate for banks that influences rates on car loans, mortgages and other forms of credit. The Fed pulled this lever long ago, and has kept its target rate near zero since late 2008.
The Fed has also been more creative. During the worst of the financial crisis, the Fed relieved American banks of troubled investments, many linked to mortgages, to give the banks room to make new loans.
This engendered the sort of debate likely to fill doctoral dissertations for generations. Most economists praise the Fed for confronting the possibility of another depression. But the Fed added to the nation's debts, provoking talk that it was testing global faith in the dollar.
The dramatic expansion of the national debt -- which began in the Bush administration, via hefty tax cuts and two wars -- has ratcheted up fears that, one day, creditors like China and Japan might demand sharply higher interest rates to finance American spending. Those rates would spread through the economy and inflict the reverse of deflation: inflation, or rising prices, as merchants lose faith in the sanctity of the dollar and demand more dollars in exchange for oil, electronics and other items.
So far, the reverse has happened. As investors lose faith in real estate and stocks, they are flooding into government savings bonds, keeping interest rates exceedingly low. Still, inflation worries occupy the people who control money, not least the governors of the Fed. The Fed has been seeking a graceful exit from its interventions, aiming to unload its cache of mortgage-linked investments and -- likely in the far future -- lift interest rates.
But the recent disturbing economic news has delayed those plans. This month, the Fed said it would take the proceeds from its mortgage-linked investments and buy Treasury bills to keep longer-term interest rates down. The Wall Street Journal reported that this decision came amid substantial disagreement among the Fed's governors, suggesting that future action will be constrained by fears of inflation.
Republicans in Congress have embraced further tax cuts and less spending as the answer to the weak economy, while accusing the administration of squandering stimulus spending on efforts that brought little gain. Some conservative analysts liken the government's reliance on spending and credit to imbibing another cocktail to take the edge off a hangover. In this view, the weak economy should be welcomed for the discipline it imposes, forcing a paring back of unsustainable spending, while building up savings that can finance investment and later feed healthy economic growth.
''The recession is the cure for the disease that affects the economy, but the politicians don't have the stomach for it,'' says Peter Schiff, president of Euro Pacific Capital, a Connecticut-based brokerage house. ''They're going to keep stimulating the economy until they kill it with an overdose. The hyper-inflation that results is going to be far worse than the cure.''
Germany, which has long harbored particularly powerful fears of inflation, has done relatively well in the current downturn without large stimulus spending, and that experience is now cited by adherents of austerity. But it can be argued that the Germans had two advantages over Americans: A more extensive social safety net to give consumers more money and the confidence to spend it, and a vibrant manufacturing base to churn out more goods for export.
Most economists who are close to the policy making arena for both parties take the position that austerity is the wrong medicine for what ails the American economy, and they dismiss warnings about inflation as akin to focusing on the side effects of chemotherapy in the face of cancer. First, they argue, take the medicine and stave off the lethal threat; then deal with the collateral problems.
Regardless, inflation fears persist, constraining what limited prescriptions might otherwise be thrown at a weakening economy.
The impending elections in November -- with control of Congress hanging in the balance -- has further narrowed the contours of political possibility
Six months ago, Alan Blinder, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, and now an economist at Princeton, dismissed the idea that America's political system would ever allow the country to sink into a Japan-style quagmire. ''Now I'm looking at the political system turning itself into a paralyzed beast,'' he says, adding that a lost decade now looms as ''a much bigger risk.'' Congress and the Obama administration have ruled out further stimulus spending. The Fed appears to be running out of powder. ''Its really powerful ammunition has been expended,'' Mr. Blinder says.
Even after the November election, few expect a different dynamic. ''We're already in a gridlock situation, and nothing substantive is going to change,'' says Bruce Bartlett, who was a Treasury economist in the first Bush administration. ''Clearly, a weak economy in 2012 will be very good for whoever the Republican presidential candidate is. It's hard to see how the Republicans lose by blocking stimulus.''
On the other hand, if deflation emerges as a verifiable menace, many economists expect Mr. Bernanke -- an expert on the Great Depression -- to again champion aggressive measures, perhaps expanding the Fed's balance sheet to buy pools of auto loans or credit card debt.
''It's very likely the Fed will bend in that direction if the economy stays soft, especially if they are starting to see deflation,'' says Kenneth S. Rogoff, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, and now a professor at Harvard. ''That's really starting to loom.''
On Friday, Mr. Bernanke, whose board can operate independent of politics and the government, offered assurance that he still had powerful therapies to use should conditions worsen. Yet he also expressed concern about the potential side effects, underscoring a reluctance for more action.
''The issue at this stage is not whether we have the tools to help support economic activity and guard against disinflation,'' he said. ''We do.'' Then he added: ''The issue is instead whether, at any given juncture, the benefits of each tool, in terms of additional stimulus, outweigh the associated costs or risks of using the tool.''
Right now, many homeowners owe the bank more than their homes are worth, prompting some to abandon properties, adding inventory to a market choked with vacant addresses. An Obama administration program aimed at slowing foreclosures has prolonged trouble, say some economists, by failing to relieve borrowers of unsustainable debt burdens or making transparent the extent of losses yet to be confronted by the financial system.
''The big question is, who's going to swallow the losses,'' says Mr. Stiglitz. ''It should be the banks, but they don't want to. We're likely to be in paralysis for years if they prevail.''
The Treasury sits in the middle, concerned by the continued weakness of housing, yet unwilling to pressure banks to write down mortgage balances.
Like their Japanese counterparts a decade ago, Treasury officials worry that forcing the banks to take losses could weaken them and risk another crisis.
By default, muddling through has emerged as the prescription of the moment.

HEADLINE: Location, Location: Benzes Driven From the Rear

BYLINE: By KEITH MARTIN

 BODY:
IRVINE, Calif.
WHEN a car you have traveled 1,000 miles to drive is a rear-engine Mercedes-Benz from 1935 and a universal joint inside the transaxle shatters, a trip to the local auto parts store is not going to solve the problem.
Fortunately, the car in question was one of three prewar models made available for journalist test drives by the Mercedes-Benz Classic Center here in Southern California. So as the reporters gathered for dinner late on a Thursday afternoon, a team of mechanics from the center began disassembling the 130 to replace the universal joint -- a task that required removing the rear bodywork along with the engine and the transaxle.
The cars represent a little-known part of Mercedes history. When the companies founded by Gottlieb Daimler and Karl Benz merged in 1926, there were enough designers and engineers -- Ferdinand Porsche among them -- available to pursue various configurations of engines and gearboxes, with the goal of producing an affordable entry-level Mercedes, said Michael Kunz, manager of the Classic Center.
Compared with traditional front-engine cars, these models proved expensive to make, however, and sales were meager. The entire series went out of production in 1939. 
The three cars I drove (the Germans describe the layout as Heckmotor, or rear engine) included a 1935 130 Cabrio-Limousine, a 1934 150 Sport Roadster and a 1936 170 H Cabrio-Limousine.
A fourth car, a 1951 170 S Cabriolet A -- an example of the company's first premium-class model in the postwar era -- was included for comparison.
In the United States today, two mainstream rear-engine cars are available in showrooms, the Porsche 911 and the Smart Fortwo. In general, rear-engine cars have not found favor because the weight of the engine at the extreme back end results in less-than-ideal handling. Early designs were often described with terms like evil or diabolical to explain what happened when a rear-engine car entered a turn at too high a speed.
Mercedes has a tradition of providing restoration, service and sales of its classic cars, and since 1993 has operated the Mercedes-Benz Classic Center in Fellbach, Germany, near the Mercedes factory in Stuttgart.
The models I drove had long been on display, in nonrunning condition, at the Mercedes-Benz Museum in Stuttgart. As a demonstration of its restoration capabilities, the Irvine center, open since 2005, had them shipped to the United States. Making the cars drivable was not without challenges, as many of the parts for the 4-cylinder engines and gearboxes were unique to the cars.
Cosmetically, the cars were in good but not concours condition. They had been restored in the 1950s, but time had taken its toll on the paint and interiors.
The showroom of the Classic Center, where we ate dinner as the 130 was repaired, was adjacent to the restoration facility. So, between courses, the writers sauntered over to supervise the technicians and offer unsolicited advice and opinions.
The Classic Center's lead mechanic, Nate Lander, is a graduate of the auto restoration program at McPherson College in Kansas. Mr. Lander was also an apprentice at the Stuttgart center before coming to Irvine. Within three hours, the transaxle was disassembled and the failed universal joint removed. Upon inspection, it was determined to be similar to a joint from a postwar Mercedes 170. With a little work, the later part was adapted to fit.
By 8 the next morning, the car was completely reassembled; it was the first of the Heckmotor cars I drove.
Not wanting to cause a repeat of the breakdown, I drove the car gingerly at first. With an 1.3-liter 4-cylinder engine producing just 25 horsepower, the acceleration of the 2,160-pound car could best be called leisurely. Top speed is reported to be 57 miles per hour.
The convertible roof of the 130 opened completely, and as a city car it proved to be a visual delight and an attention-getter, even in car-jaded Southern California.
As I drove through the streets of Laguna Beach on a trip that included runs along the Pacific Coast Highway, the car kept up with traffic. Although I shifted the nonsynchronized 3-speed (with overdrive) transmission carefully, my riding partner, a mechanic from the Classic Center, flinched slightly each time I manhandled the gears.
The second car I drove, a 1934 150 Sport Roadster, was the rarest and most interesting of the group -- one of just 11 built and the only one known to exist today. Unlike the rear-engine 130 and the 170 H models, the engine in the 150 was situated forward of the transaxle, making it a midengine car.
This configuration, still popular among sports car makers today, can be found in models like the Porsche Cayman, Ferrari F458 and Lamborghini Gallardo. Positioning the engine near the center of the car promotes more surefooted handling -- unlike the tail-heavy rear-engine cars.
Somewhat whimsical in appearance, the Sport Roadster carries a third headlight, mounted in the center of the front body panels. The long rear deck, necessary to cover both the midmounted engine and the gearbox behind it, give the vehicle the odd proportions of a Shriner parade car. I felt as if I should have been wearing a fez.
With slightly over 50 horsepower from its water-cooled 1.5-liter 4-cylinder engine, performance was more than adequate, if not overwhelming. I was surprised that Mercedes would put this only remaining example into the hands of auto writers. I imagined my co-pilot from the Classic Center having a Taser ready for writers who became too frisky behind the wheel.
My final test of a rear-engine car was of the luxurious 170 H Cabrio-Limousine. With a 1.7-liter engine, its 38 horsepower was enough to let the 2,480-pound car hold its own in California congestion. It had a luxuriously appointed interior, shifted easily and despite its added center-mounted headlight, looked the most modern of the group.
Even so, the 170 H was a market failure: just 1,507 were sold, compared with 71,000 for the front-engine 170 produced at the same time.
After my day as an automotive time traveler, I came away appreciative of the opportunity to drive cars more than 75 years old on modern highways. Even today, these cars can provide adequate transportation in urban areas.
While many automakers pay lip service to brand heritage (this is less of a selling point in today's economy than during the go-go days some five years ago), Mercedes was the first company to restore its museum cars on a regular basis and then make them available for outsiders to drive, Mr. Kunz said.
In this case, the message that was sent about Mercedes's commitment to preserving its heritage was more important than the experience of driving a handful of underpowered, hard-to-shift cars. Living a day in a 75-year-old past was an uncommon opportunity, and a welcome one, even including one brittle universal joint.

HEADLINE: Why We Need a Second Stimulus

BYLINE: By LAURA TYSON. 
Laura Tyson, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, was chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers and the National Economic Council in the Clinton administration. She is a member of President Obama's Economic Recovery Advisory Board.

 BODY:
Berkeley, Calif.
OUR national debate about fiscal policy has become skewed, with far too much focus on the deficit and far too little on unemployment. There is too much worry about the size of government, and too little appreciation for how stimulus spending has helped stabilize the economy and how more of the right kind of government spending could boost job creation and economic growth. By focusing on the wrong things, we are in serious danger of failing to do the right things to help the economy recover from its worst labor market crisis since the Great Depression.
The primary cause of the labor market crisis is a collapse in private demand -- the same problem that bedeviled the economy in the 1930s. In the wake of the financial shocks at the end of 2008, spending by American households and businesses plummeted, and companies responded by curbing production and shedding workers. By late 2009, in response to unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus, household and business spending began to recover. But by the second quarter of this year, economic growth had slowed to 1.6 percent, according to a government estimate issued Friday. Clearly, the pace of recovery is far slower than what is needed to restore the millions of jobs that have been lost. 
Households and businesses are on a saving spree to rebuild their balance sheets. Their spending relative to income has fallen more than at any time since the end of World War II. So there is now a substantial gap between the supply of goods and services the economy is capable of producing and the demand for them. This gap is starkly reflected by the 23 million Americans who are looking for full-time jobs and the millions more who have left the labor force because they could not find one.
The situation would be even worse without the $787 billion fiscal stimulus package passed in 2009. The conventional wisdom about the stimulus package is wrong: it has not failed. It is working as intended. Its spending increases and tax cuts have boosted demand and added about three million more jobs than the economy otherwise would have. Without it, the unemployment rate would be about 11.5 percent. Because about 36 percent of the money remains to be spent, more jobs will be created -- about 500,000 by the end of the year.
But by next year, the stimulus will end, and the flip from fiscal support to fiscal contraction could shave one to two percentage points off the growth rate at a time when the unemployment rate is still well above 9 percent. Under these circumstances, the economic case for additional government spending and tax relief is compelling. Sadly, polls indicate that the political case is not.
Two forms of spending with the biggest and quickest bang for the buck are unemployment benefits and aid to state governments. The federal government should pledge generous financing increases for both programs through 2011.
Federal aid to the states is especially important because they finance education. Although the jobs crisis is primarily a crisis of demand, it also reflects a mismatch between the education of the work force and the education required for jobs in today's economy. Consider how the unemployment rate varies by education level: it's more than 14 percent for those without a high school degree, under 10 percent for those with one, only about 5 percent for those with a college degree and even lower for those with advanced degrees. The supply of college graduates is not keeping pace with demand. Therefore, more investment in education could reduce both the cyclical unemployment rate, as more Americans stay in school, and the structural unemployment rate, as they graduate into the job market.
An increase in government investment in roads, airports and other kinds of public infrastructure would be cost-effective, too, as measured by the number of jobs created per dollar of spending. And it would help reduce the road congestion, airport delays and freight bottlenecks that reduce productivity and make the United States a less attractive place to do business. The American Society of Civil Engineers has identified more than $2.2 trillion in public infrastructure needs nationwide, and a 2008 study by the Congressional Budget Office found that, on strict cost-benefit grounds, it would make sense to increase annual spending on transportation projects alone by 74 percent.
Over the next five years, the federal government should work with state and local governments and the private sector to finance $1 trillion worth of additional investment in infrastructure. It should extend the Build America Bonds stimulus program, which in the past year has helped states finance $120 billion in infrastructure improvement.
The federal government should also create and capitalize a National Infrastructure Bank that would provide greater certainty about the level of infrastructure financing over several years, select projects based on rigorous cost-benefit analysis, invest in things like interstate high-speed rail that require coordination among states and attract private co-investors in projects like toll roads and airports that generate dedicated future revenue streams.
But can the government afford this additional spending? The answer is yes. Despite the large federal deficit, global savers, including savings-hungry American households, are snapping up United States government securities at very low interest rates. And they will continue to do so as long as there is ample slack in the economy and inflation remains subdued. Over the next few years, there is little risk that federal deficits will crowd out private investment or precipitate a crisis of confidence in the American government, a spike in American interest rates or a sudden drop in the dollar.
On the other hand, as long as private demand remains weak, the risk is uncomfortably high that trying to reduce the deficit -- by cutting spending or increasing taxes -- will tip the economy back into recession or condemn it to years of faltering growth and debilitating unemployment. In fact, either outcome would depress tax revenue and could mean larger deficits.
Faced with these risks, as long as the economy is operating far below potential, policy makers should do two seemingly contradictory things. First, they should provide additional fiscal support for job creation and growth. And, second, they should enact a credible multiyear plan now to stabilize the ratio of federal debt to gross domestic product gradually as the economy recovers.
By easing capital market concerns about the government's future borrowing needs, such a plan would permit larger deficits and slower debt reduction while unemployment is still high. The long-run debt problem -- the result of imprudent fiscal decisions before the recession, escalating health care costs and an aging population -- must be addressed once the economy has recovered. But for now the priorities of fiscal policy should be jobs and investment.

HEADLINE: It's Not Over Until It's In the Rules

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
NOW for the heavy lifting.
Having passed the Dodd-Frank Act earlier this summer, the bill that aspires to reorder our financial universe in the wake of the most serious economic crisis in generations, Congress has moved on to other matters. Regulators are left to write the rules that will make financial reform a reality -- or not -- and are beginning that laborious process.
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is one regulator with a lot on its plate. Last month, the commission published a list of 30 areas related to over-the-counter derivatives that require new rules. Derivatives, you might remember, are the exotic securities that Wall Street engineered to hedge risk, only to discover during the mortgage meltdown that the contracts -- which linked together a dizzying number of financial players -- actually amplified the severity of the crisis.
On Aug. 20, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission sponsored an open forum on derivatives regulation. Industry representatives, trade groups, investor advocates and regulators discussed how to put into practice Congress's desire for a more closely supervised market in derivatives. 
Because the most potentially nuclear forms of derivatives are privately arranged and loosely monitored, two clear goals of the legislation are greater price transparency and the opening of transactions to more market participants.
But not everyone wants these aims to be met. And early signs indicate that the big firms currently in control of the derivatives market view the rules-writing process as an opportunity to maintain the status quo in one of their most lucrative lines of business -- or win back what they feel they lost amid the legislative wrangling earlier this year.
The question is this: Will regulators give Wall Street's big dealers what they want in a second bite of the apple?
There is no doubt that regulating the freewheeling derivatives market is important work. If done right, heightened scrutiny could well eliminate the potential for another disastrous bank run like the one that threatened world markets in September 2008 when the American International Group imploded. The insurer had written insurance on mortgage securities-- a derivative known as a credit default swap -- and almost collapsed after, among other things, onerous collateral calls from its trading partners drained its cash.
Changing the way this market operates is also crucial because major firms like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley currently run it. These companies don't want to open trading facilities to more participants because they prefer that their customers have limited access to bids and offers; such black-box arrangements generate far more profits to dealers than open and transparent markets.
Congress wisely recommended broadening access to an array of prices so that customers trading swaps could get a feel for what they might pay or receive for an instrument before they committed to a transaction -- a process known as pretrade price transparency. Carrying out this goal is where it gets tricky, and where the existing dealers hope to protect their profits.
It promises to be a hard-fought scrimmage.
''It is again going back to the battlefield, and this is a much more complicated battlefield,'' said Michael Greenberger, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Law and a former director of trading and markets at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. ''It is technically hard lawyering, gathering your evidence and making your point. Anybody who thought this game is over or that it couldn't be reversed through the agency process is kidding themselves.''
Two important elements of the argument are how the facilities and clearinghouses that trade derivatives will be structured and who will be allowed to operate and participate in them. Control of both now lies with the dominant Wall Street firms, and they want to keep it that way.
Ninety percent of swaps are traded through the 10 biggest banks, generating revenue of an estimated $60 billion a year for these institutions, according to the Swaps and Derivatives Market Association, a membership organization that consists of firms hoping to compete with the big derivatives dealers in these markets.
A trading system that provides its customers with just a few bids and offers is far less transparent and significantly more costly to users than one presenting a long list of prices and participants ready to transact. To keep new participants out of the business of clearing trades, the established firms have rules requiring incoming members to hold a certain amount of net capital -- in some cases $5 billion -- and they want to keep these thresholds intact.
While such a requirement sounds like a way to reduce risk in the market by ensuring that only players with deep pockets are allowed in, some analysts say it heightens risk by eliminating competition and allowing the system to be dominated by institutions that are too big and politically interconnected to fail.
''For clearing of credit default swaps and interest rate swaps to actually work and lessen the systemic risk they pose to the global financial payments system, you need to have multiple clearing brokers involved with the clearinghouse to distribute the risk,'' said Michael Hisler, a co-founder of the Swaps and Derivatives Market Association. ''You also need multiple dealers to provide liquidity and continuity in markets in times of crisis.''
By controlling swaps clearinghouses, big firms have the power to decide which transactions can be cleared and which cannot. If the banks decide that certain contracts -- usually intricately tailored financial arrangements sometimes known as ''bespoke'' agreements -- can't be cleared, the deals are moved out of the clearinghouses and into private hands. This limits how transparent the pricing is for bespoke contracts, which is one of the reasons they remain among the most lucrative pieces of the derivatives market for Wall Street.
Recognizing that Wall Street's control of clearinghouses would likely thwart the development of a deep and open market, Congress initially limited dealer ownership of an operation to 20 percent. But by the end of the legislative process, that hard limit had disappeared. It was replaced by softer language giving the Commodity Futures Trading Commission power to restrict ownership without actually requiring it to do so.
What kind of limits regulators may place on ownership of these facilities is shaping up as a crucial skirmish, and some investor advocates are concerned that Wall Street may win it.
''There is going to be so much pressure from the biggest financial institutions not to have limits,'' said Heather Slavkin, senior policy adviser of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s Office of Investment and a participant in the Aug. 20 meeting. ''Regulators are going to be very much focused on what types of swaps get cleared, so the governance and ownership aspects that are just as important may not get the attention they deserve.''
IT'S entirely predictable that the big firms that have so dominated the swaps market will do all they can to hang on to their hegemony. After all, swaps trading is one of the last bastions of lush profitability, and Wall Street is desperate to protect it.
And it's clever that the banks, given the crisis we have just experienced, are suggesting that safety and soundness in the derivatives market will be improved by erecting barriers based on capital requirements. But let's hope the nation's regulators recognize that expanding the numbers of participants in the market will benefit far more people than will be helped by keeping things the way they are now.
The status quo didn't work very well for taxpayers, as you might recall.

HEADLINE: Central Bankers Are Told That Recovery May Be Slow

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. -- The American economy could experience painfully slow growth and stubbornly high unemployment for a decade or longer as a result of the 2007 collapse of the housing market and the economic turmoil that followed, according to an authority on the history of financial crises.
That finding, contained in a new paper by Carmen M. Reinhart, an economist at the University of Maryland, generated considerable debate during an annual policy symposium here, organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, which concluded on Saturday. 
The gathering, at a historic lodge in Grand Teton National Park, brought together about 110 central bankers and economists, including most of the Federal Reserve's top officials. In 2008, the symposium occurred weeks before the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy nearly shut down the financial markets. At the symposium last year, officials congratulated themselves on weathering the worst of the crisis.
But the recent slowing of the recovery cast a pall on this year's gathering. As economists (some wearing jeans and cowboy boots) conferred on a terrace with a sweeping view of the 13,770-foot peak of Mount Teton, or watched a horse trainer tame an unruly colt at a nearby ranch, they anxiously discussed research like Ms. Reinhart's. (Participants pay to attend the event, which is not financed by taxpayers, a Kansas City Fed spokeswoman emphasized.)
''I'm more worried than I have ever been about the future of the U.S. economy,'' said Allen Sinai, co-founder of the consulting firm Decision Economics and a longtime participant in the symposium. ''The challenge is unique: poor and diminishing growth, a sticky unemployment rate, sky-high deficits and a sovereign debt that makes us one of the most fiscally irresponsible countries in the world.''
Ms. Reinhart's paper drew upon research she conducted with the Harvard economist Kenneth S. Rogoff for their book ''This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly,'' published last year by Princeton University Press. Her husband, Vincent R. Reinhart, a former director of monetary affairs at the Fed, was the co-author of the paper.
The Reinharts examined 15 severe financial crises since World War II as well as the worldwide economic contractions that followed the 1929 stock market crash, the 1973 oil shock and the 2007 implosion of the subprime mortgage market.
In the decade following the crises, growth rates were significantly lower and unemployment rates were significantly higher. Housing prices took years to recover, and it took about seven years on average for households and companies to reduce their debts and restore their balance sheets. In general, the crises were preceded by decade-long expansions of credit and borrowing, and were followed by lengthy periods of retrenchment that lasted nearly as long.
''Large destabilizing events, such as those analyzed here, evidently produce changes in the performance of key macroeconomic indicators over the longer term, well after the upheaval of the crisis is over,'' Ms. Reinhart wrote.
Ms. Reinhart added that officials may err in failing to recognize changed economic circumstances. ''Misperceptions can be costly when made by fiscal authorities who overestimate revenue prospects and central bankers who attempt to restore employment to an unattainably high level,'' she warned.
Several scholars here cautioned that it was premature to infer long-term economic woes for the United States from the aftermath of past crises.
The Reinharts' research ''has not yet tried to assess the extent to which different policy stances mitigated the length of the outcome,'' said Susan M. Collins, an economist and the dean of the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan. ''But the reality is that we need to have an understanding that the issues we are dealing with are severe, and that we should not expect them to be unwound in a few months.''
Ms. Collins added: ''I'm very much a glass-half-full person. What we've seen in the past few years has been a policy success. Things are not where we want them to be, but they could have been a lot worse.''
The Reinharts' paper was not the only one to offer somber implications for policy makers.
Two economists, James H. Stock of Harvard and Mark W. Watson of Princeton, presented a paper arguing that inflation, which has already fallen so much that some Fed officials fear the economy is at risk of deflation, a cycle of falling prices and wages, could fall even further by the middle of next year.
Inflation has been running well below the Fed's unofficial target of about 1.5 percent to 2 percent. Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, reiterated on Friday that the central bank would ''strongly resist deviations from price stability in the downward directions.''
Mr. Stock and Mr. Watson noted that recessions in the United States were associated with declines in inflation, with an exception being an increase in inflation in 2004, which occurred despite a ''jobless recovery'' from the 2001 recession. The authors said they could not explain the anomaly but also could not ''offer a reason why it might happen again.''

HEADLINE: Peace and War

BYLINE: By SAM TANENHAUS. 
Sam Tanenhaus is the editor of the Book Review.

 BODY:
Jonathan Franzen's new novel, ''Freedom,'' like his previous one, ''The Corrections,'' is a masterpiece of American fiction. The two books have much in common. Once again Franzen has fashioned a capacious but intricately ordered narrative that in its majestic sweep seems to gather up every fresh datum of our shared millennial life. Franzen knows that college freshmen are today called ''first years,'' like tender shoots in an overplanted garden; that a high-minded mom, however ruthless in her judgments of her neighbors' ethical lapses, will condemn them with no epithet harsher than ''weird''; that reckless drivers who barrel across lanes are ''almost always youngish men for whom the use of blinkers was apparently an affront to their masculinity.''
These are not gratuitous observations. They grow organically from the themes that animate ''Freedom,'' beginning with the title, a word that has been elevated throughout American history to near-theological status, and has been twinned, for most of that same history, with the secularizing impulses of ''power.'' 
That twinning is where the trouble begins. As each of us seeks to assert his ''personal liberties'' -- a phrase Franzen uses with full command of its ideological implications -- we helplessly collide with others in equal pursuit of their sacred freedoms, which, more often than not, seem to threaten our own. It is no surprise, then, that ''the personality susceptible to the dream of limitless freedom is a personality also prone, should the dream ever sour, to misanthropy and rage,'' as Franzen remarks. And the dream will always sour; for it is seldom enough simply to follow one's creed; others must embrace it too. They alone can validate it.
The dream-power ratio is lived out most acutely -- most oppressively, but also most variously and dynamically -- within the family, since its members orbit one another at the closest possible range. The family romance is as old as the English-language novel itself -- indeed is ontologically inseparable from it. But the family as microcosm or micro-history has become Franzen's particular subject, as it is no one else's today.
''The Corrections,'' saturated in the socio-cultural atmosphere of the 1990s, described the hopeful ''corrections'' improvised by the three lost Lambert siblings, adults manques lured to the voluptuary capitals of the Eastern Seaboard, escaping the Depression ethic of their Midwestern parents, who continue to loom over their lives, disapproving gods, though themselves weakened by senescence and its attendant ills. Locked together in obligation and duty, assailed by guilt and love, the Lamberts thrash against the cycle of needs -- to forgive, to explain, to solve the riddle of unacknowledged hurts buried under thick layers of half-repressed memory.
In lesser hands, this might have devolved into cliche. Also the timing looked ominous. Published a week before 9/11, Franzen's novel, set against a panorama of '90s excesses (promiscuous sex and rampant drug use, trendy East Coast restaurants, high-tech gadgetry), all outgrowths of ''the rambunctious American economy,'' might have seemed fatally out of step with the somber new mood.
Instead, ''The Corrections'' towered out of the rubble, at once a monument to a world destroyed and a beacon lighting the way for a new kind of novel that might break the suffocating grip of postmodernism, whose most adept practitioners were busily creating, as James Wood objected at the time, ''curiously arrested books that know a thousand different things -- the recipe for the best Indonesian fish curry! the sonics of the trombone! the drug market in Detroit! the history of strip cartoons! -- but do not know a single human being.''
''The Corrections'' did not so much repudiate all this as surgically ''correct'' it. Franzen cracked open the opaque shell of postmodernism, tweezed out its tangled circuitry and inserted in its place the warm, beating heart of an authentic humanism. His fictional canvas teemed with information -- about equity finance, railroad engineering, currency manipulation in Eastern Europe, the neurochemistry of clinical depression. But the data flowed through the arteries of narrative, just as it had done in the novels of Dickens and Tolstoy, Bellow and Mann. Like those giants, Franzen attended to the quiet drama of the interior life and also recorded its fraught transactions with the public world. Even as his contemporaries had diminished the place of the ''single human being,'' Franzen, miraculously, had enlarged it.
''Freedom'' is a still richer and deeper work -- less glittering on its surface but more confident in its method. This time the social history has been pushed forward, from the Clinton to the Bush years -- and the generational clock has been wound forward, too. There is, again, a nuclear family, though the hopeful aspirants are not children but parents. They are the Berglunds, ''young pioneers'' who renovate a Victorian in Ramsey Hill, a neighborhood of decayed mansions in St. Paul (Franzen assuredly knows that F. Scott Fitzgerald grew up there, on Summit Avenue; the street is mentioned in the opening paragraph) and then float upward on drafts of unassailable virtue. Patty is a ''sunny carrier of sociological pollen, an affable bee'' buzzing at the back door ''with a plate of cookies or a card or some lilies of the valleys in a little thrift-store vase that she told you not to bother returning''; her husband, Walter, is a lawyer of such adamant decency that his employer, 3M, has parked him in ''outreach and philanthropy, a corporate cul-de-sac where niceness was an asset'' and where, commuting by bicycle each day, he nurtures his commitment to the environmentalist causes he will eventually pursue with messianic, and misbegotten, fervor.
To their envious neighbors, a step behind the golden couple, there ''had always been something not quite right about the Berglunds.'' They are ''the super-guilty sort of liberals who needed to forgive everybody so their own good fortune could be forgiven; who lacked the courage of their privilege.''
These heckling strophes drip with spite, but spite is often the vehicle of premonitory truth. The Berglunds really are headed for disaster, though not because there's something wrong with them. They are, after all, ''fully the thing that was just starting to happen to the rest of the street'' -- and much of America, too. They resemble any number of well-meaning couples for whom ''the home'' has become a citadel of aspirational self-regard and family life a sequence of ennobling rites, each act of overparenting wreathed in civic import -- the ''issues'' involving cloth versus disposable diapers, or the political rectitude of the Boy Scouts, or the imperative to recycle batteries -- and the long siege of the day heroically capped by ''Goodnight Moon'' and a self-congratulatory glass of zinfandel.
Franzen grasps that the central paradox of modern American liberalism inheres not in its doctrines but in the unstated presumptions that govern its daily habits. Liberals, no less than conservatives -- and for that matter revolutionaries and reactionaries; in other words, all of us -- believe some modes of existence are superior to others. But only the liberal, committed to a vision of harmonious communal pluralism, is unsettled by this truth. This is why a Ramsey Hill pioneer like Patty Berglund will suffer torments of indecision when thinking how best to ''respond when a poor person of color accused you of destroying her neighborhood.''
But, in an inspired touch, Patty is a former All-American basketball player; and her competitive drive overcomes her inhibitions when the adversary is plainly her inferior, for instance the loutish next-door neighbor ''in a Vikings jersey with his work boots unlaced and a beer can in his fist'' who noisily molests his backyard trees with a chainsaw, clearing space for a vinyl-sided boat shed that disfigures the collective efforts of urban renovation. In retaliation, Patty slashes the snow tires on the villain's pickup truck and then goes door to door like a petitioner to justify the vandalism she will not own up to.
The reckoning begins at home. Just as the complacent upright parents in Philip Roth's ''American Pastoral'' see their world capsized by their own children, who become militant leftists, so the Berglunds inadvertently have bred a native rebel, their son, Joey. Bright, handsome, personable, preternaturally adept at getting his way, all thanks to his doting mother, he defies her by moving next door to live with the enemy, the disheveled right-wing household where the chainsaw tree-murderer cohabits with a blowzy single mother and her blameless teenage daughter, who worships Joey and showers love on Patty -- or would if only Patty didn't coldly rebuff her.
This idyll, related with brilliant economy, establishes the themes explored over the course of a narrative that moves at once backward, forward, inward and outward -- with hypnotic force and with none of the literary flourishes that faintly marred ''The Corrections.'' The Berglunds, introduced as caricatures, gradually assume the gravity of fully formed people, not ''rounded characters,'' in the awful phrase, but misshapen and lopsided, like actual humans.
And, as it happens, they are willfully self-invented in the classic American vein. Walter, from rural Minnesota, ''the small-town son of an angry drunk,'' has made himself into a model of self-sacrifice and self-discipline, but remains captive to the ''bludgeoning daily misery and grievance that depressive male Berglunds evidently needed to lend meaning and substance to their lives.''
Patty, by means of the novel's most ingenious device -- a third-person autobiography, secretly written ''at her therapist's suggestion'' -- describes herself as the self-exiled daughter of Westchester County do-gooders, her mother a ''professional Democrat'' immersed in state politics, her father a lawyer with family money who is a hero to his many pro bono clients, ''most of them black or Hispanic or otherwise ethnic.''
Patty's robust athleticism violates the family creed. ''I don't see the fun in defeating a person just for the sake of defeating them,'' her mother complains after watching Patty chase down a timid runner on the softball basepath. ''Wouldn't it be much more fun to all work together to cooperatively build something?'' And yet when Patty is date-raped, her parents' solicitude extends to the culprit, the son of wealthy political activists, while they are merely embarrassed by their daughter's physical and psychic distress.
Assaultive sex reverberates through ''Freedom,'' and why not? Sex is the most insistent of the ''personal liberties,'' and for Franzen the most equalizing. One is at a loss to think of another male American writer so at ease with -- that is, so genuinely curious about -- the economy of female desire: the pull and tug of attraction and revulsion, the self-canceling wants.
There are three intersecting love triangles in ''Freedom.'' The pivotal one involves Walter's college roommate, Richard Katz, an outsize rock musician with an ominous resemblance to Muammar el-Qaddafi, to whom Patty, like any number of other women, is attracted even as Katz, saturnine and sarcastic, is tightly bonded, for some ''deep-chemical'' reason, to the almost virginally earnest Walter.
The many vivid scenes in ''Freedom'' include one in the Berglunds' lakeside cottage in northern Minnesota, where Patty, now married, and Richard, resolutely single, circle each other like matched predators. It is Patty who exults more fully in the pure exhilaration of appetite, though she has been reading ''War and Peace'' -- a touchstone for ''Freedom'' -- and has just finished the pages ''in which Natasha Rostov, who was obviously meant for the goofy and good Pierre, falls in love with his great cool friend Prince Andrei. Patty had not seen this coming,'' she records in her secret memoir. ''Pierre's loss unfolded, as she read it, like a catastrophe in slow motion.'' Yet she will heedlessly plunge into the same error. This is Franzen's self-mocking acknowledgment that not even the greatest literature can save us from ourselves, because nothing finally can override the imperative to be free. ''This seemed to her, in any case, the first time she'd properly had sex.'' Yet soon after, she startles her lover by asking, ''Do you think it's possible you're homosexual?'' The reasoning is axiomatic: ''I'm sure you'd get tired of me very soon. You'd see me naked when I'm 45, and you'd be thinking, Hmm. Do I still want this? I don't think so! Whereas Walter you never have to get tired of, because you don't feel like kissing him. You can just be close to him forever.'' Sexual freedom, for women no less than men, ''the default gender,'' to borrow a term from Franzen's second novel, ''Strong Motion,'' is yet another form of entrapment.
Thus does Franzen wring multiple meanings from his theme, particularly once the Berglunds' story merges with the encompassing history he tells, much of it set in Washington, where the Berglunds move after Walter gets a lucrative job with a nature conservancy. It comes with spacious living quarters in a Georgetown mansion, with daffodils and jonquils in the backyard, a fresh opportunity for the Berglunds, after the disappointments in St. Paul, to indulge their ''excellent urban-gentry taste.''
It is now 2004, the peak moment of the Bush phantasmagoria, when it was possible to think of America as ''still a rich and relatively young country'' and of the Iraq adventure as ''an odd sort of war in which, within a rounding error, the only casualties were on the other side.''
There is no mistaking Franzen's own view of these matters, even without the evidence of his journalism from this period -- including ''Inauguration Day, 2001,'' a report he wrote for The New Yorker on the bus trip he took to Washington with a group of protesting young socialists.
''Freedom'' abounds in journalistic touches, some of them slapdash, most obviously when Franzen revisits quarrels over ''the Bush-Cheney venture in Iraq'' and the sinister role of Halliburton, ''whose former C.E.O. was now running the nation.'' Yet Franzen, equipped with the novelist's investigatory gene, knows that every man has his reasons. If his wicked portrait of a neoconservative sage, steeped in dime-store Leo Strauss, who dazzles Joey at a dinner party with gnomic mentions of ''the philosopher, '' flirts with burlesque, Franzen has nonetheless caught the tone of those Bush administration auxiliaries who fluently made the case for the Iraq ''cakewalk'' and, as Franzen writes, ''referred to members of the president's cabinet by their first names, explaining how 'we' had been 'leaning on' the president to exploit this unique historical moment to resolve an intractable geopolitical deadlock and radically expand the sphere of freedom.''
Franzen is best, always, when he returns to the Berglunds. Their uneasy peace, roiled by strife dating back to Joey's rebellion, feels increasingly warlike, as they too breathe the fanatical air that has toxically invaded the land. Walter, ''greener than Greenpeace,'' strangely colludes with a superrich Texan to despoil a West Virginia mountaintop, though it means uprooting 200 local families, ''most of them very poor'' -- all to create a sanctuary for a species of warbler not even on the federal endangered list. The scenes set in West Virginia, and Walter's clashes with hard-edged locals, the proud, embittered descendants of ''Jefferson's yeoman farmers,'' clinging tenaciously to their wasteland -- ''the scabby rock-littered pastures, the spindly canopies of young second growth, the gouged hillsides and mining-damaged streams, the spavined barns and paintless houses, the trailer homes hip-deep in plastic and metallic trash, the torn-up dirt tracks leading nowhere'' -- bristle with conviction.
Meanwhile, Patty is reduced to a parody of the Beltway wife and finds solace at the gym where, when not toning, she holds down a desk job, mainly to escape the presence of Walter's assistant, an adoring and nubile Bengali-American. And Joey, now a Young Republican paid $8,000 a month to concoct fraudulent reports for something called ''Restore Iraqi Secular Enterprise Now,'' will soon get involved in a boondoggle involving the transshipment of corroded tank parts from Paraguay to Iraq. His motives aren't purely mercenary: he also yearns to impress the Straussian's luscious daughter, a materialistic tease captured by Franzen in all her narcissism: ''She gave Joey a once-over head to toe, the way a person might confirm that a product she'd ordered had arrived in acceptable condition, and then removed her hand luggage from the seat beside her and -- a little reluctantly, it seemed -- pulled the iPod wires from her ears.'' The magic is in ''a little reluctantly'': one sees the fleeting look of displeasure, the slow tug on the wires; rather, remembers it, from similar images stored in one's mind and awaiting release. There are numberless such moments in ''Freedom,'' crystalline instances of precise notation shaped by imaginative sympathy.
Franzen's world-historical preoccupations also shape, though less delicately, his big account of the home front -- the seething national peace that counterpoises the foreign war. Himself a confirmed and well-informed environmentalist, Franzen gives full voice to Walter's increasingly extreme preachments on the subjects of overpopulation and endangered species. ''WE ARE A CANCER ON THE PLANET!'' he declares at one point, in a rant that goes viral on the Internet as his dream sours into a nightmare vision of a land in which ''the winners,'' who own the future, trample over ''the dead and dying and forgotten, the endangered species of the world, the nonadaptive.''
The apocalpyse, when it comes, clears the way for a postlude, set in Minnesota, that is as haunting as anything in recent American fiction. In these pages, Walter, ''a fanatic gray stubble on his cheeks,'' seizes hold of the novel, and Franzen makes us see, as the best writers always have, that the only pathway to freedom runs through the maze of the interior life. Walter, groping toward deliverance, mourns ''a fatal defect in his own makeup, the defect of pitying even the beings he most hated.'' But of course it is no defect at all. It is the highest, most humanizing grace. And it cares nothing about power. Like all great novels, ''Freedom'' does not just tell an engrossing story. It illuminates, through the steady radiance of its author's profound moral intelligence, the world we thought we knew.

HEADLINE: A Temple Of Drama, Burnished

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
Fall in love with the Broadway theater, and sooner or later you will probably find yourself developing an ancillary ardor for Broadway theaters -- the grand old buildings themselves, I mean, irrespective of the hits and flops that inhabit them. The most beautiful are splendid representations of architecture styles in fashion in the early decades of the 20th century. And like most old buildings with character, the great Broadway houses -- and even some of the not-so-great ones -- seem to absorb some of the historical mystique that passes through.
I got to thinking about this on a recent tour of the refurbished Belasco Theater, the 44th Street playhouse that's one of the few Broadway theaters located east of Times Square. It's always been one of my favorites, for its relative intimacy and its almost gaslit, subtly gothic ambience. The Belasco, even during its faded days, was as rich in atmosphere as the Broadway theaters built in later years -- the Minskoff and the Marquis and the abominable barn now to be known as the Foxwoods Theater (formerly the Ford and the Hilton) -- are devoid of it. 
I seem to return to shows I like at the Belasco with an unusual frequency. I saw the theater's most recent tenant, Bartlett Sher's transcendent revival of August Wilson's ''Joe Turner's Come and Gone,'' three times during its relatively short run. Ditto Mr. Sher's revival of Clifford Odets's ''Awake and Sing!'' -- a production given an added layer of mystique since the original Group Theater staging also opened at the Belasco. And bewitched by my first encounter with a fully staged ''Follies,'' I recall finding reasons to return to the 2001 revival of that classic musical a full four times, in part because the Belasco's air of faded grandeur so perfectly suited Stephen Sondheim and James Goldman's musical elegy for a lost age.
For the Belasco is one of the few theaters with a marquee ballyhooing a name from a distant era of American theater history, when larger-than-life showmen like David Belasco and Charles Frohman and Florenz Ziegfeld ruled the Rialto. Built in 1907, it opened as the Stuyvesant because Belasco already owned a theater on 42nd Street bearing his name. When Belasco sold that house in 1910 (it's now the New Victory), he bestowed his name on the Stuyvesant.
After his death in 1931 the theater changed hands several times. History was made in the mid-1930s when the Belasco was the Broadway home to the Group Theater, the company that made the reputations of Odets, Harold Clurman, Lee Strasberg and Elia Kazan, as well as actors like John Garfield and Lee J. Cobb. The celebrated Sidney Kingsley play ''Dead End'' played the Belasco, and in 1946 Marlon Brando gave a breakthrough performance in the now-forgotten Maxwell Anderson play ''Truckline Cafe,'' directed by Clurman. Lorraine Hansberry's ''Raisin in the Sun,'' the first play by a black woman to be produced on Broadway, played at the Belasco, too.
But as Broadway economics changed, it became hard to turn a profit on shows in smaller theaters. With its two balconies and comparatively modest 1,000 or so seats, the Belasco was not considered desirable by producers. In recent years it has hosted some adventurous if ultimately uncommercial fare, like the Stew musical ''Passing Strange'' and the revival of ''Journey's End,'' as well as more dubious enterprises like the Frank Wildhorn ''Dracula.'' Today, with many theaters occupied by long-running shows, and Off Broadway more or less defunct as a commercial option, there's no such thing as an undesirable Broadway theater. And so the Belasco has been closed for a little more than a year now, to undergo a $14.5 million stem-to-stern renovation by the Shubert Organization, which has owned the theater since 1948.
After touring the refurbished house in the company of Thomas Stein, the Shubert project coordinator for the renovation, I came away with a little bit of plaster dust on my shoes and a major dose of stardust on the brain.
Under the supervision of the designer Francesca Russo, the original architectural and design details of the theater, among the most rich and idiosyncratic of any existing Broadway houses, have been meticulously restored, transforming what was once a dim and dusty if ornately detailed auditorium into a softly gleaming but still cozy showplace. Designed by George Keister, an architect who specialized in theaters, the Belasco was appointed in a neo-Georgian style that emphasized dark woods, leaded glass and subtle lighting.
Some major reclamation work was involved. Every time a new show opened for review at the Belasco, my friend Michael Kuchwara, the Associated Press theater critic who died this year, used to lament the destruction of the theater's lower boxes. (During a dark age of theater preservation, they were removed to make room for the Broadway run of ''The Rocky Horror Show'' -- which flopped.) Well, Mike, if you're up there watching with Belasco, you can toast their return. The gaping holes they left in the natural shape of the auditorium -- as if some front teeth had been knocked out -- are no longer there. With the original plasterwork recreated, the boxes are back where they belong.
The other major noticeable structural change is the elimination of the separate entrance for patrons with tickets in the second balcony, a holdover from the era in which classes of theatergoers were kept separate. (Perhaps not surprisingly given England's more entrenched class system during the early decades of the 20th century, this dual-entrance design is much more prevalent in the West End of London.)
Lighting was of paramount significance to Belasco, a producer, playwright and all-around showman who was known less for the quality of his taste in dramatic literature than for his commercial success and dedication to a kind of surface realism that allowed him to indulge his near-maniacal attention to detail. ''The all-important factor in a dramatic production,'' Belasco once said, ''is the lighting of the scenes.''
This curious aesthetic emphasis sounds laughable today, but Belasco's appreciation of the emotional effects of lighting in his productions lives on in the attention he brought to the lighting of the theater. With its remarkably varied and detailed Tiffany fixtures now refurbished or recreated, and aglow with their original luster, the Belasco is easily the most gorgeously lighted theater on Broadway. (The veteran Broadway lighting designer Ken Billington consulted on the project.)
''We tried to bring the theater back to what David Belasco originally envisioned,'' Mr. Stein said. ''He wanted a night at this theater to be almost like spending the evening in his living room.''
His actual living room, at least for the last couple of decades of his life, was right upstairs. Although it is not accessible to the public, and has not been restored, the duplex apartment Belasco built on top of the theater still exists, albeit in run-down and bare-bones form. (Heading up to take a look, we passed some decrepit former offices, one of which had a windowed door on which the words ''American Model Agency'' was stenciled, inspiring visions of aspiring chorines facing the predations of oily manipulators.)
You can still get a sense of Belasco's peculiar aesthetic from the hollowed out, atmospherically decayed rooms. The dark woodwork is suggestive of a gothic church, a curiously oppressive environment for most people, but a warm bath for a man known as ''the bishop of Broadway,'' who actually dressed in pseudoclerical garb.
The walls do quite a lot of talking in the new old Belasco. Three different artists -- Albert Crisp, Everett Shinn and a man obscurely referred to in theater archives only as Chmielewski -- supplied murals for the theater. Some of the most beautiful, the Fragonard-esque pastoral scenes by Shinn on the mezzanine level, had been entirely effaced with a layer of dull gray paint, for reasons that are hard to fathom. Specialists spent months removing the gray -- with the help of masking tape! -- and the murals have now been cleaned and restored to their former bucolic beauty, giving the first balcony its own ambience.
Below the orchestra level, where a new bar and a plush array of bathrooms have now been added, are a series of murals by Chmielewski depicting scenes from the early Wagner opera ''Rienzi.'' Just to the left of the bar is a portrait of a red-clad pope. The face is Belasco's, looking sober and self-important.
The opera connection has a curious resonance today, since Belasco's name probably appears more often on opera programs than theater ones, thanks to Puccini's adaptations of his plays ''Madame Butterfly'' and ''The Girl of the Golden West.'' And among important directors of later eras, Franco Zeffirelli perhaps most potently embodied the Belasco style, with its obsessive attention to the detailed, quasinaturalistic atmospherics of production. It's an approach that tends to make for more popular success than lasting renown.
In an assessment of Belasco's career from 1919 the critic Ludwig Lewisohn described him as ''this prestidigitator of light and shadows, this clever artificer, this glorified interior decorator.'' No doubt there is much truth in that assessment. The dozens of plays Belasco wrote or co-wrote are virtually never produced today. But the renovated Belasco makes for an enduring shrine to his skills in those not insignificant aspects of theater. The play of light and shadow in its public spaces does indeed weave its own magic spell, even when the stage is bare, occupied by stagehands preparing to load in a new show.
It makes a fitting monument to a man who loved his art so much he believed it almost amounted to a faith requiring its own clergy. Beginning in October, when the new musical ''Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown'' begins previews, the Belasco cathedral will once again be open for worship.

HEADLINE: Following Workers' Trails of Tears in China

BYLINE: By ELLA TAYLOR

 BODY:
Los Angeles
IN the quietly devastating documentary ''Last Train Home'' Chinese migrant workers huddle together in an overcrowded railway car, sweating through their annual ride home for the New Year holiday. One nattily coiffed young man inveighs against the West, complaining bitterly that American consumers who buy the cheap Chinese goods he makes also get to spend most of their higher salaries on discretionary items, while he, who makes those goods, must send most of his earnings home to support his family.
Lixin Fan, who shot, edited and directed the film, might have chosen to stick with this feisty representative of the new China. Instead his camera cuts away to a middle-aged couple who sit in silence. Zhang Changhua and Cheng Suqin, who make this trip every year to visit the children they left behind nearly two decades ago, belong to a mostly ignored generation of roughly 130 million migrant workers who have sacrificed their productive years, and possibly the integrity of their families, in service to China's headlong rush into global economic supremacy. 
''Many times I was in tears at all this misery,'' Mr. Fan said, seated in an anteroom at the Los Angeles Asian-Pacific Film Festival, where ''Last Train Home'' played in May after winning praise at the Sundance Film Festival. ''If you were on this train with hundreds of migrants around us -- it stinks, it's dirty and everyone's trying to survive, just to see their kids.''
In 2006 Mr. Fan and a skeleton crew of three began documenting the effects of industrial change on this family, with whom he spent three years, on and off.
Mr. Zhang and Ms. Cheng left their village in Sichuan -- Mr. Fan's home province and the country's largest exporter of labor -- to work in Guangzhou, the world's largest manufacturing source of denim jeans. The film cuts between the factory where they toil seven days a week, and the bucolic but chronically poor countryside where they visit their little boy and teenage daughter, who are raised by a careworn yet uncomplaining grandmother who suffered even worse privation under Mao Zedong.
Mr. Fan, a slender 33-year-old who cheerfully attributes his fluent English to ''fighting with my Chinese-American girlfriend,'' showed a sociologist's grasp of the broad shifts that have afflicted workers like this couple. The lack of farm subsidies and expropriation of farmland for urban construction have crippled agriculture, while an outdated housing registration system that denies education and social services to rural migrants in the city has created a sharp class divide and placed untenable strains on the traditionally close-knit Chinese family.
The film's unnerving railway station scenes -- panoramic views of frustrated crowds surging forward, barely contained by nervous police officers with truncheons -- underscore these changes and the growing specter of civil war. ''The government does not have a perfect track record of dealing with dissent,'' Mr. Fan said carefully. ''So civil war would be a terrible thing. While I was making this film, it was difficult to figure out where to point the finger. At the government? The factory owners and corporations? The West? I'm not in a righteous place to answer, but I hope to raise this question for my audience.''
Mr. Fan encountered little serious official opposition, perhaps because of his accommodating demeanor, or because national issues are kept mostly in the background of this intimate film, which opens Friday at the IFC Center in Greenwich Village.
To gain the family's trust Mr. Fan and his crew ate with them in their dormitory in Guangzhou, taught them how to manage their own wireless mikes, which they wore constantly, and would sleep on the pile of warm jeans the couple made while the crew waited to tag along after they finished their shift at midnight. ''So 15 minutes into the film, after that first train ride,'' he said proudly, ''we'd already known each other for a year.''
''The mom once told me that they worked for 29 days, 15 hours a day straight,'' Mr. Fan said. ''The dormitories are right across the street from their factory, so it takes one minute exactly to go from their sewing machine to their bed. So that's what they did for that month -- sewing machine, bed, sewing machine, bed.''
At home Mr. Zhang and Ms. Cheng encountered their deeply resentful daughter, Qin, 17, who rebels against her parents' pressure to get the grades they see as her passport to a better life. At one point the simmering tensions come to a boil, forcing Mr. Fan to decide on his feet whether to intervene. ''The kids want more attention, and the parents are never around,'' he said. ''The parents know that education is the only way to, as we call it, jump out of the dragon's door, out of poverty. But Qin, who is rebellious, independent and smart, did it her own way.''
Still, Mr. Fan doesn't believe that the Chinese family is close to collapse. ''Down deep we are still very family oriented,'' he said. ''When Qin gets a little older, she will come to understand that.''
He added, laughing, ''I still call my mom every other day.''
If Mr. Fan belongs to a new generation of Internet-savvy filmmakers schooled in Western liberal ideas, his spiritual, intellectual and cinematic influences reflect both ancient tradition and modernity. His father was a college professor and projectionist, and Mr. Fan grew up watching foreign films. Like many of his generation, he broke with tradition by leaving home for Beijing, then gave up a prestigious job (''My mom thought I was crazy'') with the CCTV network, briefly relocating to Canada before working as a sound man and associate producer on the well-received 2007 documentary ''Up the Yangtze,'' about the mass displacements caused by the building of the Three Gorges Dam.
''Lixin is not from the foreign-influenced cultural centers,'' said Daniel Cross, president of EyesteelFilm company in Montreal, which produced ''Up the Yangtze'' and co-produced ''Last Train Home'' with the ITVS television and cable company, which holds the North American television rights. ''He comes from the sticks, and that's what makes him unique.''
Mr. Fan said he is a committed Taoist, and his eye for the interplay of beauty and ugliness is influenced by what he calls the ''epic poetry'' of the director Jia Zhangke, whose 2004 feature ''The World'' centered on the youthful staff of a giant theme park that replicates the world's famous tourist spots.
''I see a lot of Chinese philosophy in Jia's film,'' said Mr. Fan, who added that he hopes to seed his next project, a documentary about China's green initiative focusing on a state-financed wind farm on the Silk Road in the Gobi Desert, with his earnings from ''Last Train Home.''
''I'll shoot there and in a remote mountain school where Taoist philosophy originated, where they recruit peasant children to teach them Tai Chi with martial art,'' he said. ''It's yin and yang, keeping the balance between human desire and what nature can give you.''

HEADLINE: Encouraging the Poor to Stay Poor

BYLINE: By J. C. BRADBURY. 
J. C. Bradbury, a sports economist at Kennesaw State University, is author of ''Hot Stove Economics,'' to be published in October.

 BODY:
Major League Baseball had a minor scandal last week when closely guarded financial data from several teams was leaked to the public.
The documents revealed that three franchises -- the Florida Marlins, the Tampa Bay Rays and the Pittsburgh Pirates -- generated healthy profits while receiving substantial revenue-sharing payments that were supposed to be used to improve on-field performance. Though this revelation may be embarrassing to baseball, what revenue-sharing recipients were doing with their transferred wealth was not surprising.
Baseball's revenue-sharing system was designed to increase the competitiveness of small-market teams that presumably lack the financial muscle to compete with wealthier franchises. Redistributing wealth would give poor teams more resources to improve their rosters, and richer clubs would have less money to extend their financial advantage. The cumulative effect would be to spread good players around the league to achieve a level of competitive balance where ''every well-run club has a regularly recurring reasonable hope of reaching postseason play'' -- the standard put forth by the Commissioner's Blue Ribbon Panel on Baseball Economics. 
Despite the good intentions behind revenue sharing, doling out money to baseball's have-nots has the unintended consequence of creating a disincentive to win. Though the correlation is not perfect, winning tends to attract fans, which increases local revenue. But a healthier bottom line means drawing less from the revenue-sharing pool. The quandary faced by poor-and-losing teams is that using the added wealth to improve their clubs increases local earnings, but these gains may be offset by reducing revenue-sharing payments.
In my book on valuing baseball players, I estimated the relationship between winning and revenue for M.L.B. teams. The revenue function shows disparate responses to winning at various levels of success, which support the notion that revenue sharing discourages improvement. The function shows that improving from a mid-60s-win team to a mid-70s-win team generates financial losses. The observed revenue bump from losing is consistent with the hypothesized disincentive to win when teams face a cut in revenue sharing. I refer to this region as the loss trap, because improving your team over this range of wins can cost you money.
Also, strong returns to winning do not kick in until a team hits the mid-80s in wins. Losing teams might improve their financial standing somewhat if they improved drastically, but transforming a loser to a winner does not happen overnight and cannot be willed into existence. Thus, the safety net offered by revenue sharing encourages teams to remain perpetually bad.
Investing revenue-sharing money into a team does not always make sound business sense; therefore, it is not surprising that low-revenue teams choose to hoard revenue-sharing disbursements. And though revenue-sharing recipients are charged to use the money to improve on-field performance, what constitutes proper use is hard to determine. The players union was able to coax the Florida Marlins to sign Josh Johnson to a four-year, $39 million deal by threatening legal action for not properly using its revenue-sharing receipts. The leaked documents, however, reveal that monitoring team behavior in light of bad incentives has proved difficult.
The failure of revenue sharing to promote competitive balance can also be seen in baseball's historical record. Since its introduction in the mid 1990s, revenue sharing has not made baseball any more competitive than it used to be. Sports economists often measure competitive balance by comparing the standard deviation of winning percentages across teams to an ideally balanced league where all teams are of equal strength, a measure known as the Noll-Scully ratio, which was named after the sports economists Roger Noll and Gerald Scully. As the metric declines toward one, competitive balance improves. The Noll-Scully ratio saw a drastic reduction in the average imbalance in baseball from 2.4 in the 1930s to 1.8 in the early-1990s. Since then, the ratio has not declined any further. Thus, the addition of revenue sharing appears to have had little effect on competitive balance.
It does not appear payrolls are the best policy instrument for improving competitive balance. Though payroll and winning are correlated, several teams have found success on small budgets in recent history, including the revenue-sharing scofflaws Rays and Marlins. It is also not clear that baseball's competitive balance needs further improvement. Since 2000, 23 of M.L.B.'s 30 clubs have made the playoffs, and two of the seven that have not reached the playoffs (the Cincinnati Reds and the Texas Rangers) are on track to participate in the postseason this year.
Growing attendance and revenue over the past decade do not indicate that fans are turned off by any perceived imbalance, and revenue sharing does not appear to help poor teams compete. Rather than tweaking the current revenue-sharing system, I think it would be best if M.L.B. abandoned it.

HEADLINE: Neighborly Borrowing, Over the Online Fence

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
THE first time I unboxed my gleaming Roomba, I beamed like a proud new parent as I placed it gently on my hardwood floor.
That evening, I watched it putter around my apartment, sweeping and inhaling dust bunnies. When it gamely bumbled around bulky pieces of furniture, I dashed about, too, lifting the obstacles out of its way. After the Roomba finished its chaotic dance, I put it back into its case and patted the sweet little machine good night. The next morning, I returned it to its rightful owner.
The Roomba was mine for only 24 hours. I had rented it through a service called SnapGoods, which allows people to lend out their surplus gadgetry and various gear for a daily fee.
SnapGoods is one of the latest start-ups that bases its business model around allowing people to share, exchange and rent goods in a local setting. Among others are NeighborGoods and ShareSomeSugar. Other commercial services are springing up, too, including group-buying sites like Groupon, the peer-to-peer travel site Airbnb and Kickstarter, which allows people to invest small sums in creative ventures. 
The common thread of all these sites is that access trumps ownership; consumers are offered ways to share goods instead of having to buy them.
Ron J. Williams, co-founder of SnapGoods, based in New York, describes the phenomenon as the ''access economy.''
''There may always be certain products that you do need to buy,'' says Mr. Williams. ''But there is also a growing cultural awareness that you don't always get enjoyment out of hyperconsumption. The notion of ownership as the barrier between you and what you need is outdated.''
The most obvious reason for all of this is financial. Recession-battered shoppers can test pricey new devices before deciding whether to take the plunge or wait until the next upgrade. (Roombas, for example, can retail for as much as $600 for the newer models. I borrowed mine for a much more palatable $10.)
For all the promise of these new marketplaces, analysts say they aren't likely to overtake more traditional models anytime soon.
''The holy grails of consumerism are convenience and choice,'' says Rachel Botsman, co-author of the forthcoming book, ''What's Mine Is Yours: The Rise of Collaborative Consumption.'' ''This is not the end of the old consumer way. But they could sit side by side. Peer-to-peer could become the default way to share.''
There's much evidence that this is already happening. Do-it-yourself home improvers can borrow tools for a weekend project, and hobbyist campers can rent equipment per trip, rather than splurge on all-new gear. Travelers looking for inexpensive accommodations can spend the night in someone's spare bedroom for a fraction of the cost of a hotel room. For people who lend their stuff, it's a way to make extra money on possessions that are gathering dust.
''My Roomba is on track to pay for itself,'' says Luke Tucker, 31, a software engineer who rented me his robotic vacuum cleaner through SnapGoods.
But some experts think that there may be something bigger than thriftiness at play. These services may be gaining popularity because they reinforce a sense of community.
''It turns out to actually be a good way to meet my neighbors,'' says Mr. Tucker, who also lists a jigsaw, a digital camera and a wireless keyboard for rent on SnapGoods.
Charlis Floyd, a 22-year-old student, and Nema Williams, a 30-year-old comedian, who rent out their spare bedroom in Brooklyn on Airbnb, say that while the extra income helps -- as any little bit does these days -- they're much more interested in the revolving cast of characters they meet.
''We had a couple from England teach us how to make red curry,'' says Ms. Floyd.
''Another guy, an artist, promised to paint a mural in our kitchen,'' adds Mr. Williams.
Of course, that doesn't mean it always goes off without a hitch.''Sometimes people can be weird,'' says Ms. Floyd. ''One girl drank all our milk and another person broke our toilet handle.''
Even so, Ms. Floyd and Mr. Williams still like being in the rental business.
''It's a win-win situation,'' says Ms. Floyd. ''You make some extra money and make new friends.''
For entrepreneurs, there's a payoff in such commerce. Groupon, for example, says it's on track to generate $500 million in revenue this year; Airbnb has said it is profitable, though it does not provide exact numbers.
Paul J. Zak, director of the Center for Neuroeconomics Studies at Claremont Graduate University in California, says that participating in a community like SnapGoods, Kickstarter, Groupon or Airbnb can ease social isolation and flesh out our network of friends.
''There is an underlying notion that if I rent my things in my house, I get to meet my neighbor, and if I'm walking the goods over, I get to meet them in person,'' he says. ''We're drawing on a desire in a fast-paced world to still have real connections to a community.''
Mr. Zak says he conducted a preliminary experiment indicating that posting messages on Twitter caused the release of oxytocin, a neurotransmitter that evokes feelings of contentment and is thought to help induce a sense of positive social bonding. He is now testing those ideas in research on a group of 40 people.
The social interaction ''reduces stress hormones, even through the Web,'' he says. ''You're feeling a real physiological relationship to that person, even if they are online.''
MR. ZAK says Web commerce is moving beyond transactions by individuals and companies and embracing models that encourage social contact and interaction -- a hallmark of the already robust social media phenomenon and a throwback to the good old days when people actually spent time socializing at local markets.
''The Web is bringing businesses back down to the individual as the average company becomes smaller, more niche and specialized,'' he says. ''Paradoxically, the Web is moving us back to a human-centric business model.''
Trust is a big factor in all of this. Otherwise, how can you be sure that someone won't just rip you off?
Marketplaces like eBay have long relied on ratings and user reviews to weed out unreliable participants. But in addition to safeguards like preauthorizing the price of rentals through PayPal, the latest wave of peer-to-peer systems make use of social networks like Facebook and Twitter to engender trust.
If someone wants to rent your iPad or crash on your couch, the person's online profile leaves a trail of digital bread crumbs that makes it harder to pull off a scam, giving potential lenders and hosts reason to breathe easier.
''This new economy,'' says Ms. Botsman, ''is going to be driven entirely by reputation, which is part of a new cultural shift -- seeing how our behavior in one community affects what we can access in another.''

HEADLINE: A Rose May Be a Rose -- or a Rosario

 BODY:
Last week, Sam Roberts wrote a front-page article in The Times detailing how the traditional immigrant gambit of changing one's name to something that sounds more ''American'' -- to help speed assimilation, avoid detection, deter discrimination or begin a business -- has all but disappeared. The practice began to decline within the past few decades, he wrote, ''and the evidence of its rarity, if not formally quantified, can be found in almost any American courthouse.''
About 200 readers commented on nytimes.com. Following are excerpts -- some readers signed their names, some did not.
Growing up with a unique name, it seemed to be quite a disadvantage. But over time, I have realized that there is one advantage. Once someone learns a unique name, they rarely forget. In fact, it's often more difficult to remember very common names. 
GN
Perhaps the practice ''evolved'' because the rest of the world actually did evolve. Names that previously (i.e., 50, 100 or 200 years ago) conjured up broken countries, harsh dictators, uneducated populations or asylum situations have moved forward, as have the connotations of such surnames. Just a thought.
SRon
In French I change the pronunciation of my given name; in Spanish I happily add a word-final ''o.'' If I moved permanently to a French- or Spanish-speaking country, I could envision changing my surname as well, as it doesn't conform to the spelling or pronunciation rules of either language. There is nothing wrong with changing one's name when one emigrates to a new land. If anything, it shows some deference to one's hosts, rather than daring them to mispronounce or misspell what can be for them a very strange-sounding name, and facilitates communication in general.
Robert Owen Jr.
It's interesting how many readers entertain the superficial viewpoint of equating uniformity in names with assimilation. The assimilation we need is civic assimilation, i.e., acceptance of the value system on which our liberal Western civilization is based, including individual freedom, democratic institutions, separation of church and state, etc. I think it's worth the effort to learn how to pronounce names beyond Bob, Jon, Steve, etc. Especially since we are inevitably going to move away from a consumer-driven economy to an export-driven one.
In our family, our children have names whose roots are in Sanskrit. We combed through hundreds of candidate names until we could find ones that are not too long, relatively easy to pronounce and have unique pronunciations. We added a strategically positioned consonant to their surnames to enable correct pronunciation. When one of my colleagues asked whether I was going to give my son an ''American name,'' my response was: ''Well, he is an American by birth, and hence his name is an American name by my definition.''
Ajit
The comments on here about how immigrants should assimilate all seem to contain threats of doom. ... Our nation will crumble if they don't change their names! And, ''funny'' names won't get you anywhere. When it comes to names and success ... uh, Barack Obama? Need I say more?
kok1922
My name is Juergen, and I have found people to be much more curious and courteous about my name than that of my partner, who has an equally unusual, albeit Korean name.
I can therefore attest to the fact that the way people react to your name largely depends on where that name (and the person who carries it) is from and how they perceive that particular part of the world.
However, I have also observed that people who carry their (unusual) name with pride are often treated better than those who seem to be ashamed of it.
JuergenNYC
I would like to also add another reason to the reasons mentioned in the article. Immigration in the 21st century can't be compared with what it was a century ago.
Back in those days, many people would pack up all their lives and leave their country for good. In the era of globalization, immigrants usually have the ability to keep both countries as their ''home,'' since the only thing to do is to buy a ticket and fly back home in less than a day. Andrew
We changed our children's original names to ''American'' ones when they were 5 and 9. The way I looked at it, they did not need to be yoked to names that held meaning to a culture half a world away and to relatives whom they would meet less and less as they grew up. Also, since the English spellings of their names (even though we chose them as ones that would be easy to say and spell) invariably led to incorrect pronunciations of the names. So, not changing the names would have meant staying loyal to the spelling and not to the sound of their original names -- evoking the meaning of the names was never an option anyway. Seemed quite pointless.
With my own foreign name, I experience daily how new acquaintances stumble on the name, or simply don't use it as casually as they would an easier/more familiar name. We did not want the kids to be saddled with this their entire lives. We wanted them to have names over which neither they nor their peers/co-workers would stumble. In other words, I wanted them to be able to easily introduce themselves to a crowd and get on to the more serious (and fun) business of whatever they were there to do -- schmooze, give a presentation, lead, persuade, and yes, charm. In other words, we wanted them to be in control of their ''otherness.''
At home we still use their Indian names. The kids -- now in their late teens/early 20s -- understand the rationale and appreciate the sacrifice we willingly made. We have high expectations not just for their life achievement, but also for their engagement in a fully realized assimilated life. Their names make this eminently possible.

I was born here in America, but am of an ethnic group where it is relatively unusual to change names, so my parents gave me a name typical of ''the homeland.'' And it's been a challenge. The vast majority of time when I meet someone new and they actually bother to say my name, they mispronounce it. I will correct, but much of the time they'll quickly go back to their mispronunciation.
In any sort of group setting where multiple introductions are taking place, I almost always get just a ''hello'' after introducing myself, whereas my colleagues are more likely to hear ''hello, John'' or what have you. Sounds minor, but inevitably the person feels more comfortable conversing with John than the guy with the weird name. And trying to mingle at a social event or bar or the like? Good luck.
Lastly, some of these comments seem to imply that the mispronouncing of unfamiliar names is a lesser issue in New York. I can safely say in my case that not only is that not so, it's probably even worse because here people assume they know how to pronounce it correctly and never actually listen to how I say it.
Bimmer
Anglicizing a surname is very much in the eye of the beholder. My grandfather thought that changing all of the ''y''s to ''i''s in his consonant-laden jumble of a last name would make him Americanized. Here I sit, more than 80 years later, with a surname that is still unmistakably Eastern European and not remotely easy to pronounce.
BobG
A John Smith would probably be able to add another perspective. In this day and age, one wants to be individually ''Googleable.'' The fewer doppelgangers one encounters online, the easier it is to establish what I've been told is called ''a presence.'' So, good for you all, the unique name may not be any more pronounceable, but it will be a lot stickier.
Exactly how many other people do you think there are in the world with the name Barack Obama? That could hardly be said for David Jones. Sometimes fitting in has its own disadvantages.
Bitherwack
Names, like haircuts, are, for some odd reason, supposed to be drawn from a small canonical pot. But notice, even among the natives, an always-present tendency to spice things up with novel spellings, unexpected combinations and new lexical choices.
Difference has a charge and a thrill associated with it -- everything depends on whether you are repelled or attracted. Do you feel comfortable, or trapped, in those areas where everyone looks (and talks) like they have the same grandmother? Or do you like it around here, where often enough two random passers-by haven't shared an ancestor in 20,000 years?
hquain
I don't agree with the article. I arrived in the United States about 15 years ago with a 10-letter last name that Americans (i.e. people born in this country who haven't left the United States and who don't speak another language) had a massively hard time pronouncing or spelling.
I tolerated this situation for five years and then I changed my name to a much shorter name. Life got better instantly. My mail is now spelled right, people address me without discomfort, they also don't assume I'm foreign immediately as they had before, etc.
Liliana
The only American names would be Native American names, and not Anglicized versions like Running Horse. And to pretend that people tried harder to be all alike in the past is just a myth. If that were true all of America would be exactly alike and boring. Santa Fe would look like Cleveland and we would be eating at McDonald's in the former French Quarter instead of purring in joy over shrimp Creole and gumbo. I say bring on the differences! It makes life more interesting.

HEADLINE: Women Who Hit Very Hard

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN. 
Michael Kimmelman writes the Abroad column on culture and society for The New York Times and is the chief art critic.

 BODY:
ON THE DAY BEFORE Wimbledon started, when the club grounds had not yet opened to the public, Justine Henin, the diminutive Belgian tennis great, stepped onto practice court No. 3, then still an emerald patch of unspoiled grass. The sun had just come out after several cloudy days, and all around, players, their coaches and families, yammering in various languages, exchanged greetings like veteran bunkmates on the first day at summer camp. Not Henin. Having unretired last year as suddenly as she quit 16 months earlier -- saying she had got all she wanted from the sport -- she remained absorbed with her coach, Carlos Rodriguez, in their warm-up routine.
She began exchanging ground strokes, forehands and backhands, slowly then harder, with a hitting partner, one of the men that the top women hire to practice with, a tall, powerful young Briton, Scott Sears, who missed a few shots, apologized and began to sweat. Henin missed nothing, ever. Most eyes now turned toward her, drawn by the silence of the practice, which was interrupted only when Rodriguez, to whom Henin kept turning for assurance, issued a gentle ''marche'' every once in a while. 
In Henin, the line between an expression of vulnerability and a devouring stare of slightly sour competitiveness can be fuzzy. Venus and Serena Williams, the game's longtime dominant sisters, tend to look more abstracted, in a world closed onto themselves. Until they're threatened. Then the array of weapons -- the fist pumps, the drive to win, the sheer, overwhelming athleticism -- emerge. Henin, ''the sister of no mercy,'' as she is called, is a more elegant player but no less unrelentingly obsessed with crushing her opponents.
Finished, she gathered up her belongings, leaving Sears in a pool of sweat, then walked off, head down so as not to catch anyone's eye, trying to preserve, it seemed, like breath on glass, the focus she had on court. Even practicing, she made an argument for promoters who claim that women's tennis has never been better off.
Women have certainly never hit harder and not just on account of improved equipment. They're stronger, bigger, faster, better trained and pushed above all by the example of the Williams sisters. Serena, glorious and musclebound, and Venus, long-limbed and tall, have redefined the sport around power. Years ago, tennis writers used to call Martina Navratilova, listed at 5-foot-8 and lean, a giantess with popping veins because other women seemed weaklings by comparison. Now most tour players would dwarf her. In large part what makes Henin, at 5-foot-5, such an exception on the tour and such fun to watch is that she's nearly always David against the rising tide of Goliaths.
''When I started, all the top players thought the Grand Slams began in the quarterfinals, because the early rounds were so easy and we only had to give 50 percent to get through them,'' Kim Clijsters, Belgium's other tennis superstar, told me when we sat down to talk one day at Wimbledon. ''Now I have to be at least 85 to 90 percent at my best from the beginning of a tournament. Venus and Serena raised the bar for everyone. We all had to go back to the gym. Younger players saw that, and now they're hitting harder and harder.''
This is a basic truth about the Williamses, held among professional watchers of the sport as well as players. Venus says it herself: ''Serena and I did change the game, and it's interesting to see people on court now trying to do all our moves. To be that person, the one who changed the game, wow, that's too good to be true.''
Lately, it has been Serena, the top-ranked woman, who has dominated the field, but a foot injury forced her to withdraw from the United States Open, the last major tournament of the year. Pretenders have come and gone in recent years, capitalizing on the sisters' irregular schedules, as well as on Henin's absence, before succumbing to injury or nerves or simply retiring. When, for a while, both Henin and Clijsters, who quit in 2007 to have a baby, were gone, the game looked bereft of its only serious challengers.
Clijsters is now back, defending her United States Open title in New York beginning this week. That, so shortly after coming out of retirement, she could have won at all last year (Serena crashed out in their semifinal over a foot-fault call she profanely protested) signaled to some skeptics how thin on the ground are the women capable of actually winning majors. With Henin suffering a partial ligament fracture to her right elbow in a match against Clijsters at Wimbledon and now out of commission for the rest of the year, one of those few women is missing, again.
But back, too, from shoulder trouble, is Maria Sharapova, the Russian champion and tennis's commercial gold mine, the quintessential baseline basher with razor-sharp ball-striking abilities. She won her last Grand Slam in 2008 and reached the final against Clijsters earlier this month in Cincinnati, where she injured her heel but looked as if she had nearly returned to form. At Wimbledon, after beating Anastasia Pivovarova, another towering Russian, 6-1, 6-0, in the first round, she could be seen marching back to the locker room, all business, cellphone clapped to one ear, her white satin bolero sparkling in the afternoon glare as the crowds, like filings drawn to a magnet, swiveled to watch her pass, whispering ''Sharapova'' in her wake as if she were an apparition.
At the same time, Caroline Wozniacki, a young Dane, has fought her way close to the top, joining Vera Zvonareva, Victoria Azarenka and veterans like Elena Dementieva, Svetlana Kuznetsova, Jelena Jankovic and Samantha Stosur. The feel-good match of the year, at the French Open in June, pitted Stosur, 26, against Francesca Schiavone, 29, a wry, extroverted Italian, both favorites on tour with all-around games, rarities among the women these days, and both sharing the unusual condition of not being one or the other of the Williams sisters in a Grand Slam final. Schiavone wept after winning. Even Stosur conceded the contest was special.
Yet the very exceptional quality of that match -- its variety and unpredictability -- served to reinforce skeptics' views that women's tennis, based on grinding power, is for better and worse all about the greatness and influence of the Williams sisters.
Which is to say that it's not common these days to find women with their range: with the defensive skills to neutralize the big serves, or an accomplished net game or a good second serve. Many women's matches get bogged down with baseline exchanges -- a criticism that might be leveled at the men's matches except that, as Federer put it after losing to Andy Murray in the final of the Rogers Cup in Toronto earlier this month, the men, in general, are more evenly matched. They ''don't have the margins like maybe exist in women's tennis,'' whereby players like the Williamses ''can just come out and maybe dominate an opponent every single time,'' Federer said. ''That doesn't happen in the men's game.''
It doesn't. More than that, off court as well as on, and here the criticism becomes more intangible, the two best male players of the era, Federer and Rafael Nadal, have made a point of praising competitors and showing how much they love the sport and how devoted to it they are. Playing against each other, they've also mustered some of the most brilliant matches in tennis history. Contests between Venus and Serena, though improved in recent years, were for a long time understandable but notorious duds, anticlimaxes to major championships in which fans didn't know whom to root for. Venus has been the player representative for the tour behind the scenes, but the sisters can sometimes give the impression, publicly, that they really aren't all that interested in the game. At Wimbledon, they sent reporters back to earlier interviews rather than answer questions they didn't want to answer, talking about soccer, outfits, meeting the queen, anything but tennis. And after Serena snapped at that foot-fault call, even insiders who sympathized said the incident conjured up a time when John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors made the men's game seem nasty. If you couldn't blame her, she still made it hard to take her side.
Does that matter? ''When Chrissie and Martina were winning 36 majors,'' Billie Jean King, the tennis legend, talking pure performance, not personality, recalled of the Chris Evert versus Martina Navratilova rivalry of the late '70s and early '80s, ''everyone was complaining about only two good players, no depth. Now, that was supposedly the golden age, and there's no depth and only the Williams sisters today? Give me a break. My lord, what I would give to hit one ball like them.''
It's true, there is more depth now, meaning more women beyond the top 10 or 20 or even top 100 who can smack a given forehand or backhand harder than King ever dreamed of doing, although consistency is another question. Ana Ivanovic, who looked to be the next Maria Sharapova after she won the French Open in 2008 and rose to No. 1, is beautiful, charming and talkative. She was called the future of tennis until she slumped, her serve and forehand betrayed by nerves. This month in Cincinnati, she lost in a semifinal to Clijsters, withdrawing in tears after hurting her foot. She wrestled in the first round at Wimbledon with her service toss against Shahar Peer, from Israel. Tennis is a game; but it can be heartbreaking to watch sometimes. One set down, scrambling to stay alive in the second, Ivanovic slammed her racquet in frustration. She kept making mistakes, defeating herself. Her talent escaped her. Afterward, snatching up her belongings, she hurried through the crowd toward the locker room, struggling not to break down in public.
It's a sign of both the game's depth and inconsistency that Schiavone and Stosur, like Ivanovic, also lost first-round matches at Wimbledon. Playing Vera Dushevina, another tough, tall Russian right-hander, then ranked No. 56, Schiavone grabbed the first set but soon fell behind in the second, beseeching her coach in the stands, loudly complaining about herself in Italian, urging Dushevina's lobs to sail out, gesticulating like a taxi driver stuck in traffic and grunting on some shots as if a chicken had lodged in her throat. It was hugely entertaining but sloppy tennis. At one point, Schiavone hit a miraculous backhand winner and spread her arms like Goya's defiant hero in ''The Third of May.'' The crowd roared.
But to no avail. Across the grounds, Stosur, exhausted after Paris, was falling in straight sets against Kaia Kanepi, a 5-foot-11 Estonian who had to qualify to get into the tournament. Wimbledon had barely started, and the tour's latest stars had both bitten the dust.
''I THINK IT'S sort of cyclical,'' said Bud Collins, the legendary tennis commentator, when I asked him about the ups and downs of the women's tour over the years. But, he added, ''when they talk about depth today, I snicker.''
Depth means more talent, more players who can knock the bejesus out of a ball. But there's a difference between more good tennis players and more great ones. Stacey Allaster, chairwoman and chief executive of the Women's Tennis Association, says that there are more great ones. One morning, she delivered the tour's basic message. ''Our underlying mission and values remain as strong as they were in 1973,'' she said, ''plus we have greater responsibility now in going to places like China and the Middle East, showing the world that women are strong and deserve to be treated equally.'' Feminist missionary work aside, tour executives see global outreach as critical to the bottom line, especially as fewer top players are from the United States, traditionally the sport's biggest market.
The top 100 women players now come from 33 countries, most of the best from Eastern Europe -- countries like Russia, Serbia, Poland and the Czech Republic, nations hungry to nurture the sport. America's problem, if there is one, may be a lack of urgency and the fierce competition from other sports. At Wimbledon, I found Nick Bollettieri, whose Florida academy has churned out droves of tour players over the years. He was watching an academy product, Michelle Larcher de Brito, a gifted Portuguese player with an ear-shattering grunt, giving Serena Williams a brief scare on Center Court, walloping backhands to the corners before Williams aced her way out of trouble.
''You hear all sorts of theories -- it's probably just a passing phase,'' Bollettieri shrugged about the American situation, then finally decided for the theory that ''the best American girls are not going into tennis.''
One positive result has been that tennis has developed a larger, increasingly global audience. Western media outlets took notice when Andy Murray reached the semifinals at Wimbledon and 10 million Britons tuned in on television. But when one of China's top female players, Zheng Jie, played at Wimbledon last year, as Allaster pointed out to me, 100 million Chinese watched on CCTV.
So the tour is banking on China. For its part, China has only recently begun to bank on the tour. Li Na, who is 28 and her country's leading player, with a perch now in the Top 10, in person conveys the polite world-weariness of someone who has grown up navigating a vast government bureaucracy. ''My life has been like this,'' she said, making a wave motion with one hand. ''It is step by step in China.''
By this Li meant that only after she won a W.T.A. tournament, in 2004, the first Chinese woman to do so, did Chinese officials begin to take the sport seriously. ''It had all been about Ping-Pong and diving. When I started, the Chinese tennis federation chose my coach and told me which tournaments I could play in, and nobody was really pushing me, so at one point I said, 'Enough.' But then I got back into it, and after the Olympics'' -- in Beijing in 2008, where she reached the semifinals, beating Venus Williams and Kuznetsova along the way -- ''I was finally given a choice: to stay with the federation and the national team and have everything paid for, or, like players from other countries, choose my own coach and tournaments.
''Change comes slowly there,'' she said, ''and developing top players in China will depend on Chinese players winning.'' Of course winning depends on having already developed those players, the eternal paradox.
''I have no doubt that there will be a Chinese No. 1,'' says David Shoemaker, president of the W.T.A., who oversees the association's efforts in that country. ''People say the Chinese don't know how to develop players, that they're too rigid, but they're wrong,'' he says. ''Part of the beauty of the game is how unpredictable it has always been. What we've got today is in fact what everyone always said they wanted. There are eight different Grand Slam champions playing at Wimbledon, and a bunch more who have been No. 1.''
I found one of those players at Wimbledon, Jelena Jankovic, a former No. 1, now ranked third, from Serbia, a tough customer with a big smile and sunny profile. She was dressed in a pink warm-up suit, her jewelry jangling. ''In the last couple of years, as women's tennis has become more popular, some of the girls on tour have also been trying to look nicer, more feminine, and, face it, there are fans who like to look at girls in nice tennis dresses,'' she told me. ''It has become very competitive in this sense, but the level of tennis is very high. It all depends on how you want to develop your brand. Some players want to be known as great tennis players, others for something else. I smile a lot, I show my emotions, and maybe that's what I'm known for.''
Then she confirmed what many people say about developing top players: ''Coming from a poor country, I learned to work for my own sake to become somebody -- to earn success through hard work.''
Success can mean millions in prize money and endorsements. When the women's tour started in the early 1970s, the total annual prize money was $300,000. Today it's $86 million, counting the Grand Slams, which (and this remains one of the most contested topics behind the scenes) pay men and women equally. Wimbledon and the French Open lagged behind until Venus Williams wrote an article for The Times of London a few years ago claiming she felt like a second-class citizen. Tournament officials got the message.
King, whose straight-set victory over Bobby Riggs in the so-called Battle of the Sexes in 1973 attracted some 50 million television viewers around the world and gave the tour its initial publicity boost, reflected the other day on how players back then ''were activists, ours was totally a political movement, and today the tour is so much more important than most of the young players realize. They forget that a woman could not get a credit card on her own.''
King earned $1,800 for winning Wimbledon in the late 1960s, Navratilova, $18,000 in the '70s. Now the winner takes home $1.6 million. In the tour's early days, women had to barnstorm the globe to make a decent living, and the best players aimed to be ranked No. 1 when the season ended. Grand Slam trophies figured less in their calculations. Today stars construct their careers around the slams, picking and choosing among other tour events, which vie for their participation, creating a delicate and complicated ecosystem. The system demands a broad cast of supporting players, a bit like the expendable crew members on the old ''Star Trek'' series.
More of these supporting players struggle to make a living than the public probably imagines, considering all the money on tour. Shenay Perry, an American and a longtime player, now ranked No. 116, was laboring one afternoon at Wimbledon against Maria Kirilenko, a steady Russian with clean strokes, in a second-round match on Court 5, where the fans ebbed and flowed between games like rush-hour commuters. Julie Ditty, 30, a friend of Perry's and fellow tour player who, with Renata Voracova, a Czech, had just lost in a first-round doubles match against the Williams sisters, watched from the bleachers, seated behind her father, Jack Ditty, a dermatologist from Kentucky. Powerfully built and a live wire, Jack volunteered that he played tennis in college and, like many tennis parents, he seemed at least as competitive and driven as the touring pros. ''If you're not in the top 100,'' Jack told me, ''you're lucky to have any money at the end of any year.''
That's because costs are high. At Grand Slams like Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, top players may pay to take along a coach, a trainer, a practice partner and an assistant. A single slam can set a star back between $30,000 and $50,000, according to Carlos Fleming, an agent for I.M.G., the management firm with the largest stable of tennis players. A year on tour, Fleming estimated, can require an outlay of hundreds of thousands or more in travel expenses. For journeywomen, flying economy and sharing trainers and coaches, a Grand Slam can still cost $10,000, and annual costs can run as high as $150,000. Unlike players on a professional baseball team, whose contracts basically guarantee their salaries, pros on the tennis circuit must earn that money back by winning. And when their skills decline, so do their nest eggs, if they ever had them. Players end up playing to please themselves; it's a privilege, or a lark, to be on tour if you're not highly ranked, but rarely a gold mine.
''Julie could have made more doing other things,'' Jack Ditty said as Perry succumbed to Kirilenko, ''but this is what she wanted, and you can't ask more as a parent. We've helped Julie with expenses over the years. To see your daughter ace Venus and Serena back to back at Wimbledon, well, you can't ask for more,'' he added, referring to the high point in his daughter's doubles loss. ''I filmed it. Now Julie will always have done that. If I hadn't been here,'' he took the trouble to emphasize, ''nobody would know.''
ALLASTER LIKES TO call touring pros ''independent contractors,'' because they work for themselves. And this has consequences aside from having to earn a living with each game. Since 2001, the Williams sisters have boycotted the tournament at Indian Wells, in California, one of the tour's biggest events. Venus withdrew from the semifinals that year, and Serena was roundly booed afterward. Richard Williams, their father, claimed that he heard racist slurs. Despite being cajoled, fined, penalized and begged, they haven't returned. They're young, rich, profoundly gifted African-American women who operate as they wish, in a tennis world that's still overwhelmingly white, conformist and reluctant to acknowledge that race is even an issue. The Indian Wells boycott, a matter of principle or a show of power or both, underscores the tour's impotence. ''The business is ultimately not sustainable on the backs of two players,'' Allaster acknowledged at one point, finessing what Bud Collins later put more bluntly. The W.T.A., he said, is dependent on the Williams sisters even as it's hopeful that new champions will come along to supplant them.
So where are they? The top-ranked women today are, conspicuously, not getting any younger. Serena is about to turn 29; Venus is 30. The women's tour used to turn out a steady stream of teen idols. But new strength training and equipment have made it harder for teenagers to compete against grown women, and the tour is now wary of encouraging them to try. In 1979, Tracy Austin won the U.S. Open at age 16, reached No. 1 the next year, but fell out of the Top 10 by 22. A shoulder injury in 1985 did in Andrea Jaeger, who reached No. 2, also while a teenager. During the late '90s, Martina Hingis won five Grand Slams in her teens, then retired in 2003 at 22, returning to the tour three years later only to be expelled after testing positive for cocaine. And this summer, Jennifer Capriati, who reached the Top 10 at 14, in 1990, landed in a Florida hospital after an overdose of prescription drugs.
While there are young talents on tour, like Wozniacki and Melanie Oudin, the 18-year-old American right-hander, ranked No. 44, they're few. The casualty list prompted W.T.A. officials some years ago (the Williams sisters, who began playing as teenagers in the mid-1990s, were already around) to impose restrictions on whether and how much teenagers could play. ''I will listen to doctors more than to agents,'' is how Allaster puts it. Most insiders endorse the policy.
Others, like Mary Joe Fernandez, a retired American player, now a television commentator, contend that by protecting the many, the tour may be holding back that rare precocious player -- the next rival to the Williams sisters, perhaps -- who, like Hingis and Capriati, may happen to peak as a teenager. ''I understand the age rule, but I turned pro at 14 -- I missed my prom and graduation because I played the French Open -- and while not everybody is ready then, some are,'' Fernandez says. ''At the same time I don't entirely buy the argument about power, since the same thing was said years ago, whether it was that Navratilova hit harder than anyone, or Monica Seles or Capriati or now Serena. The game needs young stars. And it may be that some women develop younger.''
This view is seconded by Tom Perrotta, editor at large at Tennis magazine. ''Why does it matter if you start your career at 16 and end it at 25?'' he asked. ''Skeptics on the development side of the game will tell you that the women's tour has become more monotonous, that there's a missing generation. Some blame parents, some blame the academies turning out robot players, some the age rule. Maybe it's just that the Williams sisters have set the bar too high or that all the money spoils players' appetites for getting to the very top. I don't know. But I do know that while you have a bigger pool of good players from more countries, having many more good players doesn't substitute for having a few more icons.''
During Wimbledon's last weekend, Yulia Putintseva, a short, pony-tailed blond teenager from Russia, played Kristyna Pliskova, a tall, blonder teenager from the Czech Republic, also pony-tailed, in the semifinals of the girls' championship, where future Henins, Clijsterses and Williamses are supposed to emerge. Putintseva was the sort of player who threw herself into every serve, coiling, pouncing, grunting, too often double-faulting, avoiding the net as if it were the precipice of a cliff, bashing her racquet on the court in disgust.
Pliskova, a lanky, slightly gawky lefty, ambled and loped around the court, smacking heavy first serves and angled backhands. Rallies often dragged on from the baseline until someone committed an error, mostly Putintseva. Pliskova went up 4-0 in the first set. From the bleachers, Jan Bedan, Pliskova's coach, kept one eye on the game, the other on his mobile telephone, typing in her statistics.
''She looks good,'' I said to him.
''Easy first set, then complications,'' Bedan replied.
''Always?'' I asked.
''Always,'' he said, still typing.
I left for a press conference and returned to find Pliskova up a set and, after a few serves, up 5-3 in the second set, on the verge of victory. Bedan remained absorbed in his telephone.
''It's not like 20 years ago,'' he offered, without looking up. ''Everything is so fast now, you can't play serve and volley. It's impossible. Not even Federer can do it. It's necessary to play from the baseline. Everyone is working harder, the competition is stronger, with more girls on the same level. So this is just where the game is.''
Contrary to his prediction, Pliskova won easily.
I tried Bedan's explanation for the state of the women's game on Geoff Macdonald, who coaches women's tennis at Vanderbilt University. ''The challenge is that an all-around game -- learning not just to hit aggressive ground strokes but to serve and volley and have the whole package -- takes longer to develop, and lots of people on tour calculate that it doesn't pay to spend an extra three or four years grooming a player when she is already winning and maybe already being marketed by the tour.'' But he added, ''I'm sure someone will come along, the way Federer did on the men's side, who's faster, plays an all-around game, who knows how to play defensively and not just rip at every ball.''
Maybe she's out there now, some 10-year-old girl preparing to raise the women's game another notch and prove the skeptics wrong. Meanwhile there's Serena to carry the sport on her broad shoulders. Only Zvonareva stood between her and the Wimbledon title everyone had expected her to win from the beginning. Heavy ground strokes nipping the lines kept the Russian in the fight for a while. At 3-3 in the first set, the crowd cheering, it looked as if it might be a contest. Then Williams found another gear, moving inside the baseline to receive even Zvonareva's first serves, pushing the Russian onto her heels, wearing her down. Zvonareva played well. But she was totally outgunned.
''Come back!'' one fan called out.
''All is forgiven,'' joked another. Then someone yelled, ''Come on, Serena,'' and Bud Collins, in the seat next to mine, shook his head.
''Sadist,'' he said.
At the end, Williams never even faced a break point. Zvonareva thanked her surgeon during the postmatch ceremony. Williams teased King, watching from the stands, because with the victory she passed King's total of 12 Grand Slam singles titles.
People worrying about the game today will probably be the same ones, years from now, who boast about having seen Serena in her prime, along with Henin and Venus and Sharapova and Clijsters.
There's nothing like it, they'll say. Those were the days.

 BODY:
WHEN you get caught between the paparazzi and New York City, the best that you can do is fall in line. So it is that the remake of the 1981 Dudley Moore-Liza Minnelli-John Gielgud comedy ''Arthur,'' which is currently filming all over Manhattan and Queens, has uncomplainingly put up with premature overexposure.
Its star, the comedian-actor-writer Russell Brand, has already been photographed on one shooting day sprinting along the street in nothing but blue-and-purple briefs, and on another outfitted in a fully be-nippled 1997-style Batman costume. (This was for an opening scene involving misappropriation of the Batmobile that required approval from Warner Brothers, as well as the gentle sounding-out of the studio's current alpha filmmaker, Christopher Nolan.)
Helen Mirren, who is playing Gielgud's role, remarked: ''It's unbelievable. I'm just glad it's a comedy, because if I had to do dramatic acting with 30 cameras going off, it would be hopeless.'' And Greta Gerwig, the indie darling who plays Arthur's love interest, had to film her first, largely improvised scene in front of the 42nd Street exit of Grand Central Terminal in the thick of Monday-morning rush hour. 
It's a lot of scrutiny for a delicate confection -- a remake of a light farce about a constantly inebriated multimillionaire who doesn't want to sober up or grow up; Hobson, his acerbic butler-surrogate parent; and the working-class girl with whom he improbably falls in love. The first version of ''Arthur'' stands as an odd one-off in '80s-comedy history; it represented Moore's only moment as a true A-list star, and its writer-director, Steve Gordon, died of a heart attack in 1982 without ever directing a second film.
But if the fragile charms of ''Arthur,'' three decades later, feel hard to recapture, the team behind the remake, due for release next year, has come up with several shrewd twists, including changing Hobson's gender and profession (from butler to nanny) and retailoring the title role to suit the lanky renegade swagger of Mr. Brand -- who, unlike his predecessor, will never be called ''pixie-ish'' or ''elfin.'' Even so, certain elements remain the same: Arthur is still very rich and very drunk; and a lush, gilded version of New York City serves as his personal playpen.
To add to the degree of difficulty, the movie's creators are to some extent making it up as they go along. The ''Arthur'' script has gone through an unusual circular rewriting process: It was drafted by Peter Baynham, who won an Academy Award nomination for his work on the similarly rewritten-on-the-fly ''Borat.'' Mr. Baynham's script then went to another writer, Jared Stern, for a structural polish. Last year Jason Winer, a compact 37-year-old who served as the primary director for the first season of ABC's acclaimed ''Modern Family,'' signed on to make his feature directorial debut and rerouted the script to seven of his colleagues in the ''Modern Family'' writing room for a line-by-line dialogue tuneup.
But in a movie-business rarity the script was then returned to the hands of Mr. Baynham, who arrives on the set every day ready to rewrite. ''Whatever makes the film better,'' he said cheerfully, as he perched in a chair on 42nd Street one morning, scribbling new lines on the backs of script pages. ''You'd be crazy, as a writer, to have someone like Russell and not take the opportunity to revise and improve on the spot, given his improvisational skills.''
Mr. Baynham's seat is next to Mr. Winer's, and their collaboration is close and constant. ''I want input,'' said Mr. Winer, who earned an Emmy nomination for the ''Modern Family'' pilot. ''When you direct TV, everybody feels completely free to tell you what you should do differently, and I welcome that.''
Mr. Winer, who seems unflappable but looks like a production assistant, is so boyish that between takes Ms. Mirren came up to him and teasingly asked, ''Have you heard anyone say, 'He can't be the director'?'' His reply: ''In my head I hear it all the time, but I do carry a crew ID card just in case.''
On this day the cast and crew had assembled to shoot Arthur's first encounter with his dream woman (Ms. Gerwig). In 1981 the character was a brassy shoplifter; today, she scams out-of-towners by conducting nonsense-filled walking tours. Better-known actresses tested with Mr. Brand, but according to one of the producers, Kevin McCormick, Ms. Gerwig ''was the one who brought out a sweetness in him and also the one who could keep up with him.''
As Mr. Brand, bedecked in a Lincoln stovepipe hat, staggers up to her, kicking off each take with a different opening line, she quickly decides he's a street crazy and incorporates him into her patter, comparing him in successive takes to Dylan Thomas, Willy Wonka and a cast member of the musical ''Grand Hotel.''
Mr. Baynham, listening for what works and what doesn't, took notes, refining their riffs into new jokes for later takes, and Mr. Winer frequently sprung from his chair to talk to the actors, then returned to study the monitors. After several takes, he realized what wasn't working: There was no moment when Ms. Gerwig's character stopped to take Arthur in with a look. After some discussion about whether a line was required, Mr. Winer decided to address it with a change in Ms. Gerwig's blocking and body language.
All of this is more controlled than it sounds. ''It's unlike most other film experiences, where you don't change lines that much,'' Ms. Mirren said. ''But Russell isn't a wild cannon. He's actually very careful about all the technical requirements, continuity and marks and all that stuff. He has an incredible comedian's brain, but he pays attention to detail.''
The original ''Arthur'' -- the working title was ''The Richest Man in the World'' -- opened six months after the inauguration of President Ronald Reagan and the television premiere of ''Dynasty.'' The poster featured Moore hoisting a cocktail while lounging in a preposterously luxe bubble bath under the slogan ''Don't you wish you were Arthur?''
In many ways the film was the first true Reagan-era comedy, the harbinger of a more-is-more era in movie romance that stretched all the way to 1990's ''Pretty Woman.'' The pleasures of materialism were displayed as ostentatiously as possible, and the answer to choosing immense riches or true love was, ''I'll take both, please.''
The first film originally ended with Arthur giving up a nine-figure inheritance in exchange for wedded bliss. ''We tested it, and it was clear the audience would have had our heads,'' recalled Larry Brezner, that film's presenting producer. A new ending was quickly shot in which Arthur lived not only happily but also wealthily ever after.
''The idea,'' Mr. Brezner said, ''was: Give Arthur the money, bring up the music loud and get the audience the hell out of the theater happy, before they have time to think about it. The trick to an irrational ending is speed.''
''Arthur'' drew reviews that compared it approvingly to 1930s screwball comedies. It opened modestly but grew into a hit, ultimately winning two Oscars (for Gielgud and the treacly, inescapable theme song) and nominations for Moore and for Gordon's screenplay. But not everyone was a fan.
''I just didn't think a film about a drunken small guy was remotely funny,'' Ms. Mirren said. ''The reality about alcoholics is that they're boring and tedious, and I'd spent enough nights in pubs with drunken boys to know it was not something I'd ever want to be caught up in. And I particularly objected to the way women were depicted -- which was something I felt about most movies I saw back then -- as kind of slave-enablers.''
Mr. Winer shared some of Ms. Mirren's concerns. ''When I rewatched it, it was as delightful as I'd remembered, but the character never grows. At the end Arthur is just as drunk as he was at the beginning, and Liza Minnelli's character essentially steps into the role of caretaker.'' As he, Mr. Brand and Mr. Baynham began to explore how a new ''Arthur'' might unfold, they found themselves in agreement about what had to go.
''People's attitudes about wealth have changed, and attitudes about alcohol have changed enormously,'' said Mr. Brand, whose autobiography ''My Booky Wook'' constitutes a sort of William Burroughs version of the ''Arthur'' story (without the immense wealth and with infinitely more substance abuse and sex).
Mr. Brand became sober several years ago; these days the closest he comes to drinking is taking a sniff of the booze that an assistant keeps in the bottom of a water bottle; the smell helps him get into character for the scenes in which Arthur is drunk; i.e., all of them.
''It's a little bit Methody, to get the memory back into his body,'' Mr. Winer said. ''I think he feels that he needs to get close to it, and he's very, very careful about it.''
Mr. Brand also prepared for the part by watching W. C. Fields movies, James Stewart in ''The Philadelphia Story'' and Nicolas Cage in ''Leaving Las Vegas.'' And, of course, his predecessor.
''Dudley's performance was a brilliantly executed comedy drunk, and I have to be a lively, inventive drunk too,'' Mr. Brand said. ''But I'm also interested in playing him as a prince who thinks he has the whole world but who then falls in love and has to make a decision, because until now he's outsourced his responsibility for making adult choices to another human being.''
So the new ''Arthur'' will nod -- nonstridently, the filmmakers hope -- toward an unintoxicated future for its hero and also tweak its tone to suit a moment in which the moviegoing audience is disgusted rather than enthralled by the excesses of the overprivileged. (''Arthur, what do you say to people who criticize the way a rich man like you behaves in a recession?'' a journalist asks him in Scene 1. ''They have a fair point,'' replies Arthur. ''We must end this recession.'')
But everyone involved is wary of doing too much tampering with what is, after all, a fairy tale. ''Modernization is tricky,'' Mr. Baynham said. ''It's easy to get gimmicky. You don't want to fall into the trap of saying, 'Look, he's Arthur -- but with an iPhone.' ''

HEADLINE: Obama's Failure In Sudan

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
When President Obama was seeking the White House, he criticized Republicans for not doing enough on Darfur and insisted that he would make Sudan a priority.
''What we have done has not been enough,'' he told me in a 2006 interview when I was guest host for a ''Charlie Rose'' segment on Sudan. He added that Washington needed ''a sustained diplomatic effort to put pressure on Sudan.''
Yet these days, Mr. Obama is presiding over an incoherent, contradictory and apparently failing Sudan policy. There is a growing risk that Sudan will be the site of the world's bloodiest war in 2011, and perhaps a new round of genocide as well. This isn't America's fault, but neither are we using all of our leverage to avert it. 
Granted, Mr. Obama has a multitude of other priorities. Granted, Sudan is a mess with no perfect solutions. Nobody expects Mr. Obama to devote much time to Sudan. But the problem isn't that the administration is too busy to devise a policy toward Sudan but that it has a half-dozen policies, mostly at cross-purposes.
As first reported by Foreign Policy, competing recommendations on Sudan are on Mr. Obama's desk, reflecting dissent within the administration. One recommendation, from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Mr. Obama's envoy for Sudan, Maj. Gen. Scott Gration, apparently focuses on continued carrots and engagement. The other, calling for a tougher approach, comes from the American ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, who has by far the longest experience dealing with Sudan.
Some 68 organizations have sent a joint letter to Mr. Obama, calling on him to work more energetically to prevent another round of war in Sudan. But so far he has been unengaged, and his administration has been less successful than the last Bush administration in getting Sudan to alter its behavior.
The upshot: Sudan's on-and-off north-south civil war could resume soon. How bad could it be? Well, the last iteration of that war lasted about 20 years and killed some two million people. Mr. Obama's former head of national intelligence, Dennis Blair, warned this year that the place facing the greatest risk of genocide or mass killing is southern Sudan.
Regular readers know I was not a fan of President George W. Bush. But one of his signal accomplishments, against all odds, was a 2005 peace agreement that ended the last round of that war. That agreement provided for a referendum next January in which southern Sudan can choose secession.
Southern Sudanese are expected to vote overwhelmingly to secede. But the region has most of the nation's oil, and the north is determined not to lose the oil wells driving the nation's economy.
The Obama administration has tried a carrots-rather-than-sticks approach to Sudan, and it has been right to engage Khartoum. It restored the issuance of American visas in Sudan, and at first this engagement led to some successes. For example, some aid groups that had been expelled from Darfur were allowed to return in a different form. And for a time, Darfur became calmer.
But in recent months Sudan has been hardening its positions, perhaps because it sees that it pays no price for misbehavior (and also because it sees that there are limits to the rewards it will receive for improved behavior). Sudan has cracked down on dissidents and journalists, steamrolled over an election, and for the last few weeks has restricted humanitarian access to Kalma, a huge camp of Darfuris. It has also curbed the ability of United Nations peacekeepers to protect themselves or others.
Most ominously, Sudan's government has been stalling in preparations for the referendum in the south, and it may have been channeling weapons to disgruntled factions there. No one expects restraint from President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, who is facing charges of genocide from the International Criminal Court.
For all his faults, President Bush inherited a war in Sudan and managed to turn it into peace. Mr. Obama inherited a peace that could turn into the world's bloodiest war next year.
The Obama administration has just dispatched a talented former ambassador, Princeton Lyman, to lead a team on the ground in Sudan. That's useful, but Washington could do much more. It could support United Nations peacekeepers, and it could work at the highest level with China, Britain, Egypt and others to avoid a new war. A useful step would be to put Vice President Joseph Biden in charge for at least the next six months.
The United Nations General Assembly also needs to take up Sudan when it meets next month. That will be the last chance for high-level involvement before the referendum.
There are plenty of bogus reasons for criticizing Mr. Obama's foreign policy, but this is a legitimate one. And in a place like Sudan, American diplomatic malpractice could lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths.

HEADLINE: At the Lincoln Memorial, a Call for Religious Rebirth

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE and CARL HULSE; Raymond Hernandez contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- An enormous and impassioned crowd rallied at the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on Saturday, summoned by Glenn Beck, a conservative broadcaster who called for a religious rebirth in America at the site where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his famous ''I Have a Dream'' speech 47 years ago to the day.
''Something that is beyond man is happening,'' Mr. Beck said in opening the event as the crowd thronged near the memorial grounds. ''America today begins to turn back to God.''
It was part religious revival, part history lecture, as Mr. Beck invoked the founding fathers and the ''black-robed regiment'' of pastors of the Revolutionary War and spoke of American exceptionalism. 
The crowd was a mix of groups that have come together under the Tea Party umbrella. Some wore T-shirts from the Campaign for Liberty, the libertarian group that came out of the presidential campaign of Representative Ron Paul, while others wore the gear of their local Tea Party group, or of 9/12 groups, which were founded after a special broadcast Mr. Beck did in March 2009.
But the program was distinctly different from most Tea Party rallies. While Tea Party groups have said they want to focus on fiscal conservatism and not risk alienating people by talking about religion or social issues, the rally on Saturday was overtly religious, filled with gospel music and speeches that were more like sermons.
Mr. Beck imbued his remarks on Saturday and at events the night before with references to God and a need for a religious revival. ''For too long, this country has wandered in darkness,'' Mr. Beck said Saturday. ''This country has spent far too long worrying about scars and thinking about scars and concentrating on scars. Today, we are going to concentrate on the good things in America, the things that we have accomplished, and the things that we can do tomorrow.''
Mr. Beck was followed on stage by Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican vice-presidential candidate and former Alaska governor, who said she was asked, in keeping with the theme of the day, not to focus on politics but to speak as the mother of a soldier.
''Say what you want to say about me, but I raised a combat vet, and you can't take that away from me,'' said Ms. Palin, whose son Track served in Iraq.
But Ms. Palin did not steer entirely clear of politics. In a veiled reference to President Obama and his pledges to fundamentally transform America, she said, ''We must not fundamentally transform America as some would want; we must restore America and restore her honor.''
Many in the crowd said they had never been to a Tea Party rally, but they described themselves as avid Glenn Beck fans, and many said they had been motivated to come by faith.
Becky Benson, 56, traveled from Orlando, Fla., because, she said, ''we believe in Jesus Christ, and he is our savior.'' Jesus, she said, would not have agreed with what she called the redistribution of wealth in the form of the economic stimulus package, bank bailouts and welfare. ''You cannot sit and expect someone to hand out to you,'' she said. ''You don't spend your way out of debt.''
Mr. Beck's themes were ones he returns to on his radio and television shows, and people in the crowd echoed his ideas, saying that ''progressives'' were moving the country toward socialism and that the country must get back to a strict interpretation of the Constitution, which would limit the role of the federal government and do away with entitlement programs.
''The federal government is only to offer us protection from our enemies and help us when we need it,'' said Ron Sears, 65, who came on a caravan of three buses from Corbin, Ky. ''The states are supposed to control education and everything having to do with their citizens, except when they need federal help.''
Mr. Beck billed the event as the Woodstock of this generation, telling listeners that for decades, people would be asking, ''Were you there?''
He had instructed his fans to leave their protest signs at home and to bring their children.
While there were few signs, people carried American flags or yellow ''Don't Tread on Me'' banners, which have become mainstays at Tea Party rallies.
The event had the feeling of a large church picnic, with people sitting on lawn chairs and blankets with coolers and strollers.
Officials do not make crowd estimates because they are unreliable and can be controversial, but event organizers put the number of attendees at 500,000; NBC News said it was closer to 300,000, but by any measure it was a large turnout. The crowd stretched from the Lincoln Memorial to the Washington Monument.
The rally organized by Mr. Beck, a Fox News broadcaster who has been critical of Mr. Obama and Congressional Democrats, has come under attack as dishonoring the memory of Dr. King by staging the event on the anniversary of his speech. Critics have suggested that Mr. Beck was trying to energize conservatives for the midterm elections.
Across town, several hundred people packed a football field at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School to stage a rally commemorating Dr. King's ''I Have a Dream'' speech.
''We come here because the dream has not been achieved,'' said the Rev. Al Sharpton, an organizer of the rally. ''We've had a lot of progress. But we have a long way to go.''
''They want to disgrace this day,'' Mr. Sharpton told the crowd, referring to Mr. Beck's event.
While the crowd at Dunbar was mostly African-American, the audience at Mr. Beck's rally was overwhelmingly white, though a number of speakers and performers were black.
Among them was Alveda King, a niece of the civil rights leader, who in a speech said that if Dr. King were alive he would commend the organizers of the event and ''would encourage us to lay aside the vicious lies that cause us to think we are members of separate races.''
Mr. Beck made a surprise visit on Friday to a convention held by FreedomWorks, a Tea Party umbrella group, for Tea Party supporters. He received a thunderous welcome from a crowd of about 1,600 in Constitution Hall.
He told the crowd that he had begun planning his march on Washington a year ago, thinking ''it was supposed to be political.''
''And then I kind of feel like God dropped a giant sandbag on my head,'' he said.
''My role, as I see it, is to wake America up to the backsliding of principles and values and most of all of God,'' he said. ''We are a country of God. As I look at the problems in our country, quite honestly, I think the hot breath of destruction is breathing on our necks and to fix it politically is a figure that I don't see anywhere.''

HEADLINE: The Case for Reviving Revenue Sharing

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. SHILLER. 
Robert J. Shiller is professor of economics and finance at Yale and co-founder and chief economist of MacroMarkets LLC.

 BODY:
PROTRACTED unemployment is eating away at millions of people. And the economy's failure to create enough jobs for them is part of a vicious circle that could keep turning for years to come.
In my last column, I called for big, temporary government programs aimed directly at putting people back to work. But how might we best accomplish this? The clock is ticking, and we don't have time to create new national organizations to employ people. Instead, the most efficient approach is to use existing organizations for specific ideas and projects.
State and local governments as well as nonprofit and other organizations need to be mainstays in this effort. We need to enlist their help -- without telling them exactly what to do. As for a framework, think of the general revenue sharing program adopted by Congress in 1972. 
In his 1971 State of the Union message, President Richard M. Nixon advocated general revenue sharing to offset the tendency for power to be concentrated in Washington. Give local governments the money and ''put the power to spend it where the people are,'' he said.
Support for the idea was not confined to Republicans. A leading Democrat, Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, supported it in 1972, saying that federal taxes were more progressive than state and local ones and that federal money could be spent more effectively by people with local knowledge than by ''some agency head in Washington.''
General revenue sharing came under attack in the Reagan years, and Congress ended it in 1987, arguing that by breaking the link between taxation and local needs, it encouraged higher taxes.
We are in a different time now. State and local governments are in severe fiscal trouble, and their constitutions often prevent deficit spending. In these circumstances, the federal government, which does not face such constraints, needs to raise revenue for them.
Legislation providing the states with $26 billion, which President Obama signed into law this month, took an important step in this direction. It did not create true general revenue sharing, because it tied the funds to specific needs -- mostly hiring teachers and paying for Medicaid. But it did free states to use other resources as they saw fit.
It is time to bring back true general revenue sharing -- temporarily -- to stimulate the economy. Hundreds of articles in political science and public policy journals have studied past efforts, and analyzed the concept of fiscal federalism, without establishing general revenue sharing as a fundamental pillar of Keynesian stabilization policies. This lapse is understandable: most of these articles were written before the current economic crisis, the most serious since the Great Depression.
The need for a Keynesian revenue-sharing program is clear. After Congress approved stimulus legislation in 2009, Lawrence H. Summers, head of the National Economic Council, said that ''it's harder to spend $300 billion within a year on quality projects than you might think.'' And no wonder the task was tough: decision makers in Washington were removed from local needs.
Martin Shubik, a professor of mathematical institutional economics at Yale, has proposed creating a ''Federal Employment Reserve Authority,'' a permanent agency that would do extensive research and maintain a detailed list of ready-to-go public works projects should a recession come. That's a great idea, but we do not have such an agency now, and, if we did, it might still suffer from a Washington bias.
Now, local governments are laying off a wide variety of employees, including teachers, police officers and social workers. So why don't we embrace general revenue sharing? Unfortunately, when faced with a need for stimulus, members of Congress seem to prefer to start their own projects, for which they are likely to get more credit from voters. Local governments, meanwhile, which are more likely to know where spending is really needed, remain in deep trouble.
It's time for the public to assert loftier expectations. We need to respect existing government bureaus and organizations for their ideas, and get down to the business of financing important jobs temporarily, and on a huge scale. This will avert more layoffs, and perhaps give cities and states time to recover to the point they can pay local employees from local revenue.
When the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt began its vast job creation program in 1933, it had to accept certain practical realities, which limited the immediate stimulus that could be provided. Foremost among them was that the government had to work largely within the framework of existing organizations -- whether state and local governments, the military or nonprofit groups -- which provided much of the economy's infrastructure.
Economic stimulus is not a matter of turning on the money spigot, as some economists are wont to describe it. It is about getting the widespread cooperation of dispersed organizations to provide jobs, at least for as long as the economy is weak.
When the Roosevelt administration and Congress created the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1933, it was done within the framework of the Army. There seemed to be no other organization that could move hundreds of thousands of young men into wilderness encampments where they could work on conservation efforts. But the Roosevelt C.C.C. placed no more than a half-million people in jobs. We need to reach further than that.
Labor unions, which represent workers who naturally fear displacement by people in new jobs, might seem to be an obstacle. But unions do have an idealistic base, and working union members have sons and daughters and friends and relatives who are unemployed. The unions need to be consulted if new jobs are to be created in a relatively nonthreatening way. In a savvy move, President Roosevelt made a union leader the head of the C.C.C.
The concept of general revenue sharing can also be extended to the nation's nonprofits, including charities and foundations. The government has long given support to such organizations, but usually in the form of narrow grants. But broader general revenue grants could be made in times like these.
Millions of people need jobs, and there are organizations that could help put them to work. It's time to move forward.

HEADLINE: Winning, Losing And War

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
AS the last officially designated American combat forces left Iraq, television cameras caught the exultation of a soldier finally heading home.
''We won!'' he yelled. ''It's over! America, we brought democracy to Iraq!''
Which naturally raises an intriguing and provocative question: Did we win? Seven years later, after all the spilled blood, after all the roadside bombs and sectarian strife, after all the terror and torment, did the United States actually win the war in Iraq?
The soldier was right in that the United States deposed a dictator and brought democracy to Iraq -- a rudimentary, still-in-progress, somewhat dysfunctional democracy that has yet to seat a government nearly six months after an election, but a democracy nonetheless. And certainly it looks more like victory than it did just three years ago in the depths of the devastation before the American troop surge and the Sunni uprising against Al Qaeda in Iraq. 
But don't look for sailors kissing nurses in Times Square or ticker-tape parades in the streets of Washington. Don't look for President Obama or most other elected leaders to use terms like ''victory'' to describe what happened in Iraq. Whatever progress has been achieved has come at great sacrifice and seems fragile and incomplete at best. Rather than winning, Mr. Obama describes his goal as ''responsibly ending this war.''
''We neither won nor lost,'' said Lee H. Hamilton, the former Democratic congressman from Indiana who served as co-chairman of the Congressionally chartered Iraq Study Group that in 2006 recommended pulling nearly all American combat troops out by 2008. ''The best that can be said is that at enormous cost, we've given them a chance to establish a stable country.''
Making a final evaluation, of course, would be premature. Even after Tuesday, when Mr. Obama will declare the end of America's combat mission, there will still be nearly 50,000 troops to advise and assist the Iraqis and conduct counterterrorism operations before pulling out at the end of 2011. A string of attacks last week demonstrated that radicals can still do damage even if not as much as before.
Still, the American role in the war has been subsiding for some time, with soldiers based mainly outside the cities for the last year and encountering less and less direct combat as Iraqi forces take the lead. As of Friday, 46 members of the American military had died in Iraq in 2010, according to the Web site, icasualties.org, a fraction of the 904 who died at the peak in 2007.
The situation was so bad back then that even President George W. Bush acknowledged at one point that ''we're not winning, we're not losing.'' Senator Harry M. Reid of Nevada, the Democratic majority leader, went even further, declaring, ''this war is lost.''
By the time he left office, Mr. Bush's optimism had returned and he declared that Iraqi forces were increasingly capable of ''winning the fight.'' Today, Mr. Reid does not take back his assessment but credits the soldiers. ''Senator Reid believes our combat troops did a great job,'' said his spokesman, Jim Manley. ''However, he and many others believed in 2007, and still believe, that the ultimate outcome of this war will not be decided by U.S. combat troops. The future of Iraq will be decided by the Iraqi people.''
That is a common theme offered even by those on the other side of the ideological battles that marked the long slog in Iraq. Meghan O'Sullivan, who oversaw the war as Mr. Bush's deputy national security adviser, said it came down to the Iraqis. ''My standard of success for Iraq is not whether the Iraqis can resolve every last issue between themselves and their neighbors but whether they can continue to tackle and manage their differences through politics, not violence,'' she said.
James M. Dubik, a retired Army three-star general who led the training of Iraqi troops, said the keys now were building governance and economics. ''The waning of combat doesn't mean the war is over,'' said General Dubik, now a senior fellow at the Institute for the Study of War. ''Wars end, in my view, not when the conflict is done but when the right diplomatic, economic and security arrangements get put in place.''
And for those who have suffered deep loss, like the relatives of the 4,400 Americans or the many more Iraqis who died, the notion of victory or defeat can feel remote. ''Well, first of all, my family lost in a big way,'' said Cindy Sheehan, who became perhaps the nation's most prominent antiwar activist after her son died in Iraq. ''We had one of our cherished members, Casey, murdered by the U.S. empire in Iraq.''
In her view, ''the only winners have been Halliburton, KBR, CACI, Xe, Unocal, BP, Standard Oil, Boeing'' and other corporations that profited from the war. ''People here in the U.S. who don't know that they lost have lost big time,'' she said.
The debate underscores the changing nature of war. The United States claimed victory in most of the wars it has fought from the American Revolution through World War II. The Korean War essentially ended in a stalemate, with American-led troops repelling North Korean invaders but then being pushed back to the prewar border. Vietnam is widely seen as a defeat after Americans withdrew and the South fell to the North. The first Gulf War succeeded in pushing Iraq out of Kuwait.
But many Americans remain unsure about the current war in Iraq. In a CBS News poll last week, 57 percent of Americans said the war was going well, compared with 22 percent who thought so in July 2007. Among those who believe that now, 26 percent gave most credit to the Bush administration, which ordered the 2007 troop surge; 20 percent gave credit to the Obama administration, which has managed the drawdown of more than 90,000 troops; and 33 percent credited both.
Yet for all that, 59 percent said the United States did not do the right thing going to war in Iraq in the first place and 72 percent said the war was not worth the loss of life and other costs to the country, the highest percentage since the invasion in March 2003.
The larger geopolitical repercussions of the war are still playing out. It drained American credibility around the world, particularly after the intelligence on weapons of mass destruction proved false and after the abuse scandal at Abu Ghraib prison. The specter of an American war on Islam, no matter how much it is denied by Washington, looms large in parts of the world.
Many argue that Iran grew stronger as a result of the war, allowing it to extend its influence to Iraq, where the Shiites, not the Sunnis, now dominate political life. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who manages Iraq policy for Mr. Obama, disputed that last week in a speech to the Veterans of Foreign War, asserting that ''Iranian influence in Iraq is minimal'' and ''greatly exaggerated.''
And while violence is down, it is not gone. The difference is that the administration deems it below a threshold where it can be managed by the Iraqis without posing a threat to the Iraqi state.
''That is what victory looks like in this kind of war -- a long-term U.S. security relationship with a country that enjoys slowly improving host country governance while confronting a gradually decreasing level of violence,'' said Lt. Col. John Nagl, a retired officer who served in Anbar Province and is now president of the Center for a New American Security in Washington.
One of those who from the beginning saw clearly what would come in Iraq was Col. Alan Baldwin, the chief Marine intelligence officer in Iraq during the invasion. A few days before the war began, he sat down with a few reporters and, off the record, predicted that the American invasion would lead to what he called a ''rolling civil war.''
Today, retired from the Marines, he said sticking it out during the roughest moments and avoiding defeat prevented an even worse outcome. ''We've won by not losing and we continue to win by continuing to engage, continuing to support,'' he said. ''We lose in some ways, too, by not doing so perfectly. But we're still there.''
Looking back to his prediction seven years ago, he said: ''We opened a Pandora's box. Lots of bad things were flying out of there. But good things are there now too. It's amazing we had the patience to be where we are today.''

HEADLINE: Hey, Big Spender: Hollywood Isn't in the Mood

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES and MICHAEL CIEPLY

 BODY:
BURBANK, Calif.
JOEL SILVER stands on the Warner Brothers lot and points to the remnants of a house where he filmed parts of four ''Lethal Weapon'' movies. ''We blasted a toilet out of that window,'' he says, smiling proudly. ''Over there, we drove a car straight into the living room.''
Ah, the glory days.
Behind Mr. Silver, the flamboyant producer of some of the biggest action hits of the last 30 years, is the modest set for one of his current films, an R-rated comedy with no stars, almost no budget and -- for now -- no title. Not that Mr. Silver was ready to call the production small. ''It's a little movie, but it's a big little movie,'' he says. 
And therein lies Mr. Silver's challenge: How does a larger-than-life, free-spending producer fit into a movie business that has been tightening up -- and cutting some of its more grandiose characters down to size?
In the new Hollywood, stars count for less, whether in front of the camera or behind it. Financial firepower and technological wizardry matter more. And a generation of producers -- whose principal assets were their industry connections and a remarkable degree of personal force -- are having to adapt.
Mr. Silver, 58, has been a dominant studio moviemaker for over three decades, delivering blockbuster franchises like ''Lethal Weapon,''''Die Hard'' and ''The Matrix.'' The 59 movies he has produced have generated almost $10 billion in ticket sales, adjusting for inflation. The money he has made for Warner alone has won him lavish treatment from the studio -- not just in compensation, but also in perks. To make him happy, Warner once went so far as to send movie props to his Brentwood mansion for his son's birthday party.
Warner, at least in years past, has ignored Mr. Silver at its own peril. Six years ago, Jeff Robinov, then a top production executive at the studio, was hospitalized after a motorcycle accident. As he recovered, Mr. Robinov heard that Mr. Silver was exaggerating the severity of the accident -- and telling people that Mr. Robinov was unable to function.
When Mr. Robinov asked Mr. Silver why he was doing this, the producer said it was because the Warner executive hadn't been returning his calls promptly.
Despite such antics, producers like Mr. Silver used to be able to count on one studio or another to support them in near perpetuity. So what if they fell on hard times -- as Mr. Silver has, recently delivering a string of flops like ''Speed Racer'' (one of the biggest money-losers in Warner's 87-year history), ''Ninja Assassin,''''Whiteout'' and the aptly titled ''The Losers.''
Studios no longer take such losses lightly. Bleeding from plummeting DVD sales and higher marketing costs, they've started reducing producer deals. Warner alone has cut the number of producers it carries by 20 percent over the last two years and has said more reductions are on the way. The producers Warner now favors are mostly young and inexpensive or come with financial backing of their own from outsiders, like Legendary Pictures, which teamed up with Warner to make ''The Dark Knight.''
Warner has also been building up the production companies of directors and actors like Zack Snyder, Ben Affleck and Todd Phillips, all of whom now challenge Mr. Silver in a pecking order that changed when old images of Hollywood producers -- who survived by wit, will and the occasional outrageous moment -- began fading to black.
A particularly difficult point for both Warner and Mr. Silver is the cost of his production deals. In a frothier time, the lucrative arrangements struck by Mr. Silver allowed him to get a cut of the revenue from his films. That means he is entitled to about 8 cents of every dollar the studio takes in for his pictures, whether they are bombs or runaway hits.
Warner is also required to distribute films from Mr. Silver's production company Dark Castle, which self-finances horror and other low-budget movies with $240 million in private funding. In theory, the deal gives Warner films from an experienced producer without risking its own production money. In practice, the arrangement has sometimes backfired, as it did earlier this year with ''Splice,'' a thriller about a pair of scientists who use genetic manipulation to create a monstrous child.
Mr. Silver acquired rights to ''Splice'' at little cost. But Warner spent about $26 million to market the film, only to see it come up short, with just $17 million at the domestic box office.
Against backdrops like this, Hollywood studios are nudging entrenched producers away from prized but risky projects, if only to avoid paying them millions of dollars in participation fees while the studio loses money.
For instance, Mr. Silver was entrusted for years with developing ''Wonder Woman'' into a big-budget movie. Warner recently took the superheroine away from him, to exert more control and to allow other, less expensive producers to take a shot at it.
So even though Hollywood has always been the fabled land of comebacks and second acts -- and Mr. Silver recently found success with ''Sherlock Holmes'' -- the megaproducer also knows that his head may be perilously close to the chopping block. His deal with Warner, which provides for a staff of about 20, expires in December 2011; negotiations for a new contract haven't started.
Mr. Robinov, now president of Warner's motion picture division, declined to comment on whether the studio would renew Mr. Silver's deal or simply pressure him into a more restrictive contract.
''Joel is an incredible cinephile, who is incredibly intelligent and incredibly passionate about his job,'' says Mr. Robinov. ''That's a lot to bring to the party.''
For his part, Mr. Silver is playing the role of the stoic.
''Maybe I will continue with Warner and maybe I won't,'' he says over a dinner of goulash and brussels sprouts inside his trailer. ''I hope I do.''
Still, some of his powerful friends seem worried. At the very least, they are rallying around him.
''Warner's is very fortunate to have Joel Silver,'' said Ron Meyer, president of Universal Studios.
''Let's hope he doesn't take a bullet from anybody. He's a good guy,'' says Terry Semel, Warner's former chairman. ''Even home-run hitters have cold streaks. It's the nature of sports and it's the nature of movies.''
BRUCE BERMAN, the chief executive of Village Roadshow Pictures, who has known Mr. Silver since 1979 when they worked together on ''Xanadu,'' says no producer working in Hollywood better understands the pull of mass entertainment.
''That's incredibly valuable,'' he says. Even so, Mr. Berman allows that his pal ''is a 20th-century man in a 21st-century world.''
Mr. Silver, burly and bearded, has been parodied in several movies, most recently by Tom Cruise in ''Tropic Thunder,'' but he is far from the only megawatt producer under pressure or needing to figure out a new way forward.
Brian Grazer, who operates under a deal at Universal Pictures, stumbled in the spring with ''Robin Hood,'' which managed to squeeze about $310 million at the global box office but cost more than $200 million to make -- when including higher-than-normal start-up costs and excluding tax credits -- and more than $100 million to market.
Scott Rudin has one of the most buzzed-about movies of the fall in ''The Social Network,'' but Walt Disney Studios, where he is based, has made clear that its new strategy leaves little room for the kind of highbrow films in which he specializes.
Even Jerry Bruckheimer, producer of such fare as the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' series, is struggling to move beyond four high-profile disappointments in a row, including ''G-Force'' and ''The Sorcerer's Apprentice,'' both of which required Disney to take quarterly write-downs.
Mr. Silver's fortunes may be turning. Warner is bullish on his next movie, ''Unknown White Male,'' a Dark Castle thriller starring Liam Neeson that is scheduled for release in January. And Mr. Silver rightly points out that ''Sherlock Holmes'' was a smash hit that cost $80 million to make and sold more than $523 million of tickets globally. Mr. Silver is starting production on a sequel.
''Sherlock Holmes,'' however, comes with an asterisk on Mr. Silver's resume. The picture was already well under way when he came on board.
Warner and the longtime producer on the project, Lionel Wigram, wanted Robert Downey Jr. to play the lead role. Mr. Downey said yes -- but only if his wife, Susan Downey, helped produce it.
That created a pickle: Mrs. Downey worked for Mr. Silver, who told Warner that he would lend out his executive -- but only if he was brought on the project, too. Mr. Robinov said O.K., in part because of Mr. Silver's close relationship with Guy Ritchie, who directed the movie.
Mr. Downey says he owes the resuscitation of his career to Mr. Silver, who cast him in the 2005 thriller ''Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'' despite the actor's prison and drug record.
''Joel just kept telling me, 'We've got to get a gun in your hand,' '' Mr. Downey says. ''Joel is one of the few relationships I care to have with a producer. Look, he's vast and voracious, and he definitely has the ability to break into a scream about a point he would like to make. But he can also be incredibly warm and generous.''
Questions about money -- how to get it, how to spend it, how to pay it back -- have loomed unusually large in Mr. Silver's Hollywood life.
''Fantasies about spending are irresistible, the best!'' Mr. Silver was quoted as saying in the production notes for ''Brewster's Millions,'' a 1985 fable in which Richard Pryor was supposed to waste $30 million in 30 days in order to inherit a much larger fortune. ''Who wouldn't want to indulge the luxury of squandering millions and millions of dollars?''
In 1989, Mr. Silver used the Warner jet to fly a bevy of pals and business associates to party at Auldbrass Plantation, his South Carolina home designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. Hollywood, still in its boom years, saw such extravagance as part of his charm.
''I'm not in this business to make art; I'm in it to make money to buy art,'' ran a much-quoted Silver quip that the producer now regrets as a shade too glib. His art collection, however, includes a 20-ton sculpture by Richard Serra; it is kept on the grounds of Mr. Silver's Brentwood estate, Casa de la Plata (Spanish for ''House of Silver'').
Expensive taste -- he also owns a Malibu house and is chauffeured around Hollywood in a Maybach sedan -- has at times appeared to leave Mr. Silver pressed for funds.
Bertram H. Fields, the Hollywood uberlawyer who has long worked for Mr. Silver, says Mr. Silver has relied on a longstanding series of loans from Warner. He declined to describe the size of the loans but said that Mr. Silver had the ability to repay them.
Filings with the secretary of state of California show that Mr. Silver's debt is secured against his interest in various films, including, most recently, ''Splice.'' Mr. Fields says the financial relationship between Mr. Silver and Warner is comfortable.
''He's their prime supplier and they do lend him money,'' he says. ''It's kind of a running account between them.''
Mr. Silver, who on occasion rumbles through the courts with the same animal spirit he brings to the Warner lot, is now suing Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, and a pair of movie companies, Alliance Films and Momentum Pictures USA, for $35 million.
In a complaint filed in May, Mr. Silver contended that Goldman and the film companies had breached an obligation to pay him that sum for his interest in Dark Castle after he helped Goldman find financing for an acquisition of Alliance.
Lawyers for Goldman and the film companies filed a response opposing all of Mr. Silver's claims, calling some of them ''absurd.'' A Goldman spokeswoman and a law firm representing Goldman, Alliance and Momentum declined to comment.
EVEN brief chats with Mr. Silver are embroidered with a cineaste's knowledge. During a recent conversation in his Warner office, he recounted, beat for beat, Adolphe Menjou's long walk through a newsroom and virtually every aspect of a paper's daily life in a memorable scene from the 1931 version of ''The Front Page.''
Inevitably, the talk also turned to the costly trappings of the office, which was built for Frank Sinatra in 1963. It had fallen into disrepair, Mr. Silver explains, so he persuaded Warner to allow him to refurbish it.
Now, the office boasts accouterments like eel-skin furniture and exterior walls washed to look like William Randolph Hearst's castle at San Simeon. (An adjoining part of the complex was once used by Mr. Hearst's lover, Marion Davies.) Among the trophies on the inside are photographs of Mr. Sinatra in his rat-pack heyday and the head of a zebra that Mr. Silver is quick to note was bought, not stalked.
''I hunted that with a credit card,'' he says.
Mr. Silver grew up middle class in South Orange, N.J., the son of a public-relations-executive father and a journalist mother. (She wrote a food column for the New Jersey section of The New York Times.)
Mr. Silver had a number of passions during his New Jersey years -- one of them was Frisbee. In the fall of 1968, while in high school, he jokingly proposed adding a Frisbee game he had created with some friends to the school curriculum. After the game spread to local colleges, Ultimate Frisbee was born.
But, at heart, Mr. Silver was a movie lover first, taking in ''Lawrence of Arabia'' at a Times Square theater in Manhattan and obscure art films at the Museum of Modern Art.
Mr. Silver recalls watching film credits scroll by on television and looking up the names of crew members in the Los Angeles telephone book. ''That's how fascinated I was with movies,'' he recalls.
Mostly, however, he was drawn to the producers, men like David O. Selznick. ''I was fascinated with the lifestyle of these guys -- how they lived, how they ran the show,'' he says. ''These guys lived like Saudi princes.''
After arriving in Hollywood in the 1970s, Mr. Silver got his break from the producer Lawrence A. Gordon, who needed an assistant. Mr. Gordon eventually employed him as an executive at his company and later worked with him as a partner. Mr. Silver quickly absorbed Hollywood's rough-and-tumble ways. In 1991, he and Mr. Gordon parted ways and still do not speak to each other.
Mr. Silver now has over 25 films in active development, including a splashy adaptation of ''Logan's Run,'' a 1976 movie about a futuristic society in which humans are terminated when they turn 30. Another project involves the comic book character Sgt. Rock.
''The core of the movie business remains intact,'' says Mr. Silver. ''And it's not descending in scope. Studios want movies that are bigger than ever.''
PERHAPS, but studios also want small -- something that Mr. Silver is trying to address with Project X, that unnamed teenage comedy in production on the Warner back lot.
Wearing a pair of his limited-edition Bathing Apes sneakers, Mr. Silver monitors a rehearsal of a fight sequence in the film. An actress, Kirby Bliss Blanton, runs over to him and gives him a hug.
''I love you!'' she beams, before walking away.
Mr. Silver is startled by the hug, but it barely registers because he is too focused on other things, like a tricky scene coming up involving nudity.
''There aren't a lot of guys like me left,'' Mr. Silver says during a break. ''But I'm a war horse. I've been through it all. And you know something about war horses? Through the sleet, through the snow -- they just keep going.''

HEADLINE: Waiting For Mr. Obama

 BODY:
If President Obama has a big economic initiative up his sleeve, as he hinted recently, now would be a good time to let the rest of us in on it.
News on Friday confirmed that the economy was far weaker in the second quarter than originally believed, growing at 1.6 percent versus an initial reading of 2.4 percent. Grim reports on housing sales indicate that the slowdown has continued. In a normal recession, housing would lead the way up from the depths. Today, it appears to be leading the way back down.
Which brings us back to Mr. Obama. The fiscal stimulus of 2009, coupled with low interest rates and other Federal Reserve interventions, kept the recession from being much worse. But it has not been enough to revive hiring, without which a real recovery is impossible. In the meantime and even more ominously, economic policy making has all but ground to a halt. 
Congress is gridlocked. For nearly two months, Republicans blocked an extension of unemployment benefits, a basic recovery measure. They are still holding up a bill to spur more lending to small businesses.
In a much-anticipated speech on Friday, Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, reiterated his vow to do more to boost the economy if conditions worsened. He did not seem particularly convinced that anything the Fed could do would be enough.
The question then is whether Mr. Obama will lead. He cannot force Congress to act, but he could pre-empt Republicans' diatribes -- on the deficit, on small business, on taxes -- with tough truths and a big mission that would tie together the strategies and the sacrifices that will be needed to put the economy right.
First, he needs to keep driving home that he is committed to addressing the deficit, and that he will call for widespread sacrifice to do so -- starting with letting the Bush tax cuts for the richest Americans expire at year end. Mr. Obama must tell Americans that claims from Republican leaders that the country can both cut taxes and tackle the deficit are absurd and cynical.
Next, he needs to explain why too much sacrifice, too soon, especially from the middle class, would do more harm than good while the economy is weak. More government support is needed until conditions improve.
Mr. Obama also needs to inspire Americans who have been ground down by the economic crisis and Washington's small-bore sniping. He needs to rally the nation around a big idea -- a project that is worth sacrificing for, worth paying for, worth working for. One that lets them know that there is more ahead than just a return to a status quo of lopsided growth in which corporate profits surge while jobs and incomes lag.
That mission could be the ''21st century infrastructure,'' that Mr. Obama mentioned on a multi-city trip this month, ''not just roads and bridges, but faster Internet access and high-speed rail.'' It could be energy independence, with high-tech green jobs and a real chance for addressing global warming. Either of the above would make sense, economically and politically.
Mr. Obama and his economic team had clearly hoped for an economic rebound in time for the midterm elections. They are not going to get it. The economic damage they inherited was too deep, and the economic stimulus they pushed through Congress, for all of the fight, was too small. Standing back is not doing the country or his party any good. We believe Americans are ready for hard truths and big ideas.

HEADLINE: The Billionaires Bankrolling the Tea Party

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
ANOTHER weekend, another grass-roots demonstration starring Real Americans who are mad as hell and want to take back their country from you-know-who. Last Sunday the site was Lower Manhattan, where they jeered the ''ground zero mosque.'' This weekend, the scene shifted to Washington, where the avatars of oppressed white Tea Party America, Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin, were slated to ''reclaim the civil rights movement'' (Beck's words) on the same spot where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. had his dream exactly 47 years earlier.
Vive la revolution!
There's just one element missing from these snapshots of America's ostensibly spontaneous and leaderless populist uprising: the sugar daddies who are bankrolling it, and have been doing so since well before the ''death panel'' warm-up acts of last summer. Three heavy hitters rule. You've heard of one of them, Rupert Murdoch. The other two, the brothers David and Charles Koch, are even richer, with a combined wealth exceeded only by that of Bill Gates and Warren Buffett among Americans. But even those carrying the Kochs' banner may not know who these brothers are. 
Their self-interested and at times radical agendas, like Murdoch's, go well beyond, and sometimes counter to, the interests of those who serve as spear carriers in the political pageants hawked on Fox News. The country will be in for quite a ride should these potentates gain power, and given the recession-battered electorate's unchecked anger and the Obama White House's unfocused political strategy, they might.
All three tycoons are the latest incarnation of what the historian Kim Phillips-Fein labeled ''Invisible Hands'' in her prescient 2009 book of that title: those corporate players who have financed the far right ever since the du Pont brothers spawned the American Liberty League in 1934 to bring down F.D.R. You can draw a straight line from the Liberty League's crusade against the New Deal ''socialism'' of Social Security, the Securities and Exchange Commission and child labor laws to the John Birch Society-Barry Goldwater assault on J.F.K. and Medicare to the Koch-Murdoch-backed juggernaut against our ''socialist'' president.
Only the fat cats change -- not their methods and not their pet bugaboos (taxes, corporate regulation, organized labor, and government ''handouts'' to the poor, unemployed, ill and elderly). Even the sources of their fortunes remain fairly constant. Koch Industries began with oil in the 1930s and now also spews an array of industrial products, from Dixie cups to Lycra, not unlike DuPont's portfolio of paint and plastics. Sometimes the biological DNA persists as well. The Koch brothers' father, Fred, was among the select group chosen to serve on the Birch Society's top governing body. In a recorded 1963 speech that survives in a University of Michigan archive, he can be heard warning of ''a takeover'' of America in which Communists would ''infiltrate the highest offices of government in the U.S. until the president is a Communist, unknown to the rest of us.'' That rant could be delivered as is at any Tea Party rally today.
Last week the Kochs were shoved unwillingly into the spotlight by the most comprehensive journalistic portrait of them yet, written by Jane Mayer of The New Yorker. Her article caused a stir among those in Manhattan's liberal elite who didn't know that David Koch, widely celebrated for his cultural philanthropy, is not merely another rich conservative Republican but the founder of the Americans for Prosperity Foundation, which, as Mayer writes with some understatement, ''has worked closely with the Tea Party since the movement's inception.'' To New Yorkers who associate the David H. Koch Theater at Lincoln Center with the New York City Ballet, it's startling to learn that the Texas branch of that foundation's political arm, known simply as Americans for Prosperity, gave its Blogger of the Year Award to an activist who had called President Obama ''cokehead in chief.''
The other major sponsor of the Tea Party movement is Dick Armey's FreedomWorks, which, like Americans for Prosperity, is promoting events in Washington this weekend. Under its original name, Citizens for a Sound Economy, FreedomWorks received $12 million of its own from Koch family foundations. Using tax records, Mayer found that Koch-controlled foundations gave out $196 million from 1998 to 2008, much of it to conservative causes and institutions. That figure doesn't include $50 million in Koch Industries lobbying and $4.8 million in campaign contributions by its political action committee, putting it first among energy company peers like Exxon Mobil and Chevron. Since tax law permits anonymous personal donations to nonprofit political groups, these figures may understate the case. The Kochs surely match the in-kind donations the Tea Party receives in free promotion 24/7 from Murdoch's Fox News, where both Beck and Palin are on the payroll.
The New Yorker article stirred up the right, too. Some of Mayer's blogging detractors unwittingly upheld the premise of her article (titled ''Covert Operations'') by conceding that they have been Koch grantees. None of them found any factual errors in her 10,000 words. Many of them tried to change the subject to George Soros, the billionaire backer of liberal causes. But Soros is a publicity hound who is transparent about where he shovels his money. And like many liberals -- selflessly or foolishly, depending on your point of view -- he supports causes that are unrelated to his business interests and that, if anything, raise his taxes.
This is hardly true of the Kochs. When David Koch ran to the right of Reagan as vice president on the 1980 Libertarian ticket (it polled 1 percent), his campaign called for the abolition not just of Social Security, federal regulatory agencies and welfare but also of the F.B.I., the C.I.A., and public schools -- in other words, any government enterprise that would either inhibit his business profits or increase his taxes. He hasn't changed. As Mayer details, Koch-supported lobbyists, foundations and political operatives are at the center of climate-science denial -- a cause that forestalls threats to Koch Industries' vast fossil fuel business. While Koch foundations donate to cancer hospitals like Memorial Sloan-Kettering in New York, Koch Industries has been lobbying to stop the Environmental Protection Agency from classifying another product important to its bottom line, formaldehyde, as a ''known carcinogen'' in humans (which it is).
Tea Partiers may share the Kochs' detestation of taxes, big government and Obama. But there's a difference between mainstream conservatism and a fringe agenda that tilts completely toward big business, whether on Wall Street or in the Gulf of Mexico, while dismantling fundamental government safety nets designed to protect the unemployed, public health, workplace safety and the subsistence of the elderly.
Yet inexorably the Koch agenda is morphing into the G.O.P. agenda, as articulated by current Republican members of Congress, including the putative next speaker of the House, John Boehner, and Tea Party Senate candidates like Rand Paul, Sharron Angle, and the new kid on the block, Alaska's anti-Medicaid, anti-unemployment insurance Palin protege, Joe Miller. Their program opposes a federal deficit, but has no objection to running up trillions in red ink in tax cuts to corporations and the superrich; apologizes to corporate malefactors like BP and derides money put in escrow for oil spill victims as a ''slush fund''; opposes the extension of unemployment benefits; and calls for a freeze on federal regulations in an era when abuses in the oil, financial, mining, pharmaceutical and even egg industries (among others) have been outrageous.
The Koch brothers must be laughing all the way to the bank knowing that working Americans are aiding and abetting their selfish interests. And surely Murdoch is snickering at those protesting the ''ground zero mosque.'' Last week on ''Fox and Friends,'' the Bush administration flacks Dan Senor and Dana Perino attacked a supposedly terrorism-tainted Saudi prince whose foundation might contribute to the Islamic center. But as ''The Daily Show'' keeps pointing out, these Fox bloviators never acknowledge that the evil prince they're bashing, Walid bin Talal, is not only the biggest non-Murdoch shareholder in Fox News's parent company (he owns 7 percent of News Corporation) and the recipient of Murdoch mammoth investments in Saudi Arabia but also the subject of lionization elsewhere on Fox.
No less a Murdoch factotum than Neil Cavuto slobbered over bin Talal in a Fox Business Channel interview as recently as January, with nary a question about his supposed terrorist ties. Instead, bin Talal praised Obama's stance on terrorism and even endorsed the Democrats' goal of universal health insurance. Do any of the Fox-watching protestors at the ''ground zero mosque'' know that Fox's profits are flowing to a Obama-sympathizing Saudi billionaire in bed with Murdoch? As Jon Stewart summed it up, the protestors who want ''to cut off funding to the 'terror mosque' '' are aiding that funding by watching Fox and enhancing bin Talal's News Corp. holdings.
When wolves of Murdoch's ingenuity and the Kochs' stealth have been at the door of our democracy in the past, Democrats have fought back fiercely. Franklin Roosevelt's triumphant 1936 re-election campaign pummeled the Liberty League as a Republican ally eager to ''squeeze the worker dry in his old age and cast him like an orange rind into the refuse pail.'' When John Kennedy's patriotism was assailed by Birchers calling for impeachment, he gave a major speech denouncing their ''crusades of suspicion.''
And Obama? So far, sadly, this question answers itself.

HEADLINE: The Height of Unfairness

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ. 
John Schwartz is the national legal correspondent for The New York Times and the author of ''Short: Walking Tall When You're Not Tall at All,'' a book about height for young readers.

 BODY:
GOV. MITCH DANIELS of Indiana is enjoying a moment on the lists of presidential hopefuls in the Republican field of dreamers.
No, he's not showing up prominently in the polls. But his stolidly conservative principles and raging popularity at home have garnered attention from some pundits on the right. He graced the cover of The Weekly Standard in June, illustrated with him riding his I-do-too-have-a-wild-streak Harley. The Economist published a largely admiring profile this month that called him a ''likable wonk'' -- high praise from the likably wonky publication.
Mr. Daniels says he is not actually seeking the job (though if people really beg him, you know ...). Still, there is one quality that might keep him from ever taking that four-year lease on 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue: his height. 
Mr. Daniels is officially listed as 5-foot-7.
What kind of superficial knucklehead, you might ask, would base the solemn vote for president on such a meaningless factor as height?
The American voter, perhaps. More often than not, presidential contests go to the taller candidate. George H. W. Bush towered over Michael Dukakis, and Bill Clinton trounced Bob Dole.
Jay Mathews, a Washington Post journalist, has explored the phenomenon for more than 20 years in playful essays about what, in 2008, he called, ''a bone-deep bias that has poisoned our presidential politics and rendered our media's campaign analysis largely irrelevant.'' In only 4 of the last 20 presidential contests, he noted in that 2008 article, has the shorter candidate won. So now it's 21.
The age of television has only made the issue more stark: the moment that the two candidates stand side by side for the debates, the difference is there for all the world to see.
This isn't an ironclad rule. After all, Jimmy Carter beat Gerald Ford, and George W. Bush did beat John Kerry. (Let's not get into 2000, but let me simply say that Al Gore is the taller man.)
In an interview, Mr. Mathews said that voter prejudice was not surprising, since as a species we start small and grow up, and as children, we literally look up to our parents. ''If we were a species that got smaller as it matured, like moths,'' he said, ''we might respect small size.''
Now, it's not that the governor is all that short -- he's in no danger of being turned away from amusement park rides. But his size has been noted. That lovely profile in The Economist? It called attention to his height not once but twice -- referring to him at the top of the article as ''this small man.'' The Washington Post columnist Steven Pearlstein referred to Mr. Daniels as ''Indiana's diminutive governor.''
Ouch and double ouch! If he upgrades that dull wardrobe, you can bet that commentators will call him ''dapper,'' a term too often applied to small men. We hate that.
Did I say ''we''? Sorry. ''Experts say.''
A spokeswoman for Governor Daniels, Jane Jankowski, declined to comment on the question, noting that her boss is not a candidate and adding, ''I am not an expert on presidential height, presidential weight, presidential hair color or any other physical attribute.''
Could Mr. Daniels overcome the height disadvantage? Even turn it into a plus? Consultants suggest their dark arts could make it happen.
Mark McKinnon, the media strategist who twice helped George W. Bush win the presidency, said that voters might have soured on President Obama by 2012 -- might be ''tired of a president known for his confidence, lofty oratory, urbane repose, hip fashion, full head of hair and substantial elevation.''
Enter the opposite, he said: ''They'll be looking for someone like Mitch Daniels who is self-deprecating, blunt, nerdy, wooden, dresses like a county commissioner, balding and pint-sized.''
Mr. McKinnon even has a slogan at the ready: ''Less Is More With Mitch.''
Robert Shrum, a Democratic political consultant, said that he did not see Mr. Daniels's height as an impediment. Americans have been known, after all, to break with tradition now and then. ''You could have written an article before 2008 saying no African-American has ever been elected president,'' he said
Besides, he said, referring to Mr. Daniels's distinguished resume: ''Being budget director to George. W. Bush is a bigger obstacle. The height of the budget deficit is a bigger issue than the height of the man.''
There's always the wild card of Republican politics, he said. ''If the Tea Party is as effective in changing the Republican Party'' as it is showing itself to be, ''it could go to Palin,'' he said.
A spokesman for Sarah Palin did not respond to a request for the former governor's height.

HEADLINE: An Island Perch With Postcard Views

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE ROSENBLUM. 
E-mail: habitats@nytimes.com

 BODY:
VINICIUS and Lorena Fortuna, a 20-something couple from Brazil, arrived in New York in 2006 with the brightest of expectations, professionally and personally.
On the job front, both found satisfying niches. Mr. Fortuna works for Google as a senior software engineer. Ms. Fortuna, a civil engineer, is employed by a consulting firm that is helping to renovate the 107-year-old Williamsburg Bridge.
But finding a place to live in a big and sometimes unforgiving city proved daunting. Knowing little about New York and having few friends to whom they could turn for guidance, the Fortunas ended up in a prewar building on the Upper West Side in a studio that had been reconfigured as a cramped one-bedroom apartment.
''It was also a fourth-floor walk-up,'' Ms. Fortuna recalled. ''But the worst thing was that the building turned out to be infested with bedbugs. I'd see them crawling on the mailboxes when I walked in the front door.'' 
The fridge was so old that when the light burned out, replacement bulbs were no longer available. Trucks barreling down Columbus Avenue jolted the Fortunas awake at 5 in the morning. Occasionally they looked at other apartments, but with little success.
''We didn't know anyone in the city who could give us advice,'' Ms. Fortuna said. ''And that made it hard.''
One day the following summer, the couple took the tram to Roosevelt Island, just to admire the view. They barely set foot on the island; they turned right around and went back to Manhattan. But the casual outing introduced them to a corner of the city that would ultimately offer an apartment and a community in which they would feel utterly at home. After their lease on the Upper West Side ran out, Roosevelt Island was their next stop.
The couple's first toehold there was an apartment in a newish high-rise. It was also a 10-minute walk from the island's lone subway stop. Finding the bus service erratic, they traveled to and from the subway by bike, but that proved less fun as winter approached and even worse when it rained. Still, they savored the pace and friendliness of island life.
They especially relished the walkway that runs along the island's western rim, a popular route along which strollers and bench sitters could admire the Manhattan skyline while perched beside the water.
''You see the same people day after day,'' Ms. Fortuna said. ''They say hi. You say hello. It felt really good. We didn't know many people in New York. But thanks partly to this street, we got to know people here.''
Two years after they settled on the island and now both 29, they lucked out further when a two-bedroom condominium became available in Riverwalk Court, a brand-new high-rise just steps from the subway. The condo's owner had been buffeted by the recession, and even before he moved in, decided to sublet the apartment and live somewhere cheaper elsewhere on the island.
The Fortunas, who arrived last February and pay $3,100 a month, are the apartment's first residents. Everything was so new, they could smell the varnish on the hardwood floors. The chalk-white walls were so pristine, the couple were at first reluctant to hang pictures.
Although modest in size, the apartment radiates traces of the glamour associated with those pieds-a-terre familiar from 1940s movies set in the more luxurious precincts of Manhattan -- ''all windows and filled with light,'' as a friend described the place.
In the living room, floor-to-ceiling windows open onto views of the East River, the 59th Street Bridge, the Manhattan skyline and the seemingly endless expanse of Queens. Barges drifting along the river offer an endlessly shifting vista. Even the hulking power plant over in Astoria appears picturesque. Looking down, the couple can see the grassy field where Mr. Fortuna plays soccer and softball on weekends.
The views are nearly as dazzling in the bedroom, where the bridge seems so close, you feel as if you could reach out and touch one of its girders. Especially for a woman whose workdays focus on the rehabilitation of one of the city's famous bridges, these vistas seem singularly appropriate.
The furnishings, among them the spare black dining table, the gray and white sofa in the living room and the multicolored pillows heaped on the sofa bed in the second bedroom, came largely by way of Ikea. The store was also the source of an urban scene almost as compelling as the one out their windows -- a copy of Angelo Cavalli's famous black-and-white photograph of the Flatiron Building framed by a dense swath of the city.
The Fortunas themselves are avid photographers, and their walls are filled with images of the two of them, eyes shining and glossy dark hair gleaming, against one or another exotic backdrop. Here is Ms. Fortuna on the beach in Rio. Here are the two of them kissing near the Eiffel Tower. Here they are kissing again in the Turks and Caicos Islands.
The contents of their bookshelves seem an amalgam of their varied interests, home to her engineering texts (''Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics''), his computer books (''Web Data Mining''), a few titles in Portuguese and textbooks that have over the years helped the couple perfect their English (''The Ins and Outs of Prepositions'').
Unless you peered behind closed doors to see the two walk-in closets or the washer/dryer, you might miss what for Ms. Fortuna are among the apartment's main attractions. But you would never miss the couple's two beloved cats, strays born on the island and rescued by a group called Island Cats.
The Fortunas found Daisy, now 3, who is gray with white feet, through an ad in The Main Street Wire, the island newspaper, where ''there was a big picture of her,'' Ms. Fortuna recalled. Fletcher, now a lively brown 1-year-old, joined the household as a foster cat and proved so adorable the couple couldn't bear to give him to another family.
Just as the waterfront promenade helped the Fortunas sink roots in this community, so did the rescue group. When the couple first arrived, Ms. Fortuna used to look out the window of their apartment and see the clusters of people who helped feed and otherwise care for the island's strays. She and her husband signed up as volunteers and in doing so acquired an instant set of new and compatible friends.
''Really,'' Mr. Fortuna said, ''these friends are one of the reasons we stay on the island.''
More recently, the couple celebrated another landmark that has helped them feel deeply connected to the community.
''Two months ago they put our building on Google Earth,'' Mr. Fortuna, the computer whiz, said proudly. ''That made us feel wonderful.''

HEADLINE: Dorothy Herman

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Ms. Herman, who is known as Dottie, is the president and chief executive of Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate, a residential brokerage firm with more than 60 offices in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island.
She acquired Douglas Elliman for nearly $72 million in 2003 with her business partner, Howard M. Lorber of Nathan's Famous.
Q How's business? 
A Business is good. We probably have done triple the amount of business we did last year, which was a pretty tough year. But I think if we looked at the last 5 or 10 years in New York City, we're pretty much at an average as far as inventory goes.
Q Are some neighborhoods faring better than others?
A I don't think there are any areas that are better than others. We are in a price-sensitive market, so if you have a good price, anywhere in New York is good.
Q What are buyers looking for?
A People want ''done.'' Apartments that are done up and are priced well go a lot faster than those that need work. And they also want buildings with gyms, if that's possible. I think that larger apartments are in demand. More and more people stay in the city with families, which is a good sign. So if you have a good product that is priced well and done nicely, there will be a bidding war.
Q That's good news for sellers.
A I wouldn't want to say we're in a sellers' market, but people feel we've hit bottom. We're getting close to where it's pretty neutral.
If you're first entering the market, it's probably the most wonderful opportunity -- you have good prices and great interest rates. If you're trading up, it's also a good time -- you're going to get a little less than you would at the peak, but you'll buy that trade-up for less. And if you're moving out of state, especially to Florida, Las Vegas or California, their prices are so much more depressed. We should kiss the ground that we walk on in New York, because we got bruised but we didn't get killed.
Q Douglas Elliman continued to expand despite the market.
A We just opened a new office in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and we're looking to open something in Jersey. We are already working with Roseland Property and the Carlyle Group on the Hudson Club Project and Fireman Capital Partners for the Residences at Liberty National. And we are in discussions with a major home builder on a new development project in New Jersey.
Q And you're revamping the Douglas Elliman Web site.
A We have the beta now, but by the week after Labor Day, it will be up and running. You'll be able to ask questions, and we'll make suggestions based on your selected preferences. It's like the shopping sites that say, ''if you like this shirt you might like this.''
When you're on the Web site, it saves all your searches, and if there are any price changes you'll know. You can get e-mail alerts if you choose to get them. And you'll have every listing from Manhattan and hopefully all the rentals, including our competition's listings.
Q Almost like a multiple listing service. Do you think the city would benefit by having one?
A There are pros and cons. I've worked with both situations.
Q How did you get your start in real estate?
A I worked for Merrill Lynch in the '80s when they were selling real estate -- under a man named David Komansky, who went on to become the chairman. Their largest entity then was Rodeo Realty in California, and I spent a couple of weeks there learning about the high-end market -- and open houses. I remember saying to them: ''An open house? Nobody would ever come.'' I also learned a lot about the mortgage business. I founded my company from what I learned from them.
Q Do you recall your first deal?
A It was an air-traffic controller who bought a house on Long Island. And at the time, the controllers were on strike and interest rates were almost 19 percent, so no one was really getting mortgages. You had to be creative.
Q Your mom died in a car accident when you were 10. How has that affected who you are today?
A I was the oldest and I had to grow up pretty quickly on my own in many ways, so I took a lot of chances. Even though this is going to sound kind of crazy, whenever I did anything it was never because of the money -- I did it to grow and because I had a vision. And I had a lot of really great mentors to help.
When I bought Prudential Long Island Realty, and I had to borrow $9 million, it actually wasn't that scary, and I'll tell you why: because I didn't have it to pay back.

HEADLINE: A Singular Place With Plural Ethnicities

BYLINE: By GREGORY BEYER

 BODY:
ONE might as well begin by considering a single street corner in the east-central Queens neighborhood of Jamaica Hills: 164th Street, near 85th Avenue.
Three storefronts stand shoulder to shoulder: a modest grocery, whose sign declares Indian-Pakistani-American roots, selling Indian DVDs, two for $5, and asking 75 cents for a microwave-warmed vegetable samosa; Annam Brahma, a new Indian vegetarian restaurant with the motto ''Food Is God,'' one of several businesses with exteriors painted a light blue to signal devotion to Sri Chinmoy, the late Bangladeshi spiritual teacher who made his home in the area; and St. Gerasimos Greek Orthodox Church.
That stretch goes some way toward capturing a neighborhood whose residents cite harmonious diversity as a defining element. ''It's getting more and more diverse as time goes by,'' said Peter Voutsinas, a 30-year-old residential contractor born and raised in the neighborhood, which has about 11,000 people. ''It's not putting up any barriers.''
Deborah Ayala, a lifelong resident and the president of the Jamaica Hills Community Association, described it as ''a great melting pot in a very small area.'' 
A visitor is likely to see many people wearing brilliantly colored saris, perhaps bought at Divine Robe Supreme, a little shop on Parsons Boulevard. Customers browsed there on a recent afternoon amid the smell of incense and the rattle of a sewing machine in the back corner.
Adarini Inkei, a former longtime resident, was visiting from her home in Geneva. She was chatting with Deepmala Thomas, a young woman wearing an ivory sari.
''You can come here and have a free cup of chai,'' Ms. Inkei said. ''Where else can you get that?''
The area's Muslim community was the chief draw for Imam Shamsi Ali, the director of the Jamaica Muslim Center.
As a new arrival in 2005, he rented, later paying $690,000 for a three-bedroom house on 85th Avenue, where he lives with his wife and five children.
''I think for me, as a Muslim New Yorker, what's most attractive is that it's easy for me to access my basic needs,'' he said, emphasizing the importance of a Muslim community in which to raise his children, not to mention shop for halal food.
In recent weeks, as the city and the nation have debated the merits of building an Islamic center and mosque known as Park51 two blocks from ground zero in Lower Manhattan, Imam Ali has been interviewed by news outlets.
He supports Park51's construction at that site, arguing that it would be ''a blow to the extremists.''
The imam, who is 43 and originally from Indonesia, counts Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis and African-Americans among his Muslim congregation of over 2,000. His center, founded in 1976, for years operated out of a basement but is now housed at a large minaretted building on 168th Street.
Marie Adam-Ovide, district manager of Community Board 8, said a 2006 city rezoning stopped a pattern of frequent demolition of single-family homes to make way for multifamilies. Ms. Ayala described the rezoning, and its preservation of the neighborhood's character, as a victory.
Ms. Adam-Ovide said she sometimes heard complaints about college students who rent in the neighborhood -- St. John's University is to the north -- but added, ''Of course the students are on their own, and they're young, and they don't keep up the property.''
Mr. Voutsinas, for one, said he was glad to have the students in the mix. His family owns two houses: one, on 151st Street, that they share with renters, and another, on 84th Drive, that they rent out to students.
WHAT YOU'LL FIND
Also sometimes called Jamaica Hill -- singular -- this area of less than a square mile is bounded to the north by the Grand Central Parkway, to the east by Home Lawn Street, to the south by Hillside Avenue, and to the west by Parsons Boulevard.
As the name suggests, the terrain gently rolls upward from Hillside Avenue. The Georgian Revival-style Jamaica High School, declared a landmark in 2009, looms high over an adjacent oasis, Captain Tilly Park.
As one ascends the hill northward, the crowdedness and traffic fade and the area becomes quiet and residential, its streets lined with parked cars. It is a neighborhood of mostly single-family homes, along with a number of large multifamilies housing both renters and extended families.
Hillside Avenue, the neighborhood's southern border, is a wide commercial thoroughfare lined with small restaurants, shops and the occasional hotel.
On that avenue, near 164th Street, is Singh's West Indian and American Grocery, a vast shop whose title does little justice to its offerings. They extend to Indian musical instruments, tropical fish, traditional Indian clothing and an abundance of cricket equipment.
Jag Singh and his wife, Kumarie, have owned the shop for 15 years, though when asked how business had been lately, Mr. Singh, who wore cargo shorts, a white T-shirt and a thin gold necklace, answered, ''No good, no good, no good.''
Two months ago, after several failed attempts to get a loan that might jump-start business, Ms. Singh hung a ''For Rent'' sign in the front window. Given the current economy, she said, not many people are in the market for a $400 harmonium.
As she sat behind the cash register browsing the daily papers, Mr. Singh paced the floor; their young son bounced a tennis ball off the wall and then chased after it among the piles of goods.
WHAT YOU'LL PAY
Single-family homes average about $460,000 to $500,000, depending on condition and number of bedrooms, brokers say. Two-family homes tend to get $575,000 to $600,000.
A two-bedroom rental in Jamaica Hills typically goes for about $1,450 a month, depending on amenities and location.
One homeowner who regularly rents to college students said the going rate for one bedroom in a house was $600 to $700.
Ms. Ayala, the community association president, lives with her husband, brother and three young children in the house where she grew up, a four-bedroom two-bath duplex on 168th Place.
Her parents bought the house in 1979 for $65,000, she said, estimating that it would sell in the $400,000 range today.
Mary Pasquarelli, a broker for Century 21 American Homes, said many of her clients were immigrants just recently arrived in America.
''A lot of people, culturally, like to stick together,'' she said. ''There are a lot of houses of worship nearby. And it's quite affordable as far as Queens is concerned.''
Ms. Pasquarelli said Jamaica Hills houses averaged two to three months on the market, which she said was largely the same as last year. Prices, too, have remained static.
THE SCHOOLS
Elementary schools in the general area include Public School 131 Abigail Adams, on 172nd Street, for prekindergarten through Grade 5. Last year 45.9 percent of fourth graders met standards in English and 71.8 in math, versus 45.6 and 58.4 citywide.
In addition to other secondary schools, there is the Queens Gateway to Health Sciences School, on Goethals Avenue, starting at Grade 7 and continuing through Grade 12. A city quality review last year found that ''the school is a safe and nurturing environment that students see as a 'large family' in which everyone looks out for the well-being of their neighbors.''
Last year 94.4 percent of eighth graders met standards in English and 85.6 in math, versus 37.5 and 46.3 citywide.
At Jamaica High School, on Gothic Drive, SAT averages for 2009 were 403 in reading, 412 in math and 407 in writing, versus 406, 416 and 401 citywide.
WHAT TO DO
Several businesses along Parsons Boulevard are inspired by the teachings of Sri Chinmoy. Among them is the vegetarian Panorama Cafe, near 85th Avenue. Serving specialty coffees, sandwiches and brunch, it also hosts music and poetry events.
St. John's University, just outside the area, has several Division I sports teams whose games and matches are open to the public. Traditions pub on 164th Street is a destination for college students and residents alike.
The nearest branch of the Queens Library is just beyond neighborhood borders, on Merrick Boulevard between 89th and 90th Avenues.
THE COMMUTE
Jamaica Hills is served by the F train, which stops at Parsons Boulevard and 169th Street along Hillside Avenue. The ride to Midtown takes about half an hour. Buses serving the neighborhood include Nos. 43 and 68, along Hillside Avenue. Buses also run north-south along both Parsons Boulevard and 164th Street, carrying passengers into downtown Jamaica.
THE HISTORY
The Tillys, once a prominent family in the area, owned the land that has become Captain Tilly Park, a nine-acre patch of hilly greenery that includes a body of water known as Goose Pond.
The park's namesake is George H. Tilly, who was killed in 1899 in the Philippines, during a mission to repair a damaged telegraph cable.

HEADLINE: Down to Its Last Million

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
''TOTAL build-out'' sounds as if it could be the title of a science fiction film. In fact it is a forecast of reality for New Jersey, which according to a new report is down to its last million acres of developable land, and may run out by midcentury.
The report issued this month, by geospatial analysts at Rowan and Rutgers Universities, concludes that the state had its ''two most sprawling decades in history'' between 1986 and 2007, when the housing boom abruptly halted. Called ''Changing Landscapes in the Garden State,'' it analyzes data from fly-over photos taken periodically by the state Department of Environmental Protection -- the most recent batch dating to three years ago. 
Visuals accompanying the report allow pinpointing of any locale to see how the landscape changed over time (http://gis.rowan.edu/projects/luc/index.html).
''Perhaps it is beneficial, in some ways, that the report is just coming out now in the midst of a severe building lull,'' said James W. Hughes, dean of the school of planning and urban policy at Rutgers in New Brunswick (which did not oversee the study). ''There is a little time for policymakers to think, and planners to plan carefully, in the context of what we are learning about the immediate past.''
Tim Evans, research director for the public planning group New Jersey Future, based in Trenton, said Gov. Christopher J. Christie's recently announced Office of Planning Advocacy could ''probably make effective use'' of the new data.
The study shows the haphazard yet persistent way in which -- despite a statewide government emphasis on ''smart growth'' -- residential development swallowed up various sorts of open space: unprotected forest; farmland; and wetland areas.
It shows that as of three years ago, New Jersey had a greater percentage of developed land than forest land.
Between 2002 and 2007, an average of 16,061 acres of raw land was developed each year, according to the report, written by John E. Hasse, from Rowan's geospatial research lab in Glassboro, and Richard G. Lathrop, director of the Rutgers center for remote sensing and spatial analysis.
New Jersey Future's researchers added that this amounted to about 44 acres per day, and that it set a development pace that had accelerated by 7 percent since a previous study by the universities of the period from 1995 to 2002.
About two-thirds of the open land developed from 2002 to 2007 became ''low-density, large-lot'' residential units, the study said -- in other words, ''McMansions'' set on an acre or more. That same land wound up housing fewer than a quarter of the total residents who moved into units built on newly developed land in that period.
Mr. Hughes lives in East Amwell, in Hunterdon County, a rural community with a minimum 10-acre lot size. ''That was established some years ago during the push to preserve farmland,'' he said.
But building houses on such large lots is not ''preservation'' of open space, Mr. Hasse said in a separate telephone interview. ''It is the opposite.''
In terms of land use, he and other specialists including builders said that land could be described as developed, restricted from development or ''open space,'' and that there were no in-betweens.
Using information from the new report, and two previous reports from the universities, Mr. Evans of New Jersey Future said Gloucester County (the site of Rowan University) was the area with by far the fastest-growing development footprint in recent years. The quantity of developed acres increased by 11.6 percent there from 2002 to 2007, he said. Atlantic County was in second place, with a 9.2 percent increase over the same period.
The five most urban counties -- Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Passaic and Union, all in northern New Jersey -- had small increases in total amount of developed land, Mr. Evans said, ''because, obviously, there's very little left to develop.''
Hudson is the most heavily built-up county, at 94.6 percent developed, while Union, Essex and Bergen each have more than 75 percent of land developed. Passaic is 40.2 percent developed, which Mr. Evans said was because the northern part of the county was relatively far away from New York City, in the Highlands area and west of Interstate 287.
The state's Highlands Preservation Act protects a total of 800,000 acres of watershed area running across seven counties.
Statewide from 2002 to 2007, the percentage of developed land increased at nearly twice the pace that population increased, according to the ''Changing Landscapes'' report. The authors described that pattern as fitting a classic description of ''urban sprawl'': development growth that significantly exceeds population growth.
The study found that 0.76 acres of land was developed for every person added to the state's population.

HEADLINE: Planned Parenthood Clinics Are Stripped of Affiliation After Complaints

BYLINE: By KATHARINE MIESZKOWSKI. 
kmieszkowski@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
A financial and administrative meltdown in recent years has led to the end of one of the largest Planned Parenthood affiliates in the United States.
Patients visiting Planned Parenthood's eight clinics in San Francisco and four other Bay Area counties often encountered wait times exceeding two-and-a-half hours. Shortages of critical supplies, including intrauterine devices, meant some patients were turned away.
Doctors, nurses, midwives and physician's assistants complained to the national organization about low morale and a hostile work environment at Planned Parenthood Golden Gate, the local affiliate that owned and operated the clinics.
''P.P.G.G. is experiencing major system issues that are affecting the access and quality of patient care that we provide,'' warned a 2008 letter from 30 doctors and clinicians detailing these problems to Bay Area administrators and senior officials at Planned Parenthood Federation of America in New York. 
On Sept. 3, Planned Parenthood Federation of America will take the rare step of stripping a local organization of its affiliate status, citing financial and administrative problems. The national organization sent a letter in July saying that the affiliate's conduct might jeopardize patient care and Planned Parenthood's trademark, said Therese Wilson, the Bay Area affiliate's interim chief executive. Ms. Wilson denied the accusations.
The national organization would not comment on the reasons for disaffiliation.
By the end of this week, there will not be not a single Planned Parenthood clinic in San Francisco, San Mateo, Marin, Sonoma and Alameda Counties.
The care of some 50,000 patients, more than 90 percent of whom live at or below poverty level, is at risk, health care providers in the area say.
Planned Parenthood Golden Gate said it planned to continue to offer the same services in the same facilities, under the name Golden Gate Community Health. Yet tax filings show that the nonprofit lost $2.8 million during the 2008-9 tax year, at the same time its chief executive's total compensation exceeded $340,000. The organization has not broken even since the 2005-6 tax year, records show.
Patients depend on the Planned Parenthood clinics for birth control, cervical-cancer screening, testing for sexually transmitted diseases and abortions.
''If their services were to be diminished or not be there, clearly that is going to have consequences,'' said Dr. Juan Vargas, an obstetrician and geneticist at Benioff Children's Hospital. ''There would be a void that would be very difficult to fill.''
The national federation has assigned Planned Parenthood Golden Gate's five Bay Area counties to neighboring Planned Parenthood affiliates, which are racing to get new clinics up and running.
Interviews with current and former staff members and executives of Planned Parenthood Golden Gate, as well as documents obtained by The Bay Citizen, show a health organization that was unraveling under the strain of financial distress, even as it portrayed itself as a robust institution that attracted high-profile supporters.
Planned Parenthood Golden Gate's leaders said the organization was undermined by a poor economy and lack of support from the national organization.
''It's my opinion that the disaffiliation was unnecessary,'' Dian Harrison, the longtime chief executive of Planned Parenthood Golden Gate, wrote in an e-mail interview.
Ms. Harrison has not led the organization since January 2010, when she went on leave for reasons that she declined to specify.
More than 100 local affiliates pay dues to Planned Parenthood Federation of America, which operates an (800) number and a Web site connecting patients to the clinics in their area. Affiliates use the Planned Parenthood name, as well as the organization's medical standards, guidelines and educational materials; they get discounts on supplies, like contraceptives, and support with fund-raising.
Planned Parenthood Golden Gate was formed in 1996, when three Planned Parenthood affiliates merged. Ms. Harrison led the organization from its inception. The affiliate won performance awards from the national organization in 2003 and 2005. Gloria Steinem appeared at a fund-raiser in 2007, as did Donna Brazile, the Democratic political strategist, in 2008.
One report distributed by the organization included an animated cartoon starring Ms. Harrison, who transforms into a ''Superhero for Choice'' armed with a condom-shooting popgun that scatters anti-abortion protesters.
Ms. Harrison won the admiration of wealthy donors and board members, who praised her as an innovative leader whose vision for social justice extended far beyond the Bay Area, even leading her to forge a partnership in Ethiopia to try to improve reproductive health care there.
Yet many staff members saw Ms. Harrison and her team as out of touch with their daily realities, creating a dysfunctional corporate culture. Some former employees still hold occasional get-togethers dubbed the ''P.P.G.G. P.T.S.D. Support Group.''
Financially, Planned Parenthood Golden Gate did not measure up to its public profile. According to a 2007 internal report by the national organization, its finances were the worst among the top 10 largest affiliates in the country. Planned Parenthood Golden Gate failed to meet four out of nine indicators of financial health that year, the report said. Some of those benchmarks -- like maintaining 60 days of cash on hand -- had not been met for years.
Over the next two fiscal years, the affiliate's revenues from contributions and grants fell 45 percent, to $2.3 million from $4.2 million. The growing internal crisis affected services, according to medical personnel.
''There were days when patients would come to see if they were pregnant and we couldn't tell them because we had no pregnancy tests in stock,'' said a doctor who no longer works for the affiliate.
In her e-mail interview, Ms. Harrison attributed the financial distress to the ''downturn in the economy and a dramatic decrease in fund-raising.''
Yet, some aspects of the organization's poor financial condition remain unclear. Other Bay Area affiliates have weathered the recession. Planned Parenthood Shasta-Diablo, based in Concord, for example, has seen its revenues increase.
This year, Planned Parenthood Golden Gate tried unsuccessfully to interest other Bay Area affiliates in buying some of its clinic buildings or merging, said Ms. Wilson, the interim C.E.O.
In the wake of Planned Parenthood Golden Gate's crisis, some of its health services have already been reduced. In June 2010, its Redwood City clinic closed, and abortion services at some other clinics have been significantly cut back.
Ms. Harrison argues that Planned Parenthood Federation of America violated its ''own standards of affiliation'' by taking ''premature action'' to sever its ties. Ms. Wilson wrote in an e-mail that the affiliate had spent the ''past six months trying to resolve our differences'' with the national organization.
''There has never been any evidence that P.P.G.G.'s conduct jeopardizes patient care,'' Ms. Wilson wrote in an e-mail.
Karen Ruffatto, vice president of affiliate services for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a statement that the accreditation process was confidential. The organization ''has clear guidelines regarding accreditation issues,'' Ms. Ruffatto said, ''and the decision to reassign the San Francisco service area followed these guidelines.''
Bay Area health care providers hope Planned Parenthood Golden Gate's patients will still be able to find the care they need.
''There are real consequences to gaps in care,'' said Dr. Eleanor Drey, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, San Francisco. ''I really hope that it's possible for these women to keep getting services consistently.''

HEADLINE: Rethinking Adjustable Rates

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
Adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs, got a bad name in the recent credit crisis, as underqualified borrowers lured by years of low fixed-interest payments fell behind when interest rates rose.
But if you took out a five-year ARM, which has a fixed rate for the first five years, in mid-2005, that risk would have paid off. Compared with a 30-year conventional loan at the prevailing rate of 5.64 percent, a loan of $417,000 would have saved you roughly $10,080 in mortgage payments by now, assuming a five-year ARM rate of 4.99 percent, said Michele Raab-Francis, chief executive of Safe Harbor Capital, a mortgage broker in Bellport, N.Y.
With mortgage rates and many financial indexes low, and the economy showing no signs of a quick recovery, current ARM borrowers face an interesting choice. If they keep their loans, they may well have lower payments in the next year than those who have fixed-rate loans. 
After the initial period, most ARMs are adjusted annually, at rates typically tied to one of three indexes: the one-year Constant Maturity Treasury Index; the Cost of Funds Index, known as the Cofi; or the London Interbank Offer Rate, known as the Libor. Borrowers whose ARMs are linked to the Treasury Index, for instance, would face one year of payments at a roughly 3 percent interest rate, according to Keith Gumbinger, a vice president of HSH Associates, a financial industry publisher and consulting firm. The Treasury rate may remain low since it generally rises when the economy strengthens.
Another option is refinancing to a fixed-rate loan while rates are at historic lows. Ms. Francis says this is especially popular with borrowers who have ARMs adjusted according to other indexes or have terms that allow for sharper interest rate spikes. But the cost of refinancing may be steep, especially in New York, where borrowers must pay a mortgage recording tax.
Ms. Francis suggested one other choice: converting the terms of an ARM with a current lender.
That is more feasible for borrowers who took out loans from regional banks and depositories instead of larger lenders like Citibank. Depositories tend to keep the mortgages on their books instead of selling them to investors.
Ms. Francis says these institutions will sometimes convert an ARM into a fixed-rate loan for a flat fee amounting to much less than the closing costs of refinancing. ''It's definitely worth it to at least call your lender in that circumstance,'' she said.
For borrowers who want a jumbo loan -- $729,750 or more in the greater New York area -- an ARM may make more sense than a fixed-rate loan, she said.
Borrowers with excellent credit who need a $2 million loan, for example, can qualify for a 3/3 ARM, in which the rate resets every third year, at roughly 3.125 percent. That saves the borrower around $100,377 over three years, and when the loan adjusts in the fourth year, the rate can increase to no more than 5.5 percent -- the same as the prevailing fixed rate jumbo loan today.
Some ARM borrowers hoping to refinance to a fixed-rate loan may be rejected if their homes are found to have lost too much value. But Anthony Hsieh, chief executive of LoanDepot.com, an online lender, said they might qualify for new loans.
For instance, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac administer the federal government's Home Affordable Finance program, in which borrowers whose mortgages exceed their homes' value by as much as 25 percent may still qualify for a new loan. To qualify, a borrower's current loan must be owned by either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. (You can find out if that is the case at fanniemae.com/loanlookup, or freddiemac.com/mymortgage.)
Borrowers must also be current on their loan payments, and the new loan must be deemed to put the borrower in a more financially stable situation than the old mortgage. Partly for that reason, borrowers whose mortgages exceed the value of their homes by more than 5 percent cannot refinance to an ARM.

HEADLINE: A Wartime Chief's Steep Learning Curve

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama rushed to the Oval Office when word arrived one night that militants with Al Qaeda in Yemen had been located and that the military wanted to support an attack by Yemeni forces. After a quick discussion, his counterterrorism adviser, John O. Brennan, told him the window to strike was closing.
''I've got two minutes here,'' Mr. Brennan said.
''O.K.,'' the president said. ''Go with this.'' 
While Mr. Obama took three sometimes maddening months to decide to send more forces to Afghanistan, other decisions as commander in chief have come with dizzying speed, far less study and little public attention.
He is the first president in four decades with a shooting war already raging the day he took office -- two, in fact, plus subsidiaries -- and his education as a commander in chief with no experience in uniform has been a steep learning curve. He has learned how to salute. He has surfed the Internet at night to look into the toll on troops. He has faced young soldiers maimed after carrying out his orders. And he is trying to manage a tense relationship with the military.
Along the way, he has confronted some of the biggest choices a president can make, often deferring to military advisers yet trying to shape the decisions with his own judgments -- too much at times for the Pentagon, too little in the view of his liberal base. His evolution from antiwar candidate to leader of the world's most powerful military will reach a milestone on Tuesday when he delivers an Oval Office address to formally end the combat mission in Iraq while defending his troop buildup in Afghanistan.
A year and a half into his presidency, Mr. Obama appears to be a reluctant warrior. Even as he draws down troops in Iraq, he has been abundantly willing to use force to advance national interests, tripling forces in Afghanistan, authorizing secret operations in Yemen and Somalia, and escalating drone strikes in Pakistan. But advisers said he did not see himself as a war president in the way his predecessor did. His speech on Tuesday is notable because he talks in public about the wars only sporadically, determined not to let them define his presidency.
Where George W. Bush saw the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan as his central mission and opportunities to transform critical regions, Mr. Obama sees them as ''problems that need managing,'' as one adviser put it, while he pursues his mission of transforming America. The result, according to interviews with three dozen administration officials, military leaders and national security experts, is an uneasy balance between a president wary of endless commitment and a military worried he is not fully invested in the cause.
''He's got a very full plate of very big issues, and I think he does not want to create the impression that he's so preoccupied with these two wars that he's not addressing the domestic issues that are uppermost in people's minds,'' Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said in an interview. Mr. Obama, though, has devoted enormous time and thought to finding the right approaches, Mr. Gates added. ''From the first, he's been decisive and he's been willing to make big decisions,'' he said.
Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat who sometimes advises Mr. Obama, said the president was grappling with harsh reality. ''He came into office with a very sound strategic vision,'' Mr. Reed said, ''and what has happened in the intervening months is, as with every president, he is beginning to understand how difficult it is to translate a strategic vision into operational reality.''
A former adviser to the president, who like others insisted on anonymity in order to discuss the situation candidly, said that Mr. Obama's relationship with the military was ''troubled'' and that he ''doesn't have a handle on it.'' The relationship will be further tested by year's end when Mr. Obama evaluates his Afghanistan strategy in advance of his July deadline to begin pulling out. As one administration official put it, ''His commander in chief role is about to get tested again, and in a very dramatic way.''
Beyond the Vietnam Debate
Mr. Obama was an 11-year-old in Hawaii when the last American combat troops left Vietnam, too young to have participated in the polarizing clashes of the era or to have faced the choices the last two presidents did about serving. ''He's really the first generation of recent presidents who didn't live through that,'' said David Axelrod, his senior adviser. ''The whole debate on Vietnam, that was not part of his life experience.''
Running for president of a country at war, he had plenty to learn, even basics like military ceremonies and titles. His campaign recruited retired generals to advise him. But it still took time to adjust when he became president. The first time he walked into a room of generals, an aide recalled, he was surprised when they stood. ''Come on, guys, you don't have to do that,'' he said, according to the aide.
Perhaps his most important tutor has been Mr. Gates, the defense secretary appointed by Mr. Bush and the first kept on by a president of another party. They are an unlikely pair, a 49-year-old Harvard-trained lawyer turned community activist and a 66-year-old veteran of cold war spy intrigues and Republican administrations. But they are both known for unassuming discipline, and they bonded through weekly meetings and shared challenges.
Mr. Obama has relied on Mr. Gates as his ambassador to the military and deferred to him repeatedly. When Mr. Gates wanted to force out Gen. David D. McKiernan in May 2009 as commander in Afghanistan in favor of Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, Mr. Obama signed off. Likewise, cognizant of Bill Clinton's ill-fated effort to end the ban on gay and lesbian soldiers, Mr. Obama let Mr. Gates set a slow pace in overturning the ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy, even though it has disappointed gay rights advocates.
Even on his signature campaign promise to pull out of Iraq, Mr. Obama compromised in the early days of his tenure to accommodate military concerns. Instead of the 16-month withdrawal of combat forces he promised, he accepted a 19-month timetable, and he agreed to leave behind 50,000 for now rather than a smaller force.
But as he grows in the job, Mr. Obama has shown more willingness to set aside Mr. Gates's advice. When General McChrystal got in trouble in June for comments by him and his staff in Rolling Stone magazine, Mr. Gates favored reprimanding the commander. Mr. Obama decided instead to oust him and replace him with Gen. David H. Petraeus, who led the troop increase in Iraq.
''My first reaction was if McChrystal with his experience and his contacts and his knowledge were pulled out, that could have real consequence for the war,'' Mr. Gates said. ''It never even occurred to me -- I kicked myself subsequently -- to move Petraeus over there. When the president raised that with me in a private meeting, it was like a light bulb went on -- yes, that will work.''
Just as keeping Mr. Gates provided political cover against the weak-on-defense Democratic image, Mr. Obama surrounded himself with uniformed officers. He kept Mr. Bush's war coordinator, Lt. Gen. Douglas E. Lute, and tapped Gen. James L. Jones as national security adviser. ''Picking General Jones was in part inoculation,'' said Bruce O. Riedel, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who led Mr. Obama's first Afghanistan review.
But they were not always in control. General Jones has often been eclipsed by younger foreign policy advisers with closer relationships with the president. Mr. Obama ended up pushing out Adm. Dennis C. Blair as director of national intelligence, and approved the Afghan troop increase despite the warnings of Lt. Gen. Karl W. Eikenberry, his ambassador to Kabul.
Although General McChrystal was described in Rolling Stone as calling Mr. Obama intimidated in meeting with military commanders early in his tenure, other attendees disagreed. ''He didn't look to me like he was one bit intimidated,'' Mr. Riedel said. ''He did look like someone who was taking it all in and a bit frustrated that what seemed for him to be simple questions he was getting complicated answers to -- like how many troops do you really need?''
Wars as a Distraction
With the economy in tatters and health care on his agenda, Mr. Obama was determined to keep the wars from becoming a major distraction. When he held a videoconference on Iraq on his first full day in office, officials recalled, he said: ''Guys, before you start, there's one thing I want to say to you and that is I do not want to screw this up.''
But while he had given much thought to ending the war in Iraq, he had not spent as much time contemplating Afghanistan despite a campaign promise to send more troops. When he took office, he found an urgent request to reinforce the flagging effort. Warned by the generals that he could not wait to study the issue, he overruled Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and sent 21,000 more troops. ''Both he and I frankly thought at that point we were done,'' Mr. Gates recalled. Within months, though, General McChrystal asked for 40,000 more troops. ''I certainly was surprised when General McChrystal came in with the request,'' he said, ''and I think the president was as well.''
Reliant on Mr. Gates, Mr. Obama has made limited efforts to know his service chiefs or top commanders, and has visited the Pentagon only once, not counting a Sept. 11 commemoration. He ended Mr. Bush's practice of weekly videoconferences with commanders, preferring to work through the chain of command and wary, aides said, of being drawn into managing the wars.
So General McChrystal's request for even more reinforcements exposed the mutual mistrust, particularly after it was leaked to the news media. The president complained he was being boxed in while the military worried whether politics would drive the decision. At one point Denis R. McDonough, deputy national security adviser, pressed Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, about stopping leaks by the military, according to people informed about the conversation. Admiral Mullen asked pointedly if that would also apply to the White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, who was skeptical of the troop increase request.
''If I had been in the White House, I would have been suspicious,'' Mr. Gates said. ''The leak of McChrystal's assessment was obviously very damaging in the assessment process because it put the president on the spot.'' He added: ''My position was this is not a deliberate attempt to jam the president. It's indiscipline.''
Last December, the president gave the military 30,000 more troops, but also a ticking clock. He would start pulling troops out in July, on the grounds that if there was not visible progress by then, it would mean the strategy was not working. Some saw that as a sop to his antiwar base. Others considered it his way of reasserting control over a military that knows how to outmaneuver the White House.
''He didn't understand or grasp the military culture,'' said Lawrence J. Korb, a former Pentagon official at the liberal Center for American Progress. ''He got over that particular quandary and put them back in the box by saying, 'O.K., I'm giving you 18 months.' ''
One adviser at the time said Mr. Obama calculated that an open-ended commitment would undermine the rest of his agenda. ''Our Afghan policy was focused as much as anything on domestic politics,'' the adviser said. ''He would not risk losing the moderate to centrist Democrats in the middle of health insurance reform and he viewed that legislation as the make-or-break legislation for his administration.''
White House officials reject the linkage, but said Mr. Obama believed that the wars should be judged against other priorities. Preparing to announce his decision last December, he read Dwight D. Eisenhower's farewell address and included a line in his own speech at West Point: ''Each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration: the need to maintain balance in and among national programs.''
Hungry for Information
Mr. Obama has made a point of seeking his own information, scribbling questions in memo margins and scouring the Internet. At one meeting, he surprised the generals by citing a study of post-traumatic stress disorder among soldiers serving repeat tours.
''He reads a lot,'' said General Jones, the national security adviser. ''He studies issues before he comes to the table. That's another thing the military mind, if there is such a thing, appreciates. When he sits down to talk about an issue, he's done his homework.''
Facing relentless and elusive foes, Mr. Obama has turned increasingly to the sort of strikes he authorized in Yemen and the drones in Pakistan, a form of warfare with little risk to American lives even though critics question its wisdom, effectiveness or even morality.
But Mr. Obama also confronts the consequences of the direct combat he has ordered. Last year, he flew to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to greet soldiers' coffins. During a later meeting with advisers, Mr. Obama expressed irritation at doubters of his commitment. ''If I didn't think this was something worth doing,'' he said, ''one trip to Dover would be enough to cause me to bring every soldier home. O.K.?''
In March, during his only trip to Afghanistan in office, he met a wounded soldier, maybe 19, who had lost three limbs. ''I go into a place like this, I go to Walter Reed -- it's just hard for me to think of anything to say,'' an emotional Mr. Obama told advisers as he left.
The moment stuck with him. Three months later, after ousting General McChrystal, Mr. Obama marched into the Situation Room and cited the teenage triple amputee as he reprimanded advisers for the infighting that had led to the general's forced resignation. ''We have a lot of kids on the ground acting like adults and we have a lot of adults in this room acting like kids,'' he lectured.
The schisms among his team, though, are born in part out of uncertainty about his true commitment. His reticence to talk much publicly about the wars may owe to the political costs of alienating his base as well as the demands of other issues. Senior Pentagon and military officials said they understood that he presided over a troubled economy, but noted that he was not losing 30 American soldiers a month on Wall Street.
The sensitivities about calling attention to the unpopular war in Afghanistan, and particularly America's problematic partner, played out when President Hamid Karzai visited last May. General McChrystal and Ambassador Eikenberry wanted to take Mr. Karzai to Fort Campbell in Kentucky to honor troops leaving for Afghanistan, but the White House objected that it sent the wrong message, as if Americans were fighting for Mr. Karzai. They compromised by having Mr. Gates go as well, but without his Washington press corps.
''From an image point of view, he doesn't seem to embrace it, almost like you have to drag him into doing it,'' said Peter D. Feaver, a Bush adviser with military contacts. ''There's deep uncertainty and perhaps doubt in the military about his commitment to see the wars through to a successful conclusion.''
Much of the public too is confused about the president's Afghan strategy, as White House aides and their critics acknowledge. ''There have only been a few moments when he's tried to focus the nation's attention on Afghanistan because, quite frankly, it's competing with the other priorities,'' said Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, who opposes the strategy. ''It's probably one of the reasons public support has fallen, because they see the costs but they don't know his thinking about it.''
If the flap over General McChrystal underscored the tensions, Mr. Obama's response may have actually helped ease them. ''Ironically enough, the McChrystal firing helped a lot because Obama handled it exactly the way most senior military officers would have handled it if they had been in his shoes,'' said Stephen Biddle, a critic of Mr. Obama's withdrawal deadline at the Council on Foreign Relations.
Perhaps more important was his selection of General Petraeus to take over. The choice brings Mr. Obama full circle. As a senator, he opposed the Iraq troop increase led by General Petraeus, and the two had a wary encounter in Baghdad when Mr. Obama visited as a candidate in 2008. After Mr. Obama came to the White House, General Petraeus no longer had the regular interactions he had with Mr. Bush.
But Mr. Obama came to appreciate General Petraeus's intelligence and dedication. He invited the general to fly on Air Force One with him to West Point for his speech announcing the Afghanistan troop increase. Six months later, after ousting General McChrystal, the president sent his personal aide to find General Petraeus and bring him to the Oval Office for a one-on-one talk. The general accepted the appointment without even a chance to call his wife.
''It's an extraordinary irony,'' said Mr. Riedel, the former Obama adviser. ''He, like Bush before him, has put all his bets down on the table on one guy -- and it's the same guy.''

 BODY:
THE NEWS Incumbents and establishment figures, for the most part, fended off strong challenges from well-financed ''outsider'' candidates to win primary contests across five states despite a widely perceived tide of voter dissatisfaction. 
BEHIND THE NEWS Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, handily beat J. D. Hayworth, a conservative talk-radio host, in part by shifting to the right on Mr. Hayworth's big issue, immigration. Among Democrats, Kendrick B. Meek, a Miami congressman, won the Senate nomination though he was far outspent by Jeff Greene, a wealthy real estate investor who poured millions of his own dollars into his campaign.
THE NEWS A few outsider candidates managed to defeat career politicians in high-profile primaries, mainly by attacking from the right and, in one case, flooding TV with campaign ads.
BEHIND THE NEWS The most notable contest was the Republican race for governor in Florida, where Rick Scott, above, a wealthy former health care executive, defeated Attorney General Bill McCollum by pressing him on immigration and jobs -- and by spending more than $50 million on the race, most of it his own money and much of it on TV, a record for a primary there. Conservative insurgents also beat establishment candidates in Republican House primaries in Arizona and Oklahoma.
THE NEWS In Alaska, the outcome of the Republican Senate primary remained up in the air, with Senator Lisa Murkowski hoping to find enough votes in absentee and provisional ballots to stage a come-from-behind victory.
BEHIND THE NEWS Joe Miller, a favorite of the Tea Party who was thought as recently as a few weeks ago to have little chance in the race, held a narrow lead of 1,668 votes over Senator Murkowski, above, whose father held the same seat before becoming governor and appointing his daughter to replace him. (He lost re-election to Sarah Palin.) Counting the remaining 7,600 ballots and settling challenges may delay a final resolution until early September.
THE NEWSKen Mehlman, who managed George W. Bush's 2004 presidential campaign and chaired the Republican National Committee, revealed that he is gay and is working to advance the cause of same-sex marriage.
BEHIND THE NEWS Mr. Mehlman, 44, a partner at a private equity firm, had previously denied that he was gay. The campaign and the party he led courted religious conservatives by pushing for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. The muted reaction to his disclosure suggests that the economy has become a more pressing issue for Republicans than social issues. ''It's taken me 43 years to come to terms with this part of my life,'' he said.
THE NEWS Vacationing on Martha's Vineyard with his family, President Obama told reporters that despite days of wind-whipped rain, ''I'm having a great time -- doing a lot of reading.''
BEHIND THE NEWS The president also took time to schedule what is being billed as a major speech on the withdrawal of American combat troops from Iraq, which he is set to deliver on Tuesday. And he held a conference call with advisers to discuss the faltering recovery, the major issue on voters' minds as midterm elections approach. The day before the call, the House Republican leader, John Boehner of Ohio, attacked the president's economic policy team and suggested that he fire them.

HEADLINE: Frontier With a View

BYLINE: By JAKE MOONEY

 BODY:
STANDING on the corner of 10th Avenue and 33rd Street, opposite the high concrete barrier that surrounds the railyards, it is just possible to imagine what the far West Side of Midtown Manhattan looked like not long ago. There are parking lots and parking garages, a McDonald's, and a boarded-up Irish pub, and not much else. Car traffic is heavy, and foot traffic is sparse.
Michael Roth, who is 56 and grew up in Brooklyn, owned a garage a few blocks south in the late 1970s. ''During those days,'' he recalled recently, ''all you had was prostitutes, pimps, more prostitutes, more pimps, drug dealing like you've never seen before. It was a horrible place to be.''
Mr. Roth spoke in the past tense because part of the view north from 33rd Street is jarringly different these days. Beyond billboards and tenements, a cluster of high-rise rental and condominium buildings has sprouted in recent years, and more are planned. An area that housed fewer than 5,000 people in the 2000 census now has nearly that many on 42nd Street between 11th and 12th Avenues alone. The new construction, long hoped for in city planning and development circles, has not yet spawned a proper name. But it has begun to feel like a neighborhood. 
Mr. Roth, who now owns New York Helicopter Charter, is a happy resident of one of those high-rises, Silver Towers.
''I lie in my bed and I see the Hudson River,'' he said. ''Sunday morning I see the cruise ships coming in and out. I see the Statue of Liberty. It doesn't get any better than that.''
Mr. Roth pays $5,400 a month for a one-bedroom apartment on the 52nd floor of Silver Towers, a 1,359-unit rental complex developed by Silverstein Properties. The project, on 42nd Street between 11th and 12th Avenues, began accepting residents last year, and the company's owner, Larry Silverstein, said it was now 80 percent rented.
Across 42nd Street it faces the Atelier, a 46-story, 478-unit condominium tower that opened in 2007, developed by the Moinian Group. Related Companies and Tishman Construction are completing a 60-story mixed-use tower on the southeast corner of 42nd Street and 10th Avenue that will have more than 800 units, both condos and rentals, as well as a branch of Yotel, the European ''pod'' hotel chain.
And the Gotham Organization has been working with city government to build 1,225 residential units in a mixed-use project between 44th and 45th Streets and 10th and 11th Avenues.
To the south, on 37th Street straddling 10th Avenue, TF Cornerstone has built three towers -- two at No. 505, which opened this year, and one at No. 455, which opened in 2009 -- with a total of more than 1,200 rental units. They have joined a handful of older rental buildings, including the 44-story Riverbank West, on 43rd Street, completed in 1987; the 34-story New Gotham, on 43rd Street, completed in 1998; and Mr. Silverstein's 41-story One River Place, which opened in 2000 at 42nd Street and 12th Avenue.
Collectively, the towers form a neighborhood -- 10th Avenue and west, from the railyards to the mid-40s -- that is not exactly Hudson Yards, since some of the buildings predate the city's large-scale redevelopment effort around the railyard, and others are outside its scope. It is not exactly Hell's Kitchen, either, lying in a former manufacturing zone to the west of that district. Its residents tend to be young, in their 20s and 30s, with white-collar jobs nearby in Midtown.
''You see very few gray hairs,'' said Enoch Hooper, the owner of Enoch's Bike Shop, just south of the 37th Street towers on 10th Avenue. He said the area's seedier side, as Mr. Roth described it, is long gone. But still, before the towers, ''there was just nobody around,'' Mr. Hooper added. ''No reason for anybody to come over here.''
For his business, the area's relatively poor public transit is a boon. ''It's good for me,'' Mr. Hooper said with a smile. ''They might buy a bike.''
Inaccessibility is the main downside to living in the area, said Aaron Kaufman, 26, a graduate student in real estate at New York University and an associate at Vicus Partners, a commercial real estate firm in Midtown. Mr. Kaufman pays $2,600 a month for a 500-square-foot alcove studio at Silver Towers, having received two months' free rent when he arrived in October. Despite certain inconveniences, he says he dreams about closing a big deal soon, so that he can buy an apartment in the area before prices go up.
Prices at the other new buildings in the area are similar, starting around $2,100 for studios, $3,000 for one-bedroom apartments, and $4,000 for two-bedrooms. At the Atelier, one-bedroom condos sell for $650,000 to $1 million, and two-bedrooms are $1.2 million to $1.5 million.
In the neighborhood's handful of other condo buildings -- including 552 West 43rd Street and 529 West 42nd Street, a converted armory -- one-bedroom units sell for around $700,000, with two- and three-bedrooms from $1.3 million to $1.7 million.
Mr. Kaufman, who moved to Silver Towers from the financial district, described the neighborhood as a mixed bag: It took him a while to find places to eat and hang out, he said, but now his list includes Daisy May's BBQ USA and H & H Bagels on 46th Street, and Ink48, a hotel at 48th and 11th with a rooftop bar.
The subway, at Eighth Avenue or Times Square, is a few long blocks from Silver Towers, but there are many lines from which to choose. And while M42 bus service can be spotty, several 42nd Street buildings, including Silver Towers, run morning shuttle buses across town. Ultimately, he said, his proximity to work, the view and the relatively affordable rent are worth the sacrifice in convenience.
''I think a lot of my young friends, when they come over, they go, 'Oh, that's far,' '' Mr. Kaufman said. ''Other people, it's a big deal, because you don't walk out and everything's within a stone's throw. But that doesn't bother me, because I'm like, 'I have a water view; you don't.' I can see the George Washington Bridge from my apartment.''
He plans to stay, he said, if he can negotiate a rental agreement similar to his current one.
The extension of the No. 7 subway line will improve accessibility somewhat. It is on schedule to open in December 2013, with a stop at 11th Avenue and 34th Street, said Kevin Ortiz, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. A planned stop at 10th Avenue and 41st Street was eliminated for budgetary reasons, but the mayor's office has been seeking money for a study to see if it can be built after all.
City efforts to spur development on the West Side have been extensive. In 2005 the City Council approved the Bloomberg administration's Hudson Yards plan, rezoning more than 300 acres, including the railyards, between 30th and 33rd Streets, and a vast swath to the north. The plan permits larger-scale residential development in some areas if affordability targets are met, and includes a goal of transforming 10th Avenue into a busy commercial and residential corridor.
The Gotham Organization's mixed-use development between 44th and 45th Streets, though not part of the Hudson Yards plan, is on city-owned land and was made possible by a rezoning with similar aims. Holly Leicht, a deputy commissioner at the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said the project would provide 600 permanent units of affordable rental housing, mostly middle-income.
Moreover the development, which Gotham hopes to begin in the second quarter of next year, will include neighborhood-oriented retail, and a replacement for the aging P.S. 51, which stands on part of the site. (There are no other public schools in the neighborhood.) Ms. Leicht said the tallest part of the project had been lowered to 31 stories in response to complaints from neighbors -- but that they were eager for stores and affordable housing.
''With so little land left that's publicly owned in the city,'' she said, ''to have a project that can have that many affordable units, especially permanent affordable units, is a big impact.''
Melissa Pianko, a vice president of Gotham, which would buy the property for around $35 million as part of the plan, said the influx of residents would engender more neighborhood services and amenities.
Not every development in the area has gone smoothly. A tower planned for the eastern end of the Moinian Group's property on 42nd Street, next to the Atelier by 11th Avenue, has not materialized; the site has received numerous citations from city authorities for standing water. And nearby branches of a Crunch gym and Starbucks recently closed.
The coffee shop's demise was ''quite shocking and disheartening,'' said Ali Jafri, a sales representative at Prudential Douglas Elliman who owns a unit in the Atelier.
Still, Mr. Jafri said he and his wife, who have newborn twins, were optimistic about the area. He cited both the neighboring developments and the building's amenities, which include a roof deck with a panoramic view, a large athletic facility and a ground-floor nightclub.
''We saw that it's not much of a neighborhood, if you will, from a buyer's perspective,'' he said. ''But we bought from an investor's perspective. It has a lot of upside, as we say in real estate.''
Frederick Elghanayan, one of the owners of TF Cornerstone, said a 10,000-square-foot Duane Reade was under construction at 455 West 37th Street, and the company is pursuing restaurants and a grocery store. No. 455 is fully leased, Mr. Elghanayan said, and 505 West 37th is 80 percent full. The company, he added, is in negotiations for a third site in the area, with the aim of creating another residential building.
Mr. Silverstein said he, too, was looking for another property in the neighborhood. It was in 1984 that he bought the land where One River Place and Silver Towers now stand; he said he had spent years weathering bad economies, pursuing rezoning, and waiting to see if development would be viable.
Now, ''the whole West Side has come into its own to a degree that's really very gratifying,'' he said. ''People now see a neighborhood, a community.''
Joey Egger, 35, a resident of One River Place, moved there from brownstone Brooklyn, which she loved, because her roommate -- both are Australian -- wanted to experience Manhattan before her time in the United States ran out. Ms. Egger works in digital media for the organization that produces Sesame Street; she says she walks to the restaurants on Ninth Avenue, and to the parkland along the Hudson River. Then there's her building's pool and rooftop, which she describes as ''fantastic.''
''It's like living in a hotel,'' she said. ''It's a bit weird.''

HEADLINE: Families of Dead Soldiers Sue Insurer Over Its Handling of Survivors' Benefits

BYLINE: By DAN FROSCH

 BODY:
Vickie Castro's only child was killed six years ago just before Christmas, when a suicide bomber blew himself up inside an Army mess tent in Mosul, Iraq, killing more than 20 people.
In those dizzying days after the death of her son, Jonathan Castro, Ms. Castro vaguely remembers getting a letter and a draft checkbook from the Prudential Insurance Company of America, which provides life insurance to American soldiers and veterans on behalf of the federal government.
The letter informed Ms. Castro that she was entitled to $250,000 from her son's military life insurance policy. Whenever she wanted the money, she could simply deposit one of the checks into a special account that had been set up in her family's name, the letter said.
Still grieving over her son's death, Ms. Castro finally brought herself to look at the account's monthly statements a year later and noticed that the money was yielding an interest rate of just 1.2 percent. She quickly transferred the funds into a certificate of deposit at her local credit union, where the interest rate was considerably higher. 
Now, the Castros and five other military families are suing Prudential, accusing it of profiting off dead service members by keeping their life insurance benefits in the company's own general account to earn interest for itself, instead of immediately handing them over to the families.
The lawsuit, which was first reported by Bloomberg News last month, was filed in federal court in Springfield, Mass., on July 29. An amended version of the suit, a draft of which was obtained by The New York Times, will be filed in federal court on Monday, lawyers say. It has additional plaintiffs and also accuses Prudential of committing fraud by pretending to put the money of military families into personal interest-bearing accounts, called Alliance Accounts.
Instead, according to the new claim, Prudential held the money in its own coffers and earned an investment profit estimated at 5 percent to 6 percent. Only when families wanted to withdraw funds would the company shuttle money into the Alliance Accounts, and then pay out the benefits with a markedly lower interest rate that varied from 0.5 to 1.5 percent, the suit says.
Prudential has made an estimated half-billion dollars off this practice over the last 11 years, the plaintiffs' lawyers say. Though that may amount to only a few thousand dollars less in interest payments per beneficiary, some military families like the Castros say they are aghast at the idea of a business making money off dead military members.
''That they would dishonor my son, who died serving his country, that Prudential would use his insurance policy to make a higher profit -- it can't be true, but it is,'' said Ms. Castro, who lives in Corona, Calif.
Prudential would not comment on the lawsuit but has vigorously defended the military life insurance policies.
A Prudential spokesman, Bob DeFillippo, said that services like the Alliance Accounts had become the industry standard, and that they provided a safe, reliable place for military families to keep their money in trying times.
The accounts are administered much the same way a bank runs any conventional on-demand money service, like a checking account, Mr. DeFillippo said. He said that the funds were readily available to the beneficiary and that interest rates were on par with similar banking setups.
''The notion that we're taking something away from the beneficiaries is completely wrong and one of the worst, most misleading facts that has come out,'' Mr. DeFillippo said. ''We've been doing this for 40 years. We don't consider this a business; it's more of a service. It's the beneficiary's money, and they have access to it whenever they want.''
Prudential has been administering life insurance plans for soldiers since 1965, when Congress created Service Members' Group Life Insurance and later a similar program for veterans. When a soldier or veteran dies, beneficiaries can receive up to $400,000 in benefits. Federal law requires Prudential to pay out either in a lump sum or in 36 monthly installments.
If a soldier's family wants to collect the lump sum, the Alliance Account is set up for them. Until they actually withdraw money, it sits in Prudential's general account, of which military benefits make up only a small fraction, Mr. DeFillippo said.
Prudential says the account yielded 4.1 percent interest over the last six months. The interest on money paid to military beneficiaries through the Alliance Accounts over a similar time period was 0.5 percent -- a rate Prudential sets based on comparable banking options, it says.
Mr. DeFillippo says it is unfair to compare the two rates because the military life insurance benefits are placed in short-term investments with little return and must be liquidated quickly if a family withdraws money.
''This is a complete fabrication to say that we're earning a lot of money,'' he said, adding that out of about $200 billion in the general account, about 2 percent came from the Alliance accounts.
But lawyers representing the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, Jacqueline Scott Corley, Michael von Loewenfeldt and Cristobal Bonifaz, say that from the day a claim is made on a soldier or veteran's death, the money is no longer Prudential's. Therefore, the company has no right to invest or profit from it at all -- particularly without giving the beneficiary a choice, the lawyers contend.
The suit is premised on a basic point: transferring money into the Alliance Account only after a family seeks to withdraw it, the lawyers say, is not the same as making a lump-sum payment, which is required by the federal law that set up the program.
''Our clients trusted Prudential -- they didn't know Prudential was using the money for its own benefit,'' Mr. von Loewenfeldt said. ''It would be like if I went to your house and stole a check out of your mailbox, invested it and then sent you a letter saying: 'I have your money. Let me know when you want it, and in the meantime I'll pay you a little bit of interest.' ''
The lawsuit seeks the return of a half-billion dollars that it says Prudential has made off the benefits.
Responding to news reports about the carrier, New York's attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, began an investigation into the life insurance industry, and members of Congress are looking into Prudential's handling of the military insurance program. The Department of Veterans Affairs, which oversees the program, is reviewing how Prudential manages the Alliance Accounts.
Mr. DeFillippo said Prudential was cooperating with the investigations and working with the veterans agency.
Ms. Castro says her lawsuit is less about money than the fact that Prudential has somehow earned profits -- whatever the amount -- from her son's death in Iraq.
''To think that these people are so unfeeling, so heartless that they would put profit above the honor that should be guaranteed to our servicemen and women who die in the line duty,'' she said. ''How could anybody think this is just another way to make a buck?''

HEADLINE: Iran Shifts Its Assets Out of Banks In Europe

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YONG

 BODY:
TEHRAN -- Iran has transferred assets out of European banks in its latest effort to defend itself against the effects of sanctions that are part of what Iranian officials have called an ''economic war'' against the country by the United States and other Western countries.
Iran's ''Central Bank had previously specified a list of its banking reserves in Europe and has transferred them,'' the bank's governor, Mahmoud Bahmani, was quoted as saying by Iran's semiofficial Fars news agency on Saturday. 
Mr. Bahmani did not specify the amount or date of the transfers but said the move had been envisioned ''six months in advance'' of the new round of trade and financial restrictions placed on Iran by Western nations because of their concerns over the nature of Iran's nuclear program.
''We are currently facing an all-out economic war and we have to be completely prepared,'' Mr. Bahmani told a conference on Islamic banking here on Saturday.
This month, the head of one of Iran's largest banks, Bank Saderat, said in comments on the bank's Web site that European assets worth about $432 million had been frozen by the nations holding them. Bank Saderat is one of several Iranian banks blacklisted by the United States on suspicion of channeling money to Iran's nuclear program.
A fourth round of United Nations Security Council sanctions, reinforced by separate restrictions imposed by the United States and the European Union, have made it increasingly difficult for Iran to conduct its international business. In recent weeks, South Korea and Japan have also expressed willingness to impose sanctions on Iran, with whom they are major trading partners.
Banks dealing with Iran have also been subjected to harsh penalties. This month, the United States Justice Department imposed a $298 million fine on Barclays for trading with countries that are under United States sanctions, including Iran. As traditional sources of trade close their doors to Iran, analysts said, the Islamic Republic will have to seek alternatives in Asia and the Middle East.
''They will probably forward assets to other banks globally,'' said an analyst based here who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. ''It makes life a lot harder to find new banking routes, but it never makes it impossible.''
Assets that Iran transferred from Europe might pass through companies in Dubai, which has tried to maintain a balance between preserving about $12 billion in annual trade with Iran and convincing its Western partners that it is on board with sanctions.
Still, there is no doubt that years of international sanctions have contributed to high unemployment, inflation and stagnation in important sectors of Iran's economy. The last 12 months have brought growing reports of mass layoffs, unpaid wages and factory closings because of outstanding government debts.
The government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has been reluctant to reveal current economic growth figures, although critics of his administration say the country could grow as little as 0.5 percent this year.
''Generally for the business community, you talk to people and they are suffering,'' said a consultant who has significant dealings with both Iranian and international businesses.
Official figures value Iran's imports at around $55 billion, but the real figure could be much higher because of smuggling and black market trade. Many economists blame Mr. Ahmadinejad's expansionist policies for a surge in Iranian imports over the last five years. And an influx of cheap imports has depressed domestic production.
Last week, parliamentary leaders announced a ''double urgency'' bill to cut unnecessary imports and bolster domestic production after a call by Mr. Bahmani to limit imports to ''necessary goods.''
''Reducing the consumption of imported goods means confronting the sanctions,'' Mr. Bahmani said this month. ''There is no other way.''

HEADLINE: Massacre in Tamaulipas

 BODY:
The full story of the massacre in Tamaulipas, in northeast Mexico, awaits telling by its one survivor. The early news accounts are horrifying: 72 people, said to be migrants from Central and South America on their way to the United States, are waylaid and imprisoned by drug smugglers on a ranch 100 miles south of Texas. They refuse to pay extortion fees and are executed. The survivor, shot in the neck, hears their screams for mercy as he flees. After a gun battle with the authorities, the killers escape in S.U.V.'s. The dead, 58 men and 14 women, are found piled in a room, discarded contraband. 
The temptation may be to write this atrocity off as another ugly footnote in Mexico's vicious drug war. But such things do not exist in isolation. Mexico's drug cartels are nourished from outside, by American cash, heavy weapons and addiction; the northward pull of immigrants is fueled by our demand for low-wage labor.
Drug cartels, opportunistic capitalists, have leaped into the business of smuggling people. Illegal immigrants, known as pollos, or chickens, are in some ways better than cocaine bricks because they can be forced to pay ransom and be drug mules.
The American response to Mexico's agonies has mostly been a heightened fixation on militarizing the border -- most recently, a $600 million bill offered by Senator Charles Schumer, Democrat of New York, and signed by President Obama. Enforcement without any overhaul of legal migration creates only the illusion of control. Without a system tied to labor demand, illegality, disorder and death proliferate.
Current temporary-worker programs are so cumbersome and bureaucratic they are almost unusable by employers. Unable to enter legally, and locked out of Texas and California by stringent border security, immigrants skirt the fence ever farther into the remote Arizona desert. Illegal crossings are down in the bad economy, but deaths this brutal summer are up. The pull of opportunity still beckons.
We have delegated to drug lords the job of managing our immigrant supply, just as they manage our supply of narcotics. The results are clear.

HEADLINE: Immigrants Of Two Eras Join Together To Celebrate

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

 BODY:
BRENTWOOD, N.Y.
It was probably inevitable that the annual Feast of Mother Cabrini run by the Giuseppe A. Nigro Lodge, Order of Sons of Italy in America, Long Island's answer to Little Italy's Feast of San Gennaro, would offer attractions like the Sol y Sombra Spanish Dance Company and the taco stand on the midway.
Brentwood, a patch of sprawl in Suffolk County, once largely populated by Italians who migrated there from Brooklyn in the '50s and '60s, is now largely Central American. The signs on Fifth Avenue read La Cubanita Hoy, Teresa's Latin Look Unisex Salon, La Excelencia Bakery and Deli, Centro Evangelistico Pentecostes. The big-screen TV behind the registers at the Compare Market shows soccer; the in-store music is salsa and merengue. 
Still, in the blur that is American culture, we take our nostalgia and hoary traditions where we can get them. So everything seems quite the same, even when it isn't, off Exit 53 on the Long Island Expressway, on the midway at Suffolk Community College, where the feast has operated since the lodge began it 39 years ago.
It is getting to be something of a struggle. This year's three chairmen were Giacomo Abruzzo, 72, Cameo Borruso, 72, and Cono Peluso, 76, but Mr. Peluso is now recovering from a stroke and heart attack he suffered shortly before the feast began.
At its peak, the lodge had about 130 members, all male, for whom the biggest annual event was putting on the feast, which runs every year on Labor Day weekend and the weekend before. Now it is down to 35, male and female, nearly all of them scurrying around in Cabrini Feast shirts.
Still, Newton Shows, a Long Island carnival operator that does two of these a week, about 26 weeks a year, has it pretty much down to a science, right down to what prizes (oversize plush bananas this year) seem most popular.
In the middle of the midway is a statue of Mother Cabrini, St. Frances Xavier Cabrini, the first American citizen (she was born in Lombardy, Italy) to be canonized by the Roman Catholic Church. One of the old Italian women in town, Maria DeSena, owned the statue, and when the lodge began the feast members named it for Mother Cabrini. People still pin money on the statue for charity. The feast raises about $50,000 for various charities, much of the money going toward scholarships.
MOTHER CABRINI, the patron saint of immigrants, turned out to be an astute choice. Once they were Italian. Now, they are largely Hispanic. In the beginning, the feast was essentially a local affair, its attendees overwhelmingly Italians from the neighborhood. Now it draws from much of Long Island and from the local area, where people might not know what a zeppole is, but show up nonetheless.
That said, many of the locals at places like La Casa Blanca, which offers Internet, printing and telephone services aimed at a Hispanic clientele, seem not to know the feast is going on, prompting a focus on Hispanic attractions and advertising toward Hispanic groups.
''I don't want to use the word catering to them; it sounds bad, but this should be an event for them, too,'' Mr. Abruzzo said. ''You want to keep the Italian flavor, but we have to recognize the way the community has changed.''
Brentwood has its share of problems these days, gang activity and crime among them, and there is no shortage of nostalgia for the old days. Go online, where many of us live, and you can find a Web page titled ''I want the old Brentwood back'' with 1,020 comments.
But, of course, there have been many old Brentwoods. Beginning in 1851, Brentwood was known as Modern Times and was a utopian community based on a pre-Tea Party philosophy of unfettered individualism. Envisioned as an libertarian, anarchist and anti-socialist utopia, it had no government, taxes, police or public spaces, and had its own currency based on labor exchange. All social arrangements, including marriage or whether to wear clothes, were left to the wishes of individuals. It lasted about 10 years, until the economic panic of 1857, the coming of the Civil War and an influx of what were described as cranks and crooks did it in.
Whatever modern was 160 or 60 years ago, off Exit 53, it feels like modern times, too. Salvadoran kids in Jets jerseys meander around eating Italian sausages, texting and taking pictures on their cellphones. One teenager actually manages to get a basketball down the too-small hoop and wins his elaborately tattooed girlfriend a huge white bear. Julio Solano, a Peruvian new in town, shows up with three children and two nephews. The Old School Band breaks into a ragged rendition of ''Woodstock,'' and the night unfolds in its own routine and inscrutable ways.

HEADLINE: A Flea Market Considers Its Fate In a Casino World

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS and MIRELA IVERAC

 BODY:
To the uncertainties over the arrival of casino gambling in a working-class neighborhood in Queens, add this: What will become of the sprawling flea market that has made its home at Aqueduct racetrack for more than 30 years? Will the vision of a lavish new Aqueduct, filled with thousands of slot machines and high-end restaurants, accommodate a down-market collection of stalls in a parking lot?
Stroll the market's crowded aisles or walk along nearby Liberty Avenue, nerve center of the small business district in the Ozone Park neighborhood, and you are bound to hear those questions. 
Shopkeepers describe the market as one piece of an engine that has kept on fueling the surrounding business district even in tough economic times. Its stalls are extensions of some of the stores there, and also of small factories, bakeries, wholesale and home-based businesses in neighborhoods all around.
Shoppers come from near and far. Stacy Lee, 35, a police officer in Kingston, Jamaica, travels to the flea market at least once a year and returns home stocked with goods, like the dresses, skirts, moisturizers and kitchen utensils she had stuffed in a green suitcase one recent Saturday.
''I wouldn't be buying and lugging them back if they weren't cheap,'' Ms. Lee said.
The flea market was not a factor in the decision to award a contract to develop a casino at Aqueduct, so its future is up in the air. But neighborhood leaders and vendors suspect the market may be seen as insignificant given the magnitude of the project.
At a time when the state is in desperate need of cash, the developer, Genting New York, would provide the state with a $380 million licensing fee up front. Genting, a subsidiary of the largest gambling company in Malaysia and Britain, said the casino -- which has 4,525 video slot machines and is linked to restaurants and a nearby subway station by a climate-controlled bridge -- could generate $1.5 million or more a day in tax revenue.
''We're just collateral damage,'' said Yvonne Kissoon, 52, a Guyanese immigrant who has sold lingerie from a stall at the market since 1987. Eight years later, Ms. Kissoon said, she and her husband, Reggie, had saved enough to open a store on Liberty Avenue, near 108th Street, four blocks from the market's main entrance on Rockaway Boulevard.
The flea market fills the racetrack's north parking lot. It is open on Tuesdays and weekends and has at least 500 stalls offering clothes, perfumes and accessories; slushies, spices and chicken shish kebobs; statues of the Hindu god Ganesh and lucky money trees that, according to practitioners of feng shui, are conducive to prosperity.
A collection of flags -- Guyanese, Colombian, Jamaican, Brazilian, Italian, American -- flutter above the stands, revealing the nationalities of the vendors. To them, the market is a first step on their climb up the economic ladder, or their sole support.
Steven Baum, 55, who lives on Long Island, has sold formal dresses and suits at the market for 25 years, as well as at a flea market in Columbus, N.J. Samer Zaben, 24, a civil engineering student from Howard Beach, Queens, works at the market on weekends, helping his parents sell men's clothing from two stands.
People travel by car, subway or bus, with some buses coming from as far away as Baltimore and Philadelphia. David King, 57, a biomedical engineer, traveled from Boston one recent Saturday on a trip organized by the Methodist church he attends.
''You get your bargains, and that's why you come here,'' Mr. King said.
Wilfer Asprilla, 39, an immigrant from Colombia who lives in Maspeth, Queens, said he made a living from the food he had sold at the market for 15 years, and up to 500 people might stop by on a Saturday or Sunday to savor his mozzarepa -- mozzarella cheese on sweet ground corn cakes -- and other specialties.
A manager at the flea market, Tom Walker, drove past Mr. Asprilla's stand in a golf cart and said that rumblings of the market's closing were ''rumor at this point.'' Mr. Asprilla seemed resigned to it, though, saying, ''It's going to happen sooner or later.''
It has happened at least once, years ago, before a previous attempt to build a casino at Aqueduct failed. (The effort to place a casino at the racetrack has been almost 10 years in the making.) ''We got to the market one day and they gave us a slip at the gate saying it would be the last day,'' Ms. Kissoon, the lingerie seller, recalled.
The market wound up closing on weekends for a few months. ''We have no idea what will happen this time,'' she said.
Messages left at the Westbury, N.Y., offices of Plain N Fancy Shows, which operates the market, have not been returned. The New York Racing Authority, which runs Aqueduct, said the arrangement with the market was private and could not be discussed.
In a statement, Stefan Friedman, a spokesman for Genting New York, said the company had not yet ''focused on the property outside of the proposed casino'' but it was open to exploring ''all possible uses of the site.''
The Indo-Caribbean Alliance, a community organization based in Ozone Park, is working to organize the vendors and find other places in the area that could house the market. But Betty Braton, chairwoman of Community Board 10, which represents the area, said, ''There aren't too many pieces of property that can accommodate something of this size.''
In the meantime, the vendors press on, trying to figure out how much merchandise to order, a difficult calculation when they do not know if the market will be around much longer.
''I don't know how you can have 10-, 20-year tenants and not have the decency of telling them what's going to happen,'' Ms. Kissoon said. ''To them, it might be just a decision. But it's our livelihood you're talking about here.''

HEADLINE: In the Finger Lakes, Enjoying a Master's Vision

BYLINE: By BILL PENNINGTON

 BODY:
While playing the Cornell University golf course designed by Robert Trent Jones before World War II, I wondered at times what the great Jones saw in the land as he laid out the holes. Why does this fairway meander to the left when the landscape slopes to the right?
Then I came around the corner of a dogleg right and saw the canopy of trees protecting the right side of the green - a daunting but perfectly natural runway of leafy limbs arching outward, ever ready to snag any slice struck from a dead slice lie. 
Ah, yes, so that's what he saw. More impressive, he saw it as he was beginning his trade, before he was even 35.
The Cornell golf course, named for its designer, is one of several examples of Jones's work in the Finger Lakes region of New York, an early breeding ground of Jones's work close to his boyhood home, East Rochester.
The Robert Trent Jones golf trail in Alabama is perhaps his best-known collection of golf courses and deservedly attracts a steady stream of golfers from around the nation.
But Jones, who died in 2000 when he was 93, was so productive, it sometimes seems as if you could piece together a Jones golf trail almost anywhere.
For sentimental value and because it's only a four-hour drive from New York City, the Finger Lakes area is my unheralded but worthy choice. And with the Jones courses generally next to lakeside mountains lined with deciduous trees, there may not be a better time to visit than the approaching fall months of September and October.
Jones certainly knew the terrain. He built his first course, Midvale Country Club just east of Rochester, in 1931 when he was 25. He built several more soon after, including the rolling course at Green Lakes State Park, a Depression-era project by the Civilian Conservation Corps. Jones himself operated that course for several years.
If the Finger Lakes were an incubator, the golf world became the benefactor as Jones built more than 500 courses worldwide, including at least one in 45 American states. But the Finger Lakes remained the starting point, and one wonders if the region shaped his designs for decades.
''I think it did if for no other reason than it has the perfect topography for golf,'' said James Hansen, a history professor and director of the honors college at Auburn University who is writing a Jones biography. ''He came away from the Finger Lakes with a certain aesthetic in his mind. He had a sense for what was beautiful and pleasing to the eye and how that translated to a golf course.
''I think it stayed with him all his life.''
In July, I composed my own tidy, four-course Jones Finger Lakes trail, with drives between the courses of no more than 80 minutes.
For starters, there is the Green Lakes State Park course in Fayetteville, N.Y., a sweeping swath of land winding through hills and swales that rarely lead to a flat lie, whether in the fairway or on the green. About 75 miles west, there is a 1972 Jones design at Bristol Harbour Resort, which sits on a dramatic bluff overlooking shimmering Canandaigua Lake. The Bristol Harbour course has striking lake views and five brilliant and distinctive closing holes in a classic woodland setting. Heading back toward Cornell, there is a little nine-hole course on the campus of tiny Wells College in the picturesque village of Aurora.
Jones's wife, Ione, whom he met while attending nearby Cornell in the late 1920s, persuaded Jones to renovate the 50-year-old Wells College course at roughly the time he was laying out the holes at Bristol Harbour. Jones re-configured only three holes, but the results are obvious. From the tee of the second hole, for example, a grove and a brook hide the green. It is one of several blind tee shots.
The Wells College course is a short, country nine-holer in the classic sense, so don't expect closely mowed fairways or manicured bunkers. Lower your expectations and enjoy the walk on another course overlooking a lake.
The final destination is Robert Trent Jones Golf Course at Cornell, which may be harder for the public golfer to experience because it is open to members of the extended Cornell community and their families, and, according to the club Web site, ''anyone with an educational affiliation.'' That can include a high school teacher in Iowa, or anywhere else, or a staff member at another college.
So if you can find a way to fit into one of those categories, or know someone who can, the Cornell course is the finest of Jones's Finger Lakes offerings. The back nine was designed and opened first, in 1941. Jones completed the 18-hole routing in 1954.
Last year, Cornell received a voluminous collection of Jones's papers, including his designs for hundreds of golf courses and about 400 boxes of correspondence and business records. In the documents was Jones's transcript when he was a special student at Cornell - special because he designed a program that was considered the first golf architecture curriculum in American higher education.
Jones, referred to as the father of modern golf course architecture, studied agronomy and landscape architecture but also horticulture, hydraulics, surveying, economics and public speaking. The public speaking component was because golf architects needed skills of persuasion if they were going to raise money for construction during the Depression.
The Jones papers are not yet open to the public for research because they have to be organized. But Elaine Engst, the director of Cornell's division of rare and manuscript collections, expects the collection to be exceedingly popular.
''A lot of people have contacted us already,'' Engst said.
Teeing off on the 14th hole at Bristol Harbour on a pristine July day, I couldn't imagine what Robert Trent Jones had in store for me. But striking my shot down the middle (or nearly so) seemed a suitable plan of attack.
Still, as I walked toward the ball in the fairway, I wondered: What did he see here?
Because I saw nothing.
And then I got to my ball and came upon the 80-foot drop from the fairway to a green enveloped by tall trees, a drop made even more devilish by the hole's sharp turn to the left.
Ah, yes, so that's what he saw.
And we can experience his vision forevermore.

HEADLINE: In California, An Old-Style Print War

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR.

 BODY:
San Francisco
The office of The Bay Guardian at the bottom of Potrero Hill in San Francisco -- the site of one of the last great newspaper wars -- was eerily quiet last Thursday morning, with the sounds of a bell at the front desk echoing up into the high ceiling.
Bruce B. Brugmann, the longtime editor-publisher-owner of that reliably leftist weekly, came down and invited me upstairs to his office, a museum to the glories of the printed artifact. Books, many of them about the persistent inadequacies of the capitalist system, formed ad hoc towers, and various kinds of newsprint were arrayed about in a system known only to him.
''I love print. We are doing a lot with the Web, but I'm a print guy,'' he said. Just in case I forgot, he later handed me a pressman's hat that had been made out of, naturally, a page of The Bay Guardian. 
Somewhere in this office, there was a copy of a decision from a California state appeals court unanimously upholding a $22 million judgment in a case brought against SF Weekly, a competing alternative weekly owned by Village Voice Media. After a six-week trial in 2008, a jury decided that SF Weekly and its owners had sold ads below cost in an effort to use anticompetitive pricing to put The Bay Guardian out of business.
The case has now gone on for six years, in part because Village Voice Media thinks it did nothing more than put out a competitive newspaper. The case has been fought in the press, in courts and in this room.
But in the meantime, the world outside has changed. Newspapers in general have obviously suffered, but weeklies, with their franchises in listings, classifieds, racy advertising and editorial content, have been clobbered by the Web. So far, the only thing that The Bay Guardian has to show for the litigation is a lot of legal bills and two old delivery vans from the SF Weekly that it managed to repossess.
But Mr. Brugmann, ever the lefty firebrand, suggests that the court decision, which upheld a long-running California statute prohibiting predatory pricing, is a victory for the little guy.
Village Voice Media is a chain of weeklies formed by the union of the Village Voice and New Times weeklies in 2005, and it owns 13 weeklies in Denver, New York, Dallas, Minneapolis and other American cities. In 1995, New Times bought SF Weekly, and one of the New Times founders came to town and told the staff that they were going to ''bury The Guardian,'' grabbing a copy of the competing weekly off a desk and stomping on it for emphasis.
As a young man in Iowa, Mr. Brugmann watched a chain drugstore wipe out his father's independent operation, and from his perspective, it is not a long walk to the present day and this newspaper, where his wife, Jean Dibble, serves as associate publisher and his one son is vice president for operations.
''We have been fighting against monopolies all these years, and we had this chain of weeklies that tried to use deep pockets to put us out of business,'' he said. ''I was a member of the 60th Infantry, and I was not about to let The Guardian go down because we had a competitor that was trying to put us out of business using illegal tactics.''
Once New Times arrived, a ferocious newspaper war ensued, with charges and countercharges. SF Weekly produced deeply reported articles with no particular political point of view, while The Bay Guardian stuck to its progressive knitting, hacking at the power companies and the daily newspapers.
''They came riding into town out of Tombstone,'' Mr. Brugmann said, alluding to the fact that the chain is headquartered in Arizona, ''and they started shooting up the place, and now they are going to have to pay the consequences.''
The public undoubtedly benefited from the competition, but each weekly suffered millions in loses.
In a riveting take, The Stranger, a weekly in Seattle, suggested that ''the winner is bound to profoundly wound the loser, possibly mortally.''
Andrew O'Hehir, now of Salon and the editor of SF Weekly when New Times took over, stared in wonder at the battle and told Eli Sanders of The Stranger that the case was becoming ''like some kind of Greek myth where the two protagonists are still fighting over a city that died 85 years ago or something.''
Mr. Brugmann says he does not keep a running tally of the legal costs associated with the case: ''I don't think we have ever totaled it up because it made us feel bad when we looked.'' But he says that at some point, Village Voice Media will be forced to settle the case, and The Bay Guardian will get back to ''raising hell and printing the news,'' as its slogan says.
He makes it clear that he doesn't expect to see the $16 million in damages, plus $6 million in interest (so far, as it accrues every day).
Village Voice Media is led by Michael Lacey and Jim Larkin, two notoriously pugnacious individuals who are not in the habit of giving up easily and have made it clear they will fight on.
''Bruce Brugmann believes he owns San Francisco and should dictate who is allowed to do business there,'' said Mr. Lacey in an e-mail. ''He announced upon our arrival that coming to his city would be our Vietnam. We don't believe Brugmann or lower courts can tell us how much to invest in journalism, and we believe the California Supreme Court will agree.''
He added: ''We never attempted to put Brugmann out of business. We merely tried to survive the collapse of tourism in San Francisco, the dot-com bust and the 9/11 economic crash. And we managed that quite well at the same time that we put out award-winning journalism.''
The feuding is taking place in one of the most wired cities in the world, where the information grid is like air and people walk right by the newspaper boxes of the crippled dailies -- The Chronicle and The Examiner -- and the attenuating weeklies as well.
''It was a horrible time to be in this kind of fight, and it is a horrible time to try to collect. But we will be back, maybe not flourishing, but on much more solid ground and doing what we have always done,'' Mr. Brugmann said.
At The Guardian, that means that the office, so quiet right now, will fill later in the day with various candidates for political office who will show up looking for the endorsement of a newspaper that once upon a time helped Harvey Milk start a political career.
It also means The Bay Guardian will continue its 40-plus year crusade for publicly owned power, a long running hobby horse that a visitor brings up at his peril. Mr. Brugmann goes over to his window and points to the power plant visible under a stretch of Interstate 280: ''We got involved in '39, I mean '69, and this is one of the greatest scandals in the history of the United States,'' he begins, and he winds into a fight song that goes on from there.

JENNY AND JOHNNY
''I'm Having Fun Now''
(Warner Brothers)
Jenny Lewis must be kidding when she sings, ''I don't think that two heads are better than one,'' on ''I'm Having Fun Now,'' the debut album by Jenny and Johnny. She has thrived with collaborators through most of her career, from her time as lead singer of the band Rilo Kiley to sharing her own 2008 album, ''Acid Tongue,'' with guests including Elvis Costello. Her partner in Jenny and Johnny is Johnathan Rice, the songwriter who's also her boyfriend and a charter member of her touring band. Her voice is clear and sunny; his is smoky. To record ''I'm Having Fun Now,'' they played most of the instruments themselves, sometimes assisted by Jason Boesel, Rilo Kiley's drummer. 
Ms. Lewis and Mr. Rice josh and harmonize their way through the album. The songs are upbeat, looking back to folk-rock and 1970s California pop. They're much breezier than ''Acid Tongue'' or Mr. Rice's albums, and they make a game of juggling who sings what. Ms. Lewis and Mr. Rice trade off leads (while the other sings ahs and la-las), or they sing close parallel lines, or they overlap and argue with each other. ''She's an artist painting a portrait all over my heart,'' he sings in ''Scissor Runner,'' the album's opening song; she airily counters, ''Colors bleeding, so deceiving.''
While the album's back story is part of its charm, ''I'm Having Fun Now'' is not a collection of love songs. Amid the guitar strumming, they stay unsentimental; there's far more banter than romance. Jenny and Johnny volley accusations of professional jealousy over the surf-rock beat of ''My Pet Snakes.'' ''All the best of luck with your career,'' Mr. Rice growls at the end.
In other songs they sing about travel, gods (Abrahamic and Greek), recreational drugs, promiscuity, even economics. ''We save our money in good faith/And we work hard for our living wage,'' Ms. Lewis sings in ''Big Wave.'' ''But still the banks got a break.'' Yet even in songs about tensions and betrayals Jenny and Johnny sound more sardonic than enraged. On this album the barbs are wrapped in smiles and irrepressible tunes. JON PARELES
LITTLE BIG TOWN
''The Reason Why''
(Capitol Nashville)
''Rain on a Tin Roof'' was buried deep on Julie Roberts's magnificent 2004 debut album, the 10th track of 11, and maybe only the seventh best. But it had teeth as an ambivalent declaration of love for a fickle man and sung with a weighty sigh.
A version of that song appears late on ''The Reason Why,'' Little Big Town's fourth album. But where Ms. Roberts's version was damp and lonely, this one is uncommitted, and almost comfortable, as if there's not a single cloud looming in the sky.
So it goes with Little Big Town, a country group that almost always chooses politesse over tension, letting its precise, sometimes clinical harmony stand in for feeling. The group comprises two women, Karen Fairchild and Kimberly Schlapman, and two men, Phillip Sweet and Jimi Westbrook, with vocals distributed in roughly equal measure among them -- when they're not all singing together in heavily compressed, anodyne harmony.
Redolent of Southern gospel and feather-light country-rock, it's a comfort zone for this group, employed consistently in the choruses, which can be arrestingly sharp, and often elsewhere. (The breakthrough 2005 hit, ''Boondocks,'' is the apogee of this tendency.) But piled on top of plangent guitars, the convergence can become grating, with all the emotion of archery, or some other sport that prizes accuracy above all.
That's true here especially on the songs written by the group (which make up a majority), save for ''Little White Church,'' which pops with acidic handclaps and needling harmonies between Ms. Fairchild and Ms. Schlapman. (Ms. Fairchild also surprises with a brief run of echoing herself, in whisper, late in the song, which for this group qualifies as innovation.)
But it takes an outside hand fully to untangle Little Big Town's wires. ''Shut Up Train,'' written with Hillary Lindsey and Luke Laird, is the highlight here, letting Ms. Fairchild sink or swim while her band mates chime in only for occasional support. Mostly she swims. JON CARAMANICA
LAND OF TALK
''Cloak and Cipher''
(Saddle Creek)
Elizabeth Powell, the singer-songwriter and guitarist behind Land of Talk, can give the impression of a chronic recluse gamely making the best of human interaction. That isn't unusual for an artist, though it may be a little odd for someone operating in a self-styled Canadian indie-rock utopia. Ms. Powell recently toured and recorded as a member of Broken Social Scene, the ultimate band as loose collective. But on ''Cloak and Cipher,'' the new Land of Talk album, she relinquishes not an ounce of control. The title suggests her state of mind: what she's seeking is obscurity, in one willful form or another.
She's good at finding it, but sometimes not to her benefit. Ms. Powell wrote a lot of the lyrics on ''Cloak and Cipher'' with scrambled input from books and various other texts, and she doesn't do much to smooth out the results, savoring the disjunctive and the cryptic. ''Swift Coin,'' the album's most driving track, feels straightforward until you note what she's singing as a chorus: ''Every mother'd eyed a better place/For to put in half a heart.'' It seems an unlikely sing-along line, though it's more or less presented as such.
At root Land of Talk is an economical three-piece, with Eoin O Laoghaire on bass and Andrew Barr on drums. Ms. Powell works well with these parameters, building songs out of coil-sprung riffs and soaring refrains. But she sometimes thickens the broth with guests from other Montreal bands, like Stars and Besnard Lakes, whose lead singer, Jace Lasek, helped produce the album. ''Quarry Hymns,'' a breezy rumination, has Jeremy Gara of the Arcade Fire on drums; the inexplicably titled ''Color Me Badd,'' with its distant bleating of trumpet, French horn and saxophone, sounds like a Broken Social Scene tune.
The graceful constant is Ms. Powell's small but penetrating singing voice, which she uses deftly. She knows when to sweeten her tone and when to go steely, and with one exception -- ''Hate I Won't Commit,'' in which she seems to be evoking an inebriated Rickie Lee Jones -- she doesn't draw attention to her musical calculations.
But there's so much emotional reserve in her style that when she coos a line like ''I want to see you,'' on ''Hamburg, Noon,'' you instinctively wait for the other shoe to drop. (Eventually it does: ''I wasn't following you.'' Of course not.) More trustworthy is a couplet from the chorus of ''Blangee Blee,'' which draws indirectly from 1960s folk-rock: ''We'd spend our lives making out middles/Oh, to give so much got me so little.'' NATE CHINEN
DANILO PeREZ
''Providencia'' (Mack Avenue)
The pianist Danilo Perez's conception of jazz is wide-angle and egalitarian, if not utopian. At the end of the day it's Pan-American folk song, even with its high refinements of collective improvisation and even when small orchestras are involved. He's a hard-core linker of traditions and rhythms and disciplines; he wants everything to connect. This has been the point of his most ambitious records over 17 years, including ''Panamonk'' (1996), ''Motherland'' (2000) and the new ''Providencia.''
But ''Providencia'' is a jumble of ensembles and intentions, and it risks incoherence. Some parts feel grand and overthought; two transformed boleros -- ''Historia de un Amor'' and ''Irremediablemente Solo'' -- are slow, concise and elegant, showing Mr. Perez's control over his sound. Another subset, with head-to-head soloing between Mr. Perez and the alto saxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa, thrives on volatility.
So much is attempted here. It can seem like at least three records scrambled together, and it's not always the case that the longer tracks -- like ''Daniela's Chronicles,'' a 10-minute piece dedicated to Mr. Perez's daughter, written in progressive sections that don't particularly cohere -- grow stale while the short ones stay fresh. Even some of the shortest pieces, between two and four minutes long, suffer from conceptual overload and indirection.
''Bridge of Life,'' cut into two brief segments in the album, joins writing for five classical woodwind players, who improvise a little bit, into Mr. Perez's jazz trio; it's a lumpy fit. The choppy, challenging, highly improvised middle of ''The Oracle'' works, whereas the beginning and end sections, with piano and drums alone, wander grimly. When the title track resembles a lost Milton Nascimento tune, with Sara Serpa singing wordless vocals, it's lovely. When it becomes a Cuban guaguanco with dam-burst piano improvising and complex chromatic melodies, the piece loses its focus. The long view isn't always the effective one. BEN RATLIFF

HEADLINE: Technology Aside, Most People Still Decline to Be Located

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER and JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
Internet companies have appropriated the real estate business's mantra -- it's all about location, location, location.
But while a home on the beach will always be an easy sell, it may be more difficult to persuade people to start using location-based Web services.
Big companies and start-ups alike -- including Google, Foursquare, Gowalla, Shopkick and most recently Facebook -- offer services that let people report their physical location online, so they can connect with friends or receive coupons.
Venture capitalists have poured $115 million into location start-ups since last year, according to the National Venture Capital Association, and companies like Starbucks and Gap have offered special deals to users of such services who visited their stores. 
But for all the attention and money these apps and Web sites are getting, adoption has so far been largely confined to pockets of young, technically adept urbanites. Just 4 percent of Americans have tried location-based services, and 1 percent use them weekly, according to Forrester Research. Eighty percent of those who have tried them are men, and 70 percent are between 19 and 35.
''Ever since mobile phones and location technology got started, there have been conversations about the potential for doing something really incredible with this for marketers,'' said Melissa Parrish, an interactive marketing analyst at Forrester. ''But clearly the question is whether it has reached the mainstream, and it looks like the answer is no.''
Foursquare, for example, which lets people ''check in'' to public places on their phones and let their friends know where they are, has close to three million users, most of them in cities. Loopt, a similar service, has four million users, about a quarter of whom actively use it. Compare that with Twitter, which has 145 million registered users.
This month, Facebook introduced Places, which adds some Foursquare-like features to its social network. If Places catches on with Facebook's 500 million users, many think it could bring location-sharing to the masses.
''Clearly location is not yet mainstream -- it's still a younger-demographic phenomenon -- but if anyone can change it, Facebook will,'' said Sam Altman, chief executive of Loopt.
For now, many people say sharing their physical location crosses a line, even if they freely share other information on the Web.
Stephanie Angelucci, who is 30 and lives in North Beach, Md., updates her MySpace page with photos of her babies, news about her health and testaments to her love of sailing. But she won't use location apps.
''I don't like broadcasting where we are or when my husband's gone, just for safety reasons,'' she said. And privacy concerns aside, she doesn't see the need: ''We go to playtime, the park and the grocery store. My life isn't exciting enough to broadcast where I am and what I do.''
Some users of Foursquare like the spontaneous social gatherings it can inspire, or the way it keeps friends informed of one's nightlife exploits. But people who are not frequent bar-hoppers need other reasons to check in. The companies that make location-based services are working to add incentives that they hope will reel in a bigger audience.
Sharing location becomes a simple cost-benefit analysis for most people, said Matt Galligan, chief executive of SimpleGeo, which sells location technology to companies building apps. ''There has to be an incentive for giving away very specific information, like coupons or points.''
Shopkick, which became available this month, offers coupons to people when they walk into stores like Best Buy and Macy's. The application allows users to share their location just with the store and not with other people, and is making inroads with a broader demographic.
Elizabeth Aley, 38, a volunteer in Nixa, Mo., says she is ''kind of addicted'' to Shopkick. She uses it when she goes to Wal-Mart, Target and the Price Cutter grocery store, to rack up points for entering the stores and to get coupons that she has exchanged for Tide laundry detergent and a Swiffer.
Ms. Aley has chosen to use the app to also reveal her location to her Facebook friends and Twitter followers. The rewards make using the app worthwhile, she said, and the privacy trade-off ''really never crossed my mind.''
Gowalla bills itself as a travel game that lets users stamp digital passports at places they visit, find virtual objects in real-world places in a kind of scavenger hunt, or follow trip itineraries in new cities.
''Connecting with friends is nice, but I don't know that it alone will be enough of a driver'' to make a location service widely popular, said Josh Williams, a Gowalla founder.
Foursquare hit upon the idea of allowing people to become ''mayor'' of places they visit most frequently, touching off competitions among users. Now it is teaming up with big companies and small stores so people see special offers when they check in, whether they are in Brooklyn or Milwaukee.
The company has signed promotional deals like a recent one with the History Channel, which sends users historical facts when they check in at a landmark.
''It's a misconception that the service is just for city kids,'' said Dennis Crowley, a Foursquare founder. ''Cities have the densest use, of course, but it happens in the Midwest and all over the world.''
Still, wariness about broadcasting one's location extends to city dwellers, too. Marsha Collier lives in Los Angeles and writes ''For Dummies'' books on technology. She uses Whrrl and Foursquare as a way to share information about her life with her online fans and followers -- but instead of checking in when she arrives at a place, she checks in as she leaves, to avoid alerting people that she is away from home.
''If I'm going to go work out at the gym, I'll check in on my way out,'' she said. ''That way, you're going to be home soon, so your house won't be unattended for a long time.''
Others let only a small circle of people see where they are. Ellen Lovelidge, 27, a fishery specialist and D.J. in Washington, carefully chooses who can see her Foursquare updates. She does not plan to use Facebook's new service, since her Facebook updates go out to a large network of friends, colleagues and family.
''I like Foursquare because I can actually pick who sees where I actually am, compared to Facebook, where I have 1,200 friends,'' she said. ''I don't want 1,200 people knowing where I am.'' Facebook does let users pick a smaller subgroup of friends who can see location updates, but Ms. Lovelidge said it would be too much trouble to set that up.
Location services are catching on more quickly with young people, who have grown up posting personal information online.
''The magic age is people born after 1981,'' said Mr. Altman of Loopt. ''That's the cut-off for us where we see a big change in privacy settings and user acceptance.''
That rings true for Richard Sherer, 65, a freelance writer in Redondo Beach, Calif. ''I can't think of anybody who cares where I am every minute of the day except my wife, and she already knows,'' he said. ''Maybe it's a generational thing. As we old fogies die off, maybe this will no longer be an issue.''

HEADLINE: Sanofi's Bid Puts Pressure On Genzyme

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and DUFF WILSON

 BODY:
Sanofi-Aventis, the French drug maker, publicly disclosed its $18.5 billion bid for Genzyme on Sunday, intensifying pressure on the American biotechnology company to engage in discussions about a sale.
Sanofi approached Genzyme in June, and the two companies were engaged in friendly merger talks. But, according to Sanofi's chief executive, Christopher Viehbacher, the discussions were stifled by Genzyme's management.
''We are disappointed that you rejected our proposal on Aug. 11 without discussing its substance with us,'' he wrote in a letter to Genzyme's chief executive, Henri A. Termeer. ''Our financial advisers finally met briefly on Aug. 24, but the meeting simply served as further confirmation that as throughout you remain unwilling to have constructive discussions.'' 
Genzyme's director of corporate communications, Bo Piela, said Sunday afternoon that the company would have no comment on Sanofi's statements.
In its bid, Sanofi is offering $69 a share in cash. That represents a 38 percent premium over Genzyme's unaffected share price before speculation hit the market about a possible deal. Shares of Genzyme closed at $67.62 on Friday.
People who have been briefed on the talks said that Mr. Termeer and Genzyme's board had pressed Sanofi for a higher bid before they would be willing to engage in meaningful negotiations and open up the company's books to its rival. Sanofi, meanwhile, faces no apparent bidding competition, and its public statement seemed aimed at raising shareholder pressure on Genzyme to sell.
A recent survey by Reuters of European and United States analysts showed an average forecast of a final deal price at $77.90 a share, with expectations ranging from $73 to $83.
Sanofi's move Sunday falls short of going hostile -- in which it would appeal directly to Genzyme's shareholders with its offer.
The deal would rank as the 10th-largest merger ever in the health care industry in the United States, according to Capital IQ, which tracks data on deals.
In an interview on Sunday, Mr. Viehbacher challenged the idea that Genzyme had refused to engage in substantive talks because of price. He said that when he called Genzyme's chief executive in June to first broach the idea of a merger, Mr. Termeer called back to say the company was not interested. ''And that was before they even asked me the price we would pay,'' Mr. Viehbacher said. ''I thought that was a little strange.''
He described the talks the companies have had as hitting ''a brick wall'' and said, ''We don't think this is a small offer.''
The $18.5 billion bid is the latest example of increased mergers and acquisition activity in the last month. BHP Billiton made a hostile $38.6 billion takeover bid for the Potash Corporation this month, and Hewlett-Packard and Dell are in a heated battle for control of 3Par, the data storage company. The increased activity is a function of the enormous amount of cash that corporations have on their balance sheets.
Some analysts also suggest that the merger activity is being driven by a slowdown in economic growth -- companies are desperately looking for ways to increase their revenues.
Although Mr. Viehbacher, who took over Sanofi in December 2008, has often described a growth plan built around smaller acquisitions and emerging markets, Genzyme is an attractive larger takeover candidate.
Based in Cambridge, Mass., Genzyme is the world's largest maker of medicines for genetic diseases. Its value has been hurt by manufacturing problems since 2008, including the shutdown of a Boston factory this year and a $175 million federal penalty for ''quality deficiencies.'' It lost production in two major products for rare inherited diseases.
At the same time, Genzyme has two possible blockbuster drugs in late-stage clinical trials -- Campath for multiple sclerosis and mipomersen for cholesterol. If approved by the Food and Drug Administration, they could provide significant revenue in 2012 and 2013, just when Sanofi will need it.
Mr. Viehbacher declined to discuss Sanofi's projections for those new drug candidates. ''Data are good, approvals are better,'' he said. ''It's pretty hard to predict that.''
Sanofi, based in Paris, wants to fill a looming revenue gap as it faces low-price generic competition to two of its top sellers, Lovenox and Plavix. Both are used to break up blood clots.
In July, the Food and Drug Administration allowed a generic version of Lovenox. And Plavix, the world's second-best-selling drug after Lipitor, will lose its United States patent in 2012.
Sanofi recently warned investors that 2010 income would be down as much as 4 percent. It reported second-quarter net sales of $10.2 billion, down 1.2 percent from the year-earlier quarter in constant exchange rates.
Sanofi is following a trend in the major pharmaceuticals industry of using cash -- or trying to use it -- to acquire new drug opportunities to compensate for patent expirations. In 2009, major pharmaceutical companies went through a wave of consolidation: Pfizer bought Wyeth for $68 billion, Merck bought Schering-Plough for $41 billion, and Roche paid $46 billion for the 44 percent of Genentech it did not already own.
Despite Sanofi's hunger to acquire Genzyme, Karen Anderson, an analyst for Morningstar, recently wrote investors that the potential synergy between Sanofi and Genzyme would be limited because of Genzyme's focus on specialty drugs. ''We don't see how Sanofi would be able to improve on Genzyme's already substantial global reach and highly customized niche sales force,'' her report concluded.
Mr. Viehbacher responded in the interview that Sanofi could build on Genzyme's reputation with rare-disease patients and improve the other portions of the company.
''Most people see Genzyme as a rare disease orphan drug company,'' he said. ''But actually that business is only 40 percent of their sales. They have oncology, for example, and Sanofi-Aventis is strong in oncology.''
He also predicted that Sanofi could help Genzyme with its manufacturing.
''We believe we can get this company back on track faster,'' he said. ''It's a company that has underperformed for a number of years now.''

HEADLINE: 2 New Federal Programs to Help Borrowers Pay Their Mortgages

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The Obama administration plans to take two new steps in the next few weeks to help struggling homeowners pay their mortgages, said Shaun Donovan, the secretary of Housing and Urban Development. 
The administration will begin a Federal Housing Administration refinancing effort to help borrowers who are struggling to pay their home mortgages, and will start an emergency homeowners' loan program for unemployed borrowers so they can stay in their homes, Mr. Donovan said on ''State of the Union'' on CNN.
''We are going to continue to make sure folks have access to home ownership,'' he said.
Home prices fell 1.6 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier as record foreclosures added to the inventory of properties for sale. The annual drop followed a 3.2 percent decline in the first quarter, the Federal Housing Finance Agency said last week in a report.
Sales of new homes unexpectedly dropped in July to the lowest level on record, signaling that even with cheaper prices and reduced borrowing costs the housing market is retreating. Purchases fell 12 percent from June to an annual pace of 276,0000, the weakest since the data began, in 1963.
Mr. Donovan said that it was too soon to say whether the administration's $8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers, which expired April 30, would be revived.
Reviving the tax credit would ''help enormously'' in the effort to fight foreclosures and revive the economy, Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida said on the same CNN program. Florida has one of the highest home foreclosure rates in the country, with one in every 171 Florida housing units receiving a foreclosure filing this year.

HEADLINE: It's Witch-Hunt Season

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
The last time a Democrat sat in the White House, he faced a nonstop witch hunt by his political opponents. Prominent figures on the right accused Bill and Hillary Clinton of everything from drug smuggling to murder. And once Republicans took control of Congress, they subjected the Clinton administration to unrelenting harassment -- at one point taking 140 hours of sworn testimony over accusations that the White House had misused its Christmas card list.
Now it's happening again -- except that this time it's even worse. Let's turn the floor over to Rush Limbaugh: ''Imam Hussein Obama,'' he recently declared, is ''probably the best anti-American president we've ever had.'' 
To get a sense of how much it matters when people like Mr. Limbaugh talk like this, bear in mind that he's an utterly mainstream figure within the Republican Party; bear in mind, too, that unless something changes the political dynamics, Republicans will soon control at least one house of Congress. This is going to be very, very ugly.
So where is this rage coming from? Why is it flourishing? What will it do to America?
Anyone who remembered the 1990s could have predicted something like the current political craziness. What we learned from the Clinton years is that a significant number of Americans just don't consider government by liberals -- even very moderate liberals -- legitimate. Mr. Obama's election would have enraged those people even if he were white. Of course, the fact that he isn't, and has an alien-sounding name, adds to the rage.
By the way, I'm not talking about the rage of the excluded and the dispossessed: Tea Partiers are relatively affluent, and nobody is angrier these days than the very, very rich. Wall Street has turned on Mr. Obama with a vengeance: last month Steve Schwarzman, the billionaire chairman of the Blackstone Group, the private equity giant, compared proposals to end tax loopholes for hedge fund managers with the Nazi invasion of Poland.
And powerful forces are promoting and exploiting this rage. Jane Mayer's new article in The New Yorker about the superrich Koch brothers and their war against Mr. Obama has generated much-justified attention, but as Ms. Mayer herself points out, only the scale of their effort is new: billionaires like Richard Mellon Scaife waged a similar war against Bill Clinton.
Meanwhile, the right-wing media are replaying their greatest hits. In the 1990s, Mr. Limbaugh used innuendo to feed anti-Clinton mythology, notably the insinuation that Hillary Clinton was complicit in the death of Vince Foster. Now, as we've just seen, he's doing his best to insinuate that Mr. Obama is a Muslim. Again, though, there's an extra level of craziness this time around: Mr. Limbaugh is the same as he always was, but now seems tame compared with Glenn Beck.
And where, in all of this, are the responsible Republicans, leaders who will stand up and say that some partisans are going too far? Nowhere to be found.
To take a prime example: the hysteria over the proposed Islamic center in lower Manhattan almost makes one long for the days when former President George W. Bush tried to soothe religious hatred, declaring Islam a religion of peace. There were good reasons for his position: there are a billion Muslims in the world, and America can't afford to make all of them its enemies.
But here's the thing: Mr. Bush is still around, as are many of his former officials. Where are the statements, from the former president or those in his inner circle, preaching tolerance and denouncing anti-Islam hysteria? On this issue, as on many others, the G.O.P. establishment is offering a nearly uniform profile in cowardice.
So what will happen if, as expected, Republicans win control of the House? We already know part of the answer: Politico reports that they're gearing up for a repeat performance of the 1990s, with a ''wave of committee investigations'' -- several of them over supposed scandals that we already know are completely phony. We can expect the G.O.P. to play chicken over the federal budget, too; I'd put even odds on a 1995-type government shutdown sometime over the next couple of years.
It will be an ugly scene, and it will be dangerous, too. The 1990s were a time of peace and prosperity; this is a time of neither. In particular, we're still suffering the after-effects of the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, and we can't afford to have a federal government paralyzed by an opposition with no interest in helping the president govern. But that's what we're likely to get.
If I were President Obama, I'd be doing all I could to head off this prospect, offering some major new initiatives on the economic front in particular, if only to shake up the political dynamic. But my guess is that the president will continue to play it safe, all the way into catastrophe.

HEADLINE: Revisiting Black History On Martha's Vineyard

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
OAK BLUFFS, Mass. -- As a getaway for two Democratic presidents, including the current one, Martha's Vineyard is often disparaged as an undemocratic haven for wealthy white elites.
Kathlyn Joy Gilliam and Lorraine Parson thought differently from what they had read in black history books, and longed to visit.
''It's always been said this is where the elite African-Americans came,'' said Ms. Parson, 74. Mrs. Gilliam, her 79-year-old sister, added, ''I didn't realize how many African-Americans were here, though.'' 
By chance, the two women finally visited last week, while President Obama was here for his second August vacation since taking office. They did not see him, but they saw much of the island on a daylong tour of its African-American Heritage Trail: 22 sites that someday will probably add a stop for the secluded farm the first black president rented.
The island has often been called self-segregated, with most African-Americans here in Oak Bluffs. Its harbor drew freed slaves, laborers and sailors in the 18th century, and white locals sold them land. In the late 19th and 20th centuries, middle-class blacks bought or rented summer homes; many descendants returned annually. Most affluent whites live in Edgartown to the southeast or on farms and estates to the west, where Mr. Obama stays.
But many African-Americans here, year-rounders and summer visitors alike, insist it is not segregated. ''This is one of the most integrated communities, racially and economically, that there is,'' said Vernon Jordan, the lawyer and former civil rights leader, who has rented a summer place for years.
His wife, Ann, came here as a child from segregated Tuskegee, Ala., with her father, a surgeon. Her cousin is Valerie Jarrett, Mr. Obama's longtime friend and adviser, who has vacationed here since she was a child.
''We'd hitchhike all over the island,'' Ms. Jarrett said. ''I never experienced a hint of discrimination on the island in more than 40 years.''
Influenced by Ms. Jarrett and other friends, Mr. Obama visited several times before he became president. In August 2004, amid his campaign for the Senate, Mr. Obama was here for a forum on the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court ruling against segregated schools. Also participating were two summer residents and Harvard professors, Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Charles J. Ogletree Jr.
In 2007, Mr. Obama came for a fund-raiser when he was running for president. He called the island ''one of those magical places where people of all different walks of life come together, where they take each other at face value.''
According to the book ''African-Americans on Martha's Vineyard,'' a 1947 article in Ebony magazine said the ''most exclusive Negro summer colony in the country is at quaint historical Oak Bluffs on Martha's Vineyard.'' It added, ''Negro and white swim together on the public beaches, rub shoulders at public affairs.''
Forty-two years later, in 1989, Ebony again declared the island ''a vacation mecca.''
The heritage trail includes stops at the houses of former Senator Edward Brooke of Massachusetts, the first black senator after Reconstruction and the first from the North; former Representative Adam Clayton Powell Jr.; and Dorothy West, a Harlem Renaissance writer who for two summers in the 1990s was visited by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, another Vineyard resident and a Doubleday editor who guided Ms. West to finish her novel ''The Wedding.''
Also on the tour is the oceanfront mansion of Joseph Overton, the onetime Harlem labor leader, which was known as the Summer White House of the civil rights movement. It faces the Inkwell beach, named long ago by black youths or black writers -- no one seems certain. The house's visitors included the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who vacationed on the island with his family a number of times, as well as Joe Louis, Harry Belafonte and Jesse Jackson.
The exclusive Chilmark area has Rebecca's Field, land that the enslaved Rebecca Amos inherited and farmed until 1801. Edgartown has a plaque honoring the daughter who was taken from her to be enslaved elsewhere, Nancy Michael, called ''Black Nance.'' It calls her ''a most singular character'' -- in the words of an 1857 obituary -- for the spells she conjured for departing ship captains.
And on Chappaquiddick is the dilapidated house of her grandson, William Martin, who became one of the few black whaling ship captains in New England.
The tour guide, Alex Palmer, said the heritage trail group had been trying to raise money to restore the 1830 house or see it sold to someone who would do the restoration, but had been unsuccessful. Yet when he drove to the site, a new owner, Michael Partenio, was there with his two young sons.
Mr. Partenio, a photographer and producer from Danbury, Conn., who is white, said he would rebuild the house much the way Captain Martin knew it -- and admit tour groups. He had already bought a guestbook; the visiting African-American women were the first to sign.
Mae Margaret Donaldson, 65, of Dallas, a cousin of Mrs. Gilliam and Ms. Parson, was so moved that she told everyone to hold hands in a circle. She prayed for a blessing on the house and its owners. Then she hugged Mr. Partenio.
''We're going to take good care of it,'' he told her.

HEADLINE: Actors' Protest and Rabbi's Sermon Stoke Tensions in Israel Ahead of Peace Talks

BYLINE: By ISABEL KERSHNER; Ethan Bronner contributed reporting.

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- Israel was in an uproar on Sunday over a refusal by Israeli theater artists to perform in West Bank Jewish settlements, and Palestinians were outraged by a virulently anti-Palestinian sermon by a Jerusalem rabbi, further fueling the atmosphere days before the expected resumption of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks in Washington.
The artists' protest awakened internal debate in Israel over the legitimacy of the Jewish settlements, while the Palestinian government condemned the sermon delivered by the influential rabbi on Saturday in which he described the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, as ''evil'' and called on God to strike ''these Ishmaelites and Palestinians with a plague; these evil haters of Israel.'' 
Excerpts of the sermon were broadcast on Israel Radio on Sunday.
The Iraqi-born rabbi, Ovadia Yosef, 89, is the spiritual leader of the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party, which is a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government coalition. A widely respected religious authority, Rabbi Yosef also is known for his incendiary pronouncements against Arabs and homosexuals, among others.
Referring to Mr. Abbas, the Palestinian Authority president, by his popular name, the rabbi said that ''Abu Mazen and all these evil people should perish from this earth.''
The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, said in a statement that the rabbi was ''literally calling for a genocide against Palestinians'' and ''for the assassination of President Abbas.''
Mr. Netanyahu stopped short of condemning the rabbi's remarks, but his office said in a statement that they ''do not reflect Netanyahu's views, nor do they reflect the stance of the Israeli government.''
The statement continued, ''Israel plans to take part in peace negotiations out of a desire to advance toward a peace agreement with the Palestinians that will end the conflict and ensure peace, security and good neighborly relations between the two peoples.''
Eli Yishai, the interior minister and the political leader of Shas, had no comment, according to his media adviser, Roei Lachmanovich.
Skepticism about the chances of a peace deal within 12 months -- the goal set by the Obama administration -- already is running high among Israelis and Palestinians, and nerves are raw on both sides.
Israel is usually the one accusing the Palestinians of incitement, citing the naming of public squares, streets and cultural events for Palestinians who planned or carried out bloody attacks against Israelis.
The Palestinian leadership has focused until now on the issue of settlements and the looming question of the partial Israeli moratorium on settlement construction, which is due to expire on Sept. 26.
In a speech broadcast on Palestinian television on Sunday night, Mr. Abbas said that the Palestinians had ''informed all concerned parties, including the Americans, before agreeing to participate in the negotiations, that Israel will be held responsible for risking the failure or undermining of the negotiations if it continues settlement expansion in any form in the Palestinian land occupied since 1967,'' in a reference to the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
The direct negotiations, scheduled to start Thursday, will be the first in 20 months.
The Palestinians aspire to an independent state in the territory that Israel conquered in the 1967 war. The West Bank is now dotted with Jewish settlements, which are home to about 300,000 Israelis. Israel maintains that the territory is disputed. Most of the world considers the settlements to be illegal under international law.
More than 50 Israeli actors and playwrights signed a letter on Thursday to the managements of six Israeli theaters protesting plans to stage productions in a new performing arts center scheduled to open in the urban settlement of Ariel in November. The artists asked the theater managers to limit their activity to sovereign Israeli territory within the 1967 lines.
The letter led to threats by members of the Israeli Parliament of economic consequences for the theaters, which are partly state-financed.
The managements of four major theaters responded with a statement saying that they ''will perform in any place where there are theater-loving Israelis, including the new cultural center in Ariel.''
The issue of performing in West Bank settlements has not arisen before because there were no large facilities there to host major productions, Noam Semel, the director general of the Cameri Theater in Tel Aviv, said by telephone.
In a separate response, Miki Gurevitch, the artistic director of the Khan Theater in Jerusalem, posed the question of whether excluding Ariel from Israel's social borders would mean that the artists were excluding themselves from society.
Mr. Netanyahu said Sunday that the Israeli government did ''not need to fund boycotts'' directed at Israeli citizens. The Israeli government has been critical of a Palestinian Authority boycott of produce from Israeli settlements.
Ron Nachman, the mayor of Ariel, said by telephone that the problem was between the theater managers and their employees. He added that Israeli-Palestinian negotiations based on a territory-for-peace formula were bound to fail.
Ariel has been a sticking point in past negotiations -- with Israel insisting on keeping it within its borders and the Palestinians insisting on its removal -- because it juts far into the West Bank.
Amid the discord, and in an effort to win over the Israeli public, a number of Palestinian leaders have recorded one-minute video clips expressing their seriousness about the negotiations and commitment to peace. The clips, sponsored by a joint Israeli-Palestinian organization and paid for by the American government, began to appear on Web sites on Sunday and were expected to spread to electronic billboards in the coming days.
''Shalom to you in Israel,'' states Mr. Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, in one such clip. Like a half-dozen others, Mr. Erekat's message is, ''I am your partner.'' He expresses confidence that a two-state solution can be reached.

HEADLINE: Takeover Targets Aren't Defenseless

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GOLDFARB and FIONA MAHARG BRAVO

 BODY:
Companies have let their takeover guards down, but they're hardly defenseless. Garden-variety antitakeover provisions, including rights plans and classified boards, are disappearing in North America. That ostensibly should make it easier for acquisitive predators to get their way, especially in a depressed market. Target firms, however, are showing pluck fending off unwanted suitors.
The poison pill provisions, originally championed by Marty Lipton to beat back corporate raiders in the 1980s, are on the outs. Sixty percent of companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had pills in force in 2002, but less than 20 percent did at the end of last year, according to FactSet SharkRepellent, a corporate governance database focusing on takeover defense. The number that require directors to serve for different term lengths, another powerful defense provision, has fallen by half in the last eight years. 
Fewer pills, however, hasn't necessarily meant less poison. Carl C. Icahn discovered that when he tried to buy the film studio Lions Gate Entertainment. Canadian regulators struck down the company's attempt at a poison pill as Mr. Icahn built his stake to 38 percent. So Lions Gate craftily converted $100 million of debt into shares held by a board member who may be friendlier to management.
Similarly, the unwelcome advances of Alimentation Couche-Tard of Quebec have left Casey's General Stores, the convenience store chain, better protected. When Casey's borrowed money to buy back shares, the debt included a provision imposing penalties in the event of a change of control.
Barnes & Noble, meanwhile, adopted an asymmetric defense to block the activist investor Ron W. Burkle's creeping control. Under its terms, no single investor can own more than 20 percent of the bookseller -- no one, that is, other than Barnes & Noble's builder, Leonard S. Riggio, who with his brother already holds 29 percent.
Pills often entrench management at the expense of shareholders. But in the right hands, they can also be used to squeeze a higher price from a suitor. With share prices depressed, unfriendly bids are on the rise.
Take the Potash Corporation, which faces a rich and powerful BHP Billiton. At best, because of Canadian rules, it will be allowed to enact a poison pill for 90 days, something BHP is planning to challenge. But based on other defenses emerging, Potash may yet have creative tactics at its disposal.
Banks Thinking Big
Spain's two biggest banks, Santander and BBVA, are following radically different strategies to crack the American market. It's too soon to tell which of these fierce competitors will come out on top. But if Santander can sew up a deal with M&T Bank of Buffalo, it will be closer to its goal.
BBVA's American adventure began in 2004 with the takeover of Laredo National for $850 million. The idea was to exploit trade flows between BBVA's strong Mexican franchise and Hispanics across the border. Since then, BBVA has added four more banks. The acquisitions include Compass Bancshares of Alabama, for which it paid $9.6 billion, or 3.5 times book value, in 2007, only to see the market tank. BBVA wrote off a huge chunk of its American franchise at the end of 2009.
By contrast, Santander went after the more affluent Northeast. Its foray began badly in 2006 with a costly 20 percent stake in Sovereign Bancorp. A $1.1 billion charge followed when the recession hit. True, Santander bagged the rest of Sovereign for a knock-down price, but only after it injected $347 million in its last-ditch 2008 capital buildup.
The worst seems to be behind both Santander and BBVA. They have cut costs drastically in the United States. In the first half of 2010, BBVA's American operations contributed 555 million euros to operating income, against 580 million euros for Santander's. Both have about 750 branches. The big difference is that BBVA's $12.7 billion expansion bill is more than double Santander's.
BBVA's last purchase, the F.D.I.C.-sponsored Guaranty Financial, was shrewd and opportunistic. But it's not clear where BBVA goes now. Texas targets are thinning, and shareholders might take some convincing to back another big American bet.
Yet, Santander is busy plotting its next move -- a potential merger of Sovereign with M&T. That would be a clever way to gain critical mass, respected management and savings without splashing out much cash. Santander's presence would virtually double in one fell swoop -- and give it an edge in America against its biggest rival.

HEADLINE: Managing Expectations For the Fed

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. -- Federal Reserve officials and economists appear increasingly united in their view that the partisan gridlock on fiscal policy in Washington has clouded the prospects for a faster and stronger recovery.
The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, who has assiduously avoided taking sides in fiscal debates, said on Friday that the central bank stood ready to use a variety of tools to forestall deflation, a broad decline in prices. But he made it clear that the Fed could not simply conjure up a recovery by manipulating interest rates and the money supply.
''Central bankers alone cannot solve the world's economic problems,'' Mr. Bernanke said in what became a theme of the annual Fed policy symposium here, organized by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. 
Mr. Bernanke has told Congress that some additional fiscal stimulus could be helpful in supporting the recovery, as long as it was accompanied by a credible plan to gradually bring deficits under control and stabilize the ratio of debt to gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic output.
He has not weighed in on specifics -- like the Obama administration's proposal to spur lending to small businesses, or the call by some Republicans to extend all of the Bush-era tax cuts -- but has instead expressed hope that a bipartisan fiscal commission appointed by Mr. Obama will deliver specific and meaningful proposals.
But the commission is not scheduled to deliver its report until December, and the likelihood of additional Congressional action to support the economy before the midterm elections in November seems to be shrinking by the day.
So even as Mr. Bernanke outlined the Fed's options and credited stimulus packages with helping the global recovery, he appeared to be tamping down expectations for a government-led fix. ''For a sustained expansion to take hold, growth in private final demand -- notably, consumer spending and business fixed investment -- must ultimately take the lead,'' he said.
He added, optimistically, ''On the whole, in the United States, that critical handoff appears to be under way.''
Mr. Bernanke's reluctance to weigh in on fiscal policy -- a departure from his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, who endorsed the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 but now supports letting all of them expire -- is partly a reflection of his personality but also stems from the Fed's delicate political position.
''The Fed has in many ways been left holding the bag while fiscal policy has fallen short,'' said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan group that has urged an immediate commitment to reduce the deficit in the medium term. ''There is excessive pressure on the Fed, because of the uncertainty about fiscal policy.''
Thomas D. Gallagher, a senior managing director at the research firm International Strategy and Investment, said it was wise of Mr. Bernanke to lay out the potential costs of additional actions the Fed could take, like resuming large-scale purchases of government debt.
''None of them is an unambiguously positive, no-brainer option,'' he said. ''The Fed should try to limit expectations about how much monetary policy can accomplish in this post-crisis period.''
In one of five research papers delivered at the symposium, which ended Saturday, Eric M. Leeper, an economist at Indiana University, challenged monetary economists to focus more attention on large fiscal deficits. In an analogy that stirred debate, he said that monetary policy had been honed to a science, and he likened fiscal policy to medieval alchemy.
''In normal times, fiscal policy doesn't pose insurmountable problems for monetary policy,'' said Mr. Leeper, a former Fed researcher. ''These normal times may be coming to an end. Demographic shifts in most of the advanced economies are putting ever-increasing demands on government spending. We're heading toward an era of fiscal stress.''
Public confidence in the Fed's ability to maintain price stability relies in part on expectations that government debts will not rise to unsustainable levels, Mr. Leeper said, suggesting that such expectations were eroding.
Douglas W. Elmendorf, director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and a former Fed researcher, said Mr. Leeper's paper ''greatly overstates the potential for fiscal policy to be made in a scientific way.''
''Fiscal policy is intrinsically about distributional choices,'' he said, adding, ''There is no scientific basis for saying how large the government deficit should be -- any more than what my level of savings should be.''
Robert B. Zoellick, president of the World Bank, said that while the scientific precision of monetary policy had perhaps been overstated, he wished that Mr. Bernanke had mentioned the role fiscal policy could play in spurring the recovery. ''The fiscal policy challenges that I see are at a different order of magnitude than anything I have either observed or dealt with over the last 25 years,'' he said.
Not all countries leave every debt and deficit question to politicians: Sweden and Hungary use fiscal policy councils, while Israel and Chile use fiscal rules that cap growth in government spending. ''Things like the White House budget commission are just alchemy as usual,'' Mr. Leeper said.
Another paper that drew considerable discussion here, presented by Charles R. Bean, deputy governor of the Bank of England, suggested that asset purchases to lower long-term interest rates -- like the Fed's purchase of $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities in 2009-10 -- have been successful in responding to the recession but ''are probably best kept in the locker marked 'For emergency use only.' ''
Mr. Bean, like Mr. Bernanke, argued forcefully against the idea of raising medium-term inflation targets in response to recession.
''The thing I'm most worried about with some of the current discussion is that monetary policy is going to be asked to do more than it's capable of,'' he said. ''It's useful for stabilizing prices, but if we expect it do multiple things simultaneously, I think we are going to be stirring up trouble for ourselves in the future.''
Or as Jacob A. Frenkel, chairman of JPMorgan Chase International and a former governor of the Bank of Israel, put it: ''We all know that the main gorilla in the room is fiscal policy.''

HEADLINE: China Fortifies State Businesses To Fuel Growth

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES; Li Bibo contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- During its decades of rapid growth, China thrived by allowing once-suppressed private entrepreneurs to prosper, often at the expense of the old, inefficient state sector of the economy.
Now, whether in the coal-rich regions of Shanxi Province, the steel mills of the northern industrial heartland, or the airlines flying overhead, it is often China's state-run companies that are on the march.
As the Chinese government has grown richer -- and more worried about sustaining its high-octane growth -- it has pumped public money into companies that it expects to upgrade the industrial base and employ more people. The beneficiaries are state-owned interests that many analysts had assumed would gradually wither away in the face of private-sector competition.
New data from the World Bank show that the proportion of industrial production by companies controlled by the Chinese state edged up last year, checking a slow but seemingly inevitable eclipse. Moreover, investment by state-controlled companies skyrocketed, driven by hundreds of billions of dollars of government spending and state bank lending to combat the global financial crisis. 
They join a string of other signals that are fueling discussion among analysts about whether China, which calls itself socialist but is often thought of in the West as brutally capitalist, is in fact seeking to enhance government control over some parts of the economy.
The distinction may matter more today than it once did. China surpassed Japan to become the world's second-largest economy this year, and its state-directed development model is enormously appealing to poor countries. Even in the West, many admire China's ability to build a first-world infrastructure and transform its cities into showpieces.
Once eager to learn from the United States, China's leaders during the financial crisis have reaffirmed their faith in their own more statist approach to economic management, in which private capitalism plays only a supporting role.
''The socialist system's advantages,'' Prime Minister Wen Jiabaosaid in a March address, ''enable us to make decisions efficiently, organize effectively and concentrate resources to accomplish large undertakings.''
State vs. Private
The issue of state versus private control is a slippery one in China. After decades of economic reform, many big state-owned companies face real competition and are expected to operate profitably. The biggest private companies often get their financing from state banks, coordinate their investments with the government and seat their chief executives on government advisory panels.
Chinese leaders also no longer publicly emphasize sharp ideological distinctions about ownership. But they never relaxed state control over some sectors considered strategically vital, including finance, defense, energy, telecommunications, railways and ports.
Mr. Wen and President Hu Jintao are also seen as less attuned to the interests of foreign investors and China's own private sector than the earlier generation of leaders who pioneered economic reforms. They prefer to enhance the clout and economic reach of state-backed companies at the top of the pecking order.
''China's always had a major industrial policy. But for a space of a few years, it looked like China was turning away from an active and interventionist industrial policy in favor of a more hands-off approach,'' Victor Shih, a Northwestern University political scientist, said in a recent telephone interview.
Mr. Shih, among others, now believes that the 1980s reforms that unleashed China's private sector and the 1990s reforms that dismantled great sections of the state-run sector are being partly undone.
''The problem is that the reforms of the first 20 years, from 1978 to the end of the '90s, actually did not touch on the power of the government,'' said Yao Yang, a Peking University professor who heads the China Center for Economic Research. ''So after the other reforms were finished, you actually find the government is expanding, because there is no check and balance on its power.''
Divining Government's Role
There are no comprehensive statistics to catalog the government's influence over the economy. So the shift is partly inferred from coarse measures like the share of financing in the economy provided by state banks, which rose sharply during the financial crisis, or the list of the 100 largest publicly listed Chinese companies, all but one of which are majority state owned.
The statistic showing an uptick in the share of industrial production attributable to the state sector is regarded by some analysts as a blip rather than the start of a trend. The World Bank's senior economist in Beijing, Louis Kuijs, said the state sector's unusually rapid growth will most likely moderate with the ending of the government's stimulus spending.
''As the growth process normalizes again, the traditional trend toward a declining SOE share will take over again,'' he wrote in an e-mail message, using the shorthand for state-owned enterprise. ''I don't think that the senior leaders had a strategy of reversing this trend.''
But others argue that officials had always intended to create a vibrant state sector that would tower above the private sector in important industries, even as they sold off or shut down money-losing state enterprises that drained capital from the government budget and banking system.
Recent alarm over the expanding role of the state, said Arthur Kroeber of Dragonomics, an economic forecasting firm based in Beijing, is mostly ''perception catching up with reality.''
In some ways, the differences in this debate are small. Everyone agrees that China runs a bifurcated economy: at one level, a robust and competitive private sector dominates industries like factory-assembled exports, clothing and food. And at higher levels like finance, communications, transportation, mining and metals -- the so-called commanding heights -- the central government claims majority ownership and a measure of management control.
Yet the two camps' view of China's future are markedly different. Those who see little evidence of an expanding state sector generally believe that China has a decade or more of robust growth awaiting it before its economy matures. Theirs is a Goldilocks view of state intervention -- not too much or too little, but just enough to push a developing economy toward prosperity.
The skeptics have a darker view: they believe distortions and waste, in no small part due to government meddling, have resulted in gross misallocation of capital and will end up pushing growth rates down well before 2020. What drives their pessimism, the skeptics say, is that China, like Japan a generation ago, has too much confidence in a top-down economic strategy that defies conventional Western theory.
The skeptics also point to what they say is the growing political and financial influence of China's state-owned giants -- 129 huge conglomerates that answer directly to the central government, and thousands of smaller ones run by the provinces and cities.
While no public breakdown exists, most experts say the vast bulk of the 4 trillion renminbi ($588 billion) stimulus package that China pumped out for new highways, railroads and other big projects went to state-owned companies. Some of the largest companies used the flood of money to strengthen their dominance in their current markets or to enter new ones.
In the last year or so, many of the 129 central government companies have moved forcefully into China's real-estate industry, with hundreds of billions of dollars in construction projects and land deals. State-owned steel giants have cut deals to buy out more profitable and often more efficient private competitors. A host of government conglomerates have snapped up coal mining companies in Shanxi Province.
''In 2009, there was a huge expansion of the government role in the corporate sector,'' Huang Yasheng, a leading analyst of China-style capitalism at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in a telephone interview. ''They're producing yogurt. They're into real estate. Some of the upstream state-owned enterprises are now expanding downstream, organizing themselves as vertical units. They're just operating on a much larger scale.''
Local Interests
At the local level, governments set up 8,000 state-owned investment companies in 2009 alone to channel government dollars into business and industrial ventures, Mr. Huang said. One example suffices: a private Chinese automaker, Zhejiang Geely Holding Group, made worldwide headlines in March when it agreed to buy Sweden's Volvo marque from Ford. Much of the $1.5 billion purchase price came not from Geely's relatively modest profits, but from local governments in northeast China and the Shanghai area.
Geely reciprocated this month, announcing that it will build its Volvo headquarters and an assembly plant in a Shanghai industrial district.
The reasons for the state's push for greater involvement in business vary. State control of energy supplies is crucial to China's growth, and the Shanxi coal takeovers will increase production, guarantee fuel to some state-owned utilities and give Beijing new power to control coal prices. State mining companies also argue that they have a superior safety record to their accident-prone private competitors.
But in other areas the state looks more mercenary.
Take telecommunications. Upon joining the World Trade Organization, China committed itself to opening its communications market to foreign joint ventures for local and international phone service, e-mail, paging and other businesses. But after eight years, no licenses have been granted -- largely, the United States says, because capital requirements, regulatory hurdles and other barriers have made such ventures impractical. Today, basic telecommunications in China are booming, and are virtually 100 percent state-controlled.
Take the passenger airline industry. Six years ago, the central government invited private investors to enter the business. By 2006, eight private carriers had sprung up to challenge the three state-controlled majors, Air China, China Southern and China Eastern.
The state airlines immediately began a price war. The state-owned monopoly that provided jet fuel refused to service private carriers on the same generous terms given the big three. China's only computerized reservation system -- currently one-third owned by the three state airlines -- refused to book flights for private competitors. And when mismanagement and the 2008 economic crisis drove the three majors into financial straits, the central government bought stock to bail them out: about $1 billion for China Eastern; $430 million for China Southern; $220 million for Air China.
One private passenger carrier that remains is Spring Airlines, a tenacious startup run by a founder so frugal that he shares a 100-square-foot office with his chief executive and takes the subway to business meetings.
That founder, Wang Zhenghua, survived in part by building his own computer reservation system. He canceled a planned interview. But in Chinese news reports, he was caustic about the state subsidies given his competitors. ''Now with the injection of 10 billion yuan'' for China Eastern and China Southern, ''everything is in chaos,'' he told Biz Review, a Chinese magazine.
China's private entrepreneurs have a catchphrase for such maneuvers: ''guo jin, min tui,'' or ''the state advances, the private sector retreats.''
State-owned enterprises in China have taken the best of the economy for themselves, ''leaving the private sector drinking the soup while the state enterprises are eating the meat,'' Cai Hua, the vice director of a chamber-of-commerce-style organization in Zhejiang Province, said in an interview.
First in Line
Mr. Cai says he believes that China needs government-run industries to compete globally and manage the country's domestic development. But locally, he said, their advantages -- being first in line for financing by state banks, first in line for state bailouts when they get in trouble, first in line for the stimulus gusher -- have created a ''profound inequality'' with private competitors.
Some analysts argue that the state-owned conglomerates, built with state money and favors into global competitors, have now become political power centers in their own right, able to fend off even Beijing's efforts to rein them in.
Of the 129 major state enterprises, more than half the chairmen and chairwomen and more than one-third of the chief executive officers were appointed by the central organization department of the Communist Party. A score or more serve on the party's Central Committee, which elects the ruling Politburo. They control not just the lifeblood of China's economy, but a corporate patronage system that dispenses top-paying executive jobs to relatives of the party's leading lights.
China's leaders have sought occasionally in the past year to curb speculative excesses by state-controlled businesses in real estate, lending and other areas. In May the State Council, a top-level policy body sometimes likened to the cabinet in the United States, issued orders to give private companies a better shot at government contracts -- for roads and bridges, finance and even military work -- that now go almost exclusively to state-owned companies. Virtually the same rules were issued five years ago, to little effect.
Yet it is hard to argue with success, other economists say, and China's success speaks well of its top-down strategy. Asian powerhouses like South Korea and Japan built their modern economies with strong state help. Many economists agree that shrewd state management can be better than market forces in getting a developing nation on its feet.
Experts on both sides of the debate have but two questions. One is how much longer state control of vast areas of the economy will generate that growth.
The other is whether, should that strategy stop working, China will be able to change it.

HEADLINE: Japan Takes Steps to Lift Its Faltering Economy

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Japan's central bank announced new measures to combat a faltering economy and rising yen on Monday, but held off from bolder steps, while the government said it would unveil a fresh stimulus plan. 
Separately, Prime Minister Naoto Kan suggested that the government would outline a new stimulus plan later in the day to shore up the country's economy. Analysts expected the scale of any new spending to be modest, constrained by already colossal levels of Japan's public debt.
Anticipation of the moves sent Japan's Nikkei index rising more than 3 percent, but after the monetary easing was announced, stocks started surrendering some of those gains, with the index up less than 2 percent by midday.
The global economic crisis led export-reliant Japan to its worst recession in decades, and the country's recovery since then has looked increasingly shaky. Figures released this month showed that Japan's economy grew just 0.1 percent in the April-June quarter.
A jump in the value of the yen to 15-year highs has hampered the country's exporters, who are responsible for much of Japan's economic growth, by making their products less competitive.
After an emergency meeting, the Bank of Japan announced that it would expand the volume of money available to banks under a special fixed rate to 30 trillion yen ($351 billion) from 20 trillion yen. It also introduced a six-month loan facility on top of a three-month program already in place. The bank's board voted to leave its main overnight target rate at 0.1 percent.
While the markets were skeptical that the steps would be enough, they have raised investor hopes that the government will be more aggressive. Years of economic stagnation in Japan have sapped demand for fresh loans from companies and consumers, despite rock-bottom interest rates.
Apart from easing the yen's rise, these measures are intended to help Japan's economy by increasing the supply of money in the financial system and encouraging banks to boost lending.
Some analysts expect the bank to ease monetary policy even further.
''In our view, this will not be the last easing. If the economic outlook and market conditions get worse, the BOJ will likely announce some additional easing measures,'' Masaaki Kanno, economist at JPMorgan Securities Japan, said in a note to clients Monday morning.
Mr. Kan may also give hints as to whether Japan will intervene in international currency markets directly to help weaken the yen.
Such a move could cap the yen's rise in the short term, intervention by Japan alone is not expected to do much to weaken the currency in the longer term especially because Tokyo is unlikely to find much support from other big currency players like the United States or European Union, both of which are quite happy for Japanese exports to stay uncompetitive.
''The BoJ's additional loosening alone may not be sufficient to reverse the market's trend, but it could make it easier for the Japanese market to ride the waves of a global market recovery,'' said Takuji Aida, Tokyo-based economist at UBS.

HEADLINE: Powell vs. Rangel: Testy Remake After 40 Years

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
About 30 years ago, Representative Charles B. Rangel invited a 19-year-old summer intern named Adam Clayton Powell IV into his office at the United States Capitol for an emotional conversation: He had run a bruising primary campaign in 1970 to unseat Mr. Powell's father, he acknowledged, ending the career of a celebrated Harlem politician.
But that bitter past, he said, did not have to poison their relationship. Mr. Rangel pledged to take Mr. Powell under his wing, and to introduce him to the titans of the House, like Dan Rostenkowski and Harold E. Ford Sr.
''He was trying to excuse, or apologize -- that is the better word -- to apologize for taking my dad out,'' Mr. Powell recalled. 
These days, it is the younger Adam Clayton Powell who is trying to take Mr. Rangel out. And he is making no apologies.
He has emerged as the most pugnacious challenger in the Democratic primary Sept. 14, relentlessly attacking the 80-year-old lawmaker: He has called Mr. Rangel's conduct ''corrupt,'' described his bid for a 21st term as ''pointless'' and said that if his father had witnessed Mr. Rangel's career, he ''would be turning over in his grave.''
In a year in which little has seemed to rattle Mr. Rangel, who faces 13 charges of ethics violations and a public trial in the House, the son of his predecessor has clearly unnerved him.
After blithely ignoring his six rivals for the last year, or tersely dismissing them as unqualified, Mr. Rangel has started to take unexpected jabs at Mr. Powell, 48, a five-term member of the New York State Assembly whose past brushes with the law provide plenty of ammunition.
During a recent debate, Mr. Rangel replied to a standard question about environmental policy with a pungent, off-topic critique of Mr. Powell's attendance record in the Assembly. He has encouraged reporters to study each candidate's criminal record, an obvious reference to Mr. Powell's conviction for driving while impaired in 2008. And he has conspicuously praised a lesser-known challenger, Vincent Scott Morgan, who has refrained from criticizing Mr. Rangel.
The attacks, however, have only raised Mr. Powell's profile in a contest awash with personal history and deep-rooted family rivalries. Mr. Rangel has held his seat for 40 years, but the streets of Harlem still echo with the name of Mr. Powell's father -- so much so that Mr. Powell and Mr. Rangel found themselves shaking hands last week inside the Adam Clayton Powell Jr. State Office Building high above Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard.
The younger Mr. Powell's relationship with his father is little understood. He knew his father, a pastor, a civil rights leader and the first black to be elected to Congress from New York, mostly through the letters he received as a young boy, which his mother read aloud to him.
He was 9 and living in Puerto Rico with his mother when his father died in 1972. Upon returning to the city for the funeral at the Abyssinian Baptist Church, he discovered that his father was something of a god in Harlem: Thousands of people stood outside the church, wiping away tears. ''Even men,'' he recalled. ''Older men.''
''It was eye-opening,'' he said.
He became a student of his father's career, which includes striking parallels to Mr. Rangel's. Though they came from different roots, Mr. Powell's father from middle to upper middle class, Mr. Rangel from working-class-- both rose to dominate Harlem politics, faced allegations of financial misconduct, came under intense pressure to resign and sought re-election anyway.
But Mr. Powell sees his father's essence as starkly different from Mr. Rangel's. ''My dad fought the system his whole career,'' he said. ''Charles Rangel became part of the system. He embraces the political trade and the political games, and he rejoices in the backslapping and connections.''
The younger Mr. Powell has borrowed his father's brash and impatient style, at times to his detriment. He repeatedly ran without the customary endorsements of elected officials or the support of his party. The experience intensified his alienation from the city's Democratic machine and his anger at its leaders, especially Mr. Rangel.
Each time he sought the congressman's support, Mr. Powell said, he was rebuffed.
''Ever since I came here, he has felt threatened,'' he said in an interview. ''And by him, by definition, I mean everybody that is part of that political establishment has felt threatened by me. And for good reason. I bring a legacy.''
Mr. Powell cultivated a loyal base of voters that he felt Mr. Rangel, the darling of Central and West Harlem, had overlooked: the Puerto Rican and Hispanic voters in the district's eastern section.
In 1994, at age 32, Mr. Powell announced a bid for Congress against Mr. Rangel. Infuriated, the congressman's allies tried to dissuade him. At one point, Jesse Jackson summoned Mr. Powell to a New York hotel room. ''You can't run against Charlie,'' Mr. Powell recalled his saying.
Mr. Powell did anyway, losing by nearly two to one.
Six years later, he was elected to the Assembly, where he developed what seemed like two entirely different reputations: one, in his district, for aggressive advocacy on behalf of constituents, especially those facing eviction; the other, in Albany, for a remarkable disengagement from the lawmaking process.
Over the last five years, he has not introduced a single bill, according to a legislative database. He disputed that figure, though he seemed fuzzy on the details. ''I passed one this year, or maybe last year. But within the last term, certainly,'' he said.
He said he had chosen his battles carefully: He recalled sponsoring a bill that exempts many elderly people from paying rent increases. ''In the type of district I represent, people have bigger concerns than what kind of bird will be the official bird for New York,'' he said.
Mr. Powell's personal life has become as well known as his political one, and has complicated his portrayal of Mr. Rangel as unscrupulous and tainted.
He was twice accused of rape, once by a 19-year-old Assembly intern who later recanted her claim. No charges were ever filed in either case.
Mr. Powell conceded that the relationship with the intern was ''inappropriate,'' but added that ''inappropriateness is a lot of things.'' He welcomes comparisons with Mr. Rangel. ''If the worst I have is a violation because somebody thinks I had one too many, I will take it,'' he said of his conviction for driving while impaired.
His bigger problem may be money. The campaign has about $20,000, compared with $500,000 for Mr. Rangel. His Assembly colleagues have largely declined to endorse him.
But that has not diminished his swagger. Mr. Powell tartly wrote off his Democratic opponents. ''He was probably throwing darts,'' he said of Jonathan Tasini, a labor activist. ''The dart landed in Northern Manhattan, so he decided to run there.''
Of the argument that Mr. Rangel has done much that is positive, he said: ''Just about every inmate at Rikers Island has done some good in their life. He has been there for 40 years; of course he has done some good.''
And he declared that, at 62, Joyce S. Johnson ''should be planning her own retirement, not Charlie Rangel's retirement.''
He predicts a decisive victory on Sept. 14. After he left a candidates' forum last week, Mr. Powell introduced himself to three women on the sidewalk. Each urged him on.
''Keep it in the family,'' said one of them. ''It's time for a change,'' said another. ''What goes around comes around,'' the third said, referring to Mr. Rangel's defeat of Mr. Powell's father.
At that, Mr. Powell drove off down a street that bears his and his father's name.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about the history of the relationship between Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York and Adam Clayton Powell IV, his most vocal opponent in the Sept. 14 Democratic primary, misstated the economic status of Mr. Powell's father. He came from middle to upper middle class roots -- not from working class -- the younger Mr. Powell confirmed.

HEADLINE: In California, the New Orange County Is No Longer Nixon Country

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY; Kitty Bennett contributed research.

 BODY:
SANTA ANA, Calif. -- Orange County has been a national symbol of conservatism for more than 50 years: birthplace of President Richard M. Nixon and home to John Wayne, a bastion for the John Birch Society, a land of orange groves and affluence, the region of California where Republican presidential candidates could always count on a friendly audience.
But this iconic county of 3.1 million people passed something of a milestone in June. The percentage of registered Republican voters dropped to 43 percent, the lowest level in 70 years.
It was the latest sign of the demographic, ethnic and political changes that are transforming the county and challenging long-held views of a region whose colorful -- its detractors might suggest zany -- reputation extends well beyond the borders of this state. 
At the end of 2009, nearly 45 percent of the county's residents spoke a language other than English at home, according to county officials. Whites now make up only 45 percent of the population; this county is teeming with Hispanics, as well as Vietnamese, Korean and Chinese families. Its percentage of foreign-born residents jumped to 30 percent in 2008 from 6 percent in 1970, and visits to some of its corners can feel like a trip to a foreign land.
The demographic changes that have swept the county reflect what is happening across the state and much of the nation. It has happened slowly but surely over the course of a generation, becoming increasingly apparent not only in a drive through the 34 cities that fill this sprawling 789-square-mile county south of Los Angeles, but also, most recently, in the results of a presidential election. In 2008, Barack Obama drew 48 percent of the vote here against Senator John McCain of Arizona. (By comparison, in 1980, Jimmy Carter received just 23 percent against Ronald Reagan, the conservative hero whose election as California governor in 1966 and 1970 was boosted in no small part by the affection for him here.)
''I was a city planner in San Diego in 1960 when Orange County was just orange groves and typecast as a conservative stronghold,'' said Marshall Kaplan, the executive director of the Merage Foundations, which runs educational and other programs for recent immigrants here. ''It isn't anymore. I live in Irvine. My wife is Asian. In Irvine, I sometimes feel like I'm her affirmative action program.''
Manuel Gomez, the vice chancellor of student affairs at the University of California, Irvine, said the county where he was born 63 years ago is almost unrecognizable to him today. ''With diversity comes more cultural voices and political voices,'' he said. ''And certainly better food.''
Orange County is not unique in being a reliable Republican region in California. But this county has always boasted of a zesty political brand: almost defiantly conservative, the anti-Los Angeles, a land of gated communities and great wealth that managed to produce a steady stream of colorful conservative figures, including the televangelist Robert H. Schuller and former Representative Robert K. Dornan -- B-1 Bob, as he was known, for his advocacy of military projects. (In a sign of what was to come, Mr. Dornan lost the House seat in 1996 to a Democratic Latina, Loretta Sanchez).
With such world-famous attractions as Disneyland and Mr. Schuller's Crystal Cathedral and enclaves like Laguna Beach and Balboa Island, Orange County is as much a symbol in California as it is nationally.
Indeed, to some measure, the extent of the county's transformation may seem magnified simply because of the way people thought of it in the past. ''The new Orange County is not a repudiation of the old,'' said Kevin Starr, a California historian. ''For all the attention paid the right-wingers there, they never really took up the whole place. They were just more mediagenic than everyone else.''
Still, by any measure, this is no longer Nixon's Orange County.
Here in Santa Ana, a sign on a downtown furniture store the other day advertised a sale in Spanish only; nearly 95 percent of the enrollment in the public schools is Latino. The mayor of Irvine, Sukhee Kang, was born in Korea, making him the first Korean-American to run a major American city. ''We have 35 languages spoken in our city,'' Mr. Kang said.
A few miles away in Westminster -- where Vietnamese immigrants began arriving about 30 years ago, earning the area the name Little Saigon -- is a dazzling sea of Vietnamese characters on storefronts and billboards (including one for McDonald's). ''I've been here for 30 years,'' said Kinh Tram, 59, as he sat in front of a two-story mall that was crowded with other Vietnamese immigrants. ''When I first came here, most of these were open lots.''
There are pockets of deep poverty spread across a county long identified with suburban affluence and escape from urban Los Angeles. About 25 percent of residents here did not have health insurance at some point during 2009, according to a report released last week by the U.C.L.A. Center for Health Policy Research. Less than a mile from the entrance to Disneyland is a Latino enclave of low-income housing where trucks arrive every morning, with names like Yucatan Produce, to sell groceries and household goods to people who cannot afford a car to drive to the store.
Orange remains a Republican county, at least relatively: an influx of immigrants certainly does not equate to automatic Democratic gains, here or anywhere else across the country. Many Vietnamese immigrants are socially conservative and run for office as Republicans. Until the increased identification of the Republican Party with tough measures on immigration in recent years, Latino voters were also clearly in play for Republicans. Most elected officials in Orange County are Republicans.
But the political texture of this county, which is larger in population than Nevada or Iowa, is changing, and many officials say it is only a matter of time before many Republican officeholders get swept out with the tide.
While Republicans have been on a steady decline -- in 1990, they made up 56 percent of the electorate -- the percentage of independent voters, as in much of the state, soared to 20 percent this past June from 8.6 percent in 1990. President Obama's strong showing here in 2008 continued a nearly 30-year pattern in which the vote for Democratic presidential candidates has steadily increased.
Mr. Tram, the Vietnamese immigrant in Westminster, said that he had voted for Mr. Obama and that he thought most of his Vietnamese friends had done the same. ''The Republicans are for rich people,'' he said.
A large reason for this transformation is immigration. But the changes also reflect how the regional economy has changed, with the shrinking of the aerospace industry, which supported the once dominant, mostly white middle-class community here. That has largely been taken over by service, tourism and high-tech jobs, the result being that this county is a contrast of the extremely wealthy and the lower middle class.
''It's less of a middle-class suburb today,'' said Michael M. Ruane, the director of the Orange County Community Indicators Project, which studies economic and demographic trends in the county. ''You have areas of poverty and areas of great affluence and less of a middle.''
Even fans of the recent hit television series ''The O.C.,'' whose main characters were prosperous white residents of Newport Beach, got little hint of the diversity of the region. ''The county is becoming more like California,'' Mr. Ruane said. ''The national image that it is an entirely conservative and entirely Republican county is wrong. Voter registration patterns and voting have shifted as a result of these demographic shifts.''

HEADLINE: Progress Will Continue, Obama Tells New Orleans

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
NEW ORLEANS -- President Obama on Sunday sought to assure this city, battered by two catastrophic disasters in five years, that federal efforts to rebuild after Hurricane Katrina would not waver even as the city struggles with the aftermath of the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
Speaking at Xavier University on the fifth anniversary of the hurricane that took 1,800 lives, Mr. Obama emphasized the resilience of New Orleans residents. 
The legacy of Katrina, Mr. Obama said, must be ''not one of neglect, but of action; not one of indifference, but of empathy; not of abandonment, but of a community working together to meet shared challenges.''
''There are some wounds that do not heal,'' the president acknowledged. ''There are some losses that cannot be repaid. And for many who lived through those harrowing days five years ago, there is a searing memory that time will not erase.''
Mr. Obama's trip to the gulf was his second in two weeks. The visits book-ended his family's 10-day vacation on Martha's Vineyard and served as a stark reminder of the challenges facing his presidency as Congressional Democrats and Republicans prepare for the midterm elections in November.
The excruciatingly slow effort to plug the BP oil spill -- finally accomplished in July after 87 days -- brought the president to the gulf numerous times in recent months as he sought to avoid the pitfalls that dogged the Bush administration's response to Hurricane Katrina.
Arne Duncan, the education secretary, announced Saturday on the White House blog a plan to award $1.8 billion to rebuild New Orleans schools.
And Shaun Donovan, the housing secretary, said Sunday on ''State of the Union'' on CNN that the Obama administration had made progress in the past 18 months in returning families to their homes. Mr. Donovan said that 40,000 families were in trailers or on emergency housing vouchers when Mr. Obama took office, and that now ''98 percent of those families are in permanent housing.''
The city's unemployment rate is 8.2 percent, compared with 9.5 percent nationally, but many of the jobs are in reconstruction. The unemployment rate dipped to 7.4 percent last year before creeping back up as the oil spill shuttered businesses and stalled livelihoods.
In an interview on Sunday with ''NBC Nightly News,'' Mr. Obama acknowledged the economic and other difficulties in New Orleans and throughout the entire Gulf Coast region, though he said there had been ''steady progress.''
He added: ''We've still got a long way to go. And part of the reason that I wanted to come down here today, to mark the fifth anniversary, was just to send a message to the people of New Orleans, but also the entire Gulf Coast.''
The region was ''hit pretty good over the last several years,'' he said. ''And all of America, not just people here, not just folks in the White House, but all of America, remains concerned and remains committed to their rebuilding.''
Most of the signs held by protesters who braved rain and wind to await Mr. Obama's arrival at Xavier on Sunday referred to the oil spill, which has been blamed for a drop in tourism, one of the city's mainstays. The spill also hurt the commercial fishing industry along the Gulf Coast and damaged fragile wetlands and wildlife sanctuaries.
But many local officials have criticized Mr. Obama's decision to impose a moratorium on deepwater offshore oil drilling. That moratorium is set to expire on Nov. 30.
Mr. Obama tacitly acknowledged that politicians could no longer talk about the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina without including the aftermath of the oil spill. Much of his speech at Xavier was devoted to the spill and what his administration had been trying to do to limit the fallout.
''From the start, I promised you two things,'' Mr. Obama said. ''One is that we would see to it that the leak was stopped. And it has been. The second promise I made was that we would stick with our efforts, and stay on BP, until the damage to the gulf and to the lives of the people in this region was reversed. And this, too, is a promise that we will keep.''
Mr. Obama brought his family along to New Orleans on Sunday. Shortly after Air Force One touched down, the first family stopped for lunch at the Parkway Bakery and Tavern. Mr. Obama mingled with diners, and he and Mrs. Obama shook hands and took photos.
''We're still here, and we're just going to keep on building,'' Mr. Obama said. ''We're going to keep on working, all right?''
As he worked the room, a voice over the loudspeaker boomed, ''Barack, pick up,'' signaling that the family's lunch order was ready.

HEADLINE: To Win Job, Met Has to Lose Beard

BYLINE: By DAVID WALDSTEIN and HARVEY ARATON

 BODY:
R. A. Dickey of the Mets still wants to be a ball man at the 2011 United States Open, but a fuzzy obstacle has been thrown in his way. It's not that Dickey is a major league knuckleball pitcher and his tosses might create havoc on the court, and it's not that he will be 36 next year.
It's his beard. The Open would love to have Dickey serve as a ball man, but the whiskers would have to go. Open ball boys and men are not allowed to have facial hair, according to Tina Taps, the Open's director of ball persons. 
When reached in Atlanta, Dickey was asked if he would be willing to shave for the opportunity to crouch by a net and retrieve Nikolay Davydenko's misses. He was unsure.
''I would prefer that they embrace me with beard,'' he said in a text message. ''Especially for $7.75 an hour.''
Indeed, Dickey (9-5) has been so good for the Mets, why would he change anything? When told that Dickey is rather fond of the fuzz, Taps would not rule out the possibility of a one-time whisker waiver.
''Why don't we cross that bridge when we come to it?'' she suggested.
A DAY FULL OF ELENAS There are six players in the women's draw with some form of the name Elena, including Elena Dementieva, Elena Baltacha, Maria Elena Camerin, Elena Vesnina, Jelena Kostanic Tosic and Jelena Jankovic.
The first five on that list played Monday, and the first three won, including Dementieva of Russia, the No. 12 seed, who could face Baltacha in the quarterfinals. Jankovic, from Serbia, is the highest seed in the group, No. 4, and is scheduled to play Tuesday against Simona Halep.
BLAKE FAMILY STORY The book on James Blake has been that he is a class act. His mother, Betty, decided to write it.
On opening day at the United States Open, Betty Blake autographed copies of the newly released ''Mix It Up, Make It Nice: Secrets of a Tennis Mom'' (Fay Publishing), with her other son, Thomas, alongside her. It's a family story more than a tennis tale, she said, written in large part in homage to her husband, Tom, who died in 2004.
''It was a chance to write about him, remember all the good times, and how my husband did such a good job of raising our boys to respect everybody,'' she said. ''And then it evolved into advice for tennis moms. I've been out there; I've seen the pressures that young players are under today.''
Not a young player anymore, his days as a Grand Slam contender probably gone, James Blake will turn 31 in December. His ranking has plummeted from a high of No. 4 to 108 -- that puts him behind fellow Americans like Michael Russell (80) and Donald Young (100).
''It's because of injuries and from trying to come back too soon,'' Betty Blake said. ''He doesn't talk about it. His father used to tell him, 'If you've got a problem, it's your problem.' ''
Mothers are exempt from the rule against legitimate excuses. ''You name it, he has it -- the shoulder, the back, the knee,'' Betty Blake said.
Given his advanced age and long climb back, Blake may be in the stretch run of a career that was -- to the family -- nothing to complain about.
''When he left Harvard, it was sort of an experiment,'' Betty Blake said. ''It turned out much better than we expected. He could have gone back anytime -- he knew that -- so he was never under the pressure many of these kids are.''
She says she thinks her son will return to Harvard for his last two years and suspects he will switch from a course of study in economics to one of the social sciences. ''This isn't written in stone, obviously, but I think he is in a good place to help people,'' she said. ''He's got the rest of his life ahead of him.''
The part up to now is covered in the book. HARVEY ARATON

HEADLINE: Casting Aside Icon Brings Browns No Honor

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Mike Holmgren has made his first major blunder as the president of the Cleveland Browns: he cut the great Jim Brown.
Holmgren was named the Browns' president in January, and at some point during the off-season, he quietly stripped Brown of his long-held position as executive adviser for the Browns, the team for which he played for nine years.
The subject of Brown's eliminated executive role came up last week when Holmgren announced that the Browns, in an effort to put themselves back together, were holding a Ring of Honor ceremony on Sept. 19. 
Brown announced through his wife, Monique, that because of a scheduling conflict, he would not be attending.
Holmgren played down any idea of a rift, and the Browns are bending over backward to let Brown -- and the world -- know that they are not kicking the N.F.L.'s greatest player to the curb.
''Change took place with a lot of people,'' Holmgren said. ''That happens.'' Holmgren is right. Things do change. New executives eager to put their signature on an organization initiate change. They often barrel in and replace the person most identified with the old regime or, in this case, with the franchise.
Who else in the Browns' organization has Jim Brown's stature? Eric Mangini?
Brown, 74, is an American icon and a pro football icon. Generations who never heard of Holmgren know Brown. He is the N.F.L.'s living Babe Ruth.
Brown's influence goes beyond football.
In 1967, Brown convened a meeting of a group of well-known African-American athletes -- including Bill Russell and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar -- to support Muhammad Ali's decision not to enter the Army.
Richard Pryor used Brown as the basis for a classic comedy routine about Brown's trying to help Pryor kick his cocaine addiction.
Brown formed the Black Economic Union in an attempt to harness the power of black athletes and the black business community.
And the Browns want to take away his title with the team.
Why, other than executing a needless power play? Why not allow Brown to keep the executive title and reduce his compensation?
Probably because compensation is not the issue. The issue is the appearance of power. Why else would the Browns offer to keep Brown on the payroll but take away his executive status and title?
It's as if Holmgren is telling Brown: ''We can't have you walking around here simulating power and control. I'm in charge. I'm the man.''
On Sunday, a Browns official earnestly explained that the Browns wanted Jim Brown to be part of the family. Just not in an official capacity.
Holmgren said during the news conference announcing the Ring of Honor that ''the importance of Jim Brown to the Browns and this community, none of that changed.''
But it has. The legendary Jim Brown has no official executive standing. He has been cut. So too, has the team's financing of Brown's Amer-I-Can Program. Brown founded Amer-I-Can in 1988 to work in inner cities and prisons with young people caught up in the gang scene in Los Angeles and Cleveland. But last year, the team ended its contribution to Amer-I-can.
In declining to attend the Ring of Honor ceremony, Brown is telling Cleveland to keep the money and the title.
I'd expect nothing less.
On a Syracuse radio show, Brown took the high road but was clearly less than thrilled with the Browns' new direction.
''Sometimes when you comment on things, all you do is create problems,'' Brown said. ''And the last thing I want to do is create problems for anyone or especially disrupt the team or ownership or the plans of other people.
''But on the other hand, as an individual, I have plans of my own. I have a dignity and character of my own that I also protect.''
Brown also said: ''I'm a very sensitive person. And I do like to be respected. And I'm very loyal. And I like it to be a two-way street.''
Cleveland won its last N.F.L. championship in 1964, Brown's next-to-last season. Now, 46 years later, Holmgren, who has won one Super Bowl as a coach, is trying to prove himself as a championship-caliber N.F.L. executive -- and Brown is apparently one of the barriers.
If Holmgren eventually turns Cleveland into a champion. he will solidify his place in N.F.L. history as the man who restored dignity to a once-proud franchise.
The last person to do that was the man he just moved aside. You keep Eric Mangini as the coach and get rid of Jim Brown?
In an interview with The Plain Dealer of Cleveland, Brown said he would continue to take the high road when it came to the Browns. ''I will never open up any Pandora's box because I have too much respect for the Lerner family and the Cleveland Browns and the way I've been treated,'' he said, referring to the family that has owned the Browns. ''I've been treated like a champion.''
You can make a strong argument that by severing their official connections with the great Jim Brown, Cleveland has lost its last champion.

HEADLINE: Awaiting Jobs Data, Market Falls

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stocks fell on Monday as investors braced for a week of unemployment figures and economic data unlikely to stoke confidence in the prospects for growth.
On Monday the Commerce Department said personal income rose 0.2 percent and consumer spending was up 0.4 percent in July, which was higher than estimates. The core Consumer Price Index rose 0.1 percent, in line with analysts' expectations. Incomes were flat in June.
''The number this morning was not all that bad,'' said Nicholas Colas, chief market strategist at the ConvergEx Group. ''What the market is generally worried about for the entire week is how much softening we are going to see in the days and weeks ahead.'' 
The personal income and spending data were the first in a series of reports this week that will include auto sales for July and the latest Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller home price index. And on Friday, the government will release its unemployment report for August, one of the most widely anticipated monthly reports.
Housing, jobs and consumer spending have been watched closely by economists trying to determine the state of the economic recovery in the United States.
The Commerce Department's report on personal incomes and spending growth suggested that consumers were cautiously loosening their belts.
''There exists pent-up demand for large-ticket items such as automobiles,'' Chris G. Christopher Jr., senior principal economist for IHS Global Insight, wrote in a research note.
''This is relatively good news,'' he added, ''given the steady stream of negative reports last week of plunging home sales, stock market volatility and employment conditions.''
Investors found little incentive to buy ahead of Friday's monthly jobs report. Analysts expect the report to show that the economy lost an additional 100,000 jobs in August and that the unemployment rate rose to 9.6 percent, from 9.5 percent in July.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 140.92 points, or 1.39 percent, to close at 10,009.73, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 15.67 points, or 1.47 percent, to 1,048.92. The Nasdaq composite index fell 33.66 points, or 1.56 percent, to 2,119.97. Volume remained light, which can increase market volatility.
Interest rates were lower.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 1 1/32, to 100 27/32, and the yield fell to 2.53 percent from 2.64 percent late Friday.
Shares of Hewlett-Packard, the computer company, rose 56 cents, or 1.47 percent, to close at $38.56 after the company said Monday that its board had approved another $10 billion for share repurchases. Intel stock fell 41 cents, or 2.23 percent, to $17.96, after the company announced that it had agreed to buy the wireless unit of Infineon Technologies for $1.4 billion.
Financial stocks weighed on the broader market, with Citigroup declining 9 cents, to $3.67, and Bank of America falling 32 cents, to $12.32.
The biotechnology company Genzyme rose $2.29, or 3.39 percent, to close at $69.91 after it rejected a buyout offer of $18.5 billion, or $69 a share, from the French drug maker Sanofi-Aventis, saying the bid undervalued the company. Sanofi shares rose 0.24 percent.
''The market is bracing for a week of bad data,'' said Nick Kalivas, vice president of financial research at MF Global Research. ''It is not going to be consistent with much strength.''
''People are reluctant to bet against it at this stage in the game,'' he said. ''It is weighing on the market.''
On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve is to release the minutes of its most recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting.
Analysts will pore over the minutes seeking insight about recent policy decisions, including the one this month that the Fed will use proceeds from its holdings of mortgage bonds to buy long-term Treasury securities in an effort to prop up the recovery.
Sales reports from chain stores and automakers are also expected to be lackluster.

HEADLINE: Chaos and Stranded Tourists After Mexicana Shutdown

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- The sudden shutdown of Mexico's largest airline on Friday stranded many tourists and left the Mexico City airport in chaos for much of the weekend. But tour operators said on Monday that they were confident they could reschedule flights.
Still, many Mexicans who had tickets for flights on the airline, Mexicana, said they feared they would not get promised refunds for tickets for future flights, and complained of having to buy full-price tickets to replace worthless Mexicana tickets. 
Tour operators said that while the news on Friday of the suspension of all flights by Mexicana was abrupt, it did not come as a total surprise. The company was saddled by debt and unable to renegotiate labor contracts with its unions. It had already signaled to travel operators that its continued operation was precarious.
''They stopped selling tickets for about a week, so that's not a good sign,'' said Mark Noennig, the vice president and general manager of Apple Vacations, a large operator that sells tours to Mexico.
In fact, tour operators said they began preparing a month ago, when Mexicana filed for bankruptcy protection. ''We were very proactive once they filed for Chapter 11,'' said Greg Bernd, a president of Classic Vacations, a tour operator in California. ''We started contacting people and encouraging them to rebook.''
Mexicana served more than a dozen routes to the United States and about a dozen routes inside Mexico, as well as flights to Latin America and Europe. Over the last couple of years, it has lost market share to low-cost airlines, and the whole industry suffered when tourism dropped last year in the wake of the swine flu outbreak and the economic crisis. Reports about violence in the country have also continued to discourage travel.
''Mexico is a tough sell because of the bad publicity,'' said Bob McMillen, the chief executive of TravelWizard.com, a travel agency. ''This is not going to help. It's a shame that this has happened.''
Jim Osborne, a vice president at Virtuoso, in Fort Worth, a network of travel agencies, said the shutdown came during a slow season for travel to Mexico. ''If it had to be, it's the right time,'' he said. ''If it had happened in winter, it would have had a much bigger impact.''
Because Mexico's resort destinations are served by several airlines, rescheduling flights is relatively easy, tour operators said.
Mexican officials played down the effect on passengers at a news conference on Monday. Gloria Guevara, the tourism secretary, said that she did not expect the Mexicana shutdown to reduce the ministry's forecast for the number of tourists visiting Mexico this year. Several foreign airlines were already planning new routes to Mexico, she said.
But for many Mexicans who had bought Mexicana tickets for their vacations, the outlook is not as clear. More than 4,000 people wrote to a forum set up by El Universal, a Mexico City daily, to complain, many of them offering tales of ruined vacations and unanswered telephone calls.
One, Paola Paez Rosas, wrote that she had bought six tickets to Cancun for a family vacation in September. Now she will need to buy new tickets, and she said she doubted she would ever get her money back from Mexicana.
''I ask that they give a viable solution to every single one of the customers and they tell us the truth, because it's not fair that we're the ones who are affected because of bad management,'' she wrote.

HEADLINE: Think the Answer's Clear? Look Again

BYLINE: By KATIE HAFNER

 BODY:
Presidential elections can be fatal.
Win an Academy Award and you're likely to live longer than had you been a runner-up.
Interview for medical school on a rainy day, and your chances of being selected could fall.
Such are some of the surprising findings of Dr. Donald A. Redelmeier, a physician-researcher and perhaps the leading debunker of preconceived notions in the medical world.
In his 20 years as a researcher, first at Stanford University, now at the University of Toronto, Dr. Redelmeier, 50, has applied scientific rigor to topics that in lesser hands might have been dismissed as quirky and iconoclastic. In doing so, his work has shattered myths and revealed some deep truths about the predictors of longevity, the organization of health care and the workings of the medical mind.
''He'll go totally against intuition, and come up with a beautiful finding,'' said Eldar Shafir, a professor of psychology and public affairs at Princeton University who has worked with Dr. Redelmeier on research into medical decision-making. 
Dr. Redelmeier was the first to study cellphones and automobile crashes. A paper he published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 1997 concluded that talking on a cellphone while driving was as dangerous as driving while intoxicated. His collaborator, Robert Tibshirani, a statistician at Stanford University, said the paper ''is likely to dwarf all of my other work in statistics, in terms of its direct impact on public health.''
As an internist who works at Sunnybrook Hospital in Toronto, Canada's largest trauma center, Dr. Redelmeier sees a large number of patients in the aftermath of crashes. As a result, one of his abiding professional preoccupations is with vehicle crashes. He found that about 25 more people die in crashes on presidential Election Days in the United States than the norm, which he attributes to increased traffic, rushed drivers and unfamiliar routes.
He also discovered a 41 percent relative increase in fatalities on Super Bowl Sunday, which he attributed to a combination of fatigue, distraction and alcohol. After publication of the findings on the Super Bowl, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration embarked on a campaign with the slogan ''Fans don't let fans drink and drive.''
In preparation for a recent interview in his modest office in the sprawling hospital complex, Dr. Redelmeier had written on an index card some of his homespun philosophies.
''Life is a marathon, not a sprint,'' he read, adding, ''A great deal of mischief occurs when people are in a rush.''
To that end, he studied the psychology around changing lanes in traffic. In an article published in Nature in 1999, Dr. Redelmeier and Professor Tibshirani found that while cars in the other lane sometimes appear to be moving faster, they are not.
''Every driver on average thinks he's in the wrong lane,'' Dr. Redelmeier said. ''You think more cars are passing you when you're actually passing them just as quickly. Still, you make a lane change where the benefits are illusory and not real.'' Meanwhile, changing lanes increases the chances of collision about threefold.
Often he works from a hunch. In the Canadian Medical Association Journal in December, Dr. Redelmeier examined University of Toronto medical school admission interview reports from 2004 to 2009. After correlating the interview scores with weather archives, he determined that candidates who interviewed on foul-weather days received ratings lower than candidates who visited on sunny days. In many cases, the difference was significant enough to influence acceptance.
Dr. Redelmeier's work on longevity began 10 years ago, when he was watching the Academy Awards and noticed that the celebrities on stage ''don't look anything like the patients I see in clinic,'' he said. ''It's not just the makeup and the plastic surgery and wardrobe. It's the way they move, it's their gestures. They seem so much more vivacious. It seemed so much more than skin deep and might go all the way to longevity.''
His findings: Academy Award winners live an average of three years longer than the runners-up. A potential explanation could be an added measure of scrutiny, a public expectation of healthier living.
Dr. Redelmeier did not set out to be a researcher. ''For years, I thought I'd be a straight clinician,'' he said. But during his years at Stanford in the 1980s and early 1990s, first as a medical resident, then as a fellow, he met Amos Tversky, the cognitive psychologist who helped inspire the field of behavioral economics, which examines the cognitive, social and emotional aspects of people's financial decisions.
Professor Tversky, who was Dr. Redelmeier's fellowship supervisor, changed Dr. Redelmeier's thinking entirely.
In 1990, he and Professor Tversky published a paper in The New England Journal of Medicine showing that when physicians make a medical decision for a single hypothetical patient, they favor more expensive treatments than when making a decision for a group of hypothetical patients with similar symptoms. And in 1996 the two scientists found that increased arthritis pain had nothing to do with the weather. They attributed the misperception to the human tendency to look for patterns even where none may exist.
Dr. Redelmeier credits Professor Tversky, who died in 1996, with shaping his own approach to research in the medical realm. ''He provided me with a language and a logic for tackling issues that seemed to be around me all the time, but weren't so apparent to other people,'' he said.
Dr. Redelmeier isn't one to forget about his past research. With the Academy Award study, for instance, he regularly updates the database.
''It's important for him to know this wasn't some statistical blip we happened to stumble across,'' said Dr. Sheldon Singh, a cardiologist at Sunnybrook Hospital and assistant professor of medicine at the University of Toronto who co-wrote the Academy Awards paper. And in a paper coming out in the September issue of Chance, a statistics journal, Dr. Redelmeier and Professor Tibshirani show that on Election Day 2008, more fatalities occurred than on two control days, the Tuesdays before and after the election. This paper is a follow-up to an earlier one published in The Journal of the American Medical Association.
''Part of the satisfaction for Don is knowing the results stand the test of time,'' Dr. Singh said.
Dr. Redelmeier's unusual approach goes hand in hand with some pronounced personality quirks. His e-mails, which are legendary among their recipients, are written as lists, with a number assigned to each thought. Dr. Redelmeier does this, he said, in order to focus on the content of a message rather than get distracted by grammar, punctuation and syntax.
''I remember the first time I got one, I was a little offended,'' Dr. Singh said. ''I'd never gotten an e-mail not written in a paragraphed format. Yet he addressed everything I needed to know.''
Dr. Redelmeier takes the results of his research seriously. He rides his bike to work, and when he does drive, he resists ''small temptations to change lanes.''
Dr. Redelmeier said he was currently looking at attention deficit disorder among teenage drivers, and whether, like epilepsy, the disorder should be considered a medically reportable condition.
Not everyone has unconditional admiration for Dr. Redelmeier's work. Professor Tibshirani, for instance, has reservations about some of Dr. Redelmeier's choices, and declined to collaborate on the Academy Awards study.
''I honestly thought it was frivolous, and we've argued about it,'' Professor Tibshirani said. He also questioned the Election Day research. ''Of course there's more traffic, so it seemed self-evident,'' he said.
That perspective amuses rather than offends Dr. Redelmeier. When asked about it via e-mail, he responded within one of his numbered missives:
15) I sometimes tell a joke to tackle the issue
16) that is, about people's ability to judge ''frivolity''
17) namely, imagine Charles Darwin 150 years ago
18) at the time he disappointed his father by neglecting medical training
19) and asked, instead, to go on a two-year vacation in the tropics
20) with an emphasis on bird watching (finches)
21) the father was not impressed and thought the son was wasting his time
Another Redelmeier philosophical pearl is ''Do not get trapped into prior thoughts. It's perfectly O.K. to change your mind as you learn more.''
In patient care, he said, he frequently does just that. ''I think I know the diagnosis and start the treatment, then follow up and realize I was wrong,'' he said. ''I intercept a lot of my own errors at a relatively early stage.''
This, not surprisingly, became the basis of some classic Redelmeier research around raising physicians' awareness of their own thinking -- cognitive shortcuts that might lead to a diagnostic error.
Professor Tibshirani said he once accompanied Dr. Redelmeier on rounds at the hospital. ''I watched him talk to patients, and they love him,'' he recounted.
While Dr. Redelmeier enjoys his patient interactions, he appears incapable of resisting the lure of a good research topic. Several years ago he compared medical school class presidents to a control group of others in the class and found that the presidents died an average 2.5 years earlier than those in the control group. The type who would run for class president, he concluded in the resulting paper, ''may also be the type who fails to look after their health or is otherwise prone to early mortality.''
The idea came to him one day in a hallway at the University of Toronto's Faculty of Medicine, where he had stopped to admire a century's worth of class photos showing mostly white men.
''Some people might say, 'What an old boys' network,' '' Dr. Redelmeier said. ''But I thought, 'My goodness, what a homogeneous population, akin to identical white mice, which thereby controls for all sorts of differences.' '' Thus was born another Redelmeier classic.

HEADLINE: New York Gains Economic Health Faster Than U.S.

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
By most standard measures of economic health, New York City's recovery from the financial crisis and the recession it started is well under way.
The typical New Yorker is less likely to be unemployed or facing foreclosure or bankruptcy than the average American. Homes in the metropolitan area have held their value better than in most other big cities as more people are moving to the region than deserting it. Tourists continue to flock to the city, filling hotel rooms at the highest rate in the country, and at rising prices.
Wall Street -- still the engine that powers the city -- roared back faster than expected, eliminated far fewer jobs than had been forecast, resumed paying out big bonuses and has begun to hire again. Despite a faltering stock market and recent signals that the national economy is losing steam, economists expect New York to remain on the rebound.
''We have been feeling on more solid footing the last six months,'' said Marcia Van Wagner, the city's assistant comptroller for budget. ''If there's no major shock, I think we're going to have a slow, relatively steady recovery.'' 
There were some major shocks two years ago, most notably the collapse of the Lehman Brothers investment bank, which heralded the end of the boom years. Lehman's failure, in September 2008, caused a panic in financial markets that spurred predictions of another Great Depression.
But in the city, far fewer jobs were lost than had been predicted and there has been job growth for the last six months. In July, the number of jobs in the city was down 108,000, or less than 3 percent, from July 2008. Over the same 24 months, the nation lost 6.7 million jobs, or more than 4.5 percent. The city's unemployment rate slipped last month to 9.4 percent, slightly below the national rate.
Still, experts on the city's economy said the effects of the recession were spread unevenly across the local landscape, leaving many people in dire financial condition. David R. Jones, the chief executive of the Community Service Society of New York, an antipoverty group, said that the farther away from Midtown one wandered, the more ravaged the city appeared.
''While we're seeing in Manhattan that things are going relatively well and there's been a sharp rebound, in some neighborhoods of New York things are not going well,'' Mr. Jones said.
Away from the office towers and rooftop cocktail lounges, long-term unemployment is a persistent problem, and young job seekers are losing hope, Mr. Jones said. A survey in late July of city residents who meet or barely exceed the definition of poor found that only about one-fifth of them thought the city's economy was improving, he said.
The city's construction industry, which practically ground to a halt in 2009, is still mired in a slump. The total value of building projects begun in the second quarter was less than half the level of two years earlier.
And so, while economists agree that the recession is over in the city and that it did not last as long or exact as harsh a toll as on the rest of the country, the key determinant of people's current well-being appears to be whether they came out of the recession with a job.
Those who remained employed, especially if they had professional or managerial positions, were fortunate. James A. Parrott, chief economist of the Fiscal Policy Institute, found that in the city, the income data masked a deep divide: the pay of managers rose at a healthy clip through the recession while lower-level workers took significant cuts in pay.
According to Mr. Parrott's analysis of local wage data, the median pay of managerial workers in the city was $990 a week in the first four months of this year, up 11 percent in three years. But the median weekly pay for nonmanagers was $472, or 10.4 percent less than they earned in the first four months of 2007.
The growing gap ''indicates a worrisome weakening in the ability of less-skilled New York workers to maintain their wage-earning power,'' Mr. Parrott said.
''That doesn't bode well for the recovery in consumer spending in New York's neighborhoods,'' he continued.
Personal incomes dropped more in New York than in the rest of the country last year, largely because of the smaller bonuses that were paid out in early 2009 for the dismal performance in 2008. But 2009 was very profitable for some of the banks that survived, like Goldman Sachs, and the corresponding bonuses have helped buoy the city this year, economists said.
''Even though the recession was milder in terms of the number of jobs lost, the income loss was much greater,'' said Marisa Di Natale, an economist with Moody's Economy.com.
The quick bounce back for the city's best-paid workers has helped fuel a pickup in business at exclusive boites and expensive hotels, consultants and business operators said. On Friday, Tiffany & Company said sales at its flagship jewelry store on Fifth Avenue rose 16 percent in the first half of the year.
But many businesses, particularly those that cater to the city's workers rather than executives or tourists, are struggling to stay afloat, they said.
''The 25 most-coveted restaurants in New York are doing an incredible amount of business,'' serving 10 percent to 15 percent more diners than they did a year ago, said Steven Kamali, who brokers sales of restaurants and bars and advises hotel owners on food service. ''On the other side of the argument, what we're finding is the local neighborhood restaurants are taking the brunt of the pain.''
The steady stream of visitors has kept the city's hotels nearly full, though room rates remain well below the levels they reached before the recession.
''Things seem to be getting better, almost inching back to late-2007 levels,'' said Andre Balazs, who operates boutique hotels including the Standard and the Mercer.
But, Mr. Balazs said, even his wealthiest clients had not kicked a habit from the recession of haggling over their bills. ''People who would fly a private plane to a destination suddenly feel the need to negotiate the price of a suite,'' he said.
On the streets of some neighborhoods, working-class residents like Selina Sharmin are still dreading the recession's aftermath.
Ms. Sharmin, 37, has worked in public libraries in Queens since she immigrated from her native Bangladesh 10 years ago. Just six months after she was promoted to a full-fledged librarian's position, she received notice that she and 45 other employees of the borough's public library system would be laid off on Thursday because of budget cuts.
''This is my dream job, I can tell you,'' said Ms. Sharmin, who lives in Jamaica with her husband and two young children. ''Now my future is dark and unknown.''
If she is laid off as scheduled, she said, she doubted that she would be able to afford the family health insurance her job provided. She said continuing that coverage would cost at least $700 a month. But she would receive just $405 a week in unemployment benefits, barely enough to cover her $1,200 monthly house payment, she said.
''Now I really don't know what I should do and what I am going to do,'' said Ms. Sharmin, whose husband has not been able to find work since he was laid off from a job in a gift shop. ''Who's going to hire me?''
Proposals to lay off more employees of city and state agencies like the Metropolitan Transportation Authority could continue to temper a local recovery, economists said. A reluctance to hire full-time employees in some struggling industries like publishing is another drag on the city's economy, they said.
Alexandra Ben Othman, 29, of Sunnyside, Queens, can tell that tale in the first person.
Through most of last year, Ms. Ben Othman could not find any work after she was laid off by a publishing company. For the last six months, she has worked steadily as a proofreader, but the jobs have been temporary, leaving her to fear that the next paycheck could be the last. She receives no benefits, so she has gone without health insurance for almost a year.
''For a while I was looking for full-time,'' Ms. Ben Othman said, describing her job search. ''Then at one point I needed to take whatever I could get.'' Her current assignment with an educational publisher is ''still a little bit shaky but definitely a lot more secure than most other temporary assignments.''
Her husband, Mohamed Ben Othman, a Tunisian immigrant who drives a taxi on weekends, is looking for work as a plumber's apprentice. She said she had considered taking classes toward a graduate degree in marketing or Islamic art history. A more remote possibility, she added, would be to move to Tunisia to teach English.
In the meantime, Ms. Ben Othman said, she is taking lunch to work, shopping at Costco and Target and frequenting her local movie theater on Tuesdays when tickets are just $5. ''These days,'' she said, ''I'm being very frugal.''
Online Correction: August 30, 2010, Monday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the percentage change in median pay found in James A. Parrott's analysis of local wage data as an increase of 7.5 percent for managerial workers and a decrease of 6.3 percent for non-managerial workers. Also, the article mistakenly said the period studied was the first three months of 2010.

HEADLINE: Doctors Heed Call For Books

BYLINE: By IRENE M. WIELAWSKI

 BODY:
Imagine cutting out a diseased appendix without ever having seen a Gray's Anatomy diagram, or calculating drug doses without a Physicians' Desk Reference, and you'll have an idea what it's like to practice medicine in Afghanistan.
Nearly three decades of war and religious extremism have devastated medical libraries and crippled the educational system for doctors, nurses and other health professionals. Factions of the Taliban, which ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, singled out medical texts for destruction, military medical personnel say, because anatomical depictions of the human body were considered blasphemous.
''They not only burned the books, but they sent monitors into the classroom to make sure there were no drawings of the human body on the blackboard,'' said Valerie Walker, director of the Medical Alumni Association of the University of California, Los Angeles.
Ms. Walker is helping lead an ambitious effort by American doctors and nurses, both civilian and military, to restock Afghanistan's hospitals, clinics and universities with medical textbooks and other reference materials. 
The project, called Operation Medical Libraries, began modestly in 2007 with a plea for books from a U.C.L.A. medical graduate serving in the Army. It has since been embraced by 30 universities and hospitals, more than a dozen professional organizations and scores of individual doctors and nurses.
''It's hard to imagine working in an environment where you don't have access to medical literature or the Internet,'' said one donor, Dr. Lawrence Maldonado, director of the medical intensive care unit at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. ''I have unbelievable resources where I work -- libraries, lecture series, online -- and I know that everything I read or learn helps me make better decisions and take better care of patients.''
Like most others involved in the program, Dr. Maldonado heard about it from a colleague. And word has spread among medical officers stationed in Afghanistan, who act as volunteer points of contact to shepherd books to the libraries.
One of them is Cmdr. David T. Beverly IV, a Navy ophthalmologist stationed at Camp Eggers in Kabul. The books he gets -- 30 boxes so far -- go to rebuild the library at Kabul Medical University, where most Afghan doctors receive their education, and at the nearby Afshar Hospital. ''They've started a family medicine residency there using our books,'' Commander Beverly said in a phone interview from Kabul.
By Ms. Walker's estimate, 27,000 medical texts have reached Afghanistan through Operation Medical Libraries, but she adds that the number is probably much higher. Donors can contribute directly by visiting the project's Web site, http://opmedlibs.medalumni.ucla.edu, to find a military volunteer's address, then shipping the books on their own.
The system had some initial bugs. Col. Susan Bassett, an Air Force nurse stationed at an outpost hospital near Kandahar in 2008, said the first boxes she received were huge and heavy. ''The people sending them didn't realize we don't have much equipment here -- no dollies or anything to get the boxes on and off the trucks,'' she said. So she spoke to Ms. Walker, who ''put out the word to send smaller boxes.''
Colonel Bassett was assigned to serve as a mentor to Afghan Army nurses, so she was delighted to find books on medical diets, nursing, pharmacology and physical therapy among the donations -- along with personal greetings from the donors.
''They all came with these homey notes: 'Hope these help.' 'Hope you're safe,' '' said Colonel Bassett, who is now stationed at Keesler Air Force Base in Biloxi, Miss. ''The generosity and kindness of Americans, well, it just warmed my heart.''
While most of the books go to Afghanistan, some have found their way to medical libraries in places as far-flung as Mozambique, the Solomon Islands and Uganda. Books on biology, chemistry, anatomy, medicine, nursing, dentistry, pharmacology and physical therapy are all in demand -- especially those published in the last five years.
The operation started with an e-mail that landed in Ms. Walker's in box in April 2007, addressed simply ''U.C.L.A. Medical Alumni Association.'' Lt. Col. Laura Pacha, a 1998 graduate serving as an Army medical officer in Iraq, described a crippled medical education system and inadequate reference libraries.
''Sadly, anything since 1994 is considered current here,'' she wrote, adding that a dearth of computers and frequent electricity failures made online resources largely inaccessible. She wondered if her fellow alumni might have books to spare, and provided her military address.
Ms. Walker, whose previous experience with donation drives was helping her daughter on Girl Scout projects, tackled the details. First she arranged for a campus bookstore to receive donations and got a commitment from the university's R.O.T.C. commander to ship the books through military channels. Then she sent an e-mail blast to medical school alumni, summarizing Colonel Pacha's request and the collection plan.
That first salvo went to medical school graduates in the Los Angeles area; Ms. Walker assumed they would be most likely to respond because they could drive their books to campus. But her e-mail recipients had other ideas, forwarding the message to colleagues and distant medical school classmates. Books began pouring in, for a total of 2,000 volumes in that first shipment.
Ms. Walker did not realize what she and Colonel Pacha had started. ''I thought this was a one-time deal,'' she said.
But the word was spreading. In January 2008, Ms. Walker heard from a Navy doctor in Afghanistan, who said the lack of textbooks was forcing medical students to rely almost entirely on lecture notes and memorization. Could she send him some books too?
Getting books wasn't the problem. The donations had never really stopped.
Dr. Christina S. Han, now a fellow in maternal and fetal medicine at Yale, delivered 60 boxes to Ms. Walker after organizing a competitive book drive at the Los Angeles hospital where she was a resident.
Dr. Michael D. Stouder, a family physician in Mission Viejo, Calif., drove a carload of donations to Ms. Walker's office after hearing about the condition of Afghanistan's libraries from his son, an Army psychologist.
And Mark McKenney, at St. Mary's Hospital in Grand Junction, Colo., learned of the effort via an e-mail list for medical librarians. He persuaded administrators to include book drives for Afghanistan as part of his hospital's community service mission.
Meanwhile, Ms. Walker set about building an Internet-based structure that would enable Operation Medical Libraries to run at no cost to her university or the military. The biggest challenge, she said, was to develop an economical and reliable shipping system.
Colonel Pacha's suggestion that donations be shipped to her military address turned out to be the answer. The project now asks volunteers from the military to provide their addresses, enabling individual donors to ship at domestic bulk-mail rates of about 50 cents a pound, with no taxes or customs fees.
''You do everything through the U.S. mail service, so things don't get lost,'' Ms. Walker said. ''We've sent well over 30 tons and haven't lost a box yet.''

HEADLINE: At Bookstore, Even Those Not Buying Regret Its End

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
On Monday afternoon, Jai Cha walked out of the Barnes & Noble at 66th Street and Broadway in Manhattan as he does nearly every week -- without a book.
''I'm just killing time,'' said Mr. Cha, a 30-year-old lawyer, his hands stuffed deep in his pockets. ''I've been coming here to read Bill Simmons's 'Book of Basketball,' about a chapter at a time.''
He might have to hurry. Barnes & Noble announced on Monday that at the end of January it would close the store, a four-story space across the street from Lincoln Center that has been a neighborhood landmark since it opened nearly 15 years ago. 
''We recognize that this store has been an important part of the fabric of the Upper West Side community since we opened our doors on Oct. 20, 1995,'' Mary Ellen Keating, a company spokeswoman, said in a statement. ''However, the current lease is at its end of term, and the increased rent that would be required to stay in the location makes it economically impossible for us to extend the lease.''
It has been a bumpy year for Barnes & Noble, the country's largest book chain, with 720 stores. Sales and store traffic have suffered as the book business has shifted online; Amazon has held its early lead in the e-reader war; and early this month, Barnes & Noble put itself up for sale and is now in the midst of a battle for control of the company with Ronald W. Burkle, the billionaire investor.
People browsing at the Lincoln Center store on Monday lamented the loss of one of the city's largest and most prominent bookstores, a sprawling space with a cafe on the fourth floor and an enormous music selection. For devoted theatergoers, it was a reliable site for readings and events that focused on the performing arts. (Still on the fall schedule are appearances by Patti LuPone and Elaine Paige.)
But many of those same people conceded that they have not bought as many books there as they did in the past. Some said they were more likely to browse the shelves, then head home and make purchases online. Others said they prized the store most for its sunny cafe or its magazines and other nonbook items.
''Oh, I really am sad,'' said Lillian Kelly, a 70-year-old retiree, upon hearing the news that the store would close. ''I love buying my greeting cards here.''
Ms. Kelly said she visited the store at least twice a week, usually heading upstairs to read magazines and to pick up a sandwich and cup of Starbucks coffee.
''They're getting business out of me, I suppose,'' she said. ''Even though I'm sitting there reading magazines for free.''
Roger Hawkins, a former television news producer who was busy e-mailing on his laptop in the cafe, said he had been a Barnes & Noble member, giving him additional discounts on purchases, but let his membership lapse after he started buying audiobooks online instead. ''There are other reasons that people come to this bookstore,'' Mr. Hawkins said. ''You don't have park benches on the street anymore. It's hard to find a place where you can sit down and have a cup of coffee.''
At the store's entrance on Broadway, a steady stream of customers pushed through the revolving doors. A teenager in a turquoise T-shirt walked out, scarfing down a scone, but with no books in his hand. A couple from Tennessee paused outside the store, but decided to wander down the block to the Lincoln Square movie theater instead.
Melissa Rosati, an adjunct professor of publishing at Pace University, said she bought nearly everything online but came to the store on Monday to spend a $25 gift card on ''The Tipping Point'' by Malcolm Gladwell.
''It's not like I'm going to miss it that much,'' she said. ''There's another Barnes & Noble on 82nd and Broadway'' (the one known for helping put the beloved independent bookstore across the street from it, Shakespeare & Company, out of business 14 years ago).
Ms. Keating, the Barnes & Noble spokeswoman, said a search was under way for a new location on the Upper West Side, but she declined to provide details.
Two other Barnes & Noble stores in Manhattan, one on Astor Place and one in Chelsea, have closed in the last three years. But Barnes & Noble still has the huge store at 82nd Street, and in July 2009, it opened a 50,000-square-foot superstore at 86th Street and Lexington Avenue.
One result of the book chain's uncertain year may be that much of the old animosity toward Barnes & Noble, once seen by some residents as a corporate bully that helped squash small, independent bookstores, has lately been replaced with affection.
Monica Blum, the president of the Lincoln Square Business Improvement District, said she detected a change in the way people viewed big bookstores.
''It is a community gathering space,'' Ms. Blum said. ''I think the larger bookstores have worked hard to become those kinds of spaces.''
Dora Schulman, a shoe saleswoman who has lived in the neighborhood since the 1960s, left clutching a CD. ''It's a pity,'' she said. ''All the stores on my route are closing -- first Tower Records, then Blockbuster, now this.''

HEADLINE: In Korea, A Model For Iraq

BYLINE: By PAUL D. WOLFOWITZ. 
Paul D. Wolfowitz, a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, was the deputy secretary of defense from 2001 to 2005.

 BODY:
Washington
VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN, who traveled to Iraq this week to mark the formal end of United States combat operations there, has claimed that peace and stability there could be ''one of the great achievements'' of the Obama administration. Of course, the largest share of credit belongs to the brave men and women of the American military, who have sacrificed so much and persevered through so much difficulty. Credit also goes to the Iraqi Army and police forces who have fought bravely and increasingly well, and to Iraq's people, who have borne a heavy burden. But it is good that President Obama and his administration also claim credit, because success in Iraq will need their support.
My hope is that the president understands that success in Iraq will be defined not by what we withdraw, but by what we leave behind. At a minimum, we need Iraq to be a stable country, at peace both within its borders and with its neighbors. And we should help Iraq to one day become a leader of political and economic progress in the Middle East. 
The aftermath of another American war is instructive. Fifty-seven years ago, an armistice ended the fighting in Korea -- another unpopular conflict, far bloodier than the Iraq war, although shorter. Civilian casualties were horrendous, and the United States and its allies suffered more than half a million military casualties. The South Korean Army took the heaviest losses, but the United States also paid a high price: 33,739 killed or missing in battle and 103,284 wounded.
Gen. Dwight Eisenhower won the 1952 presidential election, in part, on a promise to end the war. According to a poll taken in April 1953, three months before the armistice was signed, 55 percent of the American public thought the war had not been worth fighting, whereas only 36 percent thought that it had.
Yet when the war was over, the United States did not abandon South Korea. We had done so in 1949, when our post-World War II occupation of Korea ended, opening the door to North Korea's invasion the following year. This time, instead, we kept a substantial military force in South Korea.
The United States stuck with South Korea even though the country was then ruled by a dictator and the prospects for its war-devastated economy looked dim. With all its failings, South Korea was nevertheless a haven of freedom compared with the bleak and brutal despotism of North Korea.
We also understood that stability on the Korean Peninsula was critical for the peace of an entire region -- a region that involved Japan as well as the Soviet Union and China. Most important, abandoning South Korea would have risked squandering all that had been gained.
Although South Korea has assumed the principal responsibility for its own defense, there are still 28,500 American troops on the peninsula. Our continued commitment prevented another war and today South Korea is a remarkable economic success story. A series of democratic elections, starting in 1987, have made it a political success story as well.
Some similar considerations apply to Iraq today. First, Iraq occupies a key position in the Persian Gulf, a strategically important region of the world -- a position that is all the more important because of the dangerous ambitions of Iran's rulers.
Second, whatever the failings of Iraq's democracy, it bears no comparison to the regime that other hostile elements would impose. With all its imperfections, Iraq today is more democratic than South Korea was at the end of the Korean War, and more democratic than any other country in the Arab Middle East (with the possible exception of Lebanon).
We have withdrawn so many of our troops and relinquished a combat role because Iraqi security forces have been able to take on most of the security burden. Their numbers have grown from about 320,000 in December 2006 to more than 600,000 at the end of last year; they are also becoming more capable.
Of course, numbers are only part of the story, and Iraqi security forces still need assistance from the American military. Not surprisingly, the enemy has increasingly focused its attacks on Iraqi soldiers and police officers as the United States withdraws, although Iraqi losses are still far below what they were earlier in the war. Since June 2003, about 10,000 Iraqi security forces have been killed, twice the total of the United States and the entire international coalition.
Even as our combat commitment ends, our commitment to supporting Iraq must continue. That means continued political support, including offering our help in resolving the current stalemate over forming a government. (It's worth remembering that much of the difficulty the Iraqis are encountering arises from a Constitution and electoral system that the international community helped design. Moreover, this example of peaceful negotiations to create a government is something new in the Arab world.)
Our commitment must also include continued material support, particularly in the form of military and technical assistance. And though we have agreed to withdraw all our troops by the end of next year -- a pledge that we must honor if the Iraqi government so desires -- we need to remain open to the possibility of a mutually agreed longer-term security commitment or military presence for deterrence and support.
It is well worth celebrating the end of combat operations after seven years, and the homecoming of so many troops. But fully abandoning Iraq would damage the interests of the United States in the region and beyond. Maintaining a long-term commitment, albeit at greatly reduced cost and risk, is the best way to secure the gains that have been achieved with so much sacrifice.

HEADLINE: Obama Weighs Smaller Measures on the Economy

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama is weighing new steps to bolster the economy, he said Monday. But any measures he takes seem likely to be small ones, and his options are limited with Congress showing little appetite for more spending in a hotly contested midterm election year.
On his first workday back in Washington after a 10-day vacation on Martha's Vineyard and a day trip on Sunday to New Orleans, Mr. Obama spent part of the morning huddled with his economic team, then emerged in the Rose Garden for a hastily arranged appearance that was troubled by microphone difficulties. 
He chided Senate Republicans for engaging in ''pure partisan politics'' by holding up a jobs bill that would offer tax breaks to small businesses and ease credit with a $30 billion initiative to channel loans through community banks. ''I ask Senate Republicans to drop the blockade,'' Mr. Obama said.
The president also said he and his team were ''hard at work in identifying additional measures,'' including extending tax cuts for the middle class that are scheduled to expire this year, increasing government investment in clean energy and rebuilding more infrastructure.
None of those steps, however, will come close to the $787 billion stimulus measure that Democrats passed at the outset of the Obama presidency. With voters angry about government spending, and economists divided about just what approach is the correct one, such aggressive steps are by now out of the question.
''There's a deep frustration among economists that they simply don't know what to do under these circumstances, at least in terms of fiscal policy,'' said Bruce Bartlett, an economist who advised Republican presidents.
''I think there are a lot of economists who, in principle, would support some new fiscal stimulus, perhaps a jobs program where people were directly employed by the government or something of that sort,'' Mr. Bartlett said. ''But politically it's simply not possible to do anything remotely like that under the current circumstances.''
The House has already passed a bill offering tax breaks to small businesses, but the measure is not the same as the one being considered in the Senate. The majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, has scheduled a series of procedural votes on the Senate bill for when lawmakers return from their recess on Sept. 13.
But passage ''is not a foregone conclusion,'' said Jim Manley, spokesman for Mr. Reid. ''We're going to need Republican votes.''
Republicans countered that Democrats were the ones holding up the measure, by blocking Republican amendments to the bill and refusing to work with the minority party.
''Instead of growing jobs as promised, Washington Democrats have grown the size of the national debt, the federal government and the unemployment rate,'' the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, wrote in an e-mail.
With unemployment above 9 percent, and some economists warning of a double-dip recession, Mr. Obama and his fellow Democrats have been trying to make the case to voters that while the recovery is slow, the nation is moving in the right direction. But recent economic data have not cooperated: home sales in July dropped to their lowest level in a decade, and experts expect another bleak jobs report on Friday.
In his Rose Garden remarks, Mr. Obama sought to reassure nervous Americans that he is on top of the economy, reminding them that ''it took nearly a decade to dig the hole that we're in'' and that it will ''take longer than any of us would like to climb our way out.''
But as the president tried to deliver that message, he had to do several retakes, interrupting himself to make certain that his microphone was on. ''Can you guys still hear us?'' Mr. Obama asked. ''O.K. Let me try this one more time.''

HEADLINE: With New Sanctions, U.S. Aims at North Korean Elite

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The latest target for the United States, as it tries to tighten the screws on North Korea, is a shadowy party organization, known as Office 39, which raises hard currency to buy fine liquor, exotic food and luxury cars for cronies of North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-il.
The Obama administration on Monday singled out Office 39 as one of several North Korean entities that it says are engaged in illicit activity -- fleshing out new sanctions that were first announced in July by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton during a visit to South Korea. 
Under a new executive order, the United States will try to choke off the flow of luxury goods into North Korea, which officials say Mr. Kim uses to buy the loyalty of the political elite, as well as the sale of conventional weapons by the North. The Treasury Department also designated entities suspected of trafficking in nuclear technology, using existing authority.
''We need to send a signal to the North that provocative behavior will not go unpunished,'' said Robert J. Einhorn, the State Department's special adviser on arms control and nonproliferation issues. ''They are not directed at the people of North Korea, but at their leaders.''
The administration finds itself at something of a crossroads in its North Korea policy: determined to keep up the pressure on the North, while starting to question whether and when to engage the government. A wide range of outside experts have counseled Mrs. Clinton to restore some contact, contending that the sanctions have done little to change North Korea's behavior and that the impasse is becoming increasingly dangerous.
The administration's moves came as Mr. Kim returned from a mysterious visit to China last week, during which he met with President Hu Jintao.
The North Korean leader passed up an opportunity to meet former President Jimmy Carter, who was in Pyongyang, the North's capital, to win the release of a jailed American citizen. Mr. Kim's decision puzzled administration officials and North Korea experts.
Among the possible explanations, said one official: North Korea is now so economically and politically dependent on China that Mr. Kim felt that he could not afford to delay a planned visit to China. Then, too, Mr. Carter was not carrying any diplomatic message from the Obama administration, which may have made it easier for Mr. Kim to skip the meeting.
In a letter to Congress on Monday, President Obama said the new sanctions were justified after North Korea's ''unprovoked attack'' in March on a South Korean warship, the Cheonan, which killed 46 sailors; as well as its nuclear and missile tests, and a variety of other illicit activities.
Eager to demonstrate solidarity with South Korea, Mrs. Clinton previewed the measures during a visit to Seoul with Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, in which he announced joint American-South Korean military exercises. At the time, though, officials had few details.
On Monday, the Treasury filled in the blanks, designating five entities and three individuals linked to weapons of mass destruction. Some of these entities, like the Korea Taesong Trading Company, have already been sanctioned, either by the State Department or the United Nations Security Council.
Mr. Obama, in his new executive order, identified two entities and one individual suspected of involvement in conventional arms sales. The best known is the Reconnaissance General Bureau, an intelligence agency. The order also designates the commander of the agency, Gen. Kim Yong Chol.
The focusing on Office 39 builds on longstanding efforts to deprive the North Korean elite of luxury goods. Sometimes known as Room 39, Office 39 is a branch of the Korean Workers' Party that raises and manages a slush fund of hard currency for Mr. Kim's family and friends.
While some of Office 39's dealings are believed to be legitimate -- it exports exotic mushrooms, ginseng and seaweed, for example -- the organization is suspected of being involved in the counterfeiting of American currency and drug trafficking.
The Treasury Department said Office 39 had been involved in methamphetamine distribution and the production of heroin and opium.
Office 39, which answers directly to Mr. Kim and has its headquarters not far from his villa, also procures luxury goods for the leadership. Last year, American officials said, the Italian government foiled its attempt to buy two Italian-made luxury yachts worth more than $15 million for Mr. Kim.
Critics say that most of North Korea's luxury goods flow through China, which is unenthusiastic about sanctions. Mr. Einhorn said that he would travel to Beijing soon to encourage the government to enforce the measures rigorously.
Stuart A. Levey, the undersecretary of the Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence, said the designations of entities would have global impact because ''there is already a real wariness'' among foreign banks and companies about doing business with North Korean enterprises.

HEADLINE: We Owe the Troops an Exit

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
At least 14 American soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan over the past few days.
We learned on Saturday that our so-called partner in this forlorn war, Hamid Karzai, fired a top prosecutor who had insisted on, gasp, fighting the corruption that runs like a crippling disease through his country.
Time magazine tells us that stressed-out, depressed and despondent soldiers are seeking help for their mental difficulties at a rate that is overwhelming the capacity of available professionals. What we are doing to these troops who have been serving tour after tour in Afghanistan and Iraq is unconscionable. 
Time described the mental-health issue as ''the U.S. Army's third front,'' with the reporter, Mark Thompson, writing: ''While its combat troops fight two wars, its mental-health professionals are waging a battle to save soldiers' sanity when they come back, one that will cost billions long after combat ends in Baghdad and Kabul.''
In addition to the terrible physical toll, the ultimate economic costs of these two wars, as the Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz and his colleague Linda Bilmes have pointed out, will run to more than $3 trillion.
I get a headache when I hear supporters of this endless warfare complaining about the federal budget deficits. They're like arsonists complaining about the smell of smoke in the neighborhood.
There is no silver lining to this nearly decade-old war in Afghanistan. Poll after poll has shown that it no longer has the support of most Americans. And yet we fight on, feeding troops into the meat-grinder year after tragic year -- to what end?
''Clearly, the final chapters of this particular endeavor are very much yet to be written,'' said Gen. David Petraeus, the commander of American and NATO forces in Afghanistan, during a BBC interview over the weekend. He sounded as if those chapters would not be written any time soon.
In a reference to President Obama's assertion that U.S. troops would begin to withdraw from Afghanistan next July, General Petraeus told the interviewer: ''That's a date when a process begins, nothing more, nothing less. It's not the date when the American forces begin an exodus and look for the exit and the light to turn off on the way out of the room.''
A lot of Americans who had listened to the president thought it was, in fact, a date when the American forces would begin an exodus. The general seems to have heard something quite different.
In truth, it's not at all clear how President Obama really feels about the awesome responsibilities involved in waging war, and that's a problem. The Times's Peter Baker wrote a compelling and in many ways troubling article recently about the steep learning curve that Mr. Obama, with no previous military background, has had to negotiate as a wartime commander in chief.
Quoting an unnamed adviser to the president, Mr. Baker wrote that Mr. Obama sees the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as ''problems that need managing'' while he pursues his mission of transforming the nation. Defense Secretary Robert Gates, speaking on the record, said, ''He's got a very full plate of very big issues, and I think he does not want to create the impression that he's so preoccupied with these two wars that he's not addressing the domestic issues that are uppermost in people's minds.''
Wars are not problems that need managing, which suggests that they will always be with us. They are catastrophes that need to be brought to an end as quickly as possible. Wars consume lives by the thousands (in Iraq, by the scores of thousands) and sometimes, as in World War II, by the millions. The goal when fighting any war should be peace, not a permanent simmer of nonstop maiming and killing. Wars are meant to be won -- if they have to be fought at all -- not endlessly looked after.
One of the reasons we're in this state of nonstop warfare is the fact that so few Americans have had any personal stake in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. There is no draft and no direct financial hardship resulting from the wars. So we keep shipping other people's children off to combat as if they were some sort of commodity, like coal or wheat, with no real regard for the terrible price so many have to pay, physically and psychologically.
Not only is this tragic, it is profoundly disrespectful. These are real men and women, courageous and mostly uncomplaining human beings, that we are sending into the war zones, and we owe them our most careful attention. Above all, we owe them an end to two wars that have gone on much too long.

HEADLINE: Why Wall St. Is Deserting Obama

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Daniel S. Loeb, the hedge fund manager, was one of Barack Obama's biggest backers in the 2008 presidential campaign.
A registered Democrat, Mr. Loeb has given and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for Democrats. Less than a year ago, he was considered to be among the Wall Street elite still close enough to the White House to be invited to a speech in Lower Manhattan, where President Obama outlined the need for a financial regulatory overhaul.
So it came as quite a surprise on Friday, when Mr. Loeb sent a letter to his investors that sounded as if he were preparing to join Glenn Beck in Washington over the weekend.
''As every student of American history knows, this country's core founding principles included nonpunitive taxation, constitutionally guaranteed protections against persecution of the minority and an inexorable right of self-determination,'' he wrote. ''Washington has taken actions over the past months, like the Goldman suit that seem designed to fracture the populace by pulling capital and power from the hands of some and putting it in the hands of others.'' 
Over the weekend, the letter, with quotations from Thomas Jefferson, Ronald Reagan and President Obama, was forwarded around the circles of the moneyed elite, from the Hamptons to Silicon Valley. Mr. Loeb's jeremiad illustrates how some of the president's former friends on Wall Street and in business now feel about Washington.
Mr. Loeb isn't the first Wall Streeter to turn on the president. Steven A. Cohen, founder of the hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors and a supporter of the Obama campaign, recently held a meeting with Republican candidates in his home in Greenwich, Conn., to strategize about the midterm elections, according to Absolute Return magazine.
Other onetime supporters, like Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, also feel burned by the Obama administration, people close to him say.
That the honeymoon between Washington and Wall Street has turned to bitter recriminations is not news, given that the administration had long pledged to revamp Wall Street regulation in the wake of a crisis that rattled the global financial system.
Less than two years ago, Democrats received 70 percent of the donations from Wall Street; since June, when the financial regulation bill was nearing passage, Republicans were receiving 68 percent of the donations, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group.
But what is surprising is that some of the president's biggest supporters have so publicly derided his policies, even at the risk of hurting their ability to influence the party in the future. Issues like the carry-interest tax on private equity or the Volcker Rule have become personal.
Why so personal? The prevailing view is that bankers, hedge fund mangers and traders supported the Obama candidacy because he appealed to their egos.
Mr. Obama was viewed as a member of the elite, an Ivy League graduate (Columbia, class of '83, the same as Mr. Loeb), president of The Harvard Law Review -- he was supposed to be just like them. President Obama was the ''intelligent'' choice, the same way they felt about themselves. They say that they knew he would seek higher taxes and tighter regulation; that was O.K. What they say they did not realize was that they were going to be painted as villains.
That Wall Street view of itself as a victim has prompted much of the private murmurings and the unfortunate -- or worse -- outburst from Stephen A. Schwarzman, who likened the administration's plan for taxes on private equity to ''when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939.'' Mr. Schwarzman later apologized for the ''inappropriate analogy.''
Now Mr. Loeb, who manages about $3.4 billion at his firm, Third Point Partners, has articulated in a more thoughtful way what a lot of others in finance and business are saying.
''We have given a great deal of thought about the impact that public policy has on individual companies, industries and the economy generally,'' he said. Third Point has sold its investments in big banks as a result of ''regulatory headwinds''; got rid of its stake in Wellpoint, which Mr. Loeb described as ''a statistically cheap stock owned by several hedge funds, but which we saw as being overly exposed to unpredictable government regulation''; and taken a short position against for-profit education companies as a result of ''the government's increased willingness to use its regulatory muscle.''
Mr. Loeb's views, irrespective of their validity, point to a bigger problem for the economy: If business leaders have a such a distrust of government, they won't invest in the country. And perception is becoming reality.
Just last week, Paul S. Otellini, chief executive of Intel, said at a dinner at the Aspen Forum of the Technology Policy Institute that ''the next big thing will not be invented here. Jobs will not be created here.''
Mr. Otellini has overseen two big acquisitions in the last two weeks -- the $7.7 billion takeover of the security software maker McAfee and the $1.4 billion deal for the wireless chip unit of Infineon Technologies. If he is true to his word, those deals will most likely lead to job cuts in the United States, not job creation.
Mr. Loeb declined to comment.
But it seems clear that he wrote the letter because so much of his fund's investments were being driven by the impact of politics. It appears he is no longer betting that a chief executive will make his numbers; he's betting on what legislation Congress will pass next.
Mr. Loeb, whose poison pen is legendary, usually targets obstinate corporate managers or rivals. In one such note to the chief executive of Star Gas Partners, Mr. Loeb wrote: ''It is time for you to step down from your role as C.E.O. and director so that you can do what you do best: retreat to your waterfront mansion in the Hamptons where you can play tennis and hobnob with your fellow socialites.''
In his letter to investors, he took issue with a number of Washington initiatives, including the Credit Card Act of 2009 and a proposed ''enterprise tax'' that would be levied on hedge fund managers who sell their firms.
''So long as our leaders tell us that we must trust them to regulate and redistribute our way back to prosperity, we will not break out of this economic quagmire,'' Mr. Loeb wrote.
''Perhaps our leaders will awaken to the fact that free market capitalism is the best system to allocate resources and create innovation, growth and jobs,'' he continued. ''Perhaps too, a cloven-hoofed, bristly haired mammal will become airborne and the rosette-like marking of a certain breed of ferocious feline will become altered. In other words, we are not holding our breath.''
Critics of Wall Street will rightfully complain that it was the actions of free market capitalists that prompted a push for regulation. On that point, Mr. Loeb does not entirely disagree.
''Many people see the collapse of the subprime markets, along with the failure and subsequent rescue of many banks, as failures of capitalism rather than a result of a vile stew of inept management, unaccountable boards of directors and overmatched regulators not just asleep, but comatose, at the proverbial switch,'' he wrote. ''It is easy to see why so many people have concluded that the entire system is rigged.''

HEADLINE: Nuclear Deal Is Approved In India, With Compromises

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- India's Parliament approved a final, critical piece of a long-delayed landmark civil nuclear agreement on Monday, a pact regarded as a cornerstone of a Bush-era effort to transform the relationship between the United States and the world's largest democracy.
But even as supporters praised a historic victory, the end result is probably not what the United States had hoped for, nor does it seem likely to signal a new era in relations between the United States and India.
Indeed, some analysts say the compromises needed to move Monday's legislation through India's contentious Parliament could undermine the practical impact of a political, diplomatic and economic accord that took years to negotiate. The legislation still requires the signature of the president, a ceremonial gesture that is virtually guaranteed. 
With President Obama scheduled to make his first visit to India in early November, both governments are trying to strengthen a relationship sometimes described as, potentially, a natural and strategic alliance of democracies. But drawing closer has proved complicated as differences remain on issues like trade and climate change, as well as how to effectively deal with Pakistan.
The nuclear issue, putatively about India's future, has set off weeks of bitter political debate in New Delhi and tapped into Indian nationalism and public suspicion of foreign corporate interests, while dredging up a very different chapter in the countries' relations: the 1984 Union Carbide industrial disaster at Bhopal, which killed thousands. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, accused of toadying to the United States, appeared before the lower house of Parliament last week to deny that his allegiance was anywhere but with India.
''We kind of assume that we will be the dominant partner in any partnership,'' said Teresita C. Schaffer, a former envoy to Sri Lanka who also served as an American diplomat in India. ''India does not make that assumption.''
Mr. Singh, who announced the nuclear deal in a 2005 joint statement with former President George W. Bush, has an expansive vision of the role of nuclear energy, to which the deal is limited, as a power source for India's future. For decades after its 1974 nuclear weapon test, India had refused to sign the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and was subjected to a three-decade American moratorium on nuclear trade.
But the deal with the United States opened a controversial back door for India to join the nuclear club while also opening an Indian market estimated at $150 billion to foreign energy companies, once blocked by the moratorium.
Now the question is whether any foreign or even Indian energy company will be willing to enter the market to provide the expertise India needs to expand, because of the liability guidelines codified in the legislation in case of a nuclear accident.
Existing international conventions place liability solely with the operator of a nuclear reactor while immunizing suppliers. But the Indian law bucks international norms and makes suppliers potentially liable, too.
''This makes the fruits of the Indo-U.S. deal go to waste,'' said G. Balachandran, a security analyst in New Delhi with a specialty in nuclear issues. He added: ''It may well be the end of civil nuclear growth in India.''
India currently has 19 nuclear reactors, and the government wants to attract foreign and domestic suppliers to build more. International conventions largely abide by a principle in which liability is ''channeled'' strictly to the operator of a reactor rather than the long list of suppliers.
During the debate before Monday's vote in the upper house of India's Parliament, the government's point man, Prithviraj Chavan, said the law would make India the only country in the world that placed some liability on suppliers. ''The suppliers are not happy,'' Mr. Chavan said.
The government originally proposed legislation more palatable to suppliers, but opposition parties had demanded tougher provisions, particularly after the ghost of the Bhopal disaster inflamed the debate.
In Bhopal, thousands of people were killed after a leak in December 1984 at the Union Carbide pesticide factory unleashed a poisonous cloud over the city. India sought $3.3 billion in damages from Union Carbide, since purchased by the Dow Chemical Company, but would later settle for $470 million. Much of the money has not been distributed, and many victims have gotten only nominal payments.
In June, India's court system announced light criminal sentences for eight former executives of Union Carbide's Indian subsidiary, one of whom had since died. Meanwhile, Warren M. Anderson, the former chairman of Union Carbide, has never been prosecuted, and he still lives in the United States, which has declined to extradite him.
After the issue resurfaced, the public was outraged, and the Bhopal tragedy again dominated the Indian media. Then on Aug. 19, an Indian news channel reported that a senior American official had cautioned a top Indian official in an e-mail that the ''noise'' over the Dow Chemical Company could hurt investment in India. The official, Mike Froman, a deputy national security adviser, issued a statement denying that he was making any sort of threat, but the episode further inflamed the nuclear debate.
The Bharatiya Janata Party, the main opposition, insisted on language that left open the possibility that suppliers could be sued in the case of an accident.
On Monday, Arun Jaitley, the B.J.P. leader in the upper house, scoffed at the notion that foreign energy companies would stay away. He said India's appetite for new nuclear reactors would create a ''buyer's market'' and the law would provide leverage for the government. He said the law abided by the principle of channeling by holding only the operator liable for claims from accident victims. The difference, he said, is that the law allows an operator to sue a supplier under certain circumstances.
Had the law not been changed, he said, it would have been ''a suppliers' immunity law.''
Indian business groups and even the government's own Nuclear Power Corporation of India, which operates the existing reactors, have warned that such liability language was problematic and could dissuade private suppliers.
India already has a separate bilateral agreement with Russia, and liability is less central an issue since Russian companies are state-owned. Yet Russia also has expressed concern. Private companies in other countries, including France, which also has a bilateral agreement with India, could be more exposed.
''It really increases the exposure of Indian and international suppliers,'' said Ashley J. Tellis, a former American diplomat involved in negotiating the framework of the United States-India deal. ''The net effect is that it is going to restrict the prime minister's options and it could even be fatal to his vision of expanding the nuclear power sector in India.''

HEADLINE: Biden Visits Iraq for Major Step in Troop Pullout and to Meet Gridlocked Leaders

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON; Stephen Farrell contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BAGHDAD -- Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. arrived in Baghdad on Monday to commemorate the official end of the United States combat mission and to meet with Iraqi political leaders, who have yet to form a government more than five months after elections.
''We are going to be just fine; they are going to be just fine,'' Mr. Biden told reporters as he prepared to confer with James F. Jeffrey, the new American ambassador in Baghdad, and Gen. Ray Odierno, the departing American commander in Baghdad. 
Lt. Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, General Odierno's successor, who will formally take command on Wednesday, and Gen. James N. Mattis, the head of Central Command, also attended the evening session with the vice president.
The Iraqi public is increasingly discontented with the political gridlock, and American military leaders are concerned that a prolonged stalemate could lead to an erosion of security gains.
In the past few months, insurgents have significantly increased the number of rocket and mortar attacks on the fortified Green Zone that houses the Iraqi government and on Baghdad's international airport.
An aide to Mr. Biden said Iraq had a functioning caretaker government and sought to dispel any sense of crisis. But he acknowledged that the delay in seating a new government had made it hard for Iraq to address longstanding political, legal and economic problems, and to further develop its relationship with the United States. ''To build a partnership, you need a partner,'' said Antony J. Blinken, Mr. Biden's national security adviser. ''The vice president is going to urge the leaders to bring this process to a conclusion.''
The Obama administration has been reported to be sympathetic to a compromise plan in which Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki might retain his post with somewhat more limited powers while a new council with binding authority would be established under Ayad Allawi, a former interim prime minister and leader of a political coalition that is a rival to Mr. Maliki's.
Mr. Blinken said the United States did not have a plan for breaking the political logjam in Baghdad or a specific candidate for prime minister.
Still, he signaled that the Obama administration believed that both Mr. Maliki's State of Law coalition and Mr. Allawi's Iraqiya coalition -- the two leading blocs in the voting in March -- should be part of ''the foundation of the next government,'' along with the Kurdish alliance.
Asked about the bloc of candidates loyal to Moktada al-Sadr, the Shiite anti-American cleric, Mr. Blinken suggested that the United States did not see them as useful members of a new governing coalition -- or, as he put it, the Iraqi government should include ''coalitions that are interested in building a long-term partnership with the United States.''
Mr. Biden also plans to meet with Mr. Maliki; Mr. Allawi; President Jalal Talabani; Vice Presidents Tariq al-Hashimi and Adel Abdul Mahdi; and Ammar al-Hakim, the chairman of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.
Aides said Mr. Biden was previewing President Obama's Tuesday speech with Iraqi leaders; it is intended to reinforce the message that the United States aims to follow through with its troop withdrawal but also wants a long-term relationship with Iraq.
Mr. Biden will attend the ceremony on Wednesday to formally commemorate the end of the combat mission in Iraq and the change of command.
The vice president's trip to Baghdad in a C-17 cargo plane was cloaked in secrecy, reflecting the underlying concern about the security of visiting leaders.
Brig. Gen. Ralph Baker, the deputy commander of American forces in central Iraq, said the number of mortar and rocket attacks on the Green Zone and the international airport totaled around 60 in the past two months, compared with ''two or three'' in previous months.

HEADLINE: Demand for Autos Lifts U.S. Consumer Spending

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans spent money last month at the fastest pace in four months, helped by a jump in demand for automobiles.
Consumer spending rose 0.4 percent in July after three lackluster months, the Commerce Department said Monday. Spending fell 0.1 percent in April, rose a tiny 0.1 percent in May and was flat in June. 
Personal incomes were up 0.2 percent in July, less than expected but at least an improvement over June when incomes had not risen at all.
The July spending gain was the highest since a 0.5 percent rise in March. But the concern is that demand could taper off in the second half of this year if unemployment remains near double digits.
If Americans do not have jobs, they do not have the income to support spending. Consumer spending is critical because it accounts for 70 percent of economic activity in the United States.
With spending rising, the personal savings rate slowed to 5.9 percent of after-tax income. That was down from 6.2 percent in June, the highest in nearly a year. Even with the July decline, the savings rate is nearly three times higher than it was before the recession began in December 2007.
Economists had long worried about low savings in the United States. But recently they had feared that households had become too frugal and were holding back consumer spending.
The gain in spending reflected a 1 percent jump in demand for durable goods. About half of that increase came from a jump in auto sales, the government said.
Economists had expected a rebound in spending for July. An earlier government report showed that retail sales rose during July for the first time in three months.
Still, the economy is growing too slowly to support sustained job growth and some fear it could fall back into a recession. Economic growth slowed to 1.6 percent in the April-to-June quarter, the government reported Friday. That was revised down from the initial estimate of 2.4 percent.
A string of weak economic reports in recent weeks has prompted economists to trim their growth forecasts for the rest of the year and next.

HEADLINE: HSBC Sells U.S. Auto Finance Units to Santander

BYLINE: DEALBOOK


HIGHLIGHT: HSBC Holdings said Tuesday it has sold its last United States auto finance businesses to Spain's Santander for about $3.56 billion in cash, completing its exit from a market that cost it billions during the financial crisis, The Associated Press reported. 

 BODY:
British bank HSBC said Tuesday that it had sold its last United States auto finance businesses to Spain's Santander for about $3.56 billion in cash, completing its exit from a market that cost it billions during the financial crisis, The Associated Press reported.
On top of the payment, the Santander Consumer USA Inc. unit is assuming $431 million in debt, HSBC said. The loan book acquired by Santander was valued at $4.3 billion.
The deal follows a similar move in March, when Santander acquired $1 billion in auto finance loan receivables from HSBC.
HSBC came to grief in the United States through its $14 billion acquisition of Household International in 2002, which made HSBC the biggest subprime lender in the United States.
The company wrote off billions in losses on dud United States loans in the global credit crisis. It announced in March 2009 that it would stop making consumer loans in the United States and would wind down the consumer lending business by 2014.
In the first half of this year, HSBC reported it was still losing money in the United States -- $74 million on a pretax basis compared to a loss of $3.9 billion a year earlier. The company has cut its North American payroll to 34,000 by midyear, down 3,000 from a year earlier.
HSBC shares were down 1.1 percent at 630 pence in early trading on the London Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Passions and Detachment in Journalism

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Can personal passions can be reconciled with professional detachment? A reporter answers yes. 

 BODY:
Last week, in writing about James Hansen's essay on why he became a climate campaigner after decades working as a NASA climate scientist, I promised to post a lecture I gave in 2005 at Willamette University explaining how I reconciled personal passions with the professional detachment that comes with life as a journalist.
Some of you will find several familiar passages, touching on themes that have resonated in me for awhile. (And keep in mind this piece was written while I was still a full-time Times reporter.) The talk starts with my journey from training in biology to a career in journalism, including a fortuitous research fellowship that took me around the world between 1978 and 1980.
The section on covering climate comes toward the end, so feel free to skip down if you're in a rush. Here goes:
I was thankful for the invitation to come to Willamette mainly because of the question that was posed to me. It wasn't just, "Talk about the challenges facing the media or the state of the world." It was personal, powerful and unexpected, the kind of question that people like me ordinarily sweep under the rug: How does a reporter, whose job covering the environment requires dispassionate detachment, reconcile those constraints with the passions and points of view that inevitably emerge in a fully lived life?
It's taken awhile for me to be able to distill my thoughts expressed at the conference into print, but here goes. First of all, I'll prove to you that I am in fact a person first and a writer second, by filling you in a bit on how I got into this line of work.
Essentially, I've backed into my reporting life. I did not come out of the womb, like most of my colleagues, with a pen and notepad in my hand saying, "I'm going to be a newspaper reporter someday."
I was drawn first to the sciences. I was born, raised, and educated in Rhode Island, where I spent a lot of time in winter following rabbit tracks in the snow and, in summer, sailing and snorkeling along the shores of Narragansett Bay, watching scallops clap their shells in their amazing underwater castanet dance. I caught, cleaned, and cooked the occasional flounder. I stomped on low-tide mud flats to elicit the squirt of buried clams. That's where my love of nature began. I also loved to read about people learning to live with nature, both in fiction and nonfiction. Almost every time I had to stay home from school, I ended up re-reading - which hypnotized me with all those descriptions of giant lobsters and snakes. Later I would move on to .
My appreciation for the power human beings wield through technology and wile grew as I approached adolescence. One winter when I was 12 or so, a friend invited me over to his house to try out his BB gun. My dad had one on the small sailboat we cruised around in during the summer, which we used to perforate tossed soda cans so they would sink to the seabed (recycling had not become a movement yet). This time, as Doug and I crouched on the cement steps leading up from his basement to the back yard, we had a different intent. We took turns aiming at the chickadees and titmice that flitted in the trees and on a clothesline strung between two branches. I pulled the trigger. A ball of feathers fluttered wildly and fell to the snow, flinging flecks of blood and down in every direction on the whiteness before it lay still and died. Every detail of that little murder was welded indelibly in my brain. I have great respect for the hunters I know who hone their woodcraft carefully and shoot to kill - and eat. But after I shot that bird, I never shot at a living thing again.
My passion for environmental protection began around the age of 14, when I hiked into the small patch of woods and fields that remained untouched in the expanding suburban grid of streets and lawns around our home and discovered a bulldozer parked in a fresh-cut clearing near my favorite spruce tree. I placed a hand-lettered warning sign on the seat that read something like: "Whoever chops down this tree will suffer a horrible death." 
Beyond my love of nature, I developed a passion for science in high school, largely through the unorthodox educational efforts of two biology teachers, Joe Laterra and Joe Ferretti. Their subversive approach was to let us actually do science instead of just learning it. We studied a salt marsh with state wildlife biologists. I built a wave tank in the back of Mr. Ferretti's classroom, adjusting a small electric fan and a cardboard baffle and other elements until I generated miniature breakers foaming on a mock beach.
Through junior high and high school I enjoyed writing but did not see it as my calling. The only newspaper I worked for until I was an adult was a mimeographed satirical, political, outlaw rant at my high school called EGAD, for . It was the antithesis of good journalism - all innuendo and barbs.
I went to Brown University, where I first read the essays of Rene Dubos and appreciated that a human-altered landscape was not necessarily a bad thing, and also that it was possible to have a positive attitude even in the face of daunting data on the adverse impacts people were having on the planet. His title for a regular column was "The Despairing Optimist," and I have since happily adopted that label for myself.
I graduated in 1978 with a biology degree and was lucky enough to win a traveling fellowship that allowed me to get out into the world beyond New England - far out. My proposal was to go to small islands in the South Pacific and study "man's relationship to the sea" (yet another echo of those Swiss castaways!). In a tiny unwired village at the end of an unpaved road ringing the splendid French Polynesian island of Raiatea, I experienced the Rousseau-like ideal of people living simply, in harmony with nature. But the community was in transition even as I settled in, and the Tahitian friends I made there were clearly eager to move from subsistence to a modern consumer existence. I would return 10 years later and see the consequences of development, for better and worse.
I was lucky again. In Auckland, New Zealand, near the end of that project, I saw a sign on a marina bulletin board that said: "Crew Wanted, Yacht Wanderlust; inquire Marsden Wharf." I ended up becoming the first mate on the 60-foot home-built American sailboat, which was headed around the world. I lived on board for 17 months and we visited 15 countries in 15,000 miles of cruising.
That trip made me want to tell true stories in words and pictures - to be a journalist. I saw and experienced so many wonders along the way, particularly the simple splendor and power of the open sea, that I had to share it all. Something of an epiphany occurred one day as I hiked across a deserted island in the Red Sea and found the windward shore heaped with intact light bulbs. There were all manner of long fluorescent tubes and spotlights and conventional incandescent bulbs lying just above the tide line. It took a moment for me to realize they must have washed there one by one, year after year, probably after being tossed overboard by crewmen on passing ships. This was the first time I really appreciated the power of people to change the world in unintended ways.
Eventually, as happens to everyone who tries to circumnavigate, I came to realize the world actually was round, meaning you inevitably end up pointed back toward where you began. It was time to go home. After seeing extraordinary poverty in places like Djibouti and the wealth of nature in places like the Great Barrier Reef, I just had to tell everybody about it. I tried writing some magazine articles, largely failing. I traveled to Washington and excitedly showed my photographs to an editor at National Geographic. He really liked my eye for an image, but noted that my astigmatism made an awful lot of the shots just the tiniest bit out of focus - and unusable. Maybe there was something about this craft that I actually had to learn, I realized.
I learned journalism basics back in school, at Columbia, and then in a series of jobs as I climbed the profession's rungs, from copy editing to writing to assigning articles to writing books and finally to working for what remains arguably the world's best newspaper - for all its many faults.
All along the way, I settled into the world of journalistic norms. A story has an unavoidable structure. The lead tugs the reader in. The "organ music" or "nut paragraph" tells the reader why an article is important. Balance assures that you've avoided tipping your own hand about what you think or feel about the subject at hand.
In the process I learned to put away my old notions of self, of ego and attitudes. Journalism is probably the purest example of a calling in which you have a discontinuity between the personal and the professional. You are literally not allowed to exist as a person (unless you are a columnist like Tom Friedman or George Will or Dave Barry or write first-person accounts for the New Yorker unless you are expressly, overtly you).
Nowhere is the selflessness more profound than when you work for an institution like Time magazine or The New York Times. You are clearly part of a bigger machine. Newspapers have started to loosen up in how they let writers write. The Los Angeles Times, where I worked briefly in the mid 1980's, was more of a writer-friendly paper. Stories could unfold at a leisurely pace, allowing room for reported "moments" that help build a picture in the reader's mind. In contrast, at The Times, almost like clockwork, memos are circulated one every other year or so admonishing us to write shorter, and shorter yet. Several layers of editors examine each story before it is printed, not only making sure it is comprehensible and correct, but also that it is in Times style, which does not always mean it is in the writer's style.
Sometimes I have found the process exasperating, even dehumanizing, but over my 11 years (and counting) at the paper, one passion of mine has been preserved, and that is the one that drives me every day: my passion for the truth. Of course, there is no truth, really, just a trajectory toward understanding. Any article that implies it presents the bottom line on some issue is probably being dishonest. Too often, journalism aspires to being "right for a day." The facts in a story can all be correct, but it can still distort understanding. That pressure in journalism derives partly from the competitive nature of the business (we desperately want to be the first to say something is so), and the fact that it is, in fact, a business. We have an ingrained tendency to sift for the "front-page thought" in a pile of news that we have absorbed in the course of a day and - without a stiff dose of discipline - this can tempt even the most professional reporter or editor to tilt things just a bit toward hyperbole.
In instances like that, passion can drive a story over the edge. While it might get better "play" the next day and catch more readers' attention, in the end the process bites back. Think of how many stories you've read over the years about coffee and health. One minute coffee is a threat, the next it's a benefit. Major magazines and papers ran cover and front-page stories proclaiming that electromagnetic fields were associated with cancer, and then ran stories when subsequent studies found the risk was unclear, if there was one at all. To some extent this process is merely mirroring the eagerness of society, generally, to crave clarity and recoil from uncertainty. But the media amplify and help perpetuate that swinging pendulum, to my mind. We reporters are not always careful to tell how much we don't know along with how much we have learned. And that can be as important sometimes, whether we're writing about hints of unconventional weapons in Iraq or Alar in apples.
Finding the right approach can be incredibly exasperating to a science writer, and it is passion for the larger truth that pulls us forward. Not long ago, I saw frustration build in a colleague, the veteran medical writer Gina Kolata, as she grappled with a new paper in a respected journal, Science, positing that farmed Atlantic salmon held much higher levels of PCBs and other contaminants in its flesh than did wild salmon. The authors calculated that the risks from these chemical traces meant consumers should not eat more than one salmon meal a month despite the many health benefits conferred by such fish. The Food and Drug Administration, noting that the detected concentrations were dozens of times lower than federal limits, strongly disagreed. Some top toxicologists not aligned with the seafood industry or anyone else also fervently disputed the researchers' risk calculation.
Gina wrote a clear piece that explained the new findings. At the last minute, to make sure hurried readers put things in perspective, she added a vital extra clause to the opening sentence (the italics are mine): "A new study of fillets from 700 salmon, wild and farmed, finds that the farmed fish consistently have more PCB's and other contaminants, ."
Even with that proviso, and a host of researchers' voices further down in the story stressing that the health benefits of eating salmon were far clearer than any small risk from PCBs, readers remained confused. Salmon piled up in some supermarkets. The situation was sufficiently confusing that my brother, a cardiologist and heart-drug researcher, sent me an urgent e-mail asking: "What's the poop on the risk of farmed salmon, dioxin and PCBs? Any truth to it? I eat it as much as three times a week."
I'd covered PCBs for years in the context of the remaining stains buried in the Hudson's river-bottom mud. My own instinct on this, which I conveyed to my brother not as a journalist but simply as a citizen who has had to make judgments in the face of uncertainty, was that he should eat and enjoy (while perhaps avoiding the brownish fatty tissue and-sad to say for sushi-roll lovers-the salmon skin).
There are more profound challenges in the news business. Newspapers are still mainly, and unsurprisingly, a means for informing the public about things that are different today than yesterday, and important today, not someday. That means that slowly emerging problems - think sprawl, think the millions of gas-station drips that add up to 1.5 Exxon Valdez tankers a year, and definitely think global warming - often fail to get the space that they probably deserve.
In my first four years at The Times, I wrote dozens of stories about efforts to preserve the quality of New York City's water supply - 19 reservoirs surrounded by 2,000 square miles of rapidly developing exurbs - without having to build a giant filtration plant. I spent a couple of months reporting what we call "a heave," a big special report on the looming pollution problems that were slowly threatening the water. At the last minute, an editor looked at the length of the story and said, "Isn't this a little ahead of the news?" That, sadly, is a direct quote. I was kind of stunned. I figured it was our job to be a little ahead of the news. And it seemed suddenly like maybe that wasn't necessarily the case. The story survived, albeit cut back, but it nearly got bumped entirely from the front page by the news that Princess Diana had died in a car crash.
No story is less like news than my current stock in trade, global warming. It is the antithesis of news, yet my passion keeps forcing me to write on it, and push to get it space in the paper. For many years, getting the paper to grant space for a story on a significant advance in climate science was something like trying to get an elephant into a Prius. A newspaper is mostly set up to talk about what happened today, maybe sometimes what may happen tomorrow, but not what is going to happen over the course of a century.
I don't see much prospect that I or some other writer will suddenly figure out a new way to tell this story that will magically make it fit into the 20th-century template we still use to decide what is important or newsworthy, and thus galvanize the public to care.
No matter. I'm going to stick with my own sense of what's important, and I'll keep telling those stories in whatever medium is handy. Here's where passion comes into a reporter's life. Newspaper writers, except when faced with breaking news (9/11, New Orleans, the blackout), largely sustain their own lists of stories. We all make choices in doing that. I make my story choices these days based on irreversibility: what problems are emerging that cannot be undone on time scales relevant to human affairs?
The list is short: human-caused global warming, the loss of biodiversity and wilderness, and large human losses from avoidable causes (like predicted floods of sub-sea-level cities; like waterborne disease and the 1.6 million premature deaths occurring each year from mainly women and children inhaling choking plumes of smoke from unvented indoor cooking fires).
I may well be the only reporter at The Times who thinks of a century-scale story, the saga of global warming, as breaking news. My impression is that some of my bosses still don't get it, but they kind of let me keep at it, in the way that a family tolerates an eccentric uncle with odd habits.
My hope is that, slowly (but hopefully not too slowly), humans will grow through their longstanding reliance on those age-old "fight or flight" reflexes that served us so well on the savanna but may not suffice any more.
Our norms, our values, our gauges for measuring costs and benefits, these are the things that would have to change.
While I have spent most of my career writing about science, I'm shifting a bit of late. I've become more convinced than ever that some new scientific finding is not what will trigger change. Science is always going to provide ammunition to everyone in the debate - the naysayers and the apocalyptics and the people in between -- because science is like that. It is murky. It is multifaceted. Climate science, especially, is saddled with inevitable, unavoidable uncertainties. We all kind of proceed, in the political discourse and the media, as if some new breakthrough will suddenly make it all easy, will clarify how much global warming is too much. Many of us, and not just people tied to industry, see uncertainty as a reason to wait, to do more research. Others see the same uncertainty as ample reason to proceed with caution now that we know we are altering the atmosphere in ways that are ratcheting up the planet's thermostat, even if we don't know the details.
But no one can ever expect to see a headline in The New York Times reading: "Global Warming Strikes. Seas Rise. Coasts Flood. Crops Fail. People Flee." All of those things are likely to play out if the world does not find a way to stop emitting greenhouse gases as the global population goes to 10 billion or so and rich and poor nations continue to grow their economies. But they will be dispersed in time and geography, constituting the ultimate slow drip.
What this debate will swing on, ultimately, is the softer stuff -- things like evolving values. How much does one value the quality of a child's adult life? But values and ethics are not the stuff of a hard news story, either. Perhaps they are even less of a story that climate science!
Nonetheless, I've started focusing on that side of things. I wrote a long story in 2005 on efforts by various countries to shift from purely economic measures of progress, like gross domestic product, to broader ones, like Bhutan's notion of "gross national happiness." There, the country is seeking to weigh economic, environmental, cultural, and social factors together as a barometer of wellbeing, not simply growth. The move is inspired partly by studies of wealthy societies that show when a country grows through a certain level of basic prosperity more money does not make people more content.
My prediction is that such efforts will spread. This is likely to be a groundswell that will eventually overwhelm the kind of hard pencil-pusher notion that can be summarized as: "Oh, future generations are always going to be richer and smarter than we are and so they don't need our help right now."
All I can say is that I hope we can find a way through this sort of bottleneck we face. Humans are at this great moment in their cultural evolution, a point when we have begun to recognize that we have in many ways become a planet-scale force. How do we increase the human population by another 50 percent in the next 50 years and come out the other side without diminished possibilities for our successors? I think there are unavoidable losses coming, but many rich prospects will remain.
Somehow, even as we get up in the morning, knowing the scope of the challenge, we have to find a way, at worst, to limit losses and, at best, to make the world a little better than we found it. And we also have to find a way to forgive ourselves for the adolescent exuberance that got us into this fix.
Rene Dubos's notion of the despairing optimist once again comes to mind. Some of that sensibility is reflected in a Portuguese word that a comparative literature professor of mine used to talk about. The word is saudade. It describes the sadness and happiness of reflecting on something cherished that has been lost and might someday be found again. It is a word you'd use to describe the feeling, say, in a Dublin pub around 1 a.m., when patrons are all singing a lament with great smiles on their faces, and tears.
It's kind of like simultaneously sustaining passion and detachment - those qualities in a decent journalist.
We are at a stage of social history not unlike where I was, as an individual, back in 1968, after I watched that little bird die on the snow. That was the first time I really internalized my power to change the world, for better or worse. I adjusted my behavior from that point on. I grew up a little that day.
The question posed to humans now is the same. We are in a race between potency and self-awareness, kind of like the juncture between adolescence and adulthood. The question we face now, and that I will be writing about until I can't write any more is this: What do we want to be when we grow up?
