HEADLINE: Malaysia's Conspiracy Theory Draws Criticism From Albright

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, July 28

 BODY:
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and her deputies waded publicly into a culture clash with Malaysian leaders today, rejecting repeated charges that Southeast Asian currencies were being sabotaged by Westerners and dismissing calls for a rewriting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which Malaysia's Prime Minister called oppressive.
For days now, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has been accusing the American financier and philanthropist George Soros of undermining the currencies of the Southeast Asian countries because they admitted Myanmar into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean. The annual summit meeting of Asean nations is being held here this year, with Malaysia as chairman. 
 Mr. Soros, whose foundation supports a project that monitors human rights in Myanmar, formerly Burma, has denied the charges. The official American reaction has been mild and informal.
But in a speech today, Malaysia's Foreign Minister, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, repeated Dr. Mahathir's accusations in the presence of Ms. Albright and her Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, Stuart E. Eizenstat, and the Americans finally snapped back.
Speaking for the nine-member association, Mr. Abdullah said: "It is indeed troubling that the Asean economies continue to be bedeviled by currency fluctuations caused by hostile elements bent on such unholy actions," which he called "villainous acts of sabotage" and "the height of international criminality." Asean, he said, has "resolved to intensify actions to take countermeasures."
Mr. Eizenstat, with Ms. Albright's approval, tartly rejected the Malaysian theories of conspiracy and said, in remarks later released to the press, that currency fluctuations stem from judgments about a country's economy by "markets as a whole," which speculators ride but do not cause.
Of the currency issue, Mr. Eizenstat said: "Since it has been injected into opening comments by a statement alleging 'sabotage,' we felt it necessary to make a brief statement of our views. Blaming these events on speculators is not supported by the evidence."
"It is in no one's interests to undercut the economies of Asean countries," he continued. "Financial markets detected strains in the economy of one of the Asean countries and acted accordingly. In an increasingly integrated region this has had a mild spillover effect." Since an overheated property market led to a banking and currency crisis in Thailand, which devalued its currency, the baht, on July 2, other Southeast Asian currencies have been put under pressure, including the Malaysian ringgit, the Singapore dollar and the Philippine peso, all of which have lost value against the American dollar.
Manila went to the International Monetary Fund for a stabilization loan 10 days ago, while Bangkok, its currency still slipping, finally announced today that it would seek similar help.
Asean links Brunei, Myanmar, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and Laos. Given that 450 million people are represented and that Asean is now America's fourth-largest trading partner, its economies are crucial to the United States.
Washington "cannot remain indifferent to weird allegations that a respected American citizen is carrying out some financial conspiracy," a senior American official said. "This kind of stuff gets picked up around the world, and we had to answer it."
Dr. Mahathir has vented other anti-Western and anti-American themes during these meetings. He opened with a speech that described the United States as arrogant and unreliable. "We suffered in a bipolar world," he said "We know now that a unipolar world is no better."
Ms. Albright ignored those remarks as typical of Dr. Mahathir's attempts to speak for the Muslim world and developing nations. She concentrated on Southeast Asian efforts to mediate a solution in Cambodia, and on issues like Asean's ability, should it care to use it, to promote democracy in Myanmar, which became a member last week.
But when she saw the Malaysian newspapers early this morning, the State Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, said, she decided she would have to respond later today in another formal association session.
The headline of the New Straits Times read, "U.N. Review Necessary, Says Dr. M." The article described Dr. Mahathir's desire to review and alter the 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The document, signed by most countries but honored fully by few, remains a statement of commitment to individual and social rights and freedoms.
Dr. Mahathir said the declaration had been "formulated by the superpowers, which did not understand the needs of poor countries." The West's insistence that developing countries conform to their high ideals on human rights is "oppressing," he said, and should not remain "a common standard of achievement for all people and all nations."
Mr. Burns quoted Ms. Albright as saying, "It would be a great mistake to consider these principles imposed by the West," and as promising that the United States "would be relentless in its opposition to any attempt to water down the declaration."
Relations with Malaysia are important, Mr. Burns said, "but it's a little bit unusual when you're a guest at an international conference to have the head of state come out with these kinds of pronouncements. We're having a public debate about different views and different values. We need to defend ourselves in public, as the Secretary and Mr. Eizenstat did today, but continue the relationship."
Tonight, Ms. Albright carried the theme into the skits that close the association's meetings. Dressed as Evita and performing a variation of "Don't Cry for Me, Argentina," she sang:
Don't cry for me Aseanies,
The truth is I always loved you.
All through the SLORC days
and the Hun Sen days . . .
I came here to talk to your leaders,
But they were all on the golf course
So I went back to
Sunway Laguna
And called George Soros,
Talked market forces.
Hatched a conspiracy,
The rest is history.

HEADLINE: Lincoln National Set to Acquire Bulk of a Cigna Business

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
Seven weeks after selling its big home and automobile insurance unit, the Lincoln National Corporation said yesterday that it was buying most of the Cigna Corporation's individual life insurance business for $1.4 billion.
Emblematic of the consolidation that is sweeping the insurance industry, the deal contributes to the plans of both Lincoln National and Cigna to reshape their organizations. As Cigna is moving away from individual life insurance toward a greater emphasis on employee benefits and other corporate sales, Lincoln National is widening its base as a financial services company focusing on individuals. 
 "In a strategic sense, this is a good fit for both parties," said Patrick Finnegan, a senior insurance analyst for Moody's Investors Service.
Investors in Cigna showed their approval by sending the company's shares up 3 percent, or $5.9375, to $196.9375. Shares of Lincoln National, slipped 43.75 cents, to $67.
Lincoln National, which is based in Fort Wayne, Ind., sold its home and auto insurance business in June to the Safeco Corporation so it could concentrate on life insurance, annuities and investment management. At the time, Ian M. Rolland, the chairman and chief executive of Lincoln National, said he would use much of the more than $2 billion in proceeds to expand his company's reach in financial services. His announced purchase of Cigna would do just that.
One of the most attractive features of the Cigna business, Mr. Rolland said yesterday, was its force of 600 career agents who have moved far beyond the traditional role of life insurance agents to operate as financial planners, offering not only their traditional product but mutual funds and stocks and bonds as well.
The Cigna agents, who have been catering to the most affluent Americans, are models for what Mr. Rolland wants the rest of his 1,700 agents to become.
Mr. Finnegan of Moody's said the acquisition was likely to lead to substantial savings for Lincoln National through economies of scale.
Indeed, Mr. Rolland said that by the end of 1999 he hoped to trim $40 million from the current operating expenses of $500 million for the two life insurance businesses.
In February, Cigna expanded its longtime health maintenance organization and traditional health insurance operations with the $1.7 billion purchase of Healthsource Inc. Cigna's other employee benefits products include disability insurance, group life and accident insurance and retirement plans. The company, based in Philadelphia, is also a leader in corporate property insurance.
"Our strategic focus is on dealing with companies as opposed to dealing with individuals," said Michael J. Monroe, a Cigna vice president.
Cigna has been successful with the individual insurance business that it is selling to Lincoln National, with annual returns of about 15 percent a year, Mr. Monroe said. "But we were a small, niche-oriented player in individual life insurance," he said. "We were focused on selling to small businesses, entrepreneurs and professionals."
Lincoln National is getting most of Cigna Individual Insurance for the $1.4 billion in cash -- about three times book value, by Cigna calculations. But Cigna is holding on to two parts of the division: its corporate life insurance program, which covers corporate executives, and its life reinsurance company, which sells coverage to companies that sell life insurance directly to the public. Cigna plans to keep $225 million of the unit's accumulated capital, which Mr. Monroe said would give Cigna a net of $1.6 billion in the deal, or nearly what Cigna paid for Healthsource.
Mr. Monroe said Cigna planned to use the new money chiefly to buy back its stock. Given the recent acquisition of Healthsource, he said, the company has "a limited appetite for another major health care acquisition.
"But," he added, "I wouldn't necessarily rule that out. We're always looking at what's going on in the marketplace."
Lincoln National, which has been a leader in annuities sales, is increasing its efforts with individual life insurance as sales in the life insurance industry have been declining. But sales of larger, more expensive policies have been going well, and that is where Lincoln National is concentrating.
"They are a major player in the annuities business, and this acquisition allows them to balance their overall business profile by adding a very sizable block of individual life insurance," said Larry Mayewski, a senior vice president for A. M. Best, the rating agency.
The combination of the sales forces, he added, opens up opportunities for cross-selling.
Mr. Rolland said he believed that the prospects for life insurance were particularly good in estate planning and in coverage that helps businesses weather the loss of key executives.
To offset their losses in life insurance, many companies have been emphasizing annuity sales. Lincoln National plans to expand in that area also, Mr. Rolland said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
As Currency Crisis Roils Asia, Thais Ask I.M.F.'s Help

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, July 28

 BODY:
The fast-growing countries of South and Southeast Asia, regarded for years as the most economically promising of the world's developing nations, have been shaken by a plunge in their currencies.
While the crisis has reached outward to Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines, its center has been Thailand, where hard-willed global currency traders first sensed profit in a looming financial crisis stemming from a buildup of debt and a slowdown in growth. 
 Today, the Thai Government formally decided to seek International Monetary Fund assistance, underscoring the severity of its troubles and its inability to contain them.
In return for a special credit line that could total billions of dollars, however, the I.M.F., might ask for politically unpopular measures to patch up an economy that the Thai Finance Minister, Thanong Bidaya, compared tonight to "a water tank with a leak."
Thailand's action brings full circle a series of events that began on July 2, when the nation's central bank took steps to ease the pressure on its currency, the baht -- in effect, a devaluation. In the three weeks or so since, the Philippines has sought assistance from the I.M.F., and the currencies of Malaysia and Indonesia have fallen, making life more expensive and creating a welter of economic and political problems for governments.
From small towns to meetings of top Asian leaders, the talk is of devaluation, of economic stability (or instability) and of the perfidy of the West. But underlying the pain and the polemics, there is spreading concern over whether the supercharged growth of the past is ending, whether the economies of South and Southeast Asia are approaching a crossroads.
"Asia has to be prepared for much slower growth in the coming 10 years," said Nikhil Srinivasan, a vice president at Morgan Stanley in Bangkok. "These tigers are going to be roaring much less loudly."
Indeed, Thailand, long considered one of the region's most robust economies, faces a five-year supply of residential and commercial real estate, the result of a wild lending and construction boom at a time when growth indicators seemed to point only upward. The country's exports are sharply down compared with last year, and the Thais are facing their first budget deficit in a decade.
Economic growth this year, by some estimates, is expected to cool to 3.2 percent. While that might invite envy in Europe or the United States, it is sharply off from a pace of nearly 9 percent two years ago.
In Bangkok today, the suggestion of an I.M.F. rescue sent the Stock Exchange of Thailand index up more than 5 percent. Since the Thai baht was cut loose to float at market rates, stocks have risen 29 percent.
After the request for I.M.F. aid was announced, the governor of the Bank of Thailand, Rerngchai Marakanond, who had been orchestrating the defense of the baht, resigned.
The I.M.F. help, if it is granted, is likely to carry with it a range of belt-tightening requirements for the Thais -- including reining in lending, allowing foreign banks greater access and, most important, cutting back Government spending. Some economists predicted that a recession could follow.
In Washington, a spokesman for the I.M.F. said it had dispatched about half a dozen officials, who arrived in Bangkok over the weekend, but that no determination on assistance had been made. "We do have a staff team there, and we are discussing policy actions with the Thai authorities," the spokesman said.
Analysts, and bankers at the Union Bank of Switzerland, have estimated that Thailand will need as much as $20 billion in credits. When asked about those estimates, another spokesman at the I.M.F. said it was too early to set such a figure.
In a sense, a measure of economic hubris has overtaken Southeast Asia, and the face of the region has reflected it. Old cities have been transformed into stretches of mirrored towers, new centers of commerce and finance. Roads are clogged with the sclerosis of growing wealth, private cars and motorcycles. Airports, once genteel single-runway, cozy-terminal affairs, are woefully inadequate and vast new airports are either muddy construction sites or still on the drawing boards.
Growth seemed unstoppable. Investment from the United States and Europe surged, as did the appetites of the industrial nations for the products churned out of factories across the region, from semiconductors to running shoes, silk to tires.
Now, the euphoria has dissipated as the global currency traders have decided that some of the shine on Asian economies glittered over growing patches of rust. A spreading pattern of current-account deficits, wild overspending on property that sent prices in many countries spiraling upward, and a yearlong slowdown in exports convinced many traders that the region's currencies, beginning with the Thai baht, were worth a lot less than they were being traded for.
The swiftness with which devaluations have swept the region suggested that underlying problems had been ignored in the charge into economic growth. At the Asian Development Bank in Manila, Vishvanath V. Desai, the chief economist, perceives several broad problems that have eaten into the region's economies, problems that he says are correctable but that will inhibit any rapid return to the heydays of recent years. He lists them as follows:
*The steady appreciation of the United States dollar, to which many regional currencies have been linked. By making exports expensive abroad, this has undermined the competitiveness of these economies.
*A failure by many countries to invest in basic facilities and services, and in the development of banking systems and financial regulation. Such failures were compounded by a lag in investment in education, skills training and language competence, particularly in the use of English.
*A growing tendency of wages to begin outpacing productivity gains.
*In some countries, a splurging on major building and infrastructure projects without regard for their necessity or the way in which they would be financed.
"These elements have been accumulating for some time," Mr. Desai said. "Some kind of cleansing I hope will take place now."
But Miron Mushkat, chief economist for Lehman Brothers in Hong Kong, cautioned against overstating the troubles confronting the region. "Clearly there are cyclical problems," he said. "The questions about Southeast Asian economies concern labor forces that are less educated, infrastructure -- that's a bottomless pit -- and competitiveness."
"In Thailand," he said, "the currency devaluation is a symptom of major imbalances in the economy," quickly adding, "It's not a tumor."
At the same time, Mr. Srinivasan of Morgan Stanley pointed to other economies whose growth will increasingly challenge South Asia's. The future, he said, "lies with the big economies of Asia, China and India, where you don't have to rely exclusively on export markets for growth."
"Regional competition in Southeast Asia is going to pick up," he predicted.
Indeed, while the shock to Asian economies is still being assessed by governments, economists and traders, Mr. Desai said that in the end the region would benefit. "If we are talking about the next 12 months, certainly all this has not helped," he said, adding, "But I think these economies should be growing again at a fair clip in the second half of 1998 and thereafter."

HEADLINE: In a Borough of Immigrants, A Strong Market for Hovels

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY and MIRTA OJITO 

 BODY:
A prospective tenant is led into yet another of the human beehives found behind the pleasant facades of residential homes in Queens. The first floor has been carved into five cubicles, the second into six. Some renovations are so recent that chunks of plaster litter the parquet floor, and wooden door frames have yet to be painted.
The house is on 73d Street in Jackson Heights, where such illegal conditions are as common as the sidewalk peddlers hawking their mangoes and coconuts, as predictable as the No. 7 trains that rumble from above Roosevelt Avenue. 
 Twenty blocks away, at 34-57 93d Street, more than 40 people were recently found to be living in crushing closeness on the first floor. The tenants were deaf Mexicans living like indentured servants. Smuggled into the United States to sell trinkets on the New York subways, they turned over the dollar bills they collected to bosses they feared. The extraordinary circumstances sparked international outrage.
But in the context of a large swath of Queens, there was also an element of the ordinary to the sad discovery. They were just another clutch of immigrants, crammed into another house not designed to shelter so many people. If there is surprise, it comes from how easily such illegal conditions can be ignored in a city that has returned to its former stature as one of the country's most desirable places in which to live.
Few in Jackson Heights said they were surprised by the discovery. "I can't say I was shocked by it," said John D. Sabini, a city councilman whose district includes part of Jackson Heights. "Things go on in some of these blocks in Jackson Heights, Corona and Elmhurst that are below the radar."
Fernando Raposo, who has owned a house just a few steps away from the 93d Street house for 36 years, gave a what-else-is-new shrug. He leaned against his gate and jabbed a finger in the direction of five other houses. "That one, this one, the green one, the one on the other side and this other one right here," he said. "There is no telling how many people live there."
Jackson Heights and the borough of Queens have become ground zero in New York City for the illegal conversion of one- and two-family homes into makeshift boardinghouses. And while few people were taken aback by the living conditions at 93d Street, the proliferation of places like it has created a divisive tension between longtime residents who see the character of their community changing, and their newest neighbors, who feel unwelcome and misunderstood.
At its root, the phenomenon reflects an established yet unspoken arrangement among three interests. Poor people, including immigrants, need cheap housing. That need creates a market for landlords whose commitment to zoning laws can wane in the face of profit. And the city has generally looked the other way.
Last October, in a series of six articles in The New York Times about poor housing conditions in the city -- including illegal conversions in Queens -- housing experts explained that the city is saddled with both an inadequate housing supply and an overwhelmed code-enforcement system. At the time, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani declined requests for comment.
But days after a fire in April killed four Polish immigrants in an illegally converted house in Maspeth, Queens, the Giuliani administration and Ms. Shulman unveiled what they called a comprehensive plan to eradicate the problem, a plan that Ms. Shulman's aides said had been in the works for several months. They established a task force, drafted city and state legislation and vowed to impose stiffer penalties against landlords who flout zoning laws.
After the recent discovery of the deaf Mexicans in Jackson Heights -- as well as another dozen in an apartment in Corona -- city officials renewed their call for swift action.
 
The Larger Question Of a Housing Shortage
Still, the clarion call for stepped-up enforcement does not address the larger question, housing advocates say. If the struggling immigrants of Mexico -- and Pakistan, and the Dominican Republic and Russia -- can no longer find cubicles to rent for $300 a month, where will they live? Rents continue to rise in a city where vacancy rates, especially for low-income apartments, are chronically low. And space in homeless shelters, now considered politically unpalatable, continues to shrink.
An enforcement crackdown "is only half the equation," said Mary Brosnahan, the executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless. "If you lack some housing for folks to wind up in, they will simply escape through the cracks to another neighborhood. And another substandard housing market will arise to absorb these folks."
Ms. Brosnahan added that she has been working recently on the case of a woman from India, who in desperation was paying $100 a month to sleep on a kitchen table in an apartment in Queens.
The city finds itself in a dilemma, its officials acknowledge, and nowhere is that predicament more apparent than in that section of northern Queens called Jackson Heights. Created in the early 1900's as a planned community, it has been celebrated as much for its cultural diversity as for the garden courtyards of its apartment buildings. It is known as the Colombian capital of New York, but the countries represented among its populace number more than 70. There are Italian cafes and Indian diners, Argentine steakhouses and Mexican luncheonettes.
But diversity does not always translate into harmony. Some of the established residents see their hard work -- from creating a historic district to launching beautification projects -- being jeopardized by the influx of people living in carved and quartered spaces. The complaints often follow the same logic: a mostly suburban area has become crowded with people who send their children to the schools, place their garbage cans at the curb -- and, because many of them are illegal residents, do not pay taxes.
Now, they argue, the community of garden apartments has a less savory reputation. Its school district is the most overcrowded in the city, so much so that the Board of Education plans to tear down a Jewish community center to build a 600-seat elementary school. And so many brothels were cropping up along Roosevelt Avenue that the Police Department had to create a task force; along the avenue there sits a blue-and-white trailer with a sign that reads, "N.Y.P.D. Prostitution Removal Program."
Why, some longtime residents ask, have so many immigrants chosen Jackson Heights? The answers range from the economic vagaries of other countries to turn-of-the-century decisions about subway destinations to the nature of the housing stock in Queens.
Take the growing numbers of Mexicans drawn to Jackson Heights, a pattern so recent that demographers are only now beginning to measure its dimensions. Hundreds of people, perhaps thousands, have come from Mexico City and the state of Puebla to settle into the drab, two-story houses along the blocks closest to Roosevelt Avenue.
The economic recession that grips Mexico has prompted them to emigrate. And they have chosen Jackson Heights, immigration experts say, for two primary reasons: New York City is considered to be more hospitable than California, and a tight network of friends and family have told them of the job possibilities.
"Entire Mexican neighborhoods have been replicated in Jackson Heights," said Rafael Grasso, the director of an immigrant-outreach program called Concerned Citizens of Queens. "People in some of these towns know the exact corners where they can go to find jobs."
 
Always Rush Hour On the No. 7 Line
And the No. 7 subway, sometimes called "the immigrant express," helps them get to those jobs. The line provides cheap transportation to the factory jobs in Long Island City, the baby-sitting jobs in Manhattan, the kitchen jobs in restaurants along the subway route. "You can go to the 90th Street subway station in Jackson Heights at one in the morning," Councilman Sabini said. "And it looks like rush hour."
At the same time, a generation has married and moved away, leaving parents with "empty nests" in the heart of Jackson Heights. They sell their one- and two-family homes to people who may need extra income to pay the mortgage or are interested in illicit profit. They rent out a finished basement, split the living room in half, slap up partitions and even pave the backyard to rent out parking spaces.
"People in the neighborhood continually report to us houses where extra people have moved in," said Thomas D. Raffaele, the chairman of Community Board 3, which covers Jackson Heights and parts of Elmhurst and Corona. "And we have been protesting for years to try and get increased enforcement regarding illegal conversions."
To respond to the complaints coming from Queens, the Buildings Department put a plan into effect in March that some say was long overdue: it created a "quality-of-life" task force of eight inspectors to work weekends and nights, when tenants are more likely to be home. In four months, the special squad issued 1,770 violations, either for working without a permit or for violating occupancy regulations.
Frequently, those found to be living in illegal conditions are people who are new to the United States, people like Shahid Shan. Mr. Shan, 28, came from Pakistan three years ago, and now works as a stock boy in a grocery store in Jamaica. He pays $200 a month for a small room in a single-family house on 73d Street.
His bedroom is the house's former living room. And the space that used to be the dining room has been carved into two more rooms, where a woman from India and a family of three from Bangladesh live. But the tight accommodations serve his need, Mr. Shan said. He works so much that he is never home long enough to use either the kitchen or the only bathroom.
"I feel for them," said Mary Sarro, who for many years was the district manager of Board 3. "But there's two sides to a coin: some immigrants are great, and then you have the tail of the coin, an equal number that are very, very bad. The bad ones are destroying neighborhoods."
Ms. Sarro emphasized that she was the granddaughter of immigrants, but the community she has lived in for 45 years is changing, she said, for the worse. And to emphasize the point, she rattled off four addresses of homes that she said had been illegally converted.
"Why the hell do we have law and order?" she said. "Why do we have borders? It's absolutely asinine. Many of the immigrants are hard-working. But at the same time, if they're illegal, that's another chapter in a book. What should we do? I don't think we should destroy my neighborhood."
 
Valid Complaints, Or Xenophobia?
Others find xenophobic threads running through such arguments. Longtime residents have been known to complain about the smell of curry emanating from the Indian restaurants, about the Latin American peddlers clogging the sidewalks with their boxes of fruit, and, now, about the sheer numbers of their newest neighbors, the Mexicans.
Arturo I. Sanchez, an urban planner who was recently appointed to the community board, said there is a need for historical perspective. Remember, he said: many of the grandparents and great-grandparents of the people speaking out on illegal conversions were peddlers, and many of them took in boarders illegally to pay the rent.
"This is nothing new," said Mr. Sanchez, who is an immigrant from Colombia. "If you're going to hark back to the historical experiences of your grandparents, be historically accurate."
But the quandary that now bedevils Jackson Heights is often of little concern to those illegal immigrants who have come to New York City with neither intention nor recourse to stay. Their plan is simple: to work and work and work, until they have earned enough to live modestly well in their native countries.
There is Javier, 23, who came to New York illegally from Mexico a year ago, and so is reluctant to give his last name. He works 11 hours a day, six days a week, making deliveries for a delicatessen in Manhattan. He sends some money home, and spirits the rest away for his eventual return.
Meanwhile, he pays $125 a month for a corner of an apartment that he shares with eight other young men from Mexico. Old Happy New Year paper signs and Christmas lights adorn the window of his tiny room. Clothes hang from nails on the wall because, he said, he decided not to spend money on furniture.
He apologized for the messy condition of the house, but he said that no one is ever home to tidy up.

HEADLINE: Videotape Shows Pol Pot Facing Khmer Rouge Justice

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 28

 BODY:
Pictures from an extraordinary show trial in a jungle clearing in Western Cambodia appear to provide the first concrete evidence that Pol Pot, the 69-year-old Khmer Rouge leader who has not been seen in public for nearly two decades, is alive and in the custody of his former comrades.
Videos filmed on Friday show Pol Pot sitting mute before an audience of hundreds of Cambodians who cheered as he was denounced at a two-hour meeting meant to show he was no longer the leader of the nearly moribund Khmer Rouge movement. 
 The Cambodian Communist leader most responsible for the death of more than one million Cambodians was easily recognizable, though his shoulders now stoop, his hair has turned entirely gray, and age spots dot his face.
The man sitting on a folding chair in the jungle shed looked very much like the Pol Pot whom this reporter interviewed for two hours over 18 years ago. That was his first and last meeting with Western journalists. Nate Thayer, reporting for The Far Eastern Economic Review, was at the show trial and made the videotape available to the ABC News program "Nightline," which planned to broadcast it tonight.
In 10 minutes of the footage previewed by this reporter today, Pol Pot used gestures similar to those he made in that interview years earlier. Now, however, he wore the air of a defeated man, dressed plainly and wearing white plastic sandals -- not the tailored Mao suits he wore while in power. The show trial took place in a simple shed with a corrugated metal roof propped up with thick poles.
Reports that there had been a trial first surfaced over the weekend, but were initially dismissed as a propaganda maneuver by the Khmer Rouge to distance themselves from Pol Pot. In June, the now-deposed First Prime Minister, Norodom Ranariddh, said his party was talking to some Khmer Rouge leaders about turning over Pol Pot to an international tribunal.
With this apparent confirmation that Pol Pot is alive, foreign officials began seeking ways to convince the Cambodian leader Hun Sen to agree to renew attempts to bring Pol Pot to trial. In the process, Mr. Hun Sen, Cambodia's Second Prime Minister, who ousted Prince Ranariddh early this month, might shore up his reputation.
"We're going to go right after Pol Pot," said a Clinton Administration official. "One point of discussion we want to have with Hun Sen is to say he can work his way back into the world's good graces by turning this guy over."
Officially, a spokesman for the State Department, James Foley, said the United States supported efforts to prosecute Pol Pot, but would not recognize the trial conducted last week. He said the United States had no independent confirmation of Pol Pot's whereabouts.
"We do not condone trials in absentia or legal proceedings inconsistent with accepted United Nations and international legal norms, as this jungle trial appears to be," he said.
In Cambodia, reactions to reports and pictures of the trial have been confused. Mr. Hun Sen dismissed the show trial as a ploy. Experts believe that even without Pol Pot as its head, the Khmer Rouge movement is so weak Mr. Hun Sen can ignore it while he consolidates his power.
Yet earlier this month, Mr. Hun Sen said he was deposing Prince Ranariddh because the royalist leader had tried to negotiate an amnesty for some Khmer Rouge figures and the surrender of Pol Pot. Overlooked in these accusations is the fact that Mr. Hun Sen and his political party have also negotiated with the Khmer Rouge. Mr. Hun Sen's Cambodia People's Party now counts thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers and nearly a dozen fairly high-level officials within its ranks. Prince Ranariddh won nationwide elections in 1993 and relented to Mr. Hun Sen's demands to share power only after the latter threatened a coup then.
The atmosphere at the show trial was reminiscent of other political prosecutions in Communist history, like those conducted during China's Cultural Revolution in the 1960's, when disgraced leaders were made to listen to insults at choreographed meetings.
In Cambodia last week, according to the videotape, speakers walked up to a microphone on a folding table to shout at Pol Pot. One man said: "We've all undergone tough lives, full of massacres. Hundreds of thousands of people were killed and injured. Why?"
The audience responded by raising their fists and yelling: "Crush, crush, crush!"
But unlike the purge trials conducted in the Soviet Union under Stalin, the sentence was relatively mild: life imprisonment.
Pol Pot, who appeared frail and is said to be suffering from malaria and a serious heart condition, was supported by two soldiers as he walked. The women and children, largely segregated to one side at the trial, were decades younger, as were the soldiers seated on the other side. Ta Mok and Khieu Samphan, the two Khmer Rouge leaders who reportedly captured Pol Pot, were not in attendance.
Nor was there any pretense of judicial process at the hearing. According to translations and a script provided by ABC News, the nearly two-hour hearing was a series of insults. There was no attempt to tally the destruction wrought by Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge, who governed Cambodia from 1975 through 1979, leaving the country's institutions in ruins.
Also in the dock with Pol Pot were the Khmer Rouge generals So Sareuan, Nhem San and Phok Khan. It was unclear whether they received harsher judgments.
After the show trial the Khmer Rouge issued a statement saying they would not hand Pol Pot over to an international tribunal to be tried for crimes against humanity. But they did not state why they chose this moment to try Pol Pot.
The immediate trigger for the show trial appears to have been last month's killing of the Khmer Rouge leader Son Sen and his family at Pol Pot's orders. This frightened the remaining leaders, especially Ta Mok, who feared Pol Pot would kill him next and decided to save his own life by capturing Pol Pot and holding him, according to Stephen Heder, an American scholar of Cambodia and lecturer at London's School of Oriental and African Studies.
"The Khmer Rouge movement is in irredeemable crisis," said Mr. Heder. "Nothing they try works, and they are finally blaming Pol Pot."
Since nearly every Cambodian leader has been associated with the Khmer Rouge in one way or another, Mr. Heder argued, it will be impossible to say with any finality that the Khmer Rouge are no longer in power even if the movement itself is largely powerless without Pol Pot at its head.
"The Khmer Rouge are everywhere and nowhere," said Mr. Heder. "It's reduced to a political label now."

HEADLINE: Joan H. Frank, 77, a Producer Known for a Hallmark TV Series

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN 

 BODY:
Joan Heming Frank, a television producer who worked on the original "Hallmark Hall of Fame" drama series in the 1950's and 60's when the performances were broadcast live from a studio in Brooklyn, died on Thursday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 77.
The cause was cancer, her brother, Charles E. Heming, said. 
 Mrs. Frank worked for Compass Productions, which made "Hallmark Hall of Fame," the series of distinguished dramas that in its early years came from the NBC studios in Brooklyn, with actors like Greer Garson and Christopher Plummer.
In the days before pretaped shows, she was part of a six-member production team that brought a script from rehearsal through live production in about a month, said Mildred Schaefer, whose husband, George, headed Compass Productions.
Presentations of the Hallmark television series, sponsored by the greeting card company, almost always had an uplifting ending and were shown about five times a year, usually two weeks before major holidays. The series, now taped and broadcast on CBS, had its 190th performance in December.
Mrs. Frank was born in White Plains in 1920 and graduated from Vassar College in 1942. She worked as an economist during World War II in the Office of Price Administration in Washington and was married to John V. Frank, the president of a travel service. Mr. Frank died in 1991.
After moving to New York City, she pursued her love of the arts. "She was always the avid theatergoer, moviegoer," Mrs. Schaefer said. "She was never in it for the money or the salary. She just loved the whole world of that, especially creating things."
In recent years, Mrs. Frank worked with the Central Park Conservancy and at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Earlier, she had worked in political campaigns for Herbert H. Lehman and Franklin D. Roosevelt.
In addition to her brother, she is survived by a son, Daniel H. Frank of Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.; a daughter, Katherine L. Frank of Manhattan; two sisters, Delia H. Cantor and Harriet H. Simpson, and five grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Adult Prisons Won't Reform Young Criminals;
Treat Drug Offenders

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"New York's Prison Building Fever" (editorial, July 24) notes Gov. George E. Pataki's assertion that "more prison beds are needed to handle an increasing number of violent offenders." However, there has been a dramatic decline in the number of reported violent crimes and the number of offenders sent to prison for them. Scarce prison beds in New York have increasingly been occupied by nonviolent felons, particularly low-level drug dealers and drug users. 
 Since 1983, the percentage of violent felony commitments has plummeted from 63 percent to just 29 percent of those entering New York's prisons. The percentage of those committed for drug offenses alone has skyrocketed from just 12 percent in 1983 to 46 percent in 1996.
A Rand Corporation study has found that treatment is 10 times more effective than conventional sentences at reducing serious crime, and 15 times more effective than mandatory minimum prison sentences. Drug treatment also costs one-tenth to two-thirds as much as imprisonment.

Film Depicts Pol Pot Facing Show Trial In Cambodia
Video film seemed to show Pol Pot being tried by young soldiers of the Khmer Rouge he once led. The pictures appeared to be the first concrete evidence that Pol Pot, who has not been seen in public for nearly two decades, is alive. The trial consisted of a torrent of insults. At its conclusion, the man held most responsible for the death of one million Cambodians received a sentence of life imprisonment. After the show trial the Khmer Rouge announced they would not hand Pol Pot over to an international tribunal to be tried for crimes against humanity. A1

Subtle Shift for NATO in Bosnia
After long holding that their mandate did not allow them to help Bosnian refugees return to homes from which they were driven during the war, NATO troops have quietly begun doing just that. American soldiers have helped scores of Croatian and Muslim families return to their villages around Brcko, an area under Serb control. The 1995 Dayton accords that ended the war guaranteed refugees the right to return. A3

HEADLINE: Clinton Urges Minimum Wage for Workfare

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev., July 28

 BODY:
President Clinton today put himself at odds with Republican governors and insisted that welfare recipients who are placed in state workfare programs be paid the equivalent of the minimum wage.
In a speech to the National Governors' Association, an organization he once headed, Mr. Clinton also asked the governors to use the savings from moving people off welfare for other programs for the remaining recipients, not to divert the money to other state needs. "I think if we were to revert these savings to other things away from welfare reform," he said, "it would be a big mistake that would come home to haunt the states the next time there is an economic downturn." 
 Almost a year ago Mr. Clinton signed legislation, written by Republicans, that eliminated the 60-year-old Federal entitlement of aid to poor women and dependent children and replaced it with bloc grants to the states. The legislation required work after two years for most recipients and limited lifetime benefits to five years. It also shifted to the states immense authority to determine how to craft their individual welfare and work programs.
The shift in power seemed evident today. Instead of states asking as they once did for Federal authority to experiment, Mr. Clinton cited the states he thought were moving in the right direction and urged other governors to follow their lead.
Noting that 30 out of 50 states were using welfare checks to subsidize private employers who hire welfare recipients, Mr. Clinton urged all states to do so. He also called on the states to take advantage of a provision to be included in the budget agreement that will allow them to grant tax credits to private employers who hire welfare recipients.
In addition, Mr. Clinton called on the governors to press Congress to approve his proposal to allot $600 million in Federal transportation funds for states to create programs to help welfare recipients get to jobs.
Mr. Clinton and the governors have been at odds over the President's insistence that people on welfare are generally entitled to the equivalent of the minimum wage and other protections of Federal labor laws.
Some governors have said that if they have to pay the minimum wage for workfare programs, they will not be able to create enough jobs to meet the work requirements of the 1996 welfare law. But labor unions have been fighting hard for such workers to be given benefits equivalent to the minimum wage because of concerns that that welfare recipients might be used to displace better paid public employees.
Several Republican governors generally supported Mr. Clinton's speech, although some said they worried that the President would burden the states with his insistence that welfare recipients in work programs have the protections of the fair labor laws. Tonight, after an announcement of a budget agreement made it clear that the President had won in his effort to keep workfare recipients subject to Federal labor laws, the Republican governors released a statement warning that "this would discourage millions of Americans from moving from welfare to work."

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
For Yankees and Irabu, Hype and Big Plans Backfire

BYLINE: By Claire Smith 

 BODY:
New York is a funny town. Yesterday, it was downright hysterical, screeching over the Rangers' failure to break the bank for Mark Messier while at the same time smirking over the Yankees' insistence on breaking the bank for a couple of ineffective pitchers named Hideki Irabu and Kenny Rogers.
One year after George Steinbrenner signed a supposed known quantity in Rogers for $20 million only to see the veteran left-hander flop in New York, the Yankee owner turned around and signed an unknown quantity in Irabu for an astounding $12.8 million. 
 And what did he get? A pitcher so unnerved after only four starts that he has been sent, in full retreat, back to the minor leagues.
The Yankees, it seems, conceded that Irabu, at 2-2 with a burgeoning 7.97 earned run average and the look of a deer caught in the headlights, currently had no idea of what to expect in the major leagues. Teams such as the Seattle Mariners, who thrashed the pitcher for six runs in two innings on Saturday, clearly seemed too much for him.
Irabu looks scared, pitches scared and obviously is not yet ready for the big boys. That embarrassed the Yankees, who found out, probably to the delight of every club that cannot spend as wildly, that while the Irabu hype was inflated, the talent of hitters like Matt Williams and Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez never was.
Irabu and his representatives greatly oversold, if not overestimated, a pitching talent that may one day shine in the majors, but is not ready right now. The possibility that Irabu would not measure up to his hype was present from the moment the Yankees began their pursuit of the Japan native. But that didn't slow down the Yankees, the one team above all others that was guaranteed to dive in, headfirst, with wallets open.
Now, with their faces red, the Yankees acknowledged their miscalculation yesterday while picking up the unwanted distinction of having the most expensive Class AAA pitcher in baseball this side of Brien Taylor.
It's clear that Irabu isn't going to pitch for the Yankees in the foreseeable future. But the club is still noncommittal when it comes to the question of Rogers, who has offered little more than minimum dividends one and a half seasons into his four-year deal.
Interestingly, Irabu's demotion does not automatically mean that the disappointing Rogers will regain his lost spot in the rotation. The nod could go to Ramiro Mendoza, the bargain-basement right-hander who may not have as much money as Irabu and Rogers, but who has shown more fortitude.
And should Rogers fail to gain his freedom from his current exile in the Yankee bullpen, the Yankees will find themselves in a comical situation in which they have committed over $30 million to two starters who are no longer starting. That's enough to make any discerning New York sports fan snicker.
The Rangers, in contrast, don't find themselves in that kind of predicament. The same New York fans laughing at the Yankees had endorsed spending $20 million, or maybe even $30 million, to re-sign Messier, a 36-year-old captain whose production unfortunately had not risen at the same rate of inflation as had his market value and his ego.
But the Rangers, despite their fans' wishes, decided to get off that express to nowhere before they were sucked into the world of the surreal. They let their captain say goodbye instead of saying goodbye to millions of dollars themselves, avoiding a salary disaster two or three years from now if Messier's body indeed proved not to be as durable as his spirit.
In effect, the Rangers decided the gamble wasn't worth it, setting themselves apart from the Yankees, who can hardly ever seem to help themselves. Which is why the team from the Bronx, even with a world championship firmly in place, still retains the undisputed heavyweight crown as the champion of large-scale follies.
George Steinbrenner, the grand master of the Yankees, can't be pleased. But while he may wake up tomorrow demanding $12.8 million be taken out of someone's hide, he won't wake up with a new pragmatism. Unlike the Rangers, that is one commodity Steinbrenner doesn't seem bent on buying, no matter how good the price.

Credit Report Bill to Be Signed

BYLINE: By TONY MARCANO 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
State Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco, who is Acting Governor while Christine Todd Whitman attends the National Governors' Association meeting in Las Vegas, Nev., is to sign legislation today that allows residents to request one free copy of their credit report annually.
Federal law entitles anyone who is unemployed, on welfare or has been refused a line of credit to receive a free credit report. Those distinctions are eliminated under the New Jersey law, which grants a free report to anyone who requests it from a credit-data company. The new legislation is meant to give consumers the opportunity to review their credit records and to challenge any errors before applying for a mortgage, credit cards or other lines of credit. 
 The New Jersey Retail Merchants Association had opposed the legislation, saying the credit-data agencies would end up charging higher fees to retail merchants that request credit histories on customers seeking to open lines of credit.

HEADLINE: Closest to Their Hearts

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 28

 BODY:
President Clinton got his way on many of the big disputes over Federal spending, while Congressional Republicans prevailed on the tax issues about which they care most deeply.
That appears to be the secret of the success announced tonight by budget and tax negotiators from the White House and Capitol Hill. 
 Mr. Clinton got large amounts of money for children's health insurance, welfare and other domestic programs.
Republicans got a $500-a-child tax credit, the heart of their 1994 Contract With America, while making concessions to the White House to guarantee that families with lower incomes would share the benefits of such credits.
Republicans got a deeper cut in capital gains taxes than they expected. They got a bigger cut in estate taxes than Mr. Clinton wanted to give them. And they won new authority for elderly people to establish "medical savings accounts" instead of the standard Medicare program.
Many elements of the deal, most notably the commitment to a balanced budget by 2002, were conceived and initially pushed by the Republicans. But the ultimate articulation of those ideas owes much to the pressure applied by White House negotiators, who pushed Republicans to the left.
Since the framework for a budget agreement was announced on May 2, Franklin D. Raines, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin inundated Congress with letters commenting critically on every detail of the Republicans' budget and tax bills.
White House officials said they were surprised at some of their victories in the negotiations. And they had good reason to be surprised.
In his February budget, Mr. Clinton requested $15 billion over the next five years to provide health insurance for children and jobless workers. Congressional leaders agreed today to provide $24 billion, as the Senate wanted, rather than $16 billion, as the House proposed.
The new money represents the biggest new Federal investment in children's health care since the creation of Medicaid in 1965.
On two tax issues, Mr. Clinton prevailed. He persuaded the Republicans to provide more than $35 billion in tax credits and other tax breaks for college students over the next five years.
The Republicans also were persuaded to accept a big increase in cigarette taxes to help finance children's health insurance. The increase is less than Mr. Clinton wanted, but far more than political insiders had predicted in March, when Senators Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, and Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, began their crusade for a new children's health program.
When Mr. Clinton announced on July 31, 1996, that he would sign the Republicans' welfare bill, reversing six decades of social welfare policy, few expected him to succeed in restoring disability benefits to legal immigrants. From that day until April of this year, the President's efforts seemed to have little chance of success; Republicans said they would not do anything to reopen or undermine the 1996 law.
But in the last few days, Republicans bowed to the White House and agreed to restore benefits to a larger group of legal immigrants than the President or Congress had proposed. The compromise restores benefits to noncitizens who were receiving Supplemental Security Income last August, and to those who were here then and become disabled later.
The cost of restoring these benefits, estimated at $11.4 billion over five years, is nearly half of all the savings that was to have been achieved by restricting benefits for immigrants under the 1996 law.
Mr. Clinton also persuaded the Republicans to continue Medicaid coverage for children who lose disability benefits under the 1996 welfare law. Without such dispensation, many children would have lost Medicaid along with their disability benefits.
The measure of Mr. Clinton's success can be gauged from comments by two observers at opposite ends of the political spectrum. Senator Kennedy, a liberal Democrat, said the budget deal was "a landmark achievement for children's health." Robert Rector, a senior policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said the bill's provisions on welfare represented "a decisive liberal victory."
Mr. Rector said "the Republicans appear to have capitulated on almost every welfare issue," including Mr. Clinton's demand that local governments pay the minimum wage to welfare recipients in community service and workfare programs.
Republicans and Democrats forged a consensus on Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for 38 million people who are elderly or disabled. They agreed to cut payments to hospitals and other health care providers, and they approved some financial legerdemain to keep Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund solvent for six years beyond its projected bankruptcy in 2001.
The budget deal incorporates many of the changes in Medicare proposed by Republicans in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, which Mr. Clinton vetoed. For example, it will create new health insurance options for the elderly, opening the Medicare market to numerous managed care plans. But under pressure from Mr. Clinton, the Republicans dropped several proposals that would have imposed substantial new costs on Medicare beneficiaries.
Over strenuous objections by Mr. Clinton, House and Senate negotiators decided to let 390,000 Medicare recipients establish medical savings accounts. The President says such accounts will appeal mainly to elderly people who are healthy and wealthy. But Republicans say the accounts will make elderly people cost-conscious buyers of health care.

HEADLINE: WHITE HOUSE AND THE G.O.P. ANNOUNCE DEAL TO BALANCE BUDGET AND TO TRIM TAXES

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 28

 BODY:
Congressional Republicans and the Clinton Administration agreed tonight on how to balance the budget for the first time in nearly three decades and on the first major tax cuts since 1981.
Congress is likely to approve the plan this week. Among its highlights are a $500-per-child tax credit, significant cuts in capital gains and inheritance taxes, $1,500 scholarships for each of the first two years of college for middle-income students and $24 billion for children's health care. 
 Passage of the budget deal would fulfill both Mr. Clinton's recent hope for a place in history as the President who ended a long string of deficits, and the Republicans' commitment, in the 1994 Contract With America, to provide a $500-a-child tax credit.
Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who heads the Budget Committee, said the agreement showed that political leaders could respond when "the American people wanted us to work together with the President in a bipartisan way to do something good for the country."
His House counterpart, Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, said, "It's a dream come true."
In Las Vegas, Nev., President Clinton was told of the deal while playing golf with Michael Jordan. An aide said the President was pleased and looked forward to a full briefing on Tuesday morning, after his return to Washington. While in Las Vegas, Mr. Clinton also addressed the National Governors' Association and said he was happy the deal would include $31 billion over five years for the Hope Scholarship Program.
Here in Washington, Senator TomDaschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, was more exuberant.
"It accomplishes everything Democrats wanted when we set out down this arduous passage many months ago," he said in an interview. "It provides for a balanced budget. It provides a tremendous new investment in children's health. It allows for a very supportable new program for tax relief for working families."
He also praised the agreement for allowing the children's tax credit to be credited against payroll taxes, not just income taxes.
Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, and a spokesman for Mr. Clinton both called the agreement tentative until both sides had a chance to read precise legislative language on Tuesday.
But the enthusiasm offered by Republicans and Democrats alike made the delay seem like a polite way to allow the President to share the credit when he returns.
To get the agreement tonight, negotiators worked through several tough issues in final bargaining.
Those included the cut in the maximum capital gains tax rate, to 18 percent, lower inheritance taxes, a 15 cent per pack increase in the cigarette tax and a compromise on how much discretion states will have in deciding how to provide children's health insurance.
Aides revealed today the details of the $500-a-child tax credit agreed to on Sunday. It was compromised, expensively, by making it available to everyone that each side most wanted covered.
Republicans wanted it to apply to children through age 17, and prevailed, though Mr. Clinton wanted it stopped at 13. Mr. Clinton wanted the credit available to parents who did not pay income taxes, down to incomes of about $18,000, and prevailed, though Republicans had wanted to stop at about $24,000. Republicans wanted it to be phased out only after a couple's income reached $110,000, and prevailed over Mr. Clinton's figure of $60,000.
Republicans also got more in capital gains reductions than had been clear on Sunday. The maximum rate on profits from sales of investments held for five years or more will be taxed at only 18 percent, below the 20 percent they had sought. The 20 percent rate will apply to assets held for one to five years. For couples with incomes below $41,200, the rates would be 8 percent and 10 percent.
Mr. Clinton had not favored broad reductions in the capital gains rate, and the Republicans gained the lowest rate in exchange for dropping their proposal to allow investors to subtract the effects of inflation in calculating their gains.
Robert E. Rubin, Secretary of the Treasury, called the budget deal "a very substantial accomplishment. It continues a process of deficit reduction which has been central to our economic growth over five years, with a very heavy focus on children's health and education, and a child's tax credit that extends to middle-income Americans and working Americans."
The last two major issues to be settled tonight dealt with welfare and children's health. Democrats prevailed on welfare, insisting that recipients who move to work be paid the minimum wage. Unions had feared that if those employees were paid less, they would undercut union workers. Governors and Republicans opposed the requirement.
The coalition between governors and Congressional Republicans was more successful on health care. The final deal did not give them as much latitude as they had wanted in designing a benefits package for the uninsured children the $24 billion would cover. But it gave them considerably more flexibility than the Administration had wanted.
There seemed to be little doubt that the package would command the necessary majorities in both Houses. Though some House Republicans may desert the plan, thinking it does not cut taxes enough, more than as many Democrats are likely to support it. In particular, it is likely to command the backing of moderate to conservative Democrats who strongly support a balanced budget.
One of them, Representative John S. Tanner of Tennessee, said tonight after leaving a briefing on the package by Franklin D. Raines, Director of the Office of Management and Budget: "The deficit hawks are happy. This will achieve balance."
Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader, was inclined to oppose the deal, as he has all along. An aide said Democrats were annoyed that as Mr. Raines was briefing them, but insisting nothing was settled, Mr. Lott and Mr. Domenici were before television cameras announcing an agreement.
Even so, the package may get considerable support from mainstream liberal Democrats. Many may be loathe to vote against a balanced budget and may seize on the places where the Administration claims victory as evidence that Democrats shaped the plan.
Representative Sam Gejdenson of Connecticut said tonight: "I came in not optimistic about supporting the package, and now I'm much more inclined."
Because there were no votes in the Senate today, there were not enough Democratic senators around to be briefed. But at least half the Senate's 45 Democrats are expected to back the package, assuring passage. Filibusters are barred on budget measures like these, and both houses could pass it this week before going on a month's vacation.
Reaching agreement on tobacco taxes was easier than deciding what to do with the proceeds. The negotiators settled on increasing the current tax of 24 cents a pack to 34 cents in 2000 and 39 cents in 2002.
On inheritance taxes, family farms and small businesses would be exempt from taxes up to $1.3 million. The exemption level for other kinds of estates would rise gradually, to $1 million in 2007 from the current $600,000.
Although there were no formal briefings, much less a printed summary of the deal, it appeared that the net total of tax cuts exceeded the $85 billion over five years that the Administration and the Republicans agreed on earlier this year.
Republicans estimated there were $140 billion in total cuts and $49 billion in increases, for a net of "over $90 billion," Mr. Domenici said. But the Administration estimated that the extra spending on the child tax credit pushed the total cuts up to $143 billion, and the net to $94 billion.
These were some of the other highlights of the package:
The child tax credit would begin in 1998 at $400 a child and rise to $500 in 1999. Employers would be directed to change withholding rates in January so parents would see the credit in their paychecks immediately.
The Hope scholarships would cover the first $1,000 and 50 percent of the next $1,000 in expenses for the first and second years of college, to a maximum of $1,500. For the third and fourth years, the credit would begin at 20 percent of the first $5,000, to a maximum of $1,000, and gradually increase to 20 percent of the first $10,000, or $2,000.
Reductions in the capital gains rates would be retroactive to May 7. The capital gains cuts also include a complete exemption from taxes for the first $500,000 of profits from the sale of a principal residence.
The package would establish new benefits for Individual Retirement Accounts for people with incomes of $150,000 or less. Individuals could qualify for such investments even if their spouse did not, and withdrawals for education and first-time home purchases would no longer be subject to penalties.
Businesses would get some reductions in the Alternative Minimum Tax, a law designed to insure that all profitable companies pay at least some taxes.
Among the most remarkably uncontroversial provisions were those concerning savings in Medicare, perhaps the most contentious element of the plan Republicans sought to enact at the end of 1995. The package would cut payments to doctors, hospitals and other health-care providers by $115 billion over five years.
The plan would also promote more types of health care beyond the current fee-for-service plans. It would allow 390,000 elderly people to establish medical savings accounts, as long as they had private insurance to cover catastrophic health-care costs.
Three Senate provisions were dropped after sharp protests from groups representing the elderly. They would have raised the Medicare eligibility age gradually to 67 from 65, increased premiums for higher-income beneficiaries and imposed a $5-a-visit charge for home-health-care services.
Medicaid, the health-care plan for the poor, would save $13 billion over five years, mostly by cutting payments to hospitals that serve large numbers of poor patients.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 31, 1997, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption on Tuesday about the budget deal between the White House and Congressional Republicans referred incorrectly in some editions to the two people shown. They were Speaker Newt Gingrich and Representative John R. Kasich, chairman of the House Budget Committee -- not Senators Trent Lott, the majority leader, and Pete V. Domenici, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.

Chart:
Details of reported compromises on major elements of the balanced budget agreement between Congress and the White House:
 
TAX CREDITS FOR CHILDREN -- In return for making more low-income families eligible, the Administration agreed to the Republicans' position: a credit for each child up to age 17, phased out for couples with incomes of $110,000. The White House wanted the credit only through age 13, and would have phased the credit out at $60,000.
 
CHILDREN'S HEALTH -- Republicans agreed to provide $24 billion to expand health-care coverage for children, $8 billion more than many of them wanted to spend. They compromised with the Administration over how much power the states should have in deciding what services to provide.
 
CAPITAL GAINS -- The White House gave Republicans even more than they had been asking for. Profits from sales of investments held for five years or more would be taxed at only 18 percent, below the 20 percent they had sought. The 20 percent rate would apply to assets held for one to five years. For couples with incomes below $41,200, the corresponding rates would be 8 and 10 percent. The current top rate is 28 percent.
 
TOBACCO TAXES -- Under the compromise, the Federal tobacco tax, now 24 cents, would increase by 10 cents a pack in 2000 and another five cents in 2002. President Clinton wanted a 20 cent a pack increase. The Senate passed that, but the House wanted no increase in tobacco taxes.
 
INHERITANCE TAXES -- The exemption for family farms and businesses would increase to $1.3 million immediately from the current $600,000. On other estates, the exemption would rise to $1 million after 10 years.
 
WELFARE -- Republicans yielded to the President's demand that local governments pay the minimum wage in workfare programs. Altering the 1996 welfare law, they agreed to restore disability benefits to many legal immigrants and to continue Medicaid coverage for children who lose disability benefits. (pg. A1)

HEADLINE: The Bull's Last Bite

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

PUB-DATE: July 30, 2067
A spokeswoman for Fidelity Investments confirmed receipt of the cash, which was promptly converted into a fractional share of the company's Global Exuberance Growth Fund. According to Treasury officials, this means that every dollar of American currency has now been used to purchase equities, long considered the only true no-risk form of personal asset. 
 [Responding to the news with typical insouciance, stocks turned in a middling performance today, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average edging upward only 7,873,346.24 to close at 8,487,933,666.06, in very light trading.]
While Wall Street seemed to shrug off the event, it did not go unnoticed here in the nation's capital. A small ceremony was held in the McDonald's/Intel Rotunda of the Capitol. Speaker Alida Sanchez, Libertarian of Indiana, joined Senator Hal Block, Perotian of Washington, the majority leader, in marking the event, unveiling a life-size gold statue of the Wall Street Bull.
"We wanted to have it standing on a vanquished bear," the majority leader quipped, "but nobody could remember what a bear looks like!"
Becoming serious, the Senator then led the assembled group of politicians, business executives and reporters in the constitutionally mandated three kowtows before the sacred idol, which is scheduled to replace the Freedom statue atop the Capitol dome early next week.
After the ceremony, Speaker Sanchez reminisced about the days of the currency economy, when money was used for things other than making more money. "I remember selling cookies door-to-door for my Girl Scout troop," she said. "This was long before the Scouts gave up on Thin Mints and started selling call options and other derivatives. We were so naive that we put all the profits into a C.D. paying just 3 or 4 percent!"
Senator Block joined in the nostalgic spirit. "Back when I was a kid in Spokane, around the time when Washington State first became a subsidiary of Microsoft, I used to save all of my fives and tens for toys," he said. "I desperately wanted to buy a Tickle-Me-Alan-Greenspan doll. Remember those? But then I discovered that the return on stocks was more than enough to comfort me at night."
While the celebrations continued in the capital, analysts in New York and Chicago discussed the consequences of nationwide full investment. "I don't see this as any threat to the 77-year-old bull market," said Daniel Dooling of Bertelsmann/ Compaq/Schwab Inc. "There are still plenty of euros bouncing around in financial backwaters like the Japanese and Martian economies. The pent-up demand they represent should keep the Dow afloat indefinitely."
At least one stock watcher, however, expressed concern about the effects of the demise of cash. "The absence of liquidity is bound to result in a drop in demand for stocks," explained John Huang 3d of Goldman, Sachs/Time-Warner/Defense Department and Company. "This may cause a correction in the cycle, maybe by as much as 5 or 6 percent."
But others scoffed at such pessimism. "They've been saying the same stuff for 70 years," Mr. Dooling said. "Back in 1997, the grandparents of these current doomsayers were warning us about the disparity between the growth in equity prices and the growth of the economy. They were wrong then, and they're wrong now. They just refuse to believe in the magic."
Lighting a cigar with a novelty stock certificate for America Online, a long-defunct media-communications company, he added: "Hey, they didn't believe we'd be able to thaw and revive Bill Gates either, right? And now he's President of the United States. I rest my case."

HEADLINE: Moralizing Over Workfare Won't Create Any Jobs

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Robert A. Sirico's insinuation that people on welfare have no interest in seeking work (Op-Ed, July 27) bears little resemblance to the realities of either welfare recipients' lives or the New York City labor market. 
 Most people in the city's workfare program do have substantial work experience; many are middle-aged people laid off after long careers. The city's official unemployment rate hovers near 10 percent, and even the low-wage, no-benefit jobs Father Sirico romanticizes routinely draw 10 to 20 applicants for every position.
Moreover, maintaining legions of unemployed Americans is a Government policy -- the Federal Reserve manipulates interest rates to slow economic growth whenever the national unemployment rate threatens to dip below 5 percent. In New York, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has cut 21,000 municipal jobs and filled them with workfare workers who, for instance, now constitute three-fourths of the Parks Department work force.
If workfare were truly "an opportunity to enter the labor market," as Father Sirico claims, we could all rejoice. We ought not, however, to substitute moralistic musings on the value of work for an honest look at both the policies intended to further those values and the hard-working people who labor under them.

HEADLINE: Charlie Trie's Tainted Money

 BODY:
With dispassionate thoroughness, an F.B.I. agent named Jerome Campane yesterday gave the Senate committee investigating campaign spending abuses the most detailed and easily the most arresting description so far of how foreign money was laundered into the 1994 elections and Bill Clinton's re-election campaign. This startling mosaic, involving an Asian developer named Ng Lap Seng and his industrious American agent, Yah Lin (Charlie) Trie, did not prove Senator Fred Thompson's suspicions that the Chinese Government sought to influence the American political system. But it did nothing to erase those suspicions, meanwhile showing how vulnerable that system is to manipulation.
The testimony also provided further proof, if any were needed, that the Democratic National Committee casually collected money wherever it could. Mr. Trie began raising big sums from shadowy sources in 1994. He was still at it in 1996. The committee finally returned all suspect contributions in June. 
 Mr. Trie was an ambitious Arkansas restaurateur who followed his friend Bill Clinton to Washington, where he hoped to capitalize on the association and build an international trading business. He was not good at business but, in partnership with John Huang, the D.N.C.'s top Asian fund-raiser, he proved a whiz at raising money.
As Mr. Campane described it, Mr. Trie's prowess depended heavily upon his Asian business partner, Mr. Ng. Most of Mr. Trie's personal contributions, and some of the money he solicited from others, were preceded by wire transfers from Mr. Ng. In one typical example, Mr. Trie made a $20,000 contribution to the D.N.C. on Aug. 1, 1994, even though, only two weeks before, his company showed a balance of $472 and his personal account showed $472.03. In the interim, however, Mr. Ng wired the company account $100,000, enabling Mr. Trie to write a check for $20,000. In another case, reported in The Times earlier this month, Mr. Trie rounded up $100,000 in contributions for Mr. Clinton's birthday bash in New York last August, just 12 days after Mr. Ng had wired $200,000.
In all, the charitable Mr. Ng wired nearly $1 million to Mr. Trie between 1994 and 1996. In those years, despite his modest circumstances, Mr. Trie contributed over $200,000 to the D.N.C. Some of the rest was used to reimburse third parties who contributed funds at Mr. Trie's request. Federal statutes ban contributions from foreigners who are not legal residents -- for example, Mr. Ng -- and also prohibit the reimbursement of third parties.
Mr. Campane further revealed that Mr. Ng, a Chinese developer with offices in Macao, serves on the "People's Consultative Congress," an organization that provides economic advice to the Beijing Government. That does not establish a direct link between Beijing and the American election. But it is surely enough to encourage the committee to keep trying to get to the bottom of China's role.
It would obviously help matters if Mr. Trie, who absconded to China late last year, could be persuaded to testify personally. He told NBC in late June that he would not return and said, "They'll never find me." On Sunday, ABC suggested he might change his mind. It is hard to believe the Chinese Government cannot find him and send him back to the United States. His firsthand account of how he managed to thread his way through the campaign laws so easily would make clear why it is so urgent to reform those laws.

HEADLINE: Essay;
Lying in the Weeds

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Psychiatrists and pundits the professional alienists and the professionally alienated -- take most of August for their vacations. Somehow the nation survives.
Before heading for the mountains of West Virginia, let me use a recent story of the binding power of a noxious weed to draw an offbeat moral. 
 Our knowledge of the history of the Great American West is shaped by classic movies. Conflict was clear. Aficionados of economic war thrilled to the struggle between the cattle barons (well-financed Anglos with huge spreads) and the sheepherders (hardscrabble ethnics fencing off small ranches).
Cattle needed wide-open public space to roam and forage, and cowboys rounded them up yearly and drove them to market. But sheep needed protection from coyotes, and shepherds had to build fences and daily defend their flocks.
The cattlemen claimed to despise the sheep-and-goat people because their animals grazed down to the roots, despoiling the public range for cows. The small-business shepherds replied that sheep ate forbs and anything that grew, while the cattle were finicky eaters of bunch grasses.
America's self-image was the cowboy, not the shepherd; our song is "Don't Fence Me In," not "Sheep May Safely Graze." Against that background, consider a story filed from Buford, Colo., by The Washington Post's Tom Kenworthy.
Leafy spurge -- a noxious European weed analogous to the South's dread kudzu -- has infested more than three million acres of the West. Cattle and horses can't eat the sickening foliage, and with no natural predator to contain spurge, the weed takes over whole pastures. The big animals starve; cattlepeople suffer as the leafy intruder sucks the worth out of ranches.
Mowing is hopeless; chemical defoliants cost too much or draw criticism; neither fire nor flood eradicates the milky-sap plant. Where to turn?
To big cattle's rescue come the little lamb and the friendly kid.
Sheep and goats find the tough leaves of spurge edible, even nourishing. By setting a flock of sheep to intensively graze 14,000 acres of a wildlife preserve, Colorado's weed-fighters found a way to triumph over a yard-high enemy that had sunk roots 15 feet underground.
The sheep and goats are now being used to chew up the weeds and save the cattle. One land management official told Kenworthy that 240 goats had been let loose on 2,000 spurge-ridden acres with stunning results: "It was like inviting the high school football team to a pizza parlor. They just demolished it."
What lasting lessons can moralists draw from this?
The fabulous Aesop, in his account of a grateful mouse that gnawed away a rope binding a captive lion, concluded: "Little friends may prove great friends." The minister who cannot find a Sunday sermon -- or the Speaker or committee chairman who cannot find an instructive anecdote -- in the lambs and kids saving the great bulls of the Great Basin just isn't trying.
And evangelists of ecology will see in it the mysterious balancing act of nature that needs only a non-intrusive helping hand to work out the destinies of plants and animals.
But to the practical peacemakers of the political world, the story illuminates the way to dissolve ancient enmities. The cattlemen and the sheepherders were ethnically, culturally and economically at odds. Mutual contempt was bred in their bones and maintained a vestigial resentment long after the original reasons for hatred faded.
What brings them together now? A shared interest in defeating a fearsome enemy.
What the world needs is more of that self-interested fear of common enemies, whether drought, pollution or tyrannous ideologies. Such urgency creates alliances, concocts the amalgam of joint defense, and then breeds the habit of working together after crises have passed and enemies have been defeated.
Let the message beat through the jungles of Southeast Asia, the distended underbelly of the Balkans, the wasting chances in the Middle East: Your own version of the leafy spurge is coming! Now here's how we must combine to control the evil weed . . .

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up More Against Yen; Its Rise vs. the Mark Halts

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar reached an 11-week high against the Japanese yen yesterday but fell against the mark for the first time in six trading days after a top German Government economist predicted that central banks would try to halt the mark's slide. The dollar ended mixed in other currency dealings.
As trading wound down for the day, the dollar was rebounding against the mark and its strength against the yen was viewed as another sign that the global appetite for dollars remained strong. 
 "There was a little bit of a respite in the dollar's rally," said Robert Katz, a trader at MTB Bank in New York. "It looks like some profits were taken. But it seems like the dollar bull trend is intact. This was an opportunity to pick up some cheaper dollars."
In New York late yesterday, the dollar settled at 1.8367 marks, down from 1.8436 marks on Monday and the first time since July 18 that it had not finished higher against the German currency. The dollar traded at 118.43 yen, up from 117.60 yen on Monday and the strongest level since May 13. The British pound fell to $1.6239 from $1.6311.
The mark rose broadly on remarks by Rolf Peffekoven, a member of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's council of economic advisers, which were published in the Berliner Zeitung. He did not rule out an interest-rate increase by the Bundesbank to defend the mark's value, but said that coordinated intervention by central banks was more likely.
Traders said the mark's strength indirectly played a role in the yen's weakness against the dollar, as investors bought marks and sold yen. Gains in United States stock and bond markets on more evidence of steady, noninflationary growth also helped support the dollar.
Some traders said the mark's strength began to erode late in the day on reported remarks by Hans-Jurgen Kobnick, a member of the Bundesbank's policy-making council. In an advance copy of an article to be published today in the German financial daily Handelsblatt, Mr. Kobnick said the central bank had decided to refrain from raising interest rates, even if the mark's value continued to fall. Higher rates tend to lift a currency's value by increasing returns in that currency.

HEADLINE: Middle Class Dismissed

BYLINE: By David Frum; David Frum is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.

 BODY:
Liberals used to jeer at the working-class social conservatives who voted for Ronald Reagan; Mr. Reagan, they said, was exploiting working-class resentment of abortion and racial quotas, while delivering the economic goods to the rich. How could anyone be such a fool as to trade money for symbolism?
The new budget deal suggests that President Clinton believes there are plenty of such fools. It offers substantial tax cuts to the rich and poor -- from the child tax credit to capital gains tax reductions -- but the middle and upper-middle classes whose main source of income is their salaries get little but kind words and poll-tested gimmicks. Mr. Clinton said as a candidate in 1992 that he was seeking the Presidency on behalf of a "forgotten" middle class. But in this budget deal, it is he who is doing the forgetting. 
 Democrats have been losing Presidential elections since 1968 by appearing to champion the poor above everybody else. By talking tough on welfare and by promising tax cuts, Mr. Clinton tried to reach out to the broad middle of the electorate -- families earning the median or slightly better than median income.
And he succeeded. In 1996, he beat Bob Dole among voters earning $50,000 to $75,000 a year. And what did those people get in return for their support over the years? Just what the social conservatives got: symbols. The V-chip. Pro-choice judges. Rousing speeches on Earth Day. The first female Attorney General. Not much else.
For the working poor, this budget deal creates a vast new medical entitlement for uninsured children and delivers a $500-per-child tax credit even to families that pay no income tax. The well-off get a reduction in the capital gains tax and an increase in 10 years to $1 million in the size of estates sheltered from the nation's confiscatory death taxes.
But what about the two-earner family on Long Island or elsewhere in the costly New York area taking in a total of $75,000? The construction worker and the nurse who have two kids, a six-year-old car and a mortgage -- but no stocks or bonds. What has the President done for them?
In his first term, President Clinton reneged on the promise of a "middle-class" tax cut, imposed a new tax on higher-income Social Security recipients, and tried to force through a comprehensive health plan drafted without much attention to the concerns of people like the Long Island couple.
Now in his second term, the President has deployed all his rejuvenated political strength to thwart tax relief for these middle-class salary earners. He has made clear since 1995 that broad reductions in income-tax rates will be vetoed. He fought to confine the per-child tax credit to families earning less than $60,000. And while he was forced in the end to give way on that point, salaried workers making $75,000 won't be throwing many steaks on the barbecue to celebrate. With an annual Federal tax burden that the Tax Foundation estimates to be nearly $16,000, a $500-per-child credit looks rather more like a rounding error than a tax cut.
The good news for the middle class is, supposedly, the President's elaborate plan for tax relief for college tuition. Unfortunately, many experts believe Federal student assistance programs have only tempted colleges to raise their fees, leaving the real cost to the student's family unchanged -- which is how tuition costs have been able to run up so fast over the past two decades.
But even if that turns out not to be true this time, there remains something highly offensive about the President's reluctance to disgorge any middle-class money unless it is spent in ways of which he approves. This budget looks a lot less like middle-class relief than like a remission of tribute from a feudal lord who expects the peasantry to doff their caps in gratitude.
No, it's no longer a forgotten middle class. Instead, it is a manipulated middle class. That may count as a political accomplishment in some ways. But it's an accomplishment the President's party may not thank him for in the end -- not when the next recession reminds middle-class America that it has become even more overtaxed and underserved than it was when it erupted in political anger in 1992.

HEADLINE: What Saved The Hotels? Not Just Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
A few short years ago, New York hotel operators were cursing the darkness. About a third of the city's hotel rooms were empty -- the worst showing since the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's -- and average room rates were flat or falling. Much of the blame was laid at the feet of the state and the city, which had raised the tax on hotel rooms to more than 21 percent, by far the highest rate in the nation. Convention organizers announced boycotts of New York and its outrageous room prices. Tourism, hoteliers declared, was endangered.
In late 1994, the industry got its relief. The city, after a high-profile campaign by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, cut the hotel occupancy tax and the state eliminated its tax entirely. The combined sales and occupancy tax on a $100-a-night hotel room fell by more than a fourth in a few quick chops. 
 But a funny thing happened on the way to making New York a more affordable travel destination. It got less affordable. Room rates, which were considered crippling in the summer of 1993, are a full 39 percent percent higher this summer, and rooms are hard to find at that. One result is that visitors to New York are paying about the same amount of tax they did under the old rate, which supposedly was killing the industry.
What did happen was that demand -- above and beyond the effect of lower taxes -- soared. Tourists from abroad and from the rest of America rediscovered New York. Business travel increased as the economy here and elsewhere improved. The city's falling crime rate changed perceptions. Hotel taxes that were once a symbol of the city's ills were drowned in a sea of good news.
The president of the Hotel Association of New York City, Joseph E. Spinnato, said that the tax cut did have a powerful positive economic effect on New York, particularly on his industry, even if travelers have not benefited much.
"The repeal of the tax signaled, in my judgment, the start of the resurgence of New York," Mr. Spinnato said. He said he thought travelers, even if they pay more for a room than they did before the tax cut, were getting more for their money. "I think the perception as well as the reality is that people are getting what they pay for and not getting gouged by a tax," he said.
A new study by the New York City Independent Budget Office says, however, that the hotel tax cut had less effect on the city's budget than some politicians and hotel industry officials have contended. Mr. Giuliani, in particular, has repeatedly cited the hotel occupancy tax cut as an example of his administration's economic policies at their best -- a tax cut that paid for itself and improved the local economy in a single stroke. He has used the same logic in pushing for an elimination of the city sales tax on items of clothing under $500, which he says would do for retailing what it did for hotels.
The budget study, which is to be released today, says the Mayor has it only about half right. It concludes that the tax cut did help significantly by bringing more tourists who spent more money on restaurants and other entertainment. The city is also collecting more revenue over all because hotel rates and occupancy rates are high, hovering around 85 percent. But without other independent factors that were improving the city's economy and image at the same time -- especially the falling crime rate -- the tax cut would not have been so successful, the study says. Only about half the $16 million in revenue that the city gave up by cutting the tax, the study says, were made back by new business activity directly or indirectly attributable to lower taxes.
"We cut the tax and now we're collecting more than ever, that's true," said Ronnie Lowenstein, the deputy director and chief economist at the budget office, which is independent of the Mayor and the City Council. But the other variables, she said, were crucial to that result. "The regional economy was rebounding along with the European economy, business travel was up, crime was down, domestic tourism was up -- then we came along and decreased the tax rate," she said.
The demand for rooms in New York, Ms. Lowenstein said, was already on a steep upward climb before the tax cut. And to some extent the tax changes actually appear to have encouraged higher room rates as well. The now-defunct 5 percent state occupancy tax, for example, acted like a cap on hotel rates. Since it only applied to rooms costing more than $100, many hotels found it appealing to offer a $99-a-night special that avoided that tax. When the tax was lifted, so too was the incentive to keep a room under $99.
The director of the Independent Budget Office, Douglas A. Criscitello, said the implications of the agency's analysis for the clothing tax debate were particularly profound. The dense overlay of complications, he said, means you cannot apply the lessons of one tax cut to argue for another, as Mr. Giuliani does. Mr. Criscitello said that while cutting the clothing tax would be likely to have a great effect on the city's economy, a sales tax cut would probably not pay for itself through new revenue as well as the hotel tax cut did.
Unlike hotels and tourism, which spill directly into related areas like restaurants, he said, a significant part of the benefit of cutting the clothing sales taxes would flow out of New York, to the manufacturers elsewhere, many of them overseas. Demand for clothing would also be constrained by the limits of the local economy, whereas hotels are connected to the health of the world economy.
Randy M. Mastro, the Deputy Mayor for Operations, acknowledged that the effect of any tax cut was complicated and that Mr. Giuliani was fully aware that other factors, like the falling crime rate, were also improving the New York tourism industry. Indeed, Mr. Giuliani should get credit for all those other improvements, too, Mr. Mastro said.
He said that the Independent Budget Office, in looking at the clothing tax issue, underestimated the effect of those other positive factors as well. In contrast, the city's estimate of the benefits of the clothing tax cut, which include 17,000 new jobs and up to $1 billion in new retail sales, is based on the assumption that the city continues to improve in a variety of areas, Mr. Mastro said.
"A city with reduced crime and higher quality of life and more tourism and business activity would result in even greater revenue," he said.

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Falls, but Remains High

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Americans' confidence in the economy fell unexpectedly this month but remained close enough to a 28-year high to suggest that consumer spending might accelerate, a new survey showed.
The Conference Board said yesterday that its index of consumer confidence declined to 126.5 in July from a revised 129.9 in June. Last month's level was originally reported as 129.6, itself a 28-year high. 
 Economists had expected, on average, a July reading of 130.2.
The survey showed that consumers in July planned to buy more big-ticket goods like autos and appliances.
"I put more weight on the big-ticket buying plans" than the index over all, said David Resler, chief economist at Nomura International in New York.
"What people plan to do with their confidence is more important than how confident they are."
Economists and investors monitor the level of consumer confidence because Americans tend to spend more when they feel confident about their financial prospects. Their spending, in turn, accounts for about two-thirds of economic output.
While the index fell short of expectations this month, dragged down by declines in consumers' assessments of their present situation and their prospects, Lynn Franco, associate director of the Conference Board's consumer research center, said the survey "continues to signal healthy economic growth ahead."
Consumers blew hot and cold during the first half, alternating between buying sprees and periods of unexpected austerity. As a result, the economy grew at a breakneck annual pace of 5.8 percent in the first quarter before slowing.

HEADLINE: Ford to Rejuvenate Dying Mercury Cougar

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 29

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company announced plans today to rejuvenate its tired Mercury division by reviving Mercury's oldest nameplate.
The Mercury Cougar, introduced as a flashy sports coupe 30 years ago, has over that time put on the love handles of a gentle-riding large car. Earlier this year, Ford said that it would halt the Cougar's assembly line this summer because it was selling so slowly. 
 But today, Ford said the Cougar would come back to life in 1998 as a small, sporty, wedge-shaped coupe. The Cougar's repositioning represents the direction in which Ford plans to steer the Mercury division in the years to come, said Jacques Nasser, president of Ford Automotive Operations. Mercury is best known now for building big cars bought mainly by retirees, but Mercury's future mission will be "fun, flair and flexibility," Mr. Nasser said.
The reason Ford decided to stop building the Cougar was that it was losing money on it. But Mr. Nasser gave two reasons to expect profits after the next generation Cougar arrives as a 1999 model. First, it is moving from the large coupe market, which has been shrinking for years, and as a sporty small coupe is entering a popular market that Ford believes will grow. Mr. Nasser said Ford expected to sell more than 50,000 of the new Cougars a year in North America, Europe and Asia.
Second, Mr. Nasser said that the next- generation Cougar would save the company money by sharing its engine, transmission and underbody, or chassis, with Ford's Contour, Mystique and Mondeo cars. That will give the Cougar economies of scale that it now lacks. The current Cougar shares its chassis with the Ford Thunderbird, which Ford also put on the chopping block in March because of its weak sales. Both cars use a number of parts designed just for them, and as their sales slipped over the years, Ford could not justify the expense.
Ford is still designing the 1999-model Cougar. But today, the company showed off its futuristic concept of the car, a silver version called the MC2. The Cougar is likely to retain the wedge-shaped body and oval roof lines of the car shown today, Ford executives said.
The next-generation Cougar is an important step in Mercury's evolution, executives said. The stodgy nameplate is striving to attract younger buyers without alienating its loyal, older buyers, the kind who are devoted to the high-profit Grand Marquis, Mercury's big sedan.
"We are not walking away from our traditional buyers," said James G. O'Connor, general manager of the Lincoln-Mercury division. "We'll transition Mercury to a more relevant brand."
Mercury began modernizing when it added the Villager mini-van to its lineup in 1992, when the average age of a Mercury buyer was 58. Last year, Mercury began selling its Mountaineer sport utility vehicle. Most Villager and Mountaineer buyers are in their mid-40's.
Ford hopes the Cougar will attract new buyers for Mercury, particularly because, as Mr. Nasser said, "People who are in today's Cougar probably won't want to consider this vehicle."
The company is aiming the Cougar at buyers between 25 and 35 years old, buyers nearly two generations younger than those driving the Grand Marquis. "We're trying to broaden the base of appeal," Mr. O'Connor said. "That will drive down the average age of the customers."
Of course, Mercury's have-your-cake-and-eat-it-too strategy makes for difficult marketing. "That is our marketing challenge," Mr. O'Connor acknowledged.
The Mercury division has suffered for decades from a lack of a clear identity, as Ford executives have struggled with whether the division should be independent or combined in many ways with the Lincoln division, as it is now. In 1957, Consumer Reports wrote, "On and off, and particularly during the last few years, Mercury has had a hard time concealing the fact that it was essentially a Ford with not much more than a difference in nameplate and styling."
That criticism has been particularly true in recent years of cars like the Mercury Grand Marquis, which is virtually identical to the Ford Crown Victoria but costs nearly $2,000 more. The Grand Marquis is marketed to older Americans who like the vehicle's power and interior room but are reluctant to buy the Crown Victoria, which is used extensively as a police car and taxi cab.
And the Mercury Mountaineer is simply a fancy Ford Explorer. But Mercury plans to differentiate its cars and trucks from those carrying the Ford name in the future. Mr. Nasser insisted that the next-generation Cougar would not share its look with any Ford cars.
Still, the fate of the Cougar, a venerable nameplate taken off life support just months ago and given a new lease on life today, raises the hopes of those nostalgic for its cousin, the Ford Thunderbird, and Ford gave them still more reason for hope today.
"The Thunderbird is a magic marque for Ford," Mr. Nasser said. "We will not let that brand languish for long."

Clinton and G.O.P. Leaders Celebrate Budget Proposal
President Clinton and the Republican leaders of Congress jubilantly -- but separately -- celebrated their long-sought agreement on a plan to balance the Federal budget after decades of deficit spending and to provide the first Federal tax cut in 16 years. A1
 
In broad economic terms, the tax cut amounts to barely three-tenths of one percent of an economy that looks like it will hit $8 trillion this year. A few hurricanes and a bad year for the computer industry, in fact, could well have a bigger effect on the country's economic profile. A16

Yah Lin Trie, a friend of President Clinton who is suspected of donating foreign money to the Democratic Party, received $1.4 million in wire transfers from abroad from 1994 through 1996, an F.B.I. agent told the Senate inquiry on campaign finance practices. The agent said $905,000 of the $1.4 million came from a single source, Ng Lap Seng, a business associate of Mr. Trie from Macao. This money was used in part to cover the $220,000 that Mr. Trie and his wife gave to the Democratic National Committee, the agent testified. A1

HEADLINE: U.S. Reports Slight Increase In Wage Costs

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 29

 BODY:
Employee compensation costs rose slightly this spring because of an increase in benefits, but the gain posed no inflationary threat, Government figures showed today.
"There is just a slight amount of upward creep" in pay packages, said L. Douglas Lee, chief economist for HSBC Washington Analysis, a securities firm. "But we've managed to offset that with good productivity growth, strong competitive pressures and lower energy costs." 
 The Labor Department's quarterly survey of employment costs, closely scrutinized by policy makers, seemed to support assumptions that the Federal Reserve would find no need to raise short-term interest rates when its strategists next meet Aug. 19 even though the unemployment rate is near its lowest levels in a quarter century. Workers' pay and benefits account for some two-thirds of business costs, and companies, believing it futile to raise prices in a hotly competitive climate, are resisting workers' persistent attempts to receive better wages.
A poll published today by the National Association of Business Economists found that only 17 percent of companies tried to raise prices in July -- compared with 24 percent in April -- and that of these, only 37 percent could make the full amount stick.
"Price increases are increasingly difficult to realize," the association's panel found in compiling responses from 131 members, adding that the pace of labor-cost increases "appears to have slowed" from that of the first quarter.
Overall compensation, according to the Government, climbed eight-tenths of 1 percent in the April-June quarter, up from six-tenths of 1 percent during the winter. The acceleration, however, was entirely caused by a recovery in benefit costs after what analysts regard as an artificial deceleration.
Benefit costs advanced six-tenths of 1 percent, compared with one-tenth of 1 percent in the first quarter, to bring the 12-month increase to 2 percent, the report showed. Benefits, typically amounting to 30 percent of total compensation, include employer contributions for workers' health insurance and pension plans as well as the cost of Social Security taxes, vacations, sick leave, overtime and some bonuses.
But the increase in benefit costs was nothing more than a return to normal, analysts said, pointing to a pattern in recent years in which the first quarter has shown virtually no rise in benefit costs. They said the Government's statistical machinery had yet to catch up with the fact that corporate benefit costs, especially for health insurance, have not been taking big jumps in the beginning of the year.
Wages and salaries alone rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter, compared with a gain of nine-tenths of 1 percent rise in the January-March quarter.
That brings the 12-month increase in wages and salaries to 3.2 percent.
Once again, the pay of state and local government workers lagged behind, rising six-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter, the same increase obtained by those in transportation and public utilities and in finance, insurance and real estate. The latter group, however, enjoyed a 1.9 percent surge in the first quarter.
Pay in retail trade rose eight-tenths of 1 percent, following three straight advances of 1 percent or more, with another increase in the minimum wage, to $5.15 an hour, set to take effect Sept. 1.
The Employment Cost Index now stands at 132.8, or 32.8 percent more than its base level of June 1989. The rise over the latest 12 months is 2.8 percent, slightly below the 2.9 percent recorded for the year ended June 1996.
"That's remarkable, given the strong economic growth over the period and the decline in the jobless rate," said Joseph Liro of CIBC Wood Gundy Securities in New York.
Total compensation grew in the latest quarter by eight-tenths of 1 percent for all three major categories, white-collar, blue-collar and service occupations, today's report also showed, though blue-collar workers, at 2.5 percent, trailed the others by about a half-point over the latest 12 months.
Wages and salaries for nonunion workers rose 3.5 percent over the year compared with 2.2 percent for union members. By region, workers fared best in the South, up 3.4 percent over 12 months, and worse in the Northeast, where the gain was 3 percent.
Analysts remained wary, however, that wage increases could accelerate, some predicting that rebounding economic growth later this year would induce the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its meeting on Sept. 30 in an effort to head off broader inflation.
"If growth picks up strongly in the third quarter, as we expect," said Tim O'Neill, chief economist at the Bank of Montreal, "the unemployment rate could fall further and eventually intensify wage pressures."

HEADLINE: Workers in Germany Fear the Miracle Is Over

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: AHRBRUCK, Germany

 BODY:
On weekends in this warm, wet summer, the byways of the Eifel hills fill with the trophies of a leisured society rich enough for big-time toys: exotic cars heading for a meeting of the Ferrari club, herds of Harleys rumbling by the streams.
But there is trouble in paradise, for the vaunted accomplishments of Germany's economic miracle -- which produced a symbiosis of ever-shrinking work hours and ever-expanding income -- are colliding with a competitive global economy. 
 A battleground is forming between employers demanding that their workers put in more hours at less convivial times, and unions pressing exactly the opposite. And among the laborers, there is a sneaking feeling that the employers are winning.
Indeed, as the forces set loose by freer global trade push more countries toward the American approach of working longer for less, the productive and competitive edge that created the German miracle has eroded, leaving a sense that the good times are over.
That, at least, was the impression from a score of conversations with the well-heeled motorcycle set at a roadside cafe here the other day. The cafe is a mecca for middle-class bikers whose weekend roaming around the Eifel hills might seem the very emblem of leisured freedom.
"It's been creeping up on us," said Marga Waerder, 27, who arrived at the cafe on a collector's item Russian Dnepr 650 c.c. motorcycle with a sidecar for two children and her husband at the controls. "More and more people are having to do unpaid overtime, second jobs, work on the black market. They are a lot more afraid for their jobs than five years ago."
Germans in their 20's, 30's and 40's, like Ms. Waerder, grew up with the fruits of Germany's post-war revival and blossoming expansion, reaping the benefits of leisure, wealth and high living standards produced by the long work hours and industrial grit of their parents.
"Never before has there been a generation that grew up with so much time and money, education and well-being," said Horst Opaschowski, a sociologist, in a study published last year. But they are also the people feeling the first stirrings of the chillier wind that is beginning to rustle through the German idyll.
The reasons for such angst may seem hard to divine. If they took their cues from current statistics rather than their fears for the future, they might think they have nothing to worry about.
While work hours in the United States have expanded and companies downsized, Germany's workweek has not grown. In fact, it has shrunk, historically speaking, from the 6-day, 48-hour week of the 1950's to a 35-hour week negotiated in many parts of Germany between labor unions and employers in 1995. And now the country's powerful metal-workers union, I.G. Metall, is pressing for a 32-hour week.
While most Americans count themselves lucky to enjoy three or four weeks of paid vacation a year, the German average is six weeks, comparable to other parts of continental Europe. That is coupled with 10 official public holidays that, by deft maneuvering of the calendar, can often be parlayed into long weekends.
In 1964, according to the Bertelsmann Foundation, which is part owner of the Bertelsmann publishing giant, German leisure time -- defined as the time left over after working, eating and sleeping -- averaged 5 hours and 41 minutes a day. Now it is 8 hours a day.
Yet such leisure collides increasingly with the insistence of Germany's employers that something will have to give if Europe's economic powerhouse is to revive its competitiveness and keep its commanding position in international trade.
Statistics indicating that the average workweek is around 38 hours -- 40 hours in the former East Germany -- suggest that Germans are doing as well as ever. But the statistics do not reflect anxieties about possible unemployment and reduced living standards that are beginning to impose themselves on the way people work, said Hans Knieps, a technical engineer who was one of the bikers.
"People are already working five or six hours extra without overtime pay, and those hours are going to get longer," said Mr. Knieps.
One of the motorcyclists gathered here, Karl Kreuzberg, a 38-year-old auto salesman, said he has taken to working a 55-hour week. One reason is to finance the biking pastime that includes his-and-her Italian Moto Guzzis, for him and his wife.
Over the years, Germans, enjoying Europe's greatest wealth, became complacent, realizing too late that the world around them was changing fast. The reunification of East and West Germany seven years ago cut into earnings further, with a 7.5 percent income tax surcharge to pay for an integration process that still costs hundreds of billions each year.
Add to this the downward pressure on wages caused by Europe's stubbornly high unemployment -- it has been at roughly 11 percent of the work force in Germany this year -- and the declining faith in the future becomes even more explainable.
At the same time, the need for austerity has become all the more acute because of Europe's drive towards a single currency, which is pressing Germany and other countries toward ever tighter budgeting.
The bottom line, German employers argue, is that people will have to work longer and reduce leisure time if Germany is to revive the competitiveness on which its export-driven economy depends.
Employers cite global competition as the prime reason for reducing labor costs, which are already so high that many companies follow the American example and move factories outside their country -- in Germany's case, to places in Eastern Europe, Britain and even the United States itself, where workers cost less.
"Working hours must get not only longer, but more flexible," said Wolfgang Ress, a spokesman for the German Employers' Federation in Cologne. By flexible, the employers mean hours that are less convenient for workers trying to put together blocks of time off from work.
Indeed, in recent months, several big companies, including Ford's subsidiary in Cologne, have reached agreements with unions that offer workers a measure of job security in return for lower labor costs and hours that include weekend shifts that cut into hallowed leisure time.
For all that, Germans still take their downtime seriously.
At this time of the year, airports overflow with lines of people on their way to vacations just about any place that guarantees sunshine and beaches. Competition for a place in the sun is so intense that vacationers rise at 5:30 to lay claim to a pool side lounger. And in mid-July, as the annual vacation season began in northern Germany, motoring organizations recorded a staggering 100-mile traffic snarl as 50,000 cars crawled fender-to-fender on their way to vacation spots.
Indeed, it is one of the few points of similarity between western Germans and those from the east that they devote equal portions of their income to leisure pursuits, including late-model autos and vacations everywhere from Las Vegas to Las Palmas.
Last year, according to statistics based on German central bank figures, Germans spent some $45 billion on vacations abroad, more than any other European nation. In 1995, according to these figures, an average family of two adults and two children devoted roughly $500 a month ($400 in eastern Germany) to leisure pursuits, predominantly savings for vacations. That is roughly a quarter of the average worker's take-home wages.
Beyond the figures and the free time, there is an existential debate centering on the so-called American model of deregulation and market forces that is touted as a cure-all in the United States.
"The question is one of basic philosophy: do we live to work, or work to live?" said Reinhard Dombre of the Federation of German Labor Unions in Dusseldorf.
"We don't want less free time, we want more," he said, arguing that Germany's economic growth has reached its limits, so that the only way to tackle unemployment is to share jobs among people working shorter hours, as the metal-workers union has suggested.
While employers disagree, they acknowledge that the American model is not likely to find much resonance in Germany.
"You cannot simply transfer the American system, but it shows what's possible," said Mr. Ress at the Employers Federation in Cologne. "We can't just go on as the world champions of leisure."

HEADLINE: In Chicago, Finding Hope in a Shopping Mall

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, July 29

 BODY:
No wars or riots or earthquakes scarred the Kenwood-Oakland section on the South Side. It just looked that way.
More dead than alive a decade ago, the neighborhood had empty lots and vacant buildings that accounted for about 70 percent of all property. 
 On one of those empty tracts, a construction shovel will scoop out the earth Wednesday, the realization of what some long-suffering residents consider a miracle on 47th Street: the neighborhood is getting its first supermarket in more than 50 years.
"We're turning things around," said the Rev. Arthur Brazier, a 76-year-old bishop in the Apostolic Church of God, and a leader of a community group that worked to get the new business. "Ten years ago, nobody wanted to be here. Now we're giving people a reason to stay."
Ground will be broken Wednesday for a $9 million shopping center that is to include the supermarket, Hyde Park Co-Op, as well as a Walgreen drugstore, a Citibank branch, a dry cleaners, a copy shop, a restaurant and other stores.
"Retailers are coming to see that there is money to be made in these neighborhoods," said Andrew J. Mooney, an official with the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, which helped finance the building. "These were untapped markets."
In a sign of growing commercial interest in inner-city neighborhoods, construction on new supermarkets is scheduled in the next six months in Harlem, Boston, Philadelphia and New Haven.
While a booming national economy accounts for some of the growth, favorable Federal tax laws in the last decade also have motivated developers. And many cities like Chicago have aggressively courted developers and offered incentives in poorer neighborhoods.
The retail growth in Kenwood-Oakland, south of the Loop, and other inner-city Chicago neighborhoods follows a surge of residential construction and renovation.
Indeed, mortgage lending in low-income neighborhoods of Chicago has been growing at a much faster pace than in more affluent areas, said Malcolm Bush, the president of the Woodstock Institute, a nonprofit group that promotes investment in poorer areas.
Between 1990 and 1994, the number of mortgage loans in the city increased by 50 percent, Mr. Bush said, while home loans in low-income areas grew about 85 percent.
Initially, much of the increased banking presence could be attributed to stricter enforcement of the Community Re-Investment Act, which requires financial institutions to put money into their communities.
"They were reluctant to do it at first," Mr. Bush said. "But it has now been demonstrated that it can be profitable."
In some measure, the residential growth in South Side neighborhoods like Bronzeville and Kenwood-Oakland, both predominantly African-American communities, resembles some of the gentrification associated with prosperous young white professionals in North Side neighborhoods like Bucktown and Wicker Park.
Some of these neighborhoods are a few blocks from Lake Michigan, and less than 10 minutes from the Loop by train.
Gladys Taylor, a 42-year-old vice president at a Chicago advertising agency, had lived for many years in the affluent Old Town section of the city's North Side. But Ms. Taylor, who was born in the Ida B. Wells housing project in Kenwood-Oakland, said she had dreamed of buying one of the grand old buildings there and refurbishing it.
Two years ago, Ms. Taylor and her husband bought a turn-of-the-century three-story stone house with 14-foot ceilings and five fireplaces. They paid $60,000. So far, they have invested $170,000 in renovations, and have a long way to go.
Before they bought the house, many people, including some lenders, told Ms. Taylor it was a foolish risk. But now her investment is looking smart. An appraisal last year set the home's value at more than $275,000, she said.
"It has always been a dream of mine to come back to this neighborhood," said Ms. Taylor, whose family moved to the south suburbs when she was 6. "I wanted to live among my people."
She added: "A lot of us who go to school, and then achieve some success, never look back. I think that has led to our demise to a large degree. I wanted to give something back."
In an article in The Harvard Business Review, "The Competitive Advantage of the Inner City," Michael Porter has cited location and density as powerful draws for businesses.
Chicago-based Walgreen, which owns more than 2,000 stores nationwide, has been particularly aggressive about opening stores in inner-city neighborhoods.
"As we grow, we're going back looking at high-density urban markets," said Michael Polzin, a spokesman for Walgreen. "We've discovered there is more business to be done in these areas."
For decades, the Kenwood-Oakland neighborhood has been dominated by large public housing projects, such as the Ida B. Wells complex. But those towers of poverty, which cast a shadow across the neighborhood, are being torn down.
To replace them, the city is building much smaller town houses and dispersing them in scattered-site housing, including about 250 units planned for this neighborhood.
Herb Cobb, the owner of a print shop, will be a tenant in the new shopping center. His store had been in a partially-burned, dilapidated building on the same site.
Even though his rent will increase about 300 percent, to around $3,000 a month, he said the growing businesses should make it worthwhile.
"In the old place, you could see scores from flames on the back walls," said Mr. Cobb, 40, who lives across the street from the 47th Street site. "It was badly in need of help."
Mr. Cobb, who has operated the print business since 1990, said people in the neighborhood have been talking about a new supermarket and shopping center for many years.
"The old-timers would shake their heads," Mr. Cobb said, "and say, 'Aw, they've been talking about something like that for more than 20 years, and they haven't done anything yet.' Well, now they've done something."
Josh Deth, the director of member services at the Hyde Park supermarket, said the decision to open a store on 47th Street was not unanimous.
"There were people who said it's too much of a risk," Mr. Deth said, "and asked why we should put our necks on the line."
But he said a majority believed it was the right thing to do for the good of the community. And it made business sense.
"There are a lot of people moving in," Mr. Deth said. "And everybody's got to eat."

HEADLINE: The Politics of Zero Deficits

 BODY:
This week's budget deal between the White House and Congress is being portrayed as a historic agreement to balance the Federal budget for the first time in nearly three decades. But in economic terms, this is a small-bore achievement. The booming economy has already reduced the deficit to modest proportions, and this deal will ramp it down another needless notch. The real significance of the agreement lies in what it tells us of the nation's shifting political tides.
For at least five years, thanks largely to Ross Perot and his nettlesome pie charts in the 1992 election campaign, the nation's political battles have surged around the issue of balancing the budget so as to bring a supposedly profligate government under control. But this year, in the broad budget agreement reached in May and in the fine detail agreed to this week, both major parties have endorsed the notion that annual deficits should be brought to zero. The Democrats, once branded as big spenders, have become as hawkish about deficit reduction as the most conservative Republicans. 
 Indeed, the whole debate over deficits and government spending has shifted to the right. Think back, for example, to Bill Clinton's run for the Presidency in 1992. His core idea then was to raise the level of Federal spending on infrastructure, training and research that could help spur economic growth. Now the new budget deal all but guarantees that those investments will never be made, and the "New Democrat" terrain is being claimed instead by the House minority leader, Richard Gephardt, who opposes the deal because it squeezes out Mr. Clinton's beloved public investments. So today the left wing of the Congressional Democrats is championing what was Mr. Clinton's centrist position of 1992, and Mr. Clinton has moved rightward toward the Republican center.
The President has also moved with great glee and skill to usurp another issue dear to Republicans, namely the $500-per-child tax credit that was a core element of the Republicans' Contract With America, which helped the party sweep to power in the Congressional elections of 1994.
Mr. Clinton, for the sake of history, and the Republican leaders, for the sake of survival, needed a deal to prove they could govern. But even after last-minute horse trading around the edges, the deal remains unfairly tilted in favor of the better-off citizens of society. It drills scores of new loopholes into the tax code, mostly for the benefit of very wealthy families, at the cost of opening up large deficits early next century, conveniently beyond the 10-year period that the deal tracks.
In its political impact, the deal is apt to drive budget struggles in new and contentious directions. If deficits remain taboo, as seems likely unless a recession strikes, then Democrats and Republicans will fight even more fiercely over how to apportion a limited pie. Conservative Republicans will no doubt seek even deeper cuts in Federal taxes or a radical restructuring of the tax system. Liberals will no doubt run to raise Federal investment spending. But the brutal fiscal truth is that there are few options available to pay for either tax cuts or new spending programs. Discretionary spending and welfare programs were already slashed deeply in this and last year's budget struggles, and tax hikes are off the political agenda of both parties.
The most likely result is that each side will realize that the only way to pay for its programs is to cut deeply into middle-class entitlements. The ripest target is sure to be Medicare, which is bloated and fraud-ridden and cries out for overhaul. All signs suggest that the bipartisan entitlement commission called for by the budget deal will be no sham. It has a real problem to solve, and its recommendations are apt to fall on receptive ears as both parties struggle to cope with the new world of zero deficits.

HEADLINE: Kessler and Koop Urge Congress to Do Away With the Tobacco Settlement

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 29

 BODY:
Two of the nation's most respected public health experts urged Congress today to forgo the $368.5 billion legal settlement with the tobacco industry and instead draft legislation that would focus solely on cutting smoking rates, without giving cigarette manufacturers any concessions.
"You can do better than the settlement," Dr. David A. Kessler, former Commissioner of Food and Drugs, said in testimony before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. 
 Dr. Kessler was joined by former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, who told the lawmakers that rather than tinker with the pact, they should "face the scourge of tobacco for what it is and legislate a tobacco policy that holds the industry accountable."
Both Dr. Kessler and Dr. Koop had been critical of the tobacco accord before, most recently as co-chairmen of a panel of public health experts that in June issued a detailed critique of the settlement, calling for it to be strengthened in seven areas. But the criticism today was their harshest to date, and provoked a strong backlash from some of the state attorneys general who helped negotiate the agreement.
"This shows that they progressively are going more and more into fairy-tale land," Grant Woods, the Attorney General of Arizona, complained in an interview after he himself testified before the committee today. "They are contemplating prohibition, and that's just not going to happen in this country."
The complex tobacco agreement, reached this spring after 12 weeks of painstaking negotiations, would settle lawsuits filed by 39 states, and 17 class-action suits, in exchange for billions of dollars in payments by the cigarette industry over the next 25 years. The industry would win immunity from future class actions; in exchange, it would pay for public health and smoking cessation programs and submit to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration, as well as to strict limits on cigarette advertising.
For the pact to take effect, Congress must codify it in Federal legislation. But Dr. Kessler suggested today that there was no need for lawmakers to consider immunity. He advised the committee to reorient the debate by putting public health priorities ahead of the manufacturers' desire for financial stability.
"You don't need the industry's permission; you don't need the industry's money," he told the committee. At another point, he said, "All you need is the nation's collective courage."
But several senators were openly skeptical of the two doctors' testimony. And when pressed, Dr. Koop allowed that the settlement, if strengthened in the fashion suggested by the public health panel, would be preferable to the status quo.
"We have to deal with the art of the possible," said Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, "and not dwell in the world of the impossible."
Though the political climate surrounding tobacco has been changing amid disclosures that the industry has known for years that smoking is addictive, the industry still holds strong sway in Congress. As Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, noted in an interview, lawmakers just this week rejected President Clinton's proposal to raise the Federal tobacco tax by 20 cents a pack, to 44 cents, and instead settled on a compromise to increase it by 10 cents in 2000 and 5 cents more in 2002.
The hearing today was just one of what is expected to be a long series of proceedings to enable lawmakers to scrutinize the tobacco pact. If the disparate views of the Commerce Committee are an indication, agreement on any settlement may be difficult to reach.
Senator Wendell H. Ford, Democrat of Kentucky, a tobacco-growing state, argued that rather than weakening the F.D.A.'s hand, as most experts believe, the accord actually grants the agency more power than it could have achieved through regulation. "To get a little," he argued, "the industry gave a lot."
Senator Bill Frist, Republican of Tennessee, another tobacco state, complained that farmers had not been represented at the negotiating table, prompting Dr. Kessler to propose that the industry be required to set aside economic redevelopment money for farmers who would have to adjust to a decline in demand.
And Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, vowed to fight for restrictions on the tobacco companies' ability to market to children overseas.
"This settlement is called a global settlement," Mr. Wyden said. "But as far as I can tell, the only thing global about it is it gives U.S. tobacco companies the chance to hook millions of kids around the world."
In questioning Christine Gregoire, Attorney General for the State of Washington, Mr. Wyden elicited a tidbit of news:
During the settlement talks, Ms. Gregoire said, negotiators came close to reaching agreement with the cigarette manufacturers on a provision that would have required the companies to finance studies of the effects of their international marketing on children. But, she said, the provision fell apart at the last minute, and she believes that B.A.T. Industries P.L.C., the parent of the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, balked, persuading the Philip Morris Companies and RJR Nabisco to follow suit.
"I was amazed," Mr. Wyden said afterward.

Treasury Prices Rally Again After Report on Wage Costs

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices extended their rally yesterday, after reports showed a muted increase in labor costs.
Adding to investors' optimism was news that President Clinton and Congressional Republicans reached agreement on a plan to balance the Federal budget by 2002. 
 The budget accord "gave bonds a kick" said Steven Saslow, head of proprietary trading at HSBC Securities. "It's not a big surprise but the news is favorable."
The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 7/32, to 103 7/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.38 percent, from 6.40 percent on Monday.
Bond prices were bolstered after the Government reported that the Employment Cost Index rose eight-tenths of 1 percent in the second quarter, meeting analysts' expectations. In a separate report, the Conference Board said its consumer confidence index dropped in July, after reaching a 28-year high in June.
The labor costs report was the latest evidence that inflation is showing no sign of accelerating even in the face of brisk economic growth. The data follow reports on producer and consumers that have prompted rallies in bond prices. And in Congresssional testimony last week, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said United States economic conditions were "exceptional," signaling he was in no hurry to push short-term interest rates higher.
Washington's progress toward balancing the budget, meanwhile, improves the healthy backdrop for bonds.
"The market has a lot to be happy about," said Michelle Laughlin, bond market strategist at Prudential Securities. On Monday, the Treasury said it would sell less debt in the third quarter than many analysts expected -- good news for bondholders because a smaller pool of securities available tends to increase prices.
Today, the Treasury will announce details of next week's sales of three-year notes, 10-year notes and 30-year bonds.
In the corporate bond market, Merrill Lynch & Co., Quebecor Printing Inc. and ConAgra Inc. led three other companies selling a combined $1.3 billion of bonds.
Merrill Lynch sold $500 million of seven-year notes. Quebecor, a Montreal-based commercial printing company, sold $150 million of 30-year bonds. Investors can sell the bonds back to the company after seven years.
ConAgra, which produces a variety of food products, issued $300 million of notes that mature in 30-years and are putable after 12 years.
International Lease Finance, a Los Angeles-based company which leases aircraft, sold $100 million of five-year notes. Western Massachusetts Electric issued $60 million of four-year first mortgage bonds. Marsh Supermarkets sold $150 million of 10-year notes.
Companies have been eager to raise funds in the corporate bond market recently because borrowing rates are relatively low and demand among investors remains strong.
"Issues are coming to market, being pumped up in size," said John Poole, head of fixed-income at Mellon Private Asset Management in Boston, which has about $57 billion under management. "The new bonds are being absorbed as spreads get compressed across the board."
The spread, or gap in yield between corporate bonds and Treasury securities, was unchanged yesterday, traders said.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET DEAL: Details of Some Provisions Covering Children, Health, and Welfare -- MEDICARE;
New Options Include Shift Into Preventive Benefits, and Slightly Higher Costs

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

 BODY:
The budget agreement would make vast changes in Medicare, offering new health insurance options to the elderly, broadening coverage of preventive services and creating strong new financial incentives for managed care companies to serve people in rural areas.
Beneficiaries would pay slightly higher costs, but not nearly as much as they would have been required to pay under the budget bill that President Clinton vetoed in December 1995. 
 The new budget bill would establish seven new Medicare benefits to cover the costs of preventive health care services, including mammography, Pap smears and screening for colon cancer, prostate cancer and osteoporosis.
The budget bill would also pay for training and education to help people with diabetes care for themselves, as Speaker Newt Gingrich proposed.
These preventive benefits represent a major new emphasis for Medicare.
The budget agreement would increase payments to health maintenance organizations caring for Medicare beneficiaries in rural areas, where the payments have been too low to attract many H.M.O.'s.
Elderly people have been clamoring for such health plans because health maintenance organizations often cover prescription drugs, eyeglasses, hearing aids, basic dental care and other items not covered by the standard Medicare program.
The budget agreement would slow the growth of Medicare payments to H.M.O.'s in high-cost areas like New York City, Miami and Los Angeles. But the basic payment to health plans in these high-cost areas would still grow at least 2 percent a year, lawmakers said.
Other new options for Medicare beneficiaries would include "medical savings accounts" and private health plans owned and operated by doctors and hospitals, rather than by insurance companies.
This year's bill differs from the one vetoed in 1995 in several respects. It would not establish an overall limit on Medicare spending, for example.
Nor would it provide the beneficiary with a fixed amount of Federal money in the form of a voucher. And it would not automatically cut payments to doctors and hospitals if the cost of Medicare's conventional fee-for-service program exceeded goals set by Congress.
Robert D. Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, said: "Much of what was in the 1995 bill is also in this new bill, in a moderate form. The cuts in Medicare have been scaled back."
But he added, "You don't need such Draconian cuts" to keep Medicare solvent now because inflation and the growth of Medicare have slowed.
This year's Medicare package was developed with bipartisan cooperation; the 1995 proposals were written entirely by Republicans.
Still, Representative Pete Stark of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, said yesterday that he could not support the final version of the Medicare changes.
"Much of this Medicare bill seeks to promote managed care and to encourage the great mass of beneficiaries to join managed care plans, while letting the richest doctors and patients in our society avoid the inconveniences of managed care," Mr. Stark said.
In their final agreement, the budget negotiators killed proposals made by the Senate to increase Medicare premiums for higher-income beneficiaries, to raise the eligibility age for Medicare and to impose a new charge of $5 a visit for home health care services.
But the bill would create a 17-member Federal advisory commission to suggest how Medicare can avoid a financial crisis when baby boomers become eligible for the program after 2010.
Horace B. Deets, executive director of the American Association of Retired Persons, said the Medicare package unveiled this week was "a victory for all Americans and takes Medicare into the 21st century."
But Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas, said: "I am profoundly disappointed that we have failed to reform Medicare. What passes for reform in this budget deal is taking the fastest-growing part of Medicare -- home health care -- out of the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and financing it with general tax revenues."

HEADLINE: Spending Plan Gives Priority To Education

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 29

 BODY:
The state budget agreement announced this evening contains some ambitious schools programs that together represent the largest investment in public education that New York has ever made, the product of an unusual confluence of financial abundance and political factors.
Legislative leaders and Gov. George E. Pataki agreed to seek voter approval in November for a $2.4 billion bond act to build and repair schools and large increases in additional construction aid in state budgets in the next five years. Much of the money will go toward renovating and expanding schools, most of them in New York City, that are falling apart or badly crowded. 
 Lawmakers also committed the state to a raft of initiatives for very young students, a group education advocates have long listed among their highest priorities: prekindergarten classes for all 4-year-olds, smaller class sizes in the early grades and all-day kindergarten for districts that now have only half-day.
When all are fully in place, in the 2001-02 school year, the changes will mean $1.5 billion more a year in spending on schools, in addition to the basic state school aid and not counting money from the bond act. Though very little of the money would be spent in the next school year, the budget agreement locks in financing for the new programs in the next five years. Retreating from the plan would require an act by the Governor and the Legislature.
Apart from those programs, the budget contains an almost 6 percent increase in basic school aid, the largest since the 1980's.
"All together, this is probably the best budget year in the history of public education in New York or at least since Tom Dewey was Governor," said Louis Grumet, executive director of the New York State School Boards Association. "In sheer dollars, there's never been anything like it."
One obvious reason for this sudden largesse is the state's good fiscal health. In the 1990's, as the state struggled through the recession and its aftermath, state aid to schools increased at a modest pace, but not fast enough to keep up with inflation and growing enrollment.
But with the economy purring along and with Wall Street in the third year of a historic boom, New York State has found itself awash in cash. Rather than fighting over budget cuts, lawmakers are dividing $2.6 billion that was not spoken for, after existing programs and inflation were accounted for.
The impetus for spending much of that money on education came from the Democrats who control the Assembly. In March, the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, proposed the bond act and early-grade programs that were contained in today's agreement and said education would be his top priority for the budget.
Once it became clear this spring that Mr. Pataki would not insist on his call for deep cuts in Medicaid, there was no other major area of spending left to compete for the Assembly Democrats' attention.
"Obviously, there was a lot of money available this year," Mr. Silver said. "And when we raised these things, we found that there was a willingness to make a multiyear commitment for the first time, and to do a lot of things that hadn't been attempted before."
The Governor and the majority Republicans in the Senate said their chief goal for the state's surplus was property tax relief. From the start, it was clear that the fates of the education and property tax packages were joined, because the Republicans and Democrats needed each other to get their pet programs. In the end, each side got much of what it wanted.
But the Democrats were not alone in seeking more money for education; Mr. Pataki began the year by seeking a 3 percent increase in basic aid, an opening bid in the budget struggle that was widely seen as a signal that he would go much higher.
For the Governor, who will seek re-election next year, being generous to schools could soften an image built largely on cutting taxes and welfare and enacting tougher criminal penalties and could deflect criticism he has endured for trying to cut education spending in the past.
The school construction bond act, like last year's environmental bond act, could also help the Governor shore up his support in New York City, where he is politically weak and where the school system is plagued by hundreds of buildings that evoke Andrew Carnegie more than Bill Gates. Spending measures tend to be more popular in the city than upstate, and putting the measure on the November ballot will take advantage of the expected high turnout for the mayoral election at a time when voters in other parts of the state will have little reason to go to the polls.
For legislators of both parties, school aid is an ever-popular way of bringing state money home to their districts, and governors of both parties have long railed against what they saw as mindless spending that led to fat school bureaucracies rather than better education. Mr. Silver's proposal may have been inoculated against that kind of attack by earmarking much of the new money for classroom purposes and by singling out programs, particularly prekindergarten, that educators favor most. "We're going to finally begin to move toward a real statewide pre-K program, which may be the single most important thing that could happen in education," Mr. Grumet said.
Mr. Silver's case was aided by the State Education Commissioner, Richard P. Mills, who has spoken loudly and often about the need to rebuild crumbling schools and who called for a $5 billion bond act. It was also helped by Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, a Republican who has feuded with the Governor, who has called for a major expansion in prekindergarten education.
Currently, the state's public schools offer only 19,000 prekindergarten slots each year for more than 200,000 4-year-olds. The deal announced today would, by 2001-02, make $500 million a year available for classes for all 4-year-olds to any district that chooses to offer them. Districts would not be required to offer prekindergarten, nor would they be required to offer all-day kindergarten, but most of the state's school systems are expected to do so.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET DEAL: THE OVERVIEW;
Clinton and G.O.P. Cheer Plan to Balance Budget

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 29

 BODY:
President Clinton and the Republican leaders of Congress jubilantly -- but separately -- celebrated today their long-sought agreement on a plan to balance the Federal budget after decades of deficit spending and to provide the first Federal tax cut in 16 years.
"We have put America's fiscal house in order again," an ebullient President Clinton proclaimed on the south lawn of the White House where he was surrounded by about 100 Democrats from the House and Senate. Grinning and giving the Democrats a thumbs-up sign, he called the deal "an historic agreement that will benefit generations of Americans." 
 In their own news conference on the steps of the Capitol, Republicans called the agreement the culmination of their quest to reduce the size and power of the Federal Government. They posed with children as red, white and blue balloons floated from the banisters.
"Today we celebrate the beginning of a new era of freedom," said Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader. He said the five-year plan would "lead us to less Washington spending, to tax relief for working Americans, to security for our senior citizens and less dependency on the Government."
In fact, the compromise legislation negotiated after two and a half years of often bitter partisan fighting, had signature elements dear to each political party and the separate appearances today allowed each party to put its own political cast on the agreement.
The $94 billion in net tax cuts in the agreement would benefit students and families with children, but would also provide large cuts in the capital gains and inheritance taxes.
The deal also would establish a new $24 billion health care coverage program for as many as five million uninsured children, financed partly through a tobacco tax increase. And the legislation would restore disability benefits for legal immigrants and some money to help welfare recipients find jobs -- two elements that were eliminated last year in a welfare law.
Republican leaders planned to bring the agreement, broken into two separate bills, to the floor immediately in order to pass it by Friday, when Congress is scheduled to leave for a summer recess.
While Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the minority leader was noticeably absent from Mr. Clinton's side and had openly expressed some dissatisfaction with the outcome, the agreement was expected to win majority votes from each party with some liberal Democrats as the most prominent dissenters.
If the booming economy continues to perform as expected, the agreement would insure that the Federal budget deficit would be erased by 2002. It would be the first time since 1969 that the Federal Government would have a balanced budget, leading Mr. Clinton to call the agreement "historic" several times.
Spending over that five-year period would be reduced by about $140 billion under the agreement, with most of the savings coming from the Medicare program of Federal health insurance for the elderly.
While the agreement grants the first Federal tax reduction since 1981, the tax cut package amounts to about three-tenths of 1 percent of the economy. In economic terms, that is far less significant than the tax reduction that Ronald Reagan pushed through Congress at the beginning of his first term.
Though it is a fiscal milestone, the deal is also a political watershed, muddying the sharp distinctions that had existed between the two parties for decades on the issues of taxes and spending.
For Mr. Clinton, the deal was the finale of an ideological journey he began when the Republicans took control of Congress in 1994.
In 1995, he made the Republican call for a balanced budget his own. Now he has made good on the middle-class tax cut he proposed in 1992, but not until after he pushed through a tax increase in 1993, to tackle the deficit.
Along the way, he eventually wrenched most of his party along with him.
No less a liberal than Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, stood by the President's side today, saying, "So we have now shattered the myth that we, as Democrats, are spending Democrats and taxing Democrats, because we have come forward in support of the President's package."
For the Republicans, the agreement could be said to make good on the fiscal principles of their 1994 campaign manifesto the "Contract with America." They propelled the drive for a balanced budget and originated the call for a $500-per-child tax credit.
"Balancing the budget and cutting taxes are Republican ideas -- make no mistake about that," said Senator William V. Roth, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
The agreement also bolsters the position of embattled House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who was the first to take the microphone at the Republican news conference to call the pact "a great victory for all Americans."
The tone today was striking in contrast with the acrimony between the parties in 1995, which led to partisan veto fights, a television ad campaign and two Government shutdowns that came back to haunt the Republicans.
But the parties were forced to work together when voters in 1996 sent a mixed message, re-electing a Democratic President and a Republican Congress.
The task of balancing the budget was also made easier than expected by the prosperous economy and the resulting decline in the deficit. Even without the budget agreement, the deficit was expected to fall to $50 billion this year, from the peak of $290 billion in 1992.
Despite widespread talk of bipartisanship today, it was clear from the fact that Democrats and Republicans held separate news conferences that each side was already preparing to try to use the bipartisan agreement to advantage in the 1998 midterm elections.
The Democrats chose to showcase education programs today, ranging from the $35 billion in tax relief for college tuition costs to increases in spending for scholarship grants and literacy programs. "At the heart of this balanced budget," said Mr. Clinton, "is the historic investment in education -- the most significant education funding in more than 30 years."
The President, who tried and failed in 1994 to push through comprehensive health care coverage for all Americans, also highlighted the plan to extend health insurance coverage to as many as five million children.
"We want every child in America to grow up healthy and strong and this investment takes a major step toward that goal," Mr. Clinton said.
The Republicans by contrast put much of the emphasis on the tax cuts.
"We believe that those who work hard and follow the laws," said Senator Pete Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who chairs the Senate Budget Committee, "ought to pay less taxes and ought to keep more of their money because they can make better decisions than we can."
Mr. Gingrich said the tax reductions would help families "because we believe that parents are more important than bureaucrats in raising children."
Democratic Presidential politics were in the air as well. Mr. Clinton turned the microphone over to Vice President Al Gore, who sounded like he was trying out a campaign theme for 2000. "We are eliminating the deficit, while investing more in our future, and cutting taxes for the middle class," Mr. Gore said. "Promises made, promises kept."
Mr. Gephardt, who is expected to challenge Mr. Gore for the Democratic presidential nomination from the left, opposed the agreement because of its program cuts and tax cuts.
"I had hoped that we could have provided the tax relief to the middle-class working families that Democrats and Republicans alike had promised them," he said.
"Instead, only a quarter of the tax relief goes to people making less than $100,000 a year," Mr. Gephardt said.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET DEAL: NEWS ANALYSIS;
Taxes Cut, Credit Taken

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 29

 BODY:
Today's budgetary bonhomie went beyond tributes to the virtues of bipartisanship, though there was plenty of that from politicians who had been sniping at each other only the day before.
This moment of good feelings meant that both parties were cheerfully taking credit for each other's ideas. There was President Clinton on the South Lawn of the White House, adopting the $500-a-child tax credit, the crown jewel of the Republicans' 1994 Contract With America, as his own way to help "a wide range of middle-class parents, all those who are working hard to raise their children, pay their taxes and be good citizens." 
 A few minutes later on the Capitol steps, Representative Bill Archer, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, was boasting about the $1,500 Hope Scholarships that so many Republicans -- and educators -- had derided a few months ago as a device for little more than tuition inflation. "It tells young people," he said, "that education is not only a virtue but that we, through the tax code, will help reduce the cost of it."
But Vice President Gore topped them both, by adopting the slogan the Republicans used only last fall -- "Promises Made, Promises Kept" -- as his own watchword for 2000.
The day cried out for a political paternity test.
If one could be applied, it would find a lot of truth in the claim of Senator William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, that "balancing the budget and cutting taxes are Republican ideas."
This budget agreement has not only those two central Republican thoughts but also has many specifics of Republican origin. They include the tax credit of $500 a child, whose ancestry the Christian Coalition might well claim, cuts in capital gains and inheritance taxes, and the effort to make Medicare more flexible. It also has the Republican trademark of medical savings accounts, which Democrats usually scorn as inefficient boons for the well-off elderly and a financial threat to the idea that Medicare should serve everyone.
There are a few plainly Democratic ideas, too, and not just the $1,500 tax credits called Hope Scholarships. Health insurance for perhaps half the nation's currently uninsured children, most of whose parents are among the working poor, had crucial Republican support, especially from Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah. But it was Senator Edward M. Kennedy who enlisted Mr. Hatch and Mr. Clinton in the effort.
But the Democratic successes were even clearer on tactics and salesmanship. By the time they had finished arguing that people who did not earn enough to pay income taxes should get the $500-per-child tax credit -- and winning the argument -- the Democrats had made that seem like a more important issue than whether there should be any credit at all.
And their ability to scare Republicans who feared that the Democrats would exploit issues like capital gains and inheritance taxes to argue that they were the real friends of the middle class gave them leverage on other issues. It enabled President Clinton, for example, to fulfill his campaign promise to undo some painful elements of last year's welfare law, like the limits on disability payments to legal immigrants.
The talk of bipartisanship was not meaningless. Some of it took the form of one party's seeing the political advantage of a proposal from the other side and seizing on it -- the Republican move on the scholarships was the most dramatic example of that.
But a bigger element of cooperation came when each side accepted proposals it knew meant life and death to the other side. Democrats were no more persuaded than they had ever been that capital gains tax cuts do the economy any good. But they were convinced that there would be no deal if they rejected this Republican article of faith, so they gave in.
Similarly, Republicans saw no persuasive reason to guarantee that people moving from welfare to work be paid the minimum wage, but they did see that the Democrats would insist, so they gave in.
A cooperative tone had been set even before that in the Ways and Means subcommittee on health. The chairman, Bill Thomas of California, worked closely with the senior Democrat, Pete Stark of California, to find places to cut Medicare, an issue that Democrats used demagogically in 1996. Each of them is personally prickly, but they overcame it and cooperated, and House Republicans then fought off Senate measures that would save still more but leave them politically exposed. For the long run on Medicare, everybody's fig leaf will be another commission to make recommendations.
In the end, the relatively modest level of partisan boasting today probably reflects two core facts. The first is, as Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said this afternoon, that this is a "win-win" budget, with elements each side treasures.
The second may be the realization that this week's deal is made possible by a booming economy and is only the last in a series of actions that make the goal of balancing the budget attainable.
Neither side really gives much credit to the 1990 budget agreement, but it raised revenue and set spending ceilings. No Republican voted for the 1993 deal, which again raised taxes and continued budget ceilings. Democrats like Mr. Rubin contend that the 1993 plan insured the healthy economy that matters today. But Democrats never mention the spending cuts Republicans imposed in 1995 as a factor in balancing the budget.
So this deal is the only step that both sides can agree to praise, except for a few dozen liberal Democrats and a handful of conservative Republicans.
As Martha Phillips, the executive director of the Concord Coalition and a nonpartisan advocate of budget restraint -- who criticized the deal for its failure to address the long-range financial problems of Medicare and Social Security -- observed today: "This wasn't the longest pass. It wasn't the most spectacular run. But it was the one that got across the goal line, we think."

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET DEAL: THE EFFECTS;
A Tax Cut for the 90's, With Its Own Theme: All Things in Moderation

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 29

 BODY:
The country's last tax cut, pushed through Congress by President Ronald Reagan in 1981, was big by anybody's standards: by the time all its provisions had kicked in, the tax reductions amounted to roughly 3 percent of the country's gross domestic product.
So as Democrats and Republicans congratulate each other on a landmark accomplishment this week -- new types of I.R.A.'s, college tuition tax credits, reduced taxes for investors who hold stock for at least a year and a half -- consider just one statistic. When all its provisions are totaled up, this tax cut amounts to barely three-tenths of 1 percent of an economy that looks as if it will hit $8 trillion this year. 
 In short, in broad economic terms it does not add up to much. A few hurricanes and a bad year for the computer industry, in fact, could well have a bigger effect on the country's economic profile.
Not only is the cut small, it was designed to be small.
"We very deliberately wanted cuts that are not so large that they can do damage," Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said in his office at midday today, reflecting on a negotiating strategy that sought the maximum political gain for the least amount of economic impact. "And it is only affordable because of what we've been able to do economically over the past four years."
Think of it, said Mr. Rubin, drawing a comparison from his days on Wall Street, "as a kind of dividend, for good national economic performance."
The last details of that dividend were negotiated in such a rush over the weekend that, Mr. Rubin conceded today, no one in the Clinton Administration has yet had time to calculate what portion of it will go to the rich, what portion to the middle class and what portion to the lowest-income families.
But one feature of the tax cut became abundantly clear today: it is anything but simple.
A year ago Republicans on Capitol Hill were waving around postcard-sized tax returns, promising that whatever they did to taxes, they would make them simple. Today, as Mr. Rubin's aides tried -- and tried again -- to explain the rules that will govern three kinds of individual retirement accounts (all of which are linked, and one of which is actually for education, not retirement), they struggled to understand the agreement they had just reached.
"I haven't heard this thing explained twice the same way," one White House official conceded.
As economists were quick to point out, this is a tax cut of a very different kind. It is not intended to stimulate the economy. And it is tightly linked with spending reductions, something that never happened in the Reagan years. Though Democrats and Republicans still point fingers over who was to blame for the huge expansion of the deficit that followed the 1981 cut, that history hung over negotiators this time around.
"The 1981 tax cut was designed to explode," Mr. Rubin said today. "This one is designed not to."
Economists and the financial markets seemed to agree.
"The macroeconomic effect of this is almost nothing in the traditional sense," said Allan Sinai, the chief global economist of Primark Decision Economics, a consulting group to major companies around the world. "But it is also the last act in eliminating a massive structural deficit that has preoccupied Washington for 10 years. And in that sense, it is a demonstration that the country has recovered from the troubles of the 80's."
Recovered so much, in fact, that Mr. Sinai predicts that over the next decade, "we'll have more years in which the Government runs a surplus than years in which it runs a deficit."
"And that," he said, "opens a whole new world for the Washington agenda."
Of course, with no tax cut at all the surpluses would come sooner. But then politicians would not be able to boast that taxpayers were getting a post-deficit dividend.
Not everyone today was as enthusiastic about the agreement as Mr. Sinai.
"Maybe a mother could love it," said Martha Phillips, executive director of the Concord Coalition, the group that led calls to wipe out the deficit. "It shows all the trademarks of a compromise, a real-world deal that satisfies no one. But it is what you have to expect in real-world situations."
Ms. Phillips and others point out that the ticking time bomb of future budgets -- the escalation of Social Security and other entitlement spending as the baby boomers begin to retire -- is not addressed in this budget.
Nor is a balanced budget any guarantee that the economy will continue to chug along, or that the stock market will stay in the stratosphere. But in a world of unforgiving investors, and of capital that can fly around the globe with a few strokes of the keyboard, the agreement seems likely to bolster confidence that the United States plans to keep its economic house in order.
"This was more show than substance, but it was important show," said David M. Jones, vice chairman of Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a New York bond dealer. "The important decisions, it turns out, were all made in 1993, when the hard choices were made about the budget. Those decisions put us on a beautiful economic course. And that has created an environment that gave everyone a lot to work with."
In fact, what is perhaps the most remarkable aspect of this agreement is that for all the usual moaning and groaning about painful choices, there was less genuine agony than in any other budget negotiation in recent memory.
Part of the reason was that the Republicans desperately needed to show some unity after the failed coup attempt against Speaker Newt Gingrich. But the main reason was the huge inflow of unexpected revenue to the Treasury, a windfall that allowed the negotiators to sidestep the hardest political challenges. Early this year, for example, there was talk of recalculating the inflation rate in ways that would lower Social Security outlays; that issue was safely kicked down the road.
But the final result is not likely to make the process of filing a tax return any easier. The plethora of I.R.A.'s, for example, will vastly complicate financial planning for middle-income families, for whom the retirement accounts are an important tax shelter. Treasury officials said today that they expected that brokerage houses, scrambling to attract investors' dollars, would step into the void, providing free advice in an effort to lure new accounts. The eligibility rules for the child tax credit are also complex.
"Sometime around midnight," one negotiator for the White House said today, "simplicity went out the window."

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET DEAL: Highlights Of Some Provisions Covering Taxes and Tax Credits -- INHERITANCE;
Family Firms May Get Help

BYLINE: By CHRIS DREW 

 BODY:
In expanding exemptions from estate taxes, one of the highest Federal levies, the budget agreement would provide more shelter for upper-income taxpayers, family farms and family-held businesses.
The tax, which applies to wealth handed down from one generation to the next, hits the families of only 1 percent of the Americans who die each year. But with rising stock and home values, more people are paying the tax, and owners of small businesses have complained that it is hard for them to pass down their enterprises intact. 
 So under the deal, the Government would increase the amount of any estate that is exempted from Federal taxation to $1 million, from $600,000, over the next 10 years.
And, at the prodding of Republicans in Congress, it would create an additional $700,000 exemption for families with farms and businesses. This break would take effect next year, allowing families to shelter a total of $1.3 million in assets from the tax, which can be as high as 55 percent.
The changes could eliminate this "death tax" for half of the nearly 30,000 households a year that now pay it. Private analysts estimated that this could cost the Treasury from $2 billion to $3 billion annually.
Still, most analysts said the increase in the basic exemption was warranted because it was set at $600,000 in 1987 and had never been adjusted for inflation.
But the idea of special breaks for family farms and businesses has been controversial, and even the beneficiaries were not entirely happy with the new plan.
Jamie Wickett of the National Federation of Independent Business said his organization would continue to push for a total elimination of the tax.
But William G. Gale, an economist at the Brookings Institution, questioned why the groups deserved extra breaks, given other subsidies they receive. CHRISTOPHER DREW

HEADLINE: New York Joins Inquiry Into River Damage

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
In a move that could lead to a protracted legal battle between New York State and one of the nation's largest industrial companies, the state will join a Federal effort to determine the costs of environmental damage to the Hudson River from toxic chemicals, Gov. George E. Pataki announced yesterday.
The inquiry will also determine if any polluters should be sued to recover those costs. 
 While Mr. Pataki and other state officials named no particular polluters yesterday, the decision to investigate the damage was clearly a blow to the General Electric Company, which operated two factories on the upper Hudson that produced the river's most significant single taint -- a concentration of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCB's, a toxic chemical that may cause cancer in humans.
Last month, the chairman of General Electric, John F. Welch Jr., met with Mr. Pataki to urge him to wait for more scientific data before deciding whether to join the Federal inquiry.
Later, in a letter to the Governor dated June 23, Mr. Welch predicted that a lawsuit would be long and costly, and he invoked the company's 126 years as a major employer and taxpayer in the state in urging Mr. Pataki to move slowly.
Seeking compensation for damages to natural resources under the Federal Superfund law could result in more than $1 billion in claims against Hudson River polluters by the state and Federal governments, several environmental experts said.
For example, commercial and recreational fishermen have lost about $40 million a year for the last 23 years because of bans on catching valuable Hudson River species like striped bass, which were contaminated with PCB's, said Cara Lee, the environmental director of Scenic Hudson Inc., a private environmental group based in Poughkeepsie.
Mr. Pataki's decision to involve New York in the assessment was significant, Ms. Lee said, because the Superfund law allows for a broader array of environmental damages to be tallied when a state is involved in the assessment.
"The state has stepped up to the plate," she said.
John P. Cahill, the State Commissioner of Environmental Conservation, said that the environmental damage assessment would extend from the river's upper reaches, where PCB's coat the bottom, to New York Harbor, where a mix of heavy metals, PCB's, dioxins and other toxic chemicals from a variety of sources taint the water and mud.
The initial investigation will be aimed only at tallying the environmental damage, Mr. Cahill said. Any decision to seek monetary penalties would take years, he said.
But the State Attorney General, Dennis C. Vacco, said that making polluters pay for cleaning the river was clearly a goal of the investigation.
"Even when active pollution stops," Mr. Vacco said in a written statement, "polluters still must compensate the public for the long-term harm to our resources."
The Federal Environmental Protection Agency is already six years into a study of how to clean up the worst taint in the upper river, a stain of PCB's that flowed for four decades from two General Electric factories in the upstate towns of Hudson Falls and Fort Edward. But that study is examining only the cost of the specific cleanup, not damages to the ecosystem as a whole or to assets like beaches or fisheries.
"The importance here is the shift in the debate from just science to economics," Ms. Lee said. She said that by far the most significant taint in the river is the concentration of PCB's from the General Electric plants.
General Electric officials said the company has already spent more than $120 million to stop the flow of PCB's from its old factory grounds.
Yesterday, David Warshaw, a spokesman for General Electric, said the company was glad to see that the Pataki administration was looking at the river as a whole rather than restricting its inquiry solely to G.E.

Connecticut Exports Rise

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
The export business in Connecticut has picked up, but it still lags behind the rest of the nation, two new reports say.
The state increased its export of manufactured goods in the first quarter by 5.3 percent over the same period a year ago, compared with an 8.6 percent growth rate for the rest of the nation, The Connecticut Economic Resource Center, a private, nonprofit economic development company, reported on Monday. 
 Connecticut's exports rose $95 million to $1.89 billion during the first quarter, the group said.
From 1990 to 1996, Connecticut increased its exports 32 percent, while the rest of the country saw a 57 percent increase, according to a study released on Monday by the United States Department of Commerce.
"Why we've lagged over time is hard to say," said Jeff Blodgett, resource director of the Economic Resource Center.

HEADLINE: The Phoenix of Belgrade: Milosevic Rises From Yugoslavia's Ashes

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Serbia, July 26

 BODY:
The whistling, jeering protesters who jammed the streets of this city for three months have evaporated, their bristling energy transformed into sullen apathy. The trio of leaders who stood before them no longer talk to each other.
And reigning victorious is the chief target of the fizzled opposition movement, the last unreformed Communist leader of Eastern Europe, Slobodan Milosevic. 
 In a triumphant sign of his renewed strength, Mr. Milosevic elevated himself earlier this month from President of Serbia to President of Yugoslavia, which consists of Serbia and Montenegro.
One candidate for the Serbian presidency will be the opposition leader, Vuk Draskovic. But many here predict that he will not be running as an authoritative opponent, but rather as a compromised politician willing to submit himself to Mr. Milosevic's gamesmanship.
In what looked like an astounding act of groveling, Mr. Draskovic, who six months ago was lambasting Mr. Milosevic as an emblem of unreconstructed evil to tens of thousands of ebullient demonstrators, met Mr. Milosevic in a recent friendly televised encounter and lamely accepted Mr. Milosevic's newly gerrymandered election districts.
Those who mobilized the demonstrations and organized international support have watched the collapse of the opposition movement and the phoenix-like rise of Mr. Milosevic with a combination of despondency and cynicism. In large part, they say, the opposition coalition -- known as Zajedno, or Together -- was made up of weak political parties led by vain and compromised politicians.
"It is now clear that the demonstrations were a civic rebellion, not anything organized by the opposition parties," said Veran Matic, a founder of B92, the only independent radio network in Serbia. "The political parties were not authentic, but just creeds for the interests and vanities of their leaders."
Others assert that because the opposition was not courageous enough to condemn the Serbs' leading role in the Bosnian war, the demonstrations were doomed to fail.
"The people are sunk in their passivity because they know they are guilty," said Srdja Popovic, a Yugoslav lawyer who practices in New York and visited Belgrade during the winter. "They know the lies they took in -- they know they triumphed when Sarajevo was bombed. As a nation they have lost all self-respect."
The opposition fared poorly even in its short-term objective of taking over municipalities. As Mayor of Belgrade, Zoran Djindjic, the head of the Democratic Party of Serbia, has been unable to improve the third-world state of Belgrade's hospitals, transportation and telephones.
Disillusioned supporters accuse him of nepotism in filling jobs at City Hall. While some of his supporters watched flabbergasted as Mr. Draskovic made peace with Mr. Milosevic, Mr. Djindjic was on vacation. It was left to the third political leader of Vejedno, Vesna Pesic, to make some mild comments about Mr. Draskovic's gullibility.
For their part, the university students who gave the citizen demonstrators courage and verve by penning daily witticisms and distributing props like whistles, have fallen largely silent.
The lack of resolve on the opposition side has made it easier for Mr. Milosevic to resurrect himself.
One of his newest allies is an old ally, the Serbian ultranationalist Vojislav Seselj, who provided many of the most violent paramilitary troops for Mr. Milosevic's war of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia.
Mr. Seselj is now Mayor of the municipality of Zemun within Belgrade, where last month he ordered the eviction of three Croatian families from their homes.
After a Belgrade lawyer defended one of the families in court, he was badly beaten by one of Mr. Seselj's bodyguards before a roomful of people. The lawyer, Nikola Barovic, suffered a broken nose, cheek and rib, but denied that the attack had happened. Mr. Seselj said the lawyer had "slipped on a banana peel."
The renewed relationship between Mr. Milosevic and Mr. Seselj leaves what remains of the opposition in Serbia particularly unnerved. "What Seselj did to the Croatian families is pure fascism," said Nikola Kojic, a leader in the University of Belgrade's student parliament.
Mr. Seselj has announced his candidacy, and there are signs, particularly the glowing coverage he has received on state television, that Mr. Milosevic favors him over the candidate from his own Socialist Party.
Disquiet in the army in February, made evident by a statement of support for the students by the Chief of Staff, Gen. Momcilo Perisic, appeared to be the greater threat to Mr. Milosevic's control. But only recently a smiling General Perisic was shown prominently on the state television with Mr. Milosevic.
Similarly, rumblings of opposition in the Serbian Orthodox Church have stopped.
Serbia's wealthiest businessman, Bogoljub Karic, who owns the only network of private banks and the only private television station in Belgrade, said during the height of the opposition that he would run against Mr. Milosevic.
But when Mr. Milosevic ordered state industries to pull their deposits from the Karic bank and the Telecommunications Ministry curbed the transmission of Karic television programs, he withdrew his candidacy and hurried to make amends.
The Clinton Administration did not send congratulations on Mr. Milosevic's inauguration on July 23, but Mr. Karic's station tried to give the impression that it had. As the announcer read a telegram of good will from President Fidel Castro of Cuba, the station showed old clips of Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright shaking hands with Mr. Milosevic.
In cities now controlled by the opposition, Mr. Milosevic used more direct methods against television stations. More than 50 television and radio stations have been shuttered by the Serbian police on the grounds that their licenses were not in order, eliminating alternatives to the heavily controlled propaganda machine of state television.
And the weekly magazine Nin, considered the most reliable and most serious publication in Serbia, has a new editor-in-chief, Milivoj Glisic, and now embraces a more Serbian, nationalistic editorial policy. A third of the journalists have left in protest.
Mr. Milosevic may be back in full control, but the Yugoslav economy shows no sign of reviving. For ordinary people, the economy goes from bad to worse. Many state employees have not been paid since April, and farms are failing.
Would-be entrepreneurs say small businesses are impossible to establish, licenses are fixed with bribes and connections to the Socialist Party are all that count. A political mafia of close cronies continues to suck out cash from the state monopolies, Western economists assert.
The economy is further hobbled by Washington's refusal to allow the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund to lend money to Yugoslavia until it cooperates with the International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague.
But Mr. Milosevic does not seem to care. True to his past, he is intent on power, no matter what destruction it causes, his critics say.
"When Milosevic tried to rule the Communist Party, he destroyed it," said Mr. Popovic. "Then by creating the war, he destroyed Yugoslavia. Now he's trying to destroy what is left of Yugoslavia."

CORRECTION-DATE: August 6, 1997, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of a transmission error, an article on Wednesday about the resurgence of Slobodan Milosevic, now President of Yugoslavia, referred incorrectly to the aftermath of the beating of a lawyer who challenged the eviction of a Croatian family from its Belgrade home. The victim, Nikola Barovic, indeed acknowledges that the attack occurred; it was denied by Vojislav Seselj, the Serbian ultranationalist who is the municipal leader in the neighborhood where the eviction order was issued, and whose bodyguard administered the beating.

"A Novelist Begins With a Splash" (Arts pages, July 29) is a discerning analysis of the publicity surrounding Arundhati Roy's debut novel, "The God of Small Things," and the subsequent obscenity charges filed against the author in an Indian court.
Contrary to Ms. Roy's hyperbolic claim that the charges show how "one citizen can hold literature to ransom," and contrary to the common assumption that these charges are comparable to the fatwa imposed on Salman Rushdie, they are rather, as you point out, more on the order of "nuisance litigation." 
 The litigation is best understood in the context of a country that has a large pool of unemployed and poorly paid lawyers, many of whom can be hired for less than $10 a day.
Moreover, it is easier to file such charges in the Indian legal system. This is why most Indians dismiss the whole farce, even as they recognize that such episodes can notch up sales in the West and be reconstituted as yet another narrative of third world bigotry.

Dollar Ends Little Changed After Early Gains Evaporate

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
The dollar gave back early gains to end little changed yesterday against the mark and the yen.
Holding the dollar back against the mark, a member of the Bundesbank's policy-making council, Hans-Jurgen Kobnick, hinted that the central bank might raise interest rates in an effort to lure global investors to mark-denominated assets. 
 Reports that some American auto makers were urging Washington to watch Japanese trade practices and to consider sanctions knocked the dollar from an 11-week high against the yen.
"Some people are expecting the Bundesbank, as early as next week, to increase rates, so there's been some decent dollar selling," said Domenick Presa, chief currency trader at the Dresdner Bank. "And with the dollar hitting 119 yen, there's going to be concern over mumblings about trade out of Japan and the U.S."
The dollar rose as high as 118.97 yen before retreating to settle at 118.57 yen in New York trading, up from 118.53 yen on Tuesday. The dollar reached an intraday high of 1.8450 marks before settling at 1.8370 marks, up from 1.8367 marks.
The dollar was also strong in early trading against the Swiss franc, rising as high as 1.5258, its highest since August 1993, before settling at 1.5122 Swiss francs, down from 1.5180 francs. The pound rose to $1.6287 from $1.6239.
The dollar gave up gains against the yen on reports that the American Automobile Manufacturers Association earlier this month asked United States officials to put Japan on a list of countries being considered for trade sanctions.
United States auto makers have repeatedly said a strong dollar is giving their Japanese counterparts a trade advantage by making American cars more expensive in Japan. While the dollar is down from a four-and-a-half-year high of 127.50 yen it set in May, it has climbed nearly halfway back.
Some currency traders grew concerned that United States officials might heed manufacturers' complaints, signaling they are no longer as keen on a strong dollar as they have been in the past.
"With the dollar creeping up to these levels, you're going to get a pickup in rhetoric over trade," said Richard Koss of MFR Inc.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
A report shows how hard it is to break welfare dependency.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON is betting that last year's welfare legislation, mandating a five-year time limit on cash benefits, will end dependence as we know it. And the first signs have been encouraging: the combination of a strong job market and tougher eligibility rules has trimmed the welfare rolls by 800,000 in the last two years.
But a new report from the Manpower Demonstration Research Corporation on Ohio's experiment in keeping teen-age mothers in school suggests there are limits to financial carrots and sticks. It is far from clear that dependency can be reduced to the levels demanded by Congress. And "nobody's planning what to do" with those who are stranded, said Rebecca Blank, director of the Northwestern-University of Chicago Joint Center for Poverty Research. 
 Roughly half the long-term welfare recipients started on the rolls as teen-age mothers. So Ohio's decision to create its Learning, Earning and Parenting program in 1989 -- and to set it up as a controlled experiment -- was hailed as a key test of then-radical approaches to welfare reform. Teen-age mothers lose $62 a month from their average $274 benefit if they fail to attend school. As important, they get a $62 bonus if they stay. Child care and transportation are included.
M.D.R.C., a New York-based nonprofit organization that evaluates social programs, compared outcomes over four years for some 2,000 randomly chosen recipients of the Ohio program in 12 counties against a control group not given bonuses or penalties.
Participants still in school when they were chosen did prove somewhat more likely to earn a high school equivalency degree, or G.E.D., and were also more likely to be employed two years later. But teen-age mothers who had already dropped out of school when they entered the program barely responded to the financial incentives, and both their earnings and rate of degree completion were essentially the same as the control group.
What's more, even the relatively successful teen-agers who entered the program while still in school fared only marginally better than those outside the program. Just 46 percent graduated from high school or received an equivalency degree, compared with 39 percent of the controls.
The program's incentives were toughened in late 1996 to reflect the brave new world of welfare reform: Ohio added both a $200 cash bonus for graduation and stiffer benefit sanctions for nonattendence. Whether this will improve on the program's modest achievements, though, is anyone's guess. "Financial incentives should be part of the mix," concluded Judy Gueron, the president of M.D.R.C., "but there's no easy answer for the dependent population."
Easy or hard, there had better be answers, since the deadline clock is now ticking. And from the Olympian perspective of a statistician, the task of trimming welfare does not seem all that daunting: Daniel McMurrer, Isabel Sawhill and Robert Lerman of the Urban Institute have calculated that the new legislation requires states to push about 140,000 welfare recipients annually into the labor force over the next five years, an addition of just 10 percent to the natural growth of the work force.
But poverty specialists are not all optimistic. A chunk of the welfare population -- mostly women felled by bad luck, illness or divorce -- leave welfare quickly on their own. A second group can be made employable with training, counseling and financial incentives in a strong job market. A third group, however, is too damaged mentally or physically even for the most desperate employer.
A few months of benefits usually allows the first group to solve its dependence problems. The real hurdle, then, will be to press the second, marginally employable group into school, training or low-end jobs -- a plausible goal in the current, low-unemployment economy. "If there's a recession, though," Ms. Sawhill cautioned, "all bets are off."
Thereafter, though, reformers will enter uncharted territory. Perhaps the hard-core unemployable aren't so hard core. Perhaps some will respond to the deadline by shaping up -- or, as Ms. Sawhill suggests, by slipping into the gray economy to live off private charity, petty crime and relatives. "We've been naive about the sources of income available to the poor," she argued.
Ms. Blank notes that Washington could waive the deadlines, or states could spend money on cases that can't be shoehorned into the Federal quota. This may seem unlikely, she points out, but the option could gain credibility "once there is evidence of children sleeping on the streets."
The more dismal possibility suggested by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, during the welfare reform debate is that Americans will learn to ignore a new breed of street people the way they grew accustomed to ignoring the mentally ill homeless. "Sometimes I think we'll tolerate anything if it happens slowly enough," Ms. Sawhill lamented.

HEADLINE: Sales of New Homes Up 6.1%, Showing Firmness for Housing

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 30

 BODY:
Sales of new single-family homes rose 6.1 percent in June, maintaining a level high enough to suggest that the housing market entered the third quarter on firm footing.
The Commerce Department said today that new-home sales increased to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 819,000 in June. At the same time, May's sales growth was revised downward, to 1 percent from the 7.1 percent reported initially. In April, sales fell 7.4 percent. 
 Home sales increased during June in the Midwest, the South and the West. They fell in the Northeast.
Analysts said they expected housing sales, and the economy over all, to continue to grow.
Today's report showed that an important measure of consumer demand, the supply of homes for sale nationwide, decreased four-tenths of 1 percent in June, to an annual rate of 282,000.
The inventory of vacant homes fell to a 4.2-month supply, the lowest since July 1971.
Samuel Kahan, an economist at ASK Financial Research in Chicago, said that was an indication that "builders are very cautious about how long good times can last, and they're running a hand-to-mouth operation."
Still, other analysts view lean inventories as a sign that builders will soon start a flurry of new construction projects to meet demand. Housing starts rose 4.8 percent in June, the first gain since April.
Builders are indeed optimistic. "Granted, nothing lasts forever, but the way the economy is running feels good and I don't see it taking any abrupt turns," said Robert Strudler, chief executive officer of the U.S. Home Corporation, one of the nation's largest home builders.
The Commerce Department said the average price of a new home rose to $176,400 in June from $168,500 during May. That was still below April's $179,100.

HEADLINE: Roman Ships Found Off Sicily; New Sites Broaden Study

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD 

 BODY:
Exploring off the northwest coast of Sicily with a once-secret nuclear submarine, oceanographers and archeologists have discovered the largest concentration of ancient shipwrecks ever found in the deep sea, including one ship that may have carried a prefabricated temple.
The findings, announced yesterday, take archeology deeper than ever before, promising a new era of discoveries in maritime history. 
 A research team led by Dr. Robert D. Ballard, whose previous finds include the Titanic and the German battleship Bismarck, announced the discovery of eight sailing ships lying 2,500 feet beneath the Mediterranean. Until now maritime archeology has been largely confined to coastal shallows of less than 200 feet, the range for scuba divers.
But with the United States Navy's NR-1 nuclear submarine, the explorers were able to reach 3,000 feet and search the bottom for weeks at a time, using long-range sonar to detect shipwrecks at great distances. Then, with the remotely controlled vehicle Jason, which can descend 20,000 feet and use grappling arms to collect artifacts, the team inspected the wrecks up close and retrieved 115 items from the oldest ships.
Because the artifacts were found in international waters, they presumably belong to the salvagers under maritime law. Their historical value is inestimable, their monetary value unestimated.
Five ships were from Roman times, presumably lost in storms while plying the busy trade routes from Rome to North Africa. The oldest, a 100-foot-long vessel dating from about 100 B.C., is one of the earliest Roman wrecks ever discovered. Her holds were filled with amphoras, the clay shipping containers of the ancient world. Another Roman ship, probably from the first century A.D., carried cut stones, apparently ready for assembly into a temple.
Also in the wreckage, which is spread over 20 square miles, were three more modern sailing ships. One was an Islamic ship from the 18th or early 19th century; the other two were lost in the 19th century.
Dr. Ballard, president of the Institute for Exploration, in Mystic, Conn., and other team members described the discovery in interviews and at a news conference at the National Geographic Society in Washington.
Recalling the view of the wrecks from the submarine, Dr. Ballard said in an interview, "All of sudden, we realized we had found a graveyard of ships spanning 2,000 years."
The Navy still owns and operates the NR-1, but at the end of the cold war it parted the curtain of secrecy and made the submarine available for exploration, including Dr. Ballard's research into ancient shipping.
Dr. Anna Marguerite McCann, the expedition's director of archeology, was enthusiastic about the immediate discovery, but even more so about its implications for the future. Both she and Dr. Ballard spoke of the research as a demonstration that deep-sea archeology is emerging as a new branch of science.
When marine archeology was limited to 200 feet, 95 percent of the sea floor was beyond its reach. Archeologists and historians often assumed that mariners in antiquity hugged the coast and rarely ventured into the open sea. Their assumption is only now being disproved.
"The high seas were definitely traveled by mariners in ancient times," Dr. Ballard said. "That means the potential for discovery with this new technology is huge. The average depth of the Mediterranean is 9,000 feet, and so there must be a tremendous amount of antiquity preserved in the deep sea."
Not only does the large number of shipwrecks in a relatively small area suggest heavy traffic, but the state of preservation at great depths promises to be especially revealing.
"Deep-sea wrecks are more likely to be intact and their artifacts unbroken," Dr. McCann said. "In shallow waters, they are more likely to get banged up by waves and against reefs, encrusted with coral or buried by sand or looted by treasure hunters."
The wooden decks, rigging and upper hulls of the five Roman ships had been destroyed by wood borers, team members said, but timbers buried in mud were well preserved. The cargoes appeared to be undisturbed. The pilot of the remotely controlled Jason, which is owned by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on Cape Cod, was able to maneuver the robot on a detailed survey of each wreck and pick up delicate artifacts, including fine glassware.
Among the items are kitchen and other household wares, fine bronze vessels, two heavy lead anchor pieces and at least eight different types of amphoras intended for storing wine, olive oil, fish sauce and preserved fruit, Dr. McCann said.
One of the most intriguing items is the heavy cargo of high-quality marble or granite building stones still in the hold of a Roman ship from the first century. The artifacts include monolithic columns and large cut blocks of stone.
"Some of the stones appeared to have notches where they were to be fitted together," Dr. Ballard said. "Perhaps this was a pre-fab temple being shipped somewhere."
Dr. McCann, an adjunct professor of archeology at Boston University, said discoveries like these promise to provide a new picture of trade in the ancient Mediterranean. "A new economic history of the Roman world is going to have to be written," she said.
In 1989 Dr. Ballard, working with Dr. McCann, made their first ancient deep-sea discovery, a small fourth-century Roman ship they named Isis. The Jason robot was used to recover artifacts that suggested it was a widely traveled trading vessel. The location of the wreck, off Sicily, suggested that the ship was sailing between Rome and Carthage, a powerful North African city in antiquity near present-day Tunis.
For the new explorations, Dr. Ballard's expedition returned to the site, about 80 miles northwest of Trapani, Sicily. The waters there are known for their treacherous currents and dangerous reefs.
In some cases, the submarine picked up debris trails on the bottom, evidence of what Dr. Ballard said was a storm-tossed ship in distress that was jettisoning cargo in an attempt to save itself. Sometimes at the head of a debris trail would be the wreck of the ship. A trail that did not lead to a wreck presumably told the story of a storm's survivor.
These trails reminded Dr. Ballard of the story of St. Paul in Acts 27:38: When his Rome-bound ship ran into a storm, "they lightened the ship" by throwing over the cargo.
Further exploration of the Mediterranean routes is planned and next summer, Dr. Ballard said, he is to investigate trade routes in the Black Sea.

Long Bond's Yield Hits 17-Month Low

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Long-term interest rates fell to their lowest level in almost a year and a half yesterday as optimism about low inflation and slowing economic growth continued to propel this summer's swift bond market rally.
The price of the 30-year bond rose 25/32, to 104 1/32, bringing the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, down to 6.32 percent, from 6.38 percent on Tuesday. Since April 14, the yield on the 30-year bond has dropped three-quarters of a percentage point and is now the lowest since 6.24 percent on Feb. 16, 1996. 
 Shorter-term interest rates have also fallen sharply, with the yield on the 10-year note down to 6.03 percent from 6.97 percent and the yield on the two-year note down to 5.74 percent from 6.51 percent. At this level, the yield on the two-year note is just a quarter of a percentage point above the 5.5 percent level the Federal Reserve has set for the overnight Federal funds rate, its target for short-term interest rates.
The rally is expected to be tested over the next two days as the Government reports the growth rate for the second quarter today and the employment data for July tomorrow. Forecasters expect less than 2 percent growth in the second quarter and an increase of 200,000 nonfarm payroll jobs in July.
Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at Nationsbank, said yesterday that about a third of the drop in interest rates can be attributed to the slowdown in growth from the first quarter, when the economy moved ahead at a 5.9 percent annual pace. The rest, he said, can be attributed to a decline in inflation expectations, which has been assisted by agreement in Washington on a tax cut and budget plan.
But he is not sure that long-term interest rates can move much lower in the near term because he expects economic growth to pick up. He said that increases in personal income, the decline in interest rates and the strong rally in the stock market all should turn into an increase in consumer spending and improvement in the housing market.
But while he expects rates to rise when this happens, he does not think they will rise as high as the 7.17 percent in April. Because investors have become more comfortable with the idea that healthy growth can exist with low inflation, interest rate highs and lows are getting lower, he said.
William Dudley, the chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, believes that the decline in the demand for Government borrowing as the Federal deficit has shrunk has also pulled interest rates lower.
He said that rates could move lower because of the impact this rally had had on portfolio managers. When interest rates decline, he said, homeowners refinance their mortgages and companies pay off outstanding bonds to refinance at lower rates.
This shortens the average maturity of bond portfolios, changing their risk, because the mortgages and bonds paid off have longer maturities. To keep maturities constant, portfolio managers have to buy longer-term Treasury notes and bonds. That extra demand can push interest rates lower than they might fall based on economic fundamentals.
Also yesterday, the Treasury announced the details of its quarterly sale of notes and bonds, which will be held next week. The sale will include $16 billion in 3-year notes on Tuesday, $12 billion of 10-year notes on Wednesday and $10 billion of 30-year bonds on Thursday. The auction comes at a time when the Government's borrowing needs are shrinking as the budget deficit declines. But the Treasury said that it was not currently planning any changes in its quarterly cycle.

HEADLINE: The Truth About Wages

BYLINE: By Alan B. Krueger; Alan B. Krueger, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University, served as chief economist at the Labor Department from 1994 to 1995.

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J.

 BODY:
Wall Street's chief fear has been that wage increases will exceed inflation, depressing corporate profits and igniting an inflationary wage-price spiral. Main Street's chief fear has usually been the opposite: that wage increases will fail to keep pace with inflation, lowering real living standards and forcing more family members into work.
Six years of economic recovery have generated 13 million net new jobs and the lowest unemployment rate in 24 years. Market analysts and the Federal Reserve have carefully watched for signs that the tightest job market in memory might fuel inflation. The slight increase in employment costs that the Labor Department reported Tuesday was scrutinized for its effect on inflation. Sensing little inflationary pressure, the market hit a new high. 
 But little attention was given to what the slow growth in wages and fringe benefits means to the workers themselves. Isn't it time for economic policy makers and the press to stop treating bad news for workers as good news for the economy? The slowly growing real wages of many Americans -- especially the least well off -- still pose a long-term problem that is best addressed while the economy is strong.
The maze of statistics often tell a conflicting and confusing story, in part because different segments of the work force are faring differently. Comparing wages at comparable phases of the business cycle reveals some striking trends.
From 1979 to 1989, the inflation-adjusted wage rate of the worker in the bottom 10th percentile -- someone earning just above the minimum wage -- fell by an astounding 16 percent. The real wage of the median worker fell by 2 percent. Only higher-income workers did well: at the 90th percentile, pay increased by 5 percent.
From 1989 to 1997, real wages for workers at the bottom essentially stopped falling and the growth of wages for workers at the top continued at a more moderate pace. But wages for the majority of workers in the middle -- the vast American middle class -- continued to erode, with the median worker's wage falling 5 percent since 1989.
There is reason for skepticism that rapid pay increases will return any time soon. In the last year, the real median weekly wage of full-time employees increased by just 0.3 percent. No one knows for sure why wages have been stagnant. Obvious candidates include increased international competition, the decline of unions, deregulation and technological change.
Regardless of the reasons, the vast middle is sagging relative to the bottom and top. This has kept inflation at bay.
With subdued growth in wages, why does the public express such satisfaction with the economy? In part, it is simply because the economy has improved. Finding a job has rarely been easier. Inflation is low. The steep decline in wages among the lowest-paid workers has come to a halt.
Many economists also think that these reported wage trends are too pessimistic because the measured inflation rate overstates the rise in the true cost of living by inadequately adjusting for new and improved products. And the 40 percent or so of Americans who own stock have enjoyed a tremendous boom.
But the public must also feel we are in an Alice-in-Wonderland economy. If real wages don't pick up, the reported satisfaction with the economy could ebb.
It has gone almost unnoticed that there is some room for wages to grow without igniting inflation. Employer health insurance costs are now falling, and a sudden turnaround seems unlikely. The cost of other fringe benefits is increasing less than inflation. There has also been an unprecedented decline for six straight months in the price of intermediate goods like parts and components.
Combined with a recent increase in productivity, these savings could permit wages to grow without increasing the price of goods. And with profits at record levels, profit share could decline to accommodate wage growth and reduce price pressures.
Rapid economic growth has not been sufficient to lift real wages. We are in danger that when this economic upswing ends, it will be the first recovery on record in which the real wage of the median worker fell.
The economy has so successfully eliminated inflation and generated job growth that we can now turn to the problem of wage stagnation.

HEADLINE: Magic Johnson Project Shifts to Another Harlem Site

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

 BODY:
A movie theater chain partly owned by Magic Johnson has shifted its sights for a new 12-screen multiplex along 125th Street to Harlem Center, a state project at Lenox Avenue that is being developed by an arm of the Abyssinian Baptist Church and Forest City Ratner Companies, the chain's president said yesterday.
Kenneth Lombard, president of the Johnson Development Corporation of Beverly Hills, Calif., said he had begun talks with the developers of Harlem Center several weeks ago after months of negotiations with Robert W. Seavey, owner of a site between Second and Third Avenues, broke down because of differences on rent and concerns about parking. 
 But Mr. Lombard said that negotiations for a second New York City theater project, in Jamaica, Queens, are close to completion.
Johnson Development, which is half-owned by Mr. Johnson and Sony Retail Entertainment, operates two Magic Johnson Theaters, in Los Angeles and Atlanta, and has another under construction in Houston. A year ago, the company announced plans to add 200 screens at multiplexes in minority-group neighborhoods in several cities, including the Harlem and Jamaica projects.
The company began talks with Mr. Seavey last year and spent months studying the site and agreeing upon designs before realizing that they could not agree on rent, Mr. Lombard said. "They were in the high $20's per square foot and we were in the teens," he said.
In addition, the theater chain insisted on about 300 parking spaces. Mr. Seavey would have had to dig a parking garage beneath the theaters, or buy additional land for a surface lot, Mr. Lombard said. Either way, it would add too much to the costs of the project, he said. Mr. Seavey did not return a telephone call to his office seeking comment.
By switching to Harlem Center, a planned 350,000-square-foot retail and office project on 125th Street between Lenox Avenue and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard, Johnson Development may be able to combine its efforts with yet another Sony joint venture: The Imax Corporation, which builds and operates giant-screen movie theaters, has already expressed interest in the project, state officials said. That could make for a combined cinema project similar to the Lincoln Square theaters, at 68th Street and Broadway in Manhattan, but under the Magic Johnson Theaters brand rather than Sony's, the officials said.
Another benefit, officials said, is that the Harlem Center site already has a 450-space parking garage.
Forest City Ratner, one of the city's busiest builders, and Abyssinian Development were chosen as developers of Harlem Center last month by the Empire State Development Corporation, one of whose board members is Calvin O. Butts 3d, pastor of the church.
In Jamaica, Mr. Lombard said, Johnson Development is working with Joseph M. Mattone Sr., a Whitestone, Queens, developer, to erect a 13-screen theater complex on the third floor of a $75 million building planned for a city-owned lot at Jamaica Avenue and Parsons Boulevard that has been vacant for decades. Mr. Mattone, chosen last year from a field of 70 bidders, is the fourth developer to try his hand at the two-acre site, which sits atop the Parsons-Archer subway stop.
"At night, it's very quiet here," Mr. Mattone said. "We would hope that having Magic Johnson's theaters would develop the nightscape, so you don't roll up the sidewalks at 6:00."
Mr. Mattone and Mr. Lombard both said yesterday that they were close to a deal. Mr. Lombard said the focus of negotiations has been how to, and who should, pay the high cost of constructing the theaters, estimated at $4 million. He said costs in New York were about $200 a square foot, compared with $120 elsewhere.
Mr. Mattone said the costs were so high because Johnson Development is building theaters with the "stadium-style seating" now in vogue, in which each row of seats is 14 inches higher, on average, than the next. That adds enormously to the concrete and ceiling height needed for each theater, he said.
Mr. Mattone said he expected to receive considerable state and city financial assistance for the project. He said he expected $6.5 million from the state, including a $5 million loan from the Metropolitan Economic Revitalization Fund. A state official said $3 million or $4 million was a more likely number.
Mr. Mattone also said he expected the city's Economic Development Corporation to provide more than $11 million toward the $14 million cost of a parking garage for the project, which may also include Gap, Foot Locker, and Walgreen stores. But a spokeswoman for the agency said Mr. Mattone would need a signed deal with the movie theater chain first.

HEADLINE: Building on a Shaky Foundation

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
It is a project that has fallen apart in the past over the shadows that its towers would cast over Central Park, over squabbling among various sects of officialdom, over a slump in the real estate market. It is a 3.4-acre piece of land whose promise has long been matched by its capacity to stir mistrust, protest and litigation.
Now comes the latest chapter in the tortured 13-year effort to transform the site of the New York Coliseum: Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's threat to block the sale of the property by a state agency. And again, the project is foundering largely over one divisive issue: control -- who will determine the future of the site and the surrounding Columbus Circle. 
 Like two recent predecessors, Mr. Giuliani is seeking to put his stamp on the project, unexpectedly calling last weekend for the construction of a 2,000-seat theater, which is intended to link the site to Lincoln Center. As he surely knows, if the project thrives, he would leave an enduring legacy on what could be the most important real estate development of his tenure.
But the risks are also considerable, as Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins can attest, for earlier attempts at advancing the project have invariably collapsed in recrimination.
The Coliseum is a quagmire in part because the state and city share authority over it, and their interests sometimes clash. Development in the city is usually contentious, but when responsibility for projects is fragmented, it is more difficult for officials to agree on how to overcome the typical obstacles. And the fickle real estate market exacerbates these tensions.
"Each of these parties puts an emphasis and a priority on somewhat different things," said Carl Weisbrod, who worked on the project as president of the city's Economic Development Corporation in the early 1990's. "Getting a confluence of objectives is very, very difficult."
The state agency that owns the Coliseum, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, wants to receive as much as possible from the sale and then walk away from the site forever. The Mayor's demand for a theater will reduce the price of the property because a developer can make less money from a theater than it can from a department store or hotel.
The city gets virtually no money from the sale, so Mr. Giuliani, who has veto power over the Coliseum redevelopment, does not mind if the planning drags on into the fall. He wants the project to flourish in the long run. The authority, on the other hand, is worried that if it does not sell the site quickly, the surging real estate market could falter, forcing it to accept a lower price.
Even when state and city grudgingly get along, others -- particularly developers and neighborhood groups -- have tried to exert control. When they have felt ignored by government, the groups have repeatedly sought leverage over the project by suing. In the 1980's, litigation prompted officials to scale back the size of the redevelopment and thus the shadows it would cast.
One group, the Committee for Environmentally Sound Development, has already vowed to go to court to stop the new version of the project, no matter what proposal is adopted, because it believes that any development would be too large.
Such factionalism would cause problems for most projects. But the Mayor and state officials are engaging in this new battle with the knowledge of the earlier failures at developing the site. City and state officials, as well as others debating the future of the Coliseum, all insist that they do not want to repeat mistakes; yet, as a result, they are all quick to accuse others of doing just that.
The current dispute arose last weekend, when Mr. Giuliani contended that the authority was concentrating too much on profiting from the site and not enough on finding the developer with the best plans for it. The Mayor said he was angered that the authority had tentatively chosen a developer, Millennium Partners, mostly because of an unusual financial concession that it offered.
The Mayor did not criticize the Millennium proposal directly. But in attacking the authority, he was clearly trying to regain control over a project that he thought was moving too quickly in the wrong direction. He appeared particularly concerned about the perception that financial, not aesthetic or cultural, considerations were driving the search for a developer.
The authority's board was to have voted to approve the selection of Millennium yesterday, but it put off the vote after Mr. Giuliani threatened a veto and said he would set up a panel of experts to study the designs of the five finalists in the yearlong competition for a developer.
The Mayor's interest in the theater surprised M.T.A. officials and some neighborhood and civic groups that have followed the process. The groups said they supported his drive to scrutinize the aesthetics and uses in the plans, but they questioned why he was raising such issues so late in a process that his own aides helped oversee.
"If you want your place in history, do you have to engage in this last-minute improvisation?" asked Ethel Sheffer, a member of a coalition of three community boards in the Columbus Circle area that have lobbied on the project. "We are now engaging in this last-minute, peculiar deal-making, which may not work."

HEADLINE: Japan Penalizes Nomura and Big Bank for Payoffs

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 30

 BODY:
In the strongest punitive action it has ever taken against major financial institutions, Japan's Finance Ministry ordered the Nomura Securities Company and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank today to suspend part of their operations for the rest of this year as punishment for making payments and loans to a racketeer.
The penalties are intended to stop illegal dealings, believed to be widespread in Japan, which threaten to erode the credibility of the nation's financial markets. A loss of public trust could undermine the Government's plan to transform Tokyo into a money center on a par with London and New York through a program of financial deregulation. 
 But even before the ministry announced the punishments today, the scandal had spread to another big brokerage house. Tokyo prosecutors this morning raided the headquarters of Yamaichi Securities, the nation's fourth-largest broker, on suspicion that it had paid 79 million yen, or about $670,000 at current exchange rates, to the same racketeer involved with Nomura and Dai-Ichi.
Analysts said that the penalties imposed on Nomura and Dai-Ichi, while reducing their profits in the short term, were hardly ruinous. "I think the penalties were much more lenient than the market expected," said Paul Heaton of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Capital Markets here. He added that he expected Nomura, Japan's largest brokerage firm and a giant worldwide, to remain profitable this fiscal year and for Dai-Ichi, one of the largest Japanese banks, to suffer less than Nomura.
The Finance Ministry ordered Nomura to cease stock trading for its own account until the end of the year, starting next Wednesday. It was also told to shut down its entire stock- brokerage business for one week.
Nomura also faces a four-month suspension of operations related to initial public offerings and a one-month suspension of stock trading from its headquarters, where it serves big institutional investors.
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank was ordered not to make loans to new corporate customers in Japan for the rest of the year. It was also prohibited from engaging in certain new businesses, such as selling mutual funds, or opening new branches or subsidiaries at home or abroad for a year.
It was the first time that the Finance Ministry had ordered a major bank to suspend operations because of a crime. But analysts said the embargo on new loans would not hurt the bank too much because most income comes from interest on existing loans, not from a year's worth of new ones. Demand for loans by companies is weak now, anyway.
Both Dai-Ichi and Nomura were barred from underwriting bidding on government bonds, national and local, for the rest of 1997 and were ordered to improve their internal controls.
Nomura's president, Junichi Ujiie, said at a news conference this evening that with the penalty, "it is just like we have to step back 10 meters in a 100-meter competition." But he said he was confident that Nomura would be able to make up the lost ground.
Mr. Ujiie -- who took over recently after Hideo Sakamaki resigned as president and was arrested in connection with the scandal -- bowed profusely in apology for Nomura's misdeeds in paying the racketeer, Ryuichi Koike, about 370 million yen, or $3.1 million. He also said that a number of Nomura officials, including the chairman and president, would take salary cuts of 10 to 30 percent for five months and that 25 employees would be reprimanded or otherwise punished.
Katsuyuki Sugita, president of Dai-Ichi, said at his own news conference that the penalty imposed on his bank was heavy, but that he would not estimate its effects in monetary terms. The bank was punished for making loans to Mr. Koike without proper screening and for trying to conceal its actions from regulators.
The scandals have also called into question the supervisory ability of the Japanese Finance Ministry. On Tuesday, two of the ministry's bank inspectors were reprimanded for accepting free meals and golf outings from Dai-Ichi, and Takeshi Komura, the highest-ranking civil servant, was given a written warning.
In a way, the real damage to Nomura and Dai-Ichi comes not from the temporary suspension of their operations but in the defections of many of their government, corporate and individual clients since the payoff scandal came to light. In June, Nomura handled 5.8 percent of the trades on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, well down from the share of more than 10 percent it once commanded.
The scandal has also helped open new opportunities for foreign securities firms, which have begun to beef up their operations in Tokyo in anticipation of deregulation. The top 20 foreign brokers together accounted for 29 percent of the trades on the Tokyo exchange in June, up from 26 percent in May and about 8 points higher than the level a year earlier.
Yet Nomura was still more profitable than its three major Japanese rivals in the quarter that ended on June 30, with pretax profit down only 4 percent, and some analysts here say that Nomura will eventually recover its lost customers.
"Once they've been freed from the penalty box, it's back to normal," said Elizabeth Daniels of Morgan Stanley. "Everybody realizes that every single broker and banker in town has these relationships. If you're not going to deal with them because of this, you're not going to have a financial institution to deal with."
Indeed, Yamaichi's apparent involvement -- it is suspected of making reimbursements to the same racketeer, Mr. Koike, for trading losses -- seems to confirm this. Moreover, Mr. Koike, according to newspaper reports here, has told prosecutors that he also had accounts at the other two of Japan's four big brokerage firms, Daiwa Securities and Nikko Securities, raising suspicion about those companies. Mr. Koike is a sokaiya, a type of gangster peculiar to Japan, who extorts money from companies by threatening to air their dirty laundry in public.
Yamaichi is suspected of trading in stock-index futures in Singapore, which would be harder for the Japanese authorities to detect than domestic transactions, and using some of the profit to compensate Mr. Koike for losses it accumulated in trading securities on his behalf.
Analysts expect the chairman and president of Yamaichi to resign. A Yamaichi spokesman declined to admit or deny the accusations.

HEADLINE: The Abbreviated Tourist;
Americans Are So Busy, With So Many Places to Go

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
Gladys and Ralph Hamilton used to pile their four children and one or two of the youngsters' friends into the family station wagon in Tennessee and head off for a week on the beach in Florida. "It was an eight-hour drive, but it seemed a lot longer with all those kids in the car," Mrs. Hamilton remembered with a laugh.
Today, the Hamiltons still go to Florida -- but by air instead of by road, and for just three or four days, not a week. Even though their children are grown, the Hamiltons, like just about everybody else, find that their lives keep getting busier and busier, making it harder to carve out big chunks of time together. Mrs. Hamilton watches her 2-year-old granddaughter two days a week, and her husband does not like to leave his job as a chemist -- or his 90-year-old mother in a nursing home -- for more than a few days at a time. 
 Besides, there are so many more places to visit these days, from new resorts and theme parks to the Mall of America in Minnesota, and the way to see lots of them is to spend less time at each one. Already this year, the Hamiltons, who live in Cordova, Tenn., near Memphis, have flown off to their old haunt in the Florida Panhandle and have traveled to Bermuda and Seattle as well. "You have to watch the paper to see when the bargains are," Mrs. Hamilton said.
The Hamiltons' penchant for quick bursts of travel exemplifies the re-engineering of Americans' leisure time. In the 90's, for the first time, more than half of all vacation trips in the United States have consisted of "weekend travel" of no more than five nights away from home, according to the nonprofit Travel Industry Association of America. In both 1996 and 1995 the figure was 52 percent, up sharply from 42 percent in 1986.
This dramatic shift in Americans' travel habits grew out of the hectic pace of the downsized American workplace. And it has forced the tourism industry to revamp its marketing and pricing practices. Hotels, resorts, historical sites and entire cities have scrambled to accommodate larger numbers of people staying for shorter stretches.
Three months ago, Colonial Williamsburg swallowed its pride and accepted that most tourists just did not want to hang around the reconstructed 18th-century capital of Virginia for more than two or three days. So the village, which was built as a tourist attraction in 1926, began offering several abbreviated packages, including a two-day visit steeped in the world of Felicity Merriman, a fictional 9-year-old growing up in Williamsburg on the eve of the American Revolution.
The Felicity Package was a big hit with the Forcellini family of Cincinnati -- precisely because it was compact enough to let them pack in another destination and still get home in a week. "We've been having a wonderful time," said Sharla Forcellini, a high school teacher who visited Williamsburg recently with her husband, Tony, an accountant, and their three children, ages 8 to 14. "We stopped three days in D.C. to see the sights, and we thought our kids were old enough to appreciate being exposed to a couple more days of history here."
Similarly, from the Greenbrier resort in West Virginia to the Hotel Galvez in Galveston, Tex., to the Wyndham Palmas del Mar Resort in Humacao on Puerto Rico's southeast coast, visits from two to four days have proliferated.
"A couple of years ago, our rentals were usually from Sunday to Sunday," said Michele Holder, spokeswoman for Amelia Island Plantation, the upscale beach resort in northeast Florida, "but everything's speeding up so much people don't want to stay an entire week." Three of the resort's more popular packages this year are for four days and three nights, and two are for three days and two nights.
More airlines are offering bargain fares that make quickie trips across the continent, even across the Atlantic, more affordable than a visit with friends and relatives in the next state. After spotting the mini-vacation trend a few years ago, American Airlines began offering deeply discounted flights from Nashville and Raleigh, N.C., for passengers willing to leave on Saturday and return the following Monday or Tuesday. Two years ago it expanded the program to cover most domestic and international routes. Now, said Tim Smith, an American spokesman, "We've gotten so good at finding what we call 'troughs of availability' that we offer them in selected markets even in summer, our busiest travel season."
Even that most leisurely of summer traditions, the ocean cruise, is succumbing to the trend. According to the Cruise Lines International Association, cruises of two to five days are the fastest-growing segment of the market, representing one-third of all voyages, up from just over one-fifth in 1983.
Many factors have contributed to the mini-vacation movement. After years of painful restructurings and mass layoffs in American industry, hordes of refugees from the corporate world have joined small businesses that offer shorter vacations, or they have started their own businesses and take even less time off. When they do, Americans, borrowing a European gambit, are increasingly stretching out holiday weekends by adding personal days or just leaving the office at 1 P.M. on Friday instead of the usual 5 P.M.
Of course, vacationers' choices have multiplied almost geometrically as cities and hamlets, awakening to the economic benefits of tourism, have reinvented themselves as historical jewels or entertainment meccas. "When we first opened in 1926," said a wistful Timothy M. Andrews, a spokesman for Colonial Williamsburg, "there were some 200 vacation destinations in the United States. Now there are 200 between D.C. and Virginia Beach."
But the main reason most people cite for taking shorter vacations is that their schedules, at work and at home, have become so crowded. Again and again, vacationers use one word to explain the brevity of their excursions: busy.
Pat Brown, the director of equal employment opportunity at the Federal Election Commission in Washington, loves to travel, and this month she took a short cruise to Nova Scotia. But, she said, five days is the most she can spare at one time. "I'm busy at work," she said, "plus I'm a landlord."
Likewise, Debbie Bowles, a Washington stockbroker, said she does "a lot of three- to five-day trips because I don't like being away from clients for long." In the last year, she said, she has flown to Amsterdam for five days and to Paris for three, and she is planning a three-day cruise to Nassau, the Bahamas, in November. Those jaunts are a far cry from her childhood vacations, which were usually spent driving with her parents from their home in Jacksonville, Fla., to visit a week with her grandmother in North Carolina or with cousins in Kentucky or Ohio.
While nobody disputes that vacations are shriveling, some people question the hypothesis -- popularized by Juliet B. Schor's book "The Overworked American: The Unexpected Decline of Leisure" (Basic Books, 1992) -- that Americans are overwhelmed by toil. On the contrary, the authors of a new book, "Time for Life: The Surprising Ways Americans Use Their Time" (Penn State Press, 1997), argue that Americans actually have almost five hours more free time each week than their parents did in the 1960's.
"But most of it comes in small chunks, on weekdays, and three-fourths of it is spent watching television," one co-author, Geoffrey C. Godbey, a professor of leisure studies at Penn State University, said in a telephone interview.
To be sure, some people still take long vacations. Most Americans flocking to Europe this summer, for example, are spending more than a few days there. And earlier this year, four cruise ships completed around-the-world cruises that lasted as long as three and a half months.
For most people, though, long vacations are the stuff of nostalgia. June and Thomas Doerger of Cincinnati remember going camping with their two daughters for a week or 10 days in Kentucky or Indiana. "Once, we even took a two-week trip to Florida that seemed like it lasted six months," Mrs. Doerger said.
As the girls grew older, she added, "there were dance lessons, music lessons, always something going on, and it got harder and harder to stay away for a week." Even with the children now grown, Mrs. Doerger and her husband still find themselves so pressed by the demands of their jobs -- she is an accountant, he an electrician -- that their vacations consist of going away several times a year for a few days to such places as Gatlinburg, Tenn., Berea, Ky., and, in mid-August, to Port Clinton, Ohio, on the shores of Lake Erie.
Even so, they love the more hectic pace. "When you take a two-week vacation," Mrs. Doerger said, "it's over and done with and there's nothing more to look forward to. This way it breaks up the summer, and we get to see more places."

HEADLINE: FINANCIAL EXPERTS WARN OF HAZARDS IN ALBANY ACCORD

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 30

 BODY:
The $68 billion budget agreement between Gov. George E. Pataki and state legislative leaders came under sharp criticism today from bond raters and fiscal monitors who said its deep multiyear tax cuts and spending increases were likely to create major financial problems for the state, particularly if Wall Street's current boom collapses.
The plan, which is expected to be approved by the full Legislature this weekend, calls for the largest single-year increase ever in state spending on schools, $750 million, as well as the largest tax cut in state history, $5 billion phased in over five years, and the allocation of an additional $2.3 billion over the next five years on education programs for early grades. Mr. Pataki and the leaders said the plan was based on projections of modest economic growth. 
 But with the state already facing annual budget shortfalls, lavish new education programs and tax cuts will place immense pressure on state officials to cut spending over the coming five years on other programs, the fiscal monitors and bond raters said. The most likely target for the budget ax would be Medicaid, the health care program for the poor and some of the middle-class elderly. The cost of the state's Medicaid program is about $24 billion a year, or more than a third of the total state budget.
In turn, the added pressures to slash spending are likely to intensify the bitter battles that have typified budget negotiations between the Legislature and Mr. Pataki since 1995, leading to the latest budgets in history. And if the economy turns sour within the next five years, as many economists predict, fiscal monitors say the state will be thoroughly unprepared for the sudden drop-off in tax revenues, forcing it to make painful choices between cutting essential services or raising taxes -- or both. That was the case during the recession of the late 1980's and early 1990's, when the state postponed tax cuts, raised taxes and fees, cut aid to schools and municipalities and laid off thousands of workers.
"I think the state seems very poorly positioned to deal with a downturn," said Robert A. Kurtter, vice president for state ratings at Moody's Investors Service, which rates state bonds for investors. "And the protracted nature of Albany's budget process raises significant doubts about the state's willingness or ability to deal with difficult decisions should the economy go bad."
Moody's currently gives New York State the second-lowest rating among the 40 states it reviews, surpassed only by Louisiana. Lower bond ratings mean states must pay more in interest. Mr. Kurtter said it was too early to say whether Moody's would change the state's rating. But he suggested that an upgrade was virtually out of the question, saying New York had done almost nothing to redress its longtime fiscal problems, including its ever-growing debt and perennial budget shortfalls, ranging between $2 billion and $5 billion under Mr. Pataki.
Even if the economy simply levels off, the state may have to strain to balance future budgets as the tax cuts are gradually phased in, economists said. They observed that the state often faces budget shortfalls, even in good economic times.
"We're a little on the generous side with the tax cuts," said Michael Wasylenko, a professor at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University. "That's not a great idea when you are still facing a structural budget problem."
Mr. Pataki and the legislative leaders say gloomy predictions on the economy have proved wrong in recent years. They say their budget plan is predicated on projections of modest growth in the coming years, not the booming stock market that has been the main reason that state tax coffers are now flush with cash.
"We are talking about a very easily achievable growth in revenues," said Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat. He said just a 3 percent revenue growth would pay for the new budget, a notion some economists questioned.
As the Republican Governor stumped across the state in a tour promoting the budget accord today, he repeatedly described the plan as prudent, even as he trumpeted its tax cuts and spending on schools, new prison cells and environmental projects. At each stop, he noted that the spending plan included nearly $1 billion in reserves that could be used to prevent cuts if the economy takes a sudden turn for the worse.
"We're very confident that this year, next year and into the future, we'll be able to meet the commitments that have been made, as we have in the past," Mr. Pataki said in Albany, the first leg of a sweep that took him to New York City, Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo.
The budget agreement calls for increasing total state spending by 5 percent, significantly higher than in Mr. Pataki's first two years in office. But aides to Mr. Pataki said the one-year figure was deceiving: over three years, state spending has risen by an average of only 2.9 percent a year, well below the average 7.4 percent annual increases under Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, a Democrat.
Despite that, the fiscal monitors and bond analysts said this year's budget had set a bad precedent for Mr. Pataki. And they predicted that fiscal restraint would be even more difficult next year, unless there is a sudden economic downturn, since the Governor will be up for re-election and under immense political pressure to sprinkle new spending across the state.
Andrew Rein, a research associate for the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit group that monitors the state's budget, said, "Whatever progress we've made, we're starting to backtrack."
The raters and monitors also bemoaned the Legislature's and Governor's inability to use the current recovery to fix some of the state's worst fiscal maladies, like paying down its $32 billion in debt, among the heaviest debt loads that the states have.
Not only does the budget agreement do little to reduce the state's debt, it also proposes significant new borrowing: a $2.4 billion bond act to finance school repairs and construction, and $425 million to build sports stadiums and art centers. The school bond act requires voters' approval.
"New York State is still not taking the necessary steps to put its fiscal house in order," State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a Democrat who is considering challenging Mr. Pataki in the race for governor next year, said. "New York's budget mood is still stuck in the 'spend all you want, we'll make more' mode."
The impact of an economic downturn on the state's budget would actually be twofold. First, it reduces tax revenues as profits decline, businesses close and people lose their jobs. But it also can cause state expenses to rise, as more people go on welfare and become eligible for Medicaid. Mr. Pataki and the legislative leaders are predicting relatively modest growth in Medicaid but not the kind of surge in costs that could come with even a mild recession.
But if economic growth were to slow substantially, Medicaid would not be the only program due for cuts. Public colleges, welfare and mental health programs, all of which Mr. Pataki has tried to cut over the last three years, would also probably be subjected to the budget-cutting knife.
For that reason, fiscal monitors said the Legislature and Mr. Pataki should have settled for smaller spending increases and tax cuts this year, so that budget cuts would be minimized if -- some say when -- an economic downturn does occur.
"The fiscal discipline the Governor showed in the first two years has given way to a spending spree that Cuomo would have been proud of," said Thomas Carroll, president of Change-N.Y., a nonprofit group that advocates tax cuts and smaller government. "When they assume that Wall Street will be at stratospheric levels forever, they are doing an exact repeat of the mid-1980's."

HEADLINE: New York's High-Wire Budget Act

 BODY:
New York State's new $68 billion budget provides all the pleasures and terrors of a circus high-wire act. It is bound to be popular in the short run. But it is dangerous for the future. Again the Governor and Legislature seem to be making commitments beyond the state's long-term ability to pay.
With $2.6 billion in unanticipated revenues on hand, thanks to the boom on Wall Street, Gov. George Pataki and legislative leaders had no need to be niggardly this year. They restored all the cuts Mr. Pataki proposed last winter, and provided localities with the largest school aid increase in history. But then negotiators went further, committing the state to $5 billion in tax cuts and billions more in costly school initiatives over the next five years. If the boom ends, which booms have a habit of doing, the state will be hard pressed to pay for all the voter-pleasing programs being locked in. It is the latest display of irresponsibility by New York politicians who love expensive new programs they can take credit for now and pay for later. 
 If the money holds out, the budget negotiators have picked some good things to spend it on. Thanks mainly to Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, the state has established some excellent education priorities -- $2.3 billion for initiatives like smaller class sizes in the early grades and pre-kindergarten programs for every child in New York State, and an ambitious $2.4 billion bond issue for public school construction. Those efforts could make a good start toward improving an education system, in New York City and upstate, that virtually everyone agrees needs reform.
But those education gains, so vital for the economic and social health of the state, come at a heavy price -- acceptance of a large and needless tax cut program aimed mostly at bolstering the Republicans' political base. True, some of the Republican proposals look reasonable. There is a welcome reduction in the tax on utilities, a particularly bad levy in a state that already has uncompetitive electricity and telephone costs in many areas. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani also won the right to eliminate New York City's sales tax on clothing purchases under $100 in 1999, when the state promises to end its part of the tax as well. The Mayor is undoubtedly right when he contends that the present tax sends both New Yorkers and tourists fleeing to New Jersey to do their shopping. But Mr. Giuliani will still have to prove his contention that the business generated by eliminating the tax for clothing under $100 would make up for the city's loss of sales tax revenue.
Interpreting the budget deal is difficult because dozens of exhausted legislative and gubernatorial staff workers are now struggling to write bills reflecting the handshake agreement made by the Governor, Mr. Silver and the Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno. The details could make the difference between good programs and bad ones.
But the worst part of the budget deal is clearly Mr. Pataki's property tax relief plan, which will cost $2.2 billion a year when fully instituted in 2002. Aimed at the Governor's suburban and rural base, it is a boon for wealthier suburbs. Instead of fighting a plan that does not target the area of greatest need, the Assembly Democrats focused on getting something extra for New York City, where many residents do not pay property taxes. Mr. Silver and Mr. Giuliani are both boasting that now the city will be compensated with a state-financed income tax reduction all its own. Mr. Pataki will be able to claim that he delivered tax cuts to the city, too. But in a state whose economy is still struggling, a huge, something-for-everybody tax cut program is not the best way to allocate scarce resources.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET DEAL: THE DEMOCRATS;
In a Sea of Harmony, an Undercurrent of Discord

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 30

 BODY:
At first glance, Democrats looked like the picture of harmony on Tuesday afternoon when President Clinton and an array of his party's lawmakers gathered at the White House to congratulate themselves for the budget deal.
But notably absent was Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, whom the Administration had frozen out of the budget negotiations all along. Rather than join the President for the celebration at the White House, Mr. Gephardt was closeted in his office, where he was telling a reporter of his reservations about the agreement. 
 The tensions between Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gephardt underscore an unmistakable gulf that has emerged between the two ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. That gulf runs deeper than disagreement over the budget, and it is broader than the personal and philosophical differences between these two Democrats alone.
It is rooted instead in conflicting visions of how the party can present itself as a distinct alternative to Republicans and take back Congress in the midterm elections next year.
Conceiving a unified strategy to achieve that victory has been made all the harder by Mr. Clinton's steadfast sliding toward the political middle, leaving the two parties with agendas that look remarkably similar and with consequent tactical problems.
For all the backslapping at the White House on Tuesday, many Democrats, particularly in the House, are at odds with the Administration. They contend that the best way to persuade the electorate to send Democratic majorities to Congress in 1998 is to embarrass Republicans by forcing them to cast unpopular votes.
In contrast, White House aides argue that the way to Democratic success next year is to build on Mr. Clinton's public popularity. They are searching for compromises with Republicans -- the budget deal was one -- so that the President can point to accomplishments, retain that popularity and so, it is hoped, be the champion who rallies his party to a 1998 triumph. Perhaps only coincidentally, success in that tactic would strengthen the hand of the Administration's No. 2, Vice President Al Gore, Mr. Gephart's certain rival for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 2000.
"You try to work hard to sing off the same page, but there's clearly a point where you get a divergence," said one liberal Congressman, Representative George Miller of California. Among House Democrats, Mr. Miller said, there is "a certain level of nervousness" about "some basic erosion in the White House on issues of clear distinction with the American public."
The early debate over strategy for the 1998 elections is shadowed by something of a political jinx: except in 1934, the party of the President has lost ground in the House in every set of midterm elections since the Civil War.
Rahm Emanuel, a senior Presidential aide, plays down the tensions and notes that he and other White House assistants meet weekly on Capitol Hill with top members of theHouse and Senate Democratic staff.
"We have honest differences about tactics, but we don't have differences about goals and objectives," Mr. Emanuel said. "In contrast to the Republicans right now, we have a level of trust. We can get into a room and work out our differences."
Still, officials on both sides concede that the Democrats' conflicting perspectives over the 1998 elections might well lead to flare-ups over a number of pending legislative issues, from the environment to expanding the North American free-trade zone.
Bitterness toward Mr. Clinton has lingered among Congressional Democrats since the 1992 campaign, after which many complained that his coattails had proved virtually nonexistent. They were even angrier after the midterm elections of 1994, with many blaming him for the loss of both the House and the Senate. And last year, some accused him of abandoning his party and campaigning for re-election as a Republican.
Similarly some Congressional Democrats now complain that Mr. Clinton's priority is his reputation rather than the party's success next year.
"The President and his party in Congress are always at cross purposes," said Norman J. Ornstein, an expert on Congress at the American Enterprise Institute. "The Democrats want to say, 'Look how awful things are.' And Clinton wants to say, 'Look how good things are.' "
The strains have been exacerbated by the White House designs of Mr. Gephardt, who has broken with the President not only on the budget agreement but also on several other issues, including the welfare overhaul and the continuation of most-favored-nation trade status for China.
Several White House aides insisted in interviews that the President did in fact have coattails and that the best way for Democrats to make inroads against the Republicans' Congressional majority was to run on them. The President has maintained high popularity ratings, these aides said, not only because of the healthy economy but also because he has effectively worked with Republicans and pulled his party to the center.
"We are focused on getting things done," said John Hilley, the White House liaison to Congress. "We think that's the formula for '98. It's positive accomplishment."
But in the House, where the Democratic caucus is dominated by liberals, the minority has been less willing to work closely with the Republicans. The Democrats need only 11 seats to regain control of the House, and many are focused more on their coming elections than on the preferences and the legacy of a lame-duck President.
For their part, some White House officials say Mr. Gephardt should not be so concerned with the electoral fate of House liberals, who generally have the safest of all Democratic seats, and should concentrate instead on a message with appeal in the suburbs, where Democrats may have to work hardest to win.
In an interview, Mr. Gephardt praised Mr. Clinton but contended that winning back the House required more than a popular President.
"I am less a believer than maybe we used to be that there are huge coattails," he said, "and that the President, by dint of his support, can elect a lot of our candidates. Voters are very independent today."
And contrary to the tone set by the White House, Mr. Gephardt said it was crucial for Democrats to show that they were different from Republicans.
"It is important to us and our candidates," the minority leader said, "that there be an understanding in this country that there is a real difference on a lot of these issues between Democratic and Republican candidates. We try to articulate that very real difference."
The dynamics of any discord between the White House and the Senate are less volatile, in part because Administration officials are less suspicious of the motives of the Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, who, after all, is not running for President. In addition, Senate Democrats as a whole are more moderate, more inclined to reach across the aisle and, with terms lasting six years rather than two, generally less focused at any given time on the next election.
There has nonetheless been some ambivalence toward the President among Senate Democrats, most recently demonstrated in the campaign finance hearings: rather than mount an aggressive defense of Mr. Clinton, several Democrats have chosen instead simply to attack Republicans.
"There are still some tensions in our relationship with the White House," said Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts. "Still, we're a little more moderate, more conservative, and the makeup of our caucus has brought about compromise more easily than you can in the House."
Their rifts are a sensitive topic among Democrats, both in the White House and on Capitol Hill. In interviews, several party officials sought to put the best face on the relationships.
Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster, explained that the interests of Democrats in the White House were simply not the same as the interests of Democrats in Congress.
"The Congressional Democrats would like Bill Clinton's only important consideration to be winning back the Congress," Mr. Garin said. "That's not a realistic expectation. But it's not realistic for the President to expect that it would not be the most important consideration for the Congressional party."
Mr. Gephardt said he would like to foster an anti-Republican, pro-Democratic national tide to win back the House. Short of that, he said, he believes that his party can nonetheless be victorious if races are fought one by one. "I'm not one who argues that if we don't achieve that collective national sense we have no chance to win the House," he said.
It has become almost a cliche that in midterm elections, Congressional candidates often end up trying to distance themselves from a President of their own party. President Jimmy Carter never seemed to get along with Democrats in Congress, and Congressional Republicans were furious at President George Bush for forging a tax-raising deal with the Democrats.
But some moderate Democrats say they wish that Mr. Gephardt would try to work in greater harmony with the White House.
"I don't want to be critical of Dick, but sometimes it gets frustrating," said Representative James P. Moran of Virginia. "I respect his commitment to principles. But I think the President has principles. The Democrats are a minority in Congress, and our message is not working. So rather than fall on our sword, let's get a new set of armor."

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET DEAL: THE STATES;
With Their Budgets in the Black, Governors' Skies Turn Blue

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev., July 30

 BODY:
The nation's governors are presiding over such prosperous states these days that they find themselves with an enviable problem unheard of a few years back: what to do with all their money.
"In a funny way it's almost harder to govern when there's more money because people want to spend it," Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, a Republican, said at the annual meeting of the National Governors' Association here. "You still need to discipline state government." 
 Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, a Democrat, complained: "The legislatures can get very feisty, with lots and lots of ideas about how to spend money. And it's much more difficult to make the case to constituents that you have to be very tough fiscally. And it's harder to say 'no' to advocacy groups."
The two Governors' comments underscore a transformation that has occurred in state governments and, thus, in the jobs of their chief executives. For years, Republican and Democratic governors alike were on the defensive as they were forced to slash programs to cut costs and grappled with rising unemployment. But in interviews this week, governors from around the country who attended the annual meeting, which ended today, described an era of relative tranquility in the states.
Freed from their customary worries about the economy and generally supportive of initiatives from Washington like the welfare overhaul enacted last year, many governors boasted about swelled rainy day accounts and about diminished anxiety among middle-class voters. They said the relative good times had allowed them to turn their attention to matters like education, health care and building roads.
Many chief executives are benefiting politically in their states in much the same way President Clinton is nationally. As long as the economy holds, many governors expect to continue to enjoy high popularity ratings, and several said they were reasonably confident of their re-election prospects in this economic climate. This good news for governors as a whole is even better news for Republicans, because there are 32 Republican governors, 17 Democrats and 1 independent.
"They're all running around talking about success stories," said Brian Kennedy, executive director of the Republican Governors' Association. "They're all saying, 'Guess how many people I got off welfare? Guess how much I cut in taxes?' "
Doug Richardson, communications director for the Democratic Governors' Association, was equally upbeat, declaring, "It really is a boom time."
Indeed, a veteran of the meetings here, Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, a Republican, said the governors were less inclined to commiserate with one another here because their states were doing well. "There's more of an independent spirit when the economy is strong," Mr. Thompson said. When the economy is more bleak, he said, there is "more of a collective spirit: 'How are we going to get out of this?' 'What are you doing in your state?' 'How can I copy you?' "
In another demonstration of how things have changed, some governors now find themselves facing labor shortages and competing to lure skilled workers. "Our biggest challenge today," said Gov. Terry E. Branstad of Iowa, chairman of the Republican Governors Association, "is having enough people with the skills to fill the jobs that are being created."
Gov. Gary Locke of Washington, a Democrat, said people were flocking to his state for an expanding pool of jobs in aerospace and high-tech industries. "We have the luxury of having a surplus," Mr. Locke said of the state budget.
Mr. Locke is hardly alone. "We had the largest surplus in the history of our state,"said Gov. David Beasley of South Carolina, a Republican. "And I think many states are very similar." And Gov. George F. Allen of Virginia boasted that he planned to resist spending and would put far more money in a "rainy day fund."
Gov. John M. Engler of Michigan said his state had just approved a package to improve its infrastructure, which never would have happened in a weaker economic climate. "The problems are different, which is terrific," Mr. Engler said. "We're looking at 39 months of declining families on public assistance."
A further sign of the governors' content is that most Democrats and Republicans here were smiling over the Federal budget agreement. Some Republican governors did express concerns, however, that Mr. Clinton would tamper with the reconstituted welfare system and, as Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma put it, "burden us with additional costs."
Despite the battles over spending priorities, many governors said their jobs were simpler now that their states were better off and voters seemed more satisfied. "People are willing to give you a little slack," said Mr. Dean, chairman of the Democratic Governors' Association. "They're willing to give you the benefit of the doubt because they're feeling better about what's happening to themselves."
But, explaining that the demands from interest groups and from the legislature were greater when more money was available, he added, "It's easier to get elected in good times -- but not easier to govern."
Despite the improved outlook, some states are still struggling to improve their economies, and the cities have been particularly slow to rebound. "All of us are dealing with the holdouts in this recovery, which are the urban centers," said Mr. Engler. "But even there we're seen remarkable progress."

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET DEAL: THE CONSEQUENCES;
Deal's Long-Term Effect Has Economists Uneasy

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
While Republicans and Democrats alike are congratulating themselves on a fiscal package that delivers on promises to cut taxes while still balancing the budget, economists are less sanguine about the long-term consequences of the Byzantine negotiation. For one thing, the hodgepodge of tax breaks in the deal complicates an already complex tax code, even as it erodes revenue.
"This bill will allow the middle class to enjoy the same frustrations as the very rich in devising tax-avoidance strategies and computing tax liability," said Robert D. Reischauer of the Brookings Institution. 
 Yet more problematic, the package does very little to contain the escalating costs of medical and pension entitlements that will almost certainly put severe pressure on the budget in decades ahead.
"There was potential for reform here," said Van Doorn Ooms, research director at the Committee on Economic Development, "and they blew it."
Though Congress is expected to approve the deal this week, hard numbers on the budget are still hard to come by. Still, enough is known to draw some broad conclusions.
The fiscal package is all things to all people, including more than $90 billion in estimated tax breaks over five years and a balanced budget in the year 2002. What many taxpayers may not yet know, however, is that taking advantage of the tax breaks will involve considerable effort.
Phase-out provisions for the tax credits, capital gains holding periods and rules for eligibility to shelter savings, for example, will all add paperwork to tax reporting. And choosing between old-fashioned individual retirement accounts and the new super-I.R.A.'s that permit tax-free withdrawals after a taxpayer reaches 59 1/2 years of age will require very serious thought.
"The new law goes in just the wrong direction when it comes to simplicity," said Rudolph Penner, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office who is now a managing director of the Barents Group, investment consultants based in Washington.
Joel Slemrod, an economist at the University of Michigan's Business School, has other concerns. Piling on new tax breaks ranging from credits for college tuition to deductions for retirement saving may be justifiable from a narrow perspective. "But each creates a new interest group that won't want to give up its preferences in return for broad tax reform," he said. "And each represents a new intrusion by the Government in the lives of individuals."
More ominous from the perspective of the bean counters, the tax breaks are "back-loaded" to cause most of the revenue losses after 2002. Capital gains cuts, for example, are revenue producers in the short run because rate reductions should induce a flurry of asset sales, but will almost certainly lead to revenue losses in the long run.
President Clinton did fight off the House-backed provision for indexing taxable gains to inflation. But in the process, the rate on sales of assets held for five years, starting in 2006, is lower than Congressional Republicans had envisioned last month.
By the same token, the new I.R.A.'s will cost nothing in the near term because contributions are taxable -- and should even generate revenue because they offer incentives for owners of ordinary I.R.A.'s to switch their holdings and pay taxes on sheltered income earned in the past. But the erosion of the future tax base could be substantial.
Indeed, one preliminary estimate puts the 10-year tax loss at $270 billion -- three times the loss over the next five years. "We're creating a revenue hole" that won't be easy to fill, said Mr. Ooms of the Committee on Economic Development.
The significance of that revenue hole grows in light of the failure of the budget negotiators to make serious headway on medical or pension entitlements.
It is no secret that the aging of the baby boomers and the growth in the cost of medical procedures are likely to push the Federal budget deep into the red by the second or third decade of the next century.
But this round of budget negotiations did not touch pension issues, ignoring a flurry of alternatives ranging from partial privatization to benefit trims that were offered earlier in the year by the Social Security Advisory Commission. And at the eleventh hour, the negotiators also chose to duck the basic issues of medical cost containment.
"We came very close on Medicare," Mr. Penner said, alluding to efforts to add a means test to coverage or to raise the age at which benefits become an entitlement.
Indeed, Mr. Reischauer, who also is a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, contends that the impact of what the negotiators did manage on Medicare may have been "perverse." While the deal does tighten the screws on medical providers, it also creates incentives for beneficiaries to accept group care.
To achieve the latter, Mr. Reischauer said, providers will have to come up with enhanced benefit packages. "Extra services, such as prescription drugs, will be seen as a right," he predicted, "creating political pressures that will make reform harder" down the road.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET DEAL: THE HOUSE;
Budget Bill Clears House as Senate Takes Up Its Debate

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 30

 BODY:
With both Republicans and Democrats claiming victory and credit, the House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly today to approve landmark legislation to balance the Federal budget by 2002.
Across the Capitol, debate began this afternoon on the same bill in the Senate, where the legislation enjoys even greater support. 
 The balanced budget bill and a companion tax cut bill that the House and Senate are expected to approve this week represent significant political achievements for President Clinton, Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader.
The budget bill passed in the House on a vote of 346 to 85, despite some last-minute wrangling with the White House over money for Amtrak. Another problem arose when Mr. Clinton threatened a veto on Tuesday night if the tax bill included a measure to offer tax benefits for private and parochial school expenses.
Most of the opposition came from the far ends of the political spectrum of both parties. Although an unassailable majority of Republicans -- 193 of them -- voted for the bill, the 32 dissidents included many of the conservative junior members who were involved in a plot earlier this month to oust Mr. Gingrich.
Ignoring the parts of the bill that Mr. Gingrich and other leaders promoted as major victories for their party, most of the Republicans who voted no did so because they felt that the deal was weighted too heavily in Mr. Clinton's favor, especially in increased spending and an increase on cigarette taxes.
"Cutting taxes and at the same time increasing spending is not a good marriage," said Representative Lindsey O. Graham, a Republican sophomore from South Carolina who was a leader of the junior members in the so-called coup attempt against Mr. Gingrich.
"This has short-term political appeal, akin to the honeymoon, but unfortunately presents a financial mess that people will soon get tired of picking up after."
On the Democratic side, 153 voted to approve the bill. As expected, Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, was among the 52 Democrats who voted no, along with the lone independent. Mr. Gephardt said on Tuesday that he would vote against the balanced budget bill and the tax cuts.
But a number of party stalwarts split with the Administration over the budget bill, including Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee, and Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the senior Democrat on the Appropriations Committee.
Still, approval of the balanced budget bill was especially gratifying for both Mr. Gingrich and President Clinton. Mr. Gingrich put in a rare appearance in the Speaker's chair to preside over today's vote and flashed a smile as he slammed the gavel down and announced the results.
During the last two and a half years, differences between Republicans and Democrats over spending and budget issues have provoked some of the most raucous debates on the floor of the House of Representatives and led to two shutdowns of parts of the Federal Government.
Today's debate was anti-climactic by comparison, never rising to a feverish level or setting Republican against Democrat or liberal against conservative in angry exchanges.
Republicans promoted the budget deal as both the first step toward achieving the sweeping changes that they promised when they took control of the House of Representatives in 1995 and as the legacy of President Ronald Reagan.
Democrats bragged that the agreement concluded a process that they and the Clinton Administration started in 1993 with their deficit reduction package.
But in the few times that the debate had a hint of political dueling, it involved floor speeches from two of the most fiercely partisan members and their party's whips: Representative Tom DeLay, Republican of Texas, and Representative David E. Bonior, Democrat of Michigan.
"If Democrats still ran the Congress, this deal would have contained more Government spending and tax increases instead of tax cuts," Mr. DeLay said. "You have to give President Clinton credit. He has rejected the left wing of his own party and publicly embraced common-sense conservative values of lower taxes and smaller Government."
But Mr. Bonior suggested that the Republicans were reaping the benefits of fields that Democrats had plowed at great political expense.
"We made tough choices in 1993," he said. "Some of my Republican colleagues have criticized that plan as a tax increase. What galls them the most is our plan worked. The economy has boomed. The deficit has virtually disappeared."
Only months ago, Mr. DeLay and Mr. Bonior were waging fierce warfare over budget issues. But after exchanging their rather mild partisan salvos this afternoon, they united in support of the budget bill.
The budget bill puts into place the spending proposals and entitlement savings on Medicare and Medicaid for which President Clinton and Republican Congressional leaders set the broad framework in May and agreed on in detail just two days ago.
The bill includes $3 billion in block grants to states for welfare-to-work programs and $24 billion in health care coverage for uninsured children. Part of the health care program would be paid for with a tax increase of 15 cents on a pack of cigarettes.
The bill also calls for $115 billion in reduced spending on Medicare over the next five years and $13.6 billion less for Medicaid in the same period.
"This represents the dawning of a new era," Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who heads the House Budget Committee, said this afternoon as he wound up debate on the bill. "It's an era where we recognize the limits of Government and begin one more time to count on the innovation, the creativity and the pure energy of the American people."
Opponents, as could be expected, had a much less glowing outlook.
"We've got a lousy bill," said Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California.
Mr. Stark and other Democrats complained that the bill cut too deeply into Medicare to finance what they said were tax reductions for the rich.
One Democrat, Representative Luis V. Gutierrez of Illinois, offered this view: "Our budget might be balanced, at least until the tax cuts explode it again in the future, but we are creating a lot of new deficits. Deficits of keeping our promises, deficits of fairness, deficits of equity, deficits of caring."
The balanced budget bill was the culmination of nearly three years of tough, on-and-off negotiations between the Administration and the Republicans who took control of Capitol Hill in the 1994 elections.
The negotiations remained tough until the very end. Hours before the debate on the budget bill began on the House floor today, Republicans and Democrats clashed over an obscure provision in that legislation and another in the tax bill.
According to participants in talks between the Republican leaders in Congress and the Administration, the first impasse was over job protection for employees of Amtrak, the national railroad passenger line.
Federal law calls for severance pay of one year's salary for each year of service, up to six years, if an Amtrak worker is laid off. Republicans wanted that provision removed in the budget bill and to make layoffs a matter for negotiations between Amtrak and its unions. But the White House reportedly refused to back down from its support of the law.
After the two sides failed to reach a compromise in talks that lasted late into Tuesday night, they froze $2.3 billion in Federal money that had been earmarked in the budget bill to upgrade Amtrak. Officials have said that without the huge infusion of money, the railway agency faces bankruptcy next year. A possible solution raised by some Senators today would be to pass a separate bill to release the Amtrak money.
The House Transportation Committee today narrowly passed a bill that would free the $2.3 billion and give Amtrak management more authority. Democrats on the panel opposed some provisions of the measure, indicating that it might be hotly debated on the House floor.
The other dispute was over Mr. Clinton's objection to expanding the education savings accounts for college expenses program in the tax bill to pay for primary and secondary education expenses at private or parochial schools.
"I would veto any tax package that would undermine public education by providing tax benefits for private and parochial school expenses," he said in a letter sent to Mr. Gingrich on Tuesday night.
Rather than risk a showdown with the White House, Republican leaders dropped the amendment from the tax bill.

HEADLINE: ON PRO BASKETBALL;
Hypocrisy and a $10,000 Fine

BYLINE: BY Mike Wise 

 BODY:
Jayson Williams has said some funny things the last few seasons. He has said some stupid things, too, attempts at humor that did not just cross the etiquette border, they obliterated it.
 Among sports journalists, the Nets forward is known as a quote machine, a player willing to spew forth on any subject at any time.
Some of his stories about teammates and coaches are true. Some of them are dramatized beyond reality. All of them are entertaining. That was why many of the writers who cover the National Basketball Association again voted Williams to the All-Interview Team last season, along with such candid souls as Charles Barkley and Michael Jordan. 
 Entertaining guy, Jayson. Except to his employers, who clearly have a different sense of humor and disciplinary standards.
For verbal barbs directed at Nets Coach John Calipari and his seasonlong shots lobbed at the organization and teammates, Williams was recently fined $10,000 by the team. For example, in an off-beat diary he wrote for GQ magazine last spring, Williams painted Coach Cal as Coach Out of Control. "Nobody wants to see coaches, I don't care how high they jump on the sidelines," Williams wrote. "I want to stay in New Jersey, but I don't want a man who's only eight years older than me yelling and hollering at me. I'm not going to let John Calipari decide what I can or cannot say."
Having warned him many times about flapping his gums in ways detrimental to the franchise, the Nets finally took monetary action. Essentially, the Nets said you can only make so many Yinka Dare jokes and not pay.
 This could be easily dismissed as a tidy, off-season internal matter between a player and his team, except that Jayson Williams has a big mouth and announced it, and isn't this the same franchise that barely reprimanded Calipari for his racially insensitive remarks to a reporter covering the Nets earlier this season, the same organization that waited for the league to fine its coach a record $25,000?
In choosing to define insubordination and bad taste, the Nets have made an example of Williams and hypocrites of themselves.
Who, really, has done more public relations damage this year?
Williams, the unemployed comic whose wit has been sarcastic and brutally honest at times but never mean-spirited? Or Calipari, the coach who angrily called the reporter, Dan Garcia of The Star-Ledger of Newark, a "Mexican idiot" before threatening to punch him in the face? That incident brought a lawsuit upon Calipari and the franchise earlier this month that is pending.
No contest. The worst Williams is guilty of is exuberance off the floor. The more valuable his performances have become, the more voluble he has become. Now that he has gone from bench warmer under Chuck Daly to one of the league's rebounding commodities, the team does not want to hear him squawk.
Talking head that he is, Williams is concerned about his right to free speech. He said he planned to take his case to the players association, although some of his comments did make a mockery of the league's code-of-conduct handbook. He is one of the leading revisionist historians in sports, changing his stories by the day.
But the Nets are guilty of much more: a double standard when it comes to punishment and indecisiveness in matters of real importance.
It would be easy to write this off to the Trade Jayson Campaign. Williams and the Nets have been waging it since midway through last season with little success. They would part with him for the right player if they could; he could deal without Calipari riding him in practice.
And the confidential nature of fines makes it difficult to cast wide aspersions on everyone at the decision-making level. The fine was meted out by General Manager John Nash, but Calipari's blessing indeed played a major part.
The Nets will not say whether they privately fined Calipari or whether they would have taken the sort of action that Commissioner David Stern took in the matter. Their failure to do so may partly stem from the pending litigation; why make it appear that they were privately outraged by their coach's behavior when it could cost Calipari and the Nets money?
But as the Nets try to move past an embarrassing moment, the franchise's action against Williams seems silly and almost juvenile, like one of Jayson's jokes. If they could only confront their real problems with the same zeal.
In Kerry Kittles, Sam Cassell and Kendall Gill, the Nets have one of the most exciting backcourts in the game. The rookie Keith Van Horn can score from anywhere on the floor. Their concerns over a true center aside, eventually they are going to be something. But out of this great potential comes a major shortcoming: a clue.
In the matter of doings things right and proper, they still don't have one.
